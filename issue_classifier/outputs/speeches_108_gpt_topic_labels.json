Despite the Presidents \"Mission Accomplished\" declaration. more of our brave service men and women died last month since any month since the war in Iraq. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz does not know how much the war costs. or that 764 Americans have died. but that is typical of an administration that refuses to admit its mistakes or explain its policies. The images of tortured prisoners. broadcast throughout the world. have done irreparable damage to our mission and credibility in the Middle East. Still the majority of the House and the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services said congressional hearings are unnecessary. Let me quote President Kennedy. \"An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. Without debate. without criticism. no administration and no country can succeed. and no republic can survive.\" President Kennedy possessed the kind of leadership that allowed him to acknowledge mistakes and accept responsibility. But now there is a different standard. and today America received this response from House majority leader. the gentleman from Texas",

Mr. Speaker. like countless people in this country and around the world. I loved Mary McGrory. She was an absolutely beautiful writer. and she was an absolutely beautiful person. To me. she was a treasured and dear friend. Marys columns. which first appeared in the Washington Star and then in The Washington Post. were always well written and always right to the point. She took on such subjects as Joe McCarthy. the war in Vietnam. Richard Nixon. and U.S. policy in Central America. And while she was an unabashed liberal and proud of it. many of her admirers included some of the most conservative politicians in America. in large part because they admired her integrity and her character. She called it as she saw it.",

I know we are going to talk about prescription drugs tonight. but I just want to say that I heard the gentleman from California also. and he kept referencing France and Germany and how their economies were not doing well and the U.S. was doing so well. I do not know how he can make those comparisons because I do not think the United States is doing well at all. I saw an analysis yesterday in terms of what was happening to the United States in terms of job losses as opposed to Canada. and it showed dramatically that even though the Canadian economy is very dependent on the U.S. economy. the Canadian economy actually increased the number of jobs over the 4 years at the same time that jobs were being lost here under President Bushs Presidency. It said the reason was because in Canada. although they gave tax cuts. the tax cuts all went to the middle class and working people. and those people basically got that money and reinvested it and created more jobs. and it also talked about how productivity in Canada and the United States increased at about the same amount over the last 4 years. but in the United States the profits from the increased productivity went to corporate profit whereas in Canada. the increase in productivity was passed on to workers in higher wages and they invested it and created more jobs. The gentleman from California was comparing other countries. and he did not mention Canada. The reality is if we look at the Canadian experience in the last 4 years. it is the Republican policies in the United States. huge tax cuts to the rich. taking the money from increased productivity and giving it back in corporate profits and not giving it to workers. this has resulted in a. huge difference between our two countries. We lose the jobs. and in Canada they increase the number of jobs. It is the Presidents policies which have caused these job losses. It is not something that is inevitable. it Is something that he has caused with his Republican majority.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. several people are saying how much seniors are going to have to pay for these drugs. The trouble is. one part of the problem is. it is their tax money that is being used to promote the program. We have just seen the Federal Government spend tens of millions of dollars to promote the underlying prescription drug benefit that will not take effect until January of 2006. Now there is an $18 million taxpayerfunded campaign hitting the airwaves to promote these new Medicare cards. So the public has to pay for the TV advertising. to persuade them of something that is not true. that is. that these cards will actually help them. There was an article in the Portland paper today quoting one woman. 70yearold Jean Houston of Waterville. Maine. who said she has already tried calling the Federal Governments tollfree number to enroll. She has not gotten through yet. \"I tried to sign up.\" she said. \"I called five times yesterday and three times today.\" How long will it take Jean Houston just to get through? Now. CMS says. well. they have got a Web site. They can just go to the Web site. Most seniors do not have computers that are linked to the Internet. That is just a fact. And the idea that they are going to sit down and try to choose among 50 different cards with all sorts of different drugs when the pharmaceutical companies can change the drugs that are on the cards any given week. week after week after week. this is just absolutely nonsense. But there is an explanation. My staff tells me that CMS has now admitted that if we get seniors to work through this absolute maze. this absolute nightmare of 50 different prescription drug cards. it will help prepare them. It will get seniors used to working with private plans. private insurance plans. Instead of the Medicare plan. which has the same benefit and the same additional premium for everyone in the country no matter where they live. we are going to have lots and lots of private insurance plans. The systems that are failing the small business community today are going to be inflicted on seniors in Medicare. and it is not right.",

Think about what the gentleman from Maine said now. We had a choice. We could do what President Bush wanted to do on behalf of his friends that own the drug companies and the insurance companies. We could have 50 cards to choose from and seniors can go through and try to choose the best one and pay $30 and the cardholder changes the way it works and changes the discount. changes what drugs are available. We can look at 50 cards and choose and get about a 10 or 15 percent discount. or we could use one card and we could tell the government to negotiate price. tell the government to negotiate on behalf of 39 million Medicare beneficiaries a better price the way Canada does. Canadas prices are 30. 40. 50. 60. 70 percent lower than the United States because the Canadian government on behalf of the whole country. 29 million people. negotiates drug prices. Why could we not use a card like this. give this to every senior. and then negotiate prices on behalf of every senior in this country. 39. 40 million beneficiaries? They go to a drug store and they show this card and they automatically get that 30. 40. 50. 60. 70 percent discount. Instead. because President Bush receives so much money from the drug and insurance industry. he has given us 50 cards for seniors to choose one of the 50. and then maybe. if they are lucky. get a consistent 10 or 15 percent discount. So we have one card that could do 50. 60. 70 percent discount or a choice of 50 that might do a 10. 15. 20 percent discount. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio",

It is really just ridiculous. It is a shame that we would put the burden on the backs of seniors to require them to negotiate through this process. Even with this proposal that will allow lowerincome seniors a $600 benefit. they are probably going to spend so much time trying to manipulate or make it through the process that they are not going to be payable able to benefit from this at all. It is almost like the lottery. One gets a lottery ticket and they scratch off on it. Does this work? No. that does not work. Let me go to the next scratch off. and I am going to scratch off again. And it is almost similar to how much benefit we in Ohio got from the lottery in terms of education right now. and here we are imposing upon the seniors across this country the responsibility to figure out not only what plan to go to. but how do they figure out the benefit. and then in 2006 they are going to have to go back and figure out what plan to take and what plan will benefit them or not benefit them. It is a shame that we are not standing up for seniors and saying. seniors. just like Medicare used to go to work. they can go to the doctor. get their Medicare. They can go to the pharmacist. get their prescription. and they can move on without all this hassle.

The private plans are being paid 100 percent more than it cost Medicare to deal with the average Medicare beneficiary. We will pay those private insurance plans $46 billion more than it costs the governmentrun feeforservice Medicare plan. In other words. we are paying private insurance companies more than it costs to deliver Medicare to Medicare beneficiaries today and for what reason? Why on earth?

July 27th holds special significance because it will mark the 50th anniversary of the Korean War armistice. Begun only five years after the end of World War II. the Korean War was. in many ways. the first reminder that America must remain the worlds leading force for peace. prosperity and freedoma responsibility we still hold today. Called to fight back the brutal forces of communism. 1.800.000 Americans courageously participated in the Korean War. The United States suffered over 36.000 dead and over 100.000 wounded in some of the most horrific conditions in the history of warfare. The service and sacrifices of our Korean War veterans 50 years ago saved a nation from communities enslavement and gave South Korea the opportunity to develop and flourish under freedom and democracy. Sadly. the Korean War is sometimes referred to as the \"forgotten war.\" Perhaps it was the mood of a nation wanting to return to peace after the Second World War. But for the U.S. men and women who served. and for the families and friends of those who paid the ultimate price. the Korean War can never be forgotten. May this resolution. along with all the Korean War commemoration events taking place this year across the country. send a message. loud and clear. that \"we will never forget.\" All Americans must know. as the words etched on the Korean War Memorial reminds us. \"Freedom is Not Free.\" It cannot be taken for granted.

During the last year that we observe the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. this resolution would honor the 1.800.000 Americans who courageously served in Korea by recognizing and supporting the goals and ideals of 2003 as the Year of the Korean War Veteran. With the passage of this resolution. Congress would call upon the President and state leaders to urge Americans to mark the Year of the Korean War Veteran with events that remember all those who so bravely fought in the defense of freedom. H. Con. Res. 212 shows our veterans that their courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten. A veteran myself. I represent thousands of Korean War veterans living in my home district of El Paso. Texas. During my time in Congress I have gotten to know many of these exceptional men and women. and I have gained an understanding of the dreadful conditions they were forced to face in Korea. As a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. I am grateful to have this opportunity to simply thank them. and to honor them for their service to our country. Too many Americans know the Korean War as the \"Forgotten War.\" as a blurb lost in their high school history books among better known wars. Yet the sacrifices made by our soldiers and the advancements they made for democracy are no less significant and no less deserving of our respect. The price paid by the 36.577 Americans who were killed in Korea and the 103.284 who were wounded is testimony to that fact. The time has come to properly recognize and respectfully honor veterans of the Korean War. I hope all my colleagues will join me in support of this resolution.",

I rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of privilege under rule IX. and the form of the resolution is as follows: Whereas. during a meeting of the Committee on Ways and Means on July 18. 2003. for the consideration of the bill H.R. 1776. the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Whereas during the reading of that amendment. the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means directed majority staff of the committee to ask the United States Capitol Police to remove minority party members of the committee from a room of the committee during the meeting. causing the United States Capitol Police thereupon to confront the minority party members of the committee. Whereas pending a unanimous consent request to dispense with the reading of that amendment. the chairman deliberately and improperly refused to recognize a legitimate and timely objection by a member of the committee. Now. therefore. be it resolved. that the House of Representatives disapproves the manner in which Representative Thomas summoned the United States Capitol Police to evict minority party members of the Committee on Ways and Means from using the library of the Committee on Ways and Means. as well as the manner in which he conducted the markup in the Committee on Ways and Means on July 18. 2003. and finds that the bill considered at that markup was not validly ordered reported to the House.",

Yet our Nation is standing by. refusing to act as expeditiously as we should. It is important to say to the American people that this is distinctive from the issue of war in Iraq where brave young men and women every day are on the frontline protecting the interests of the United States of America. This is a situation where the Liberian people who are well connected with this Nation have asked for peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. It is imperative that we join in with the United Nations and the organization of West African states as peacekeepers and for humanitarian aid to this country. It is imperative that we act now to stop the loss of life. I too want to ensure that the young men and women who serve in the United States military are not put in harms way. My position on the war in Iraq is well known. but this is a different set of circumstances. The people of Liberia are begging for our assistance. and our assistance is being asked for truly and only as peacekeepers and humanitarians. I believe it is imperative for the President of the United States. the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Defense Department to act expeditiously. not only to protect the United States embassy and Americans in the United States embassy and in Liberia. but to be a friend to Africa. as represented in the last visit by the President of the United States. in order to protect the innocent women and children and families that are desiring the aid of this Nation in a humanitarian and peacekeeping manner.",

I rise today to share another tragic story with my colleagues of another senseless criminal act that could have and should have never happened but was allowed to take place because of our broken immigration system.

California. Police Department. Sadly. the world lost Officer Zeppetella just last month when he was gunned down on a routine traffic stop. According to witnesses. it was a brutal ganglandstyle murder. Officer Zeppetella was shot once as he was walking away from the suspects car. The suspect then pistolwhipped Officer Zeppetella. grabbing his firearm in the process and shooting him again at point blank range. Madam Speaker. the individual accused and arrested for the murder is Adrian Camacho. an illegal and criminal alien who has a rap sheet that includes numerous gang- and drugrelated charges and convictions and hard prison time. While it appears Adrian Camacho has been deported a number of times to his home country of Mexico. he was allowed to continue to return to his personal criminal playground. the United States. time after time after time. Americas committed law enforcement officers who protect us every day. officers like Tony Zeppetella. deserve better than an immigration system that creates a revolving door for 80.000 criminal aliens living in the United States. a system that asks them to spend their time arresting. then rearresting the same individuals. This makes their job far more difficult and dangerous than it already is. Earlier this month. along with the gentleman from Florida . the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania",

When the wall fell. a wave of sovereignty rolled through Eastern Europe. washing away suppressive governments and leaving in i -s wake democracies firmly backed by individual liberty. Americans will always measure their President against the high bar Ronald Reagan has set for the Presidency. But along with being a statesman. a peacemaker. and a leader. Ronald Reagan was a kind man who I was very honored to have met. a loving husband and father. and a compassionate human being. I will always remember Ronald Reagan for his ability to lift up the American people. inspiring us to rely on ourselves. not on our government. to overcome challenges in our lives. His legacies will be remembered for years to come. Freedom over fear. the individual before its government. and the strength of America overall.

President Reagan never wavered. never backed down from his defense of freedom. of his belief that we could achieve peace through strength. Of course. his strong stand created countless critics. and yet today those critics must recognize the rightness of his cause and his methods. History has certainly proven him to be right. Because of the leadership of President Reagan. Soviet communism collapsed and hundreds of millions of people who lived under Soviet domination now live as free people.

Ronald Reagan. LI 1330 I was inspired by Ronald Reagan some 40 years ago when he. the Great Communicator. first outlined his vision for America. His vision was one of free enterprise. strong defense. and limited government. I was so drawn to these principles that I worked with fellow conservatives to nominate him for President in 1968 and again in 1976. The biggest heartbreak in my political career came in 1976 when we were unable to secure Reagan the nomination. But we stayed at it. Ronnie stayed true to his principles. and. finally. in 1980 we had a man in the White House who I knew would turn this country around. Reagan did just that. He turned around our economy. he ended the Cold War. and he renewed hope for Americans. Reagan was able to accomplish so much in his years as President because he approached everything as a gentleman. He never allowed politics to become personal. He treated everyone with respect even when he disagreed with you. And always his wit and humor won you over. I am proud to say that I knew Ronald Reagan not so much for his accomplishments. and there were many. but I am more proud to have known him for the man he was. As President.

I had grown acutely aware of a quadrennial rift between my parents. My father was a Truman Democrat. my mother was an Eisenhower Republican. and my brother and myself were. of course. KISS fans. Then one cold November night. there was a thaw. My father walked in the door. sat my mother down and. in a hushed. tremulous tone. as if every fellow Irish Catholic Democrat he had known from his days in the St. Francis Home for Boys Orphanage. every worker in a Detroit Labor Day parade. and everybody on every St. Patricks Day pub crawl might somehow overhear him. Dennis Vincent Patrick Mullen McCotter admitted to his wife. quote. \"I cannot believe I went and did it. Joan. I voted for him.\" Him was Ronald Wilson Reagan. This vignette of American democracys unifying force occurred in millions of homes across our Nation in 1980. The resulting national unity. which was brought about through the thawing of so many families political Cold Wars. ultimately led to the end of the global Cold War. Madam Speaker. today the words of Albert Camus ring true: \"A man does not show his greatness by being at one extremity or the other. but rather by touching both at once.\" Truly. President Reagan was a unifying force for moral good in our Nation and our world. And thus his great humility would have precluded him from ever agreeing. Ronald Reagan was a great man.

His was. in many ways. the quintessential American life: moving from a small town to chase the American dream in California. achieving success through hard work and determination. and finally giving back through public service. One of the things I most admired about President Reagan was his ability to disagree without being disagreeable. During the 1980s. I was a staff member for the late Congressman Joe Moakley from Massachusetts. We had a front row seat to the great political battles between the Reagan White House and the House of Representatives under Speaker Tip ONeill. While President Reagan and Tip ONeill had sharp political differences. they never had sharp words. Their arguments were never nasty. They were never personal. At the end of the day. their battles shifted from policy to who could tell the most outlandish story or the funniest Irish joke. It is an example that I believe all of us should try to do a better job of following. Madam Speaker. I would also like to take a moment to say just how much respect and admiration I have for Nancy Reagan.

That is a very short period of time. given what we are facing here. The Democratic proposal is for double that. basically 26 weeks. and goes back to December 28.",

Where are our priorities? Could he not do 10 percent for the unemployed and for their families? I mean. it is just extraordinary to me that the emphasis would be so thinly disguised.",

I fail to see how an unemployed worker in Ohio who has exhausted his benefits is any different than an unemployed worker in Oregon or New Jersey. Then there was the issue of how many weeks and at what level for benefits they had worked for. These are working people. They are people who have believed in our system of enterprise and have tried to make a difference in their lives. I was just amazed that none of the press talked about the difference in the bills. that we were as the Democratic Party talking about every State in the Union. every unemployed worker who had fallen off of benefits. and that we were talking about a realistic number of weeks. not just 6 weeks or 7 weeks. but so that people could plan. 26 weeks. which has been historic here.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we should remember that unemployment benefits have been paid for by the employers and the employees. The employers have to pay a tax. most economists say that comes in the form of lower wages or at least is shared in lower wages by the employees. and there is a large and healthy balance in the unemployment trust fund. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. the President and the Republican majority. have refused to expend some of those taxes. That was money that was saved for a rainy day for families and individuals across this country. It is raining like hell out there right now. and they need that money. It is their money. That. in fact. does not have an impact on the deficit. Giving a $300 billion tax break to people who clip coupons on their taxes does cost the Federal Treasury and will increase the deficit. but if we kept the books honestly. money spent out of the unemployment trust fund which has been accumulated over many years for a rainy day would not count as money that is spent and created out of nothing. There is money there to spend. It is just like we could invest in infrastructure by spending down the highway trust fund. We could invest in aviation by spending down the aviation trust fund. We could accelerate a whole bunch of projects across this country and put people back to work. really. I mean. in the phony way we keep books here. it counts as deficit. but in reality it would not be. The American taxpayers would be getting the money back that they paid for the purpose for which it was intended. which is unemployment benefits or investment in bridges. highways. roads and aviation.",

Part of it is because the Bush administration has not really said exactly what they are proposing. I gather from today that they are talking about 12 weeks. and we will find that out tomorrow. But we are going to have to insist beginning tomorrow that this package pass and pass in a way that is effective before we leave this week. let alone tonight. So I particularly appreciate the fact that my colleagues mentioned that. because I think it is something we are going to have to deal with literally tomorrow.

This bill will expand the current boundaries of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve to include approximately 12.5 acres of land in American Beach. Amelia Island. The Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve currently provides protection to an important ecological treasure and the addition of American Beach will serve to enhance its national significance. This beautiful stretch of shoreline provides a great history and a great story. Founded in the 1930s by A.L. Lewis. American Beach provided a sunny paradise for those Americans who. because of segregation. were not able to enjoy most of Americas beaches. This area of Floridas northeastern shore attracted African Americans from all over the country. While this nation struggled to find equality within its shores. American Beach provided a relaxing. culturally unique vacation spot for African Americans along the oceans edge. The significance of this site was recognized when the beach and 120 residential homes in the area were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally. in 1992. the Florida Legislature named American Beach the first site on the Florida Black Heritage Trail. In his recently released budget. President Bush provides resources for a new \"Preserve America\" program through the National Park Service. This initiative is designed to encourage heritage tourism throughout the country. Today. this legislation answers the Presidents call without spending a single dime of taxpayers money. Last year. American Beachs neighbor. Amelia Island Plantation made arrangements to donate these 12.5 acres to the National Park Service. Unfortunately. the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve is not able to accept this generous gift because the acreage rests outside the boundaries of the Preserve. This legislation allows the National Park Service to accept this historic site by simply modifying the boundaries of the Timucuan. I support this addition to the Timucuanand others like itwhere willing property owners and the National Park Service can work cooperatively as stewards of our national treasures. Mr. Speaker. it is especially fitting this legislation comes to the floor of this House as we celebrate Black History Month to honor those individuals who worked to bring equality to all Americans.",

As a resident of Springfield and Belchertown. MA. Ed has played his pipes at parades. inaugurations. celebrations. and internments. He is loved by so many in our area.

For years. in lieu of accepting any fee for performing at intemments.

Bensons Battalion has provided local police stations with over $3.000 in funds matched by the government for new equipment and over $5.000 in grants for local firefighters to assist in the purchase of new equipment as well. This is truly an organization that makes the lives of Western Pennsylvanians better every day.

Rose Kennedy. a mother for our community and a pioneering activist of her North Toledo neighborhood. passed from this life on December 26. 2003 at age 76. I came to know Rose and her husband Bob nearly three decades ago as she vigorously pursued improvements in her neighborhood. Toledos oldest. Small in stature. unassuming by nature. she worked on largerthanlife projects sidebyside with community leaders on the revitalization of the heart of our city. starting in North Toledo with beautification initiatives. Most notably. North Toledos signature effort. the Buckeye Basin Greenbelt Parkway. has Roses imprimatur. Without Rose Kennedys personal tireless efforts. this major parkway construction which diverted traffic from North Toledo streets and upgraded the entire region with a linear greenbelt in the heart of our city would not have been realized. She pursued this goal for nearly a quarter century. and proudly stood by as the dream was finally brought to fruition and ribbons cut. In addition to her community activism. Rose Kennedy. together with her husband Robert. brought a sense of family to eighteen children: four adopted and fourteen fostered. She explained. \"These kids needed love and that was about all we had to give them.\" The oldest of six children. Rosalie Kennedy spent her entire life in her North Toledo neighborhood. After marriage. she and her husband were involved in veterans organizationsheading up the Toledo chapter of the DAV in the 1950sin addition to neighborhood groups. She worked with the Northriver Development Corporation and the Economic Opportunity and Planning Association. Civicminded as well. Rose served for many years as her precincts Democratic committeewoman. Rounding out her community and civic responsibilities. she also served her faith as Secretary to her church. Salem Lutheran Church. In spite of her family and community demands. Rose tound time to enjoy her hobbies of crochet and crossword puzzles and reading. She was an ordinary woman who accomplished extraordinary feats. To her husband. children. grandchildren and great grandchildren. we extend our heartfelt sympathy.

The NCIHA is governed by a twenty member Board of Commissioners and staffed by 17 dedicated employees. Over its 25year history. the NCIHA has built 324 housing units in nine locations. directing $60 million in construction planning and development programs. The organization manages an additional 232 housing units located in seven reservation communities. The NCIHA also administers a down payment assistance home ownership program. rental subsidy programs. housing rehabilitation and replacement services for member tribes. In addition to these services. the NCIHA has worked to develop a Community Housing Development Organization to access state funding and increase housing opportunities for Native Americans. The NCIHA is sharing valuable resources and providing technical support with the newly formed United Native Housing Development Corporation to help assure its success. Mr. Speaker. the accomplishments of the NCIHA are recognized by many. most notably by the Office of Native American Programs. who awarded the NCIHA a Certificate of Excellence in 2000 and declared the organization one of the best of its kind. With the support of both the federal government and private foundations. the NCIHA is committed to the establishment of healthy communities for the Native Americans it serves. In addition to constructing and managing sufficient housing. NCIHA builds infrastructure including roads. water and sanitation facilities. and electric services.

I remember photos my father. a U.S. serviceman. took when U.S. forces overran the death camp in Dachau. Germany in the closing days of World War 1-. People executed in pits. by the thousands. I never thought I would see photos like those photos again. In the days and weeks following Saddams overthrow. we learned more about another dictators evil. and here is one account from the L.A. Times: \"The executions took place two or three times on most days. Each time between 100 and 150 blindfolded people. their hands and sometimes feet bound. were led into pits about 10 feet deep. Gunmen then fired into the pit. often for several minutes . . . A bulldozer then pushed dirt over the bodies. sometimes burying or crushing people who had survived the volley and were trying to climb out.\" Four hundred thousand people. In two trips to Iraq. I have had the chance to talk to tortured Iraqis. Some ask. Why act in Iraq and not the other countries suffering through human rights nightmares? I would respond that just because we do not act in all cases of gross human rights abuses does not mean we should not act in any cases. Moreover. in Iraqs case. our ability to act effectively is greater because our vital national security interests are on the line. Our interest in seeing a reformed Middle East will keep us committed to building a free Iraq. So let us forget that argument.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. for more than 20 years. Saddam Hussein used tactics of torture. brutality. and fear to terrorize the citizens of Iraq and neighboring countries. Exactly 16 years ago this week. Saddam Hussein unleashed weapons of mass destruction that killed 5.000 of his own Kurdish citizens. He encouraged Iraqi officials to rape and torture women. Men and women of Iraq were repressed. and they were isolated from the rest of the world. One year after the United States and coalition forces liberated Iraqi citizens. the people of Iraq are embracing this opportunity to build a new and free Iraq for their children. Last October. I saw firsthand the remarkable activities that are taking place on the ground in Iraq. There are now over 3.800 programs that offer immediate assistance to improve the quality of life for all Iraqi people. As reconstruction efforts continue to move forward. many essential services like water. sanitation. electricity. and telecommunication have been restored and even surpass prewar levels. In fact. public health spending is now 26 times as great as it was under Saddams regime. Today I met with a delegation of Iraqi leaders to talk about the continuing advances in Iraq. This was a diverse delegation. It was men and women. Shiias. Sunnis. tribal leaders. doctors. members of the free press. They are dedicated to promoting and to teaching democracy throughout south central Iraq. They shared their personal stories. They talked about the Democracy Regional Center where a democracy discussion was held for more than 1.500 Iraq people from different backgrounds. and they are launching a radio station. and they are promoting democracy to 10 million people through that part of the country. The Iraqi people are embracing democracy with open arms. Mr. Speaker. last week I held a roundtable discussion with a group of remarkable women leaders from Iraq. One of the women in the group gave me her wedding ring to keep as a reminder that we should not waiver from our commitment to women. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. support the Iraqi men and women who have done so much for us in that Nation. We should help them. E 1845",

I am almost in disbelief when I hear Members on the other side claiming perhaps that the world is not as safe a place since Saddam Hussein was removed. But I do not hear anyone on the other side disputing the facts in the resolution that Saddam Hussein committed crimes against humanity. that he subjected the Iraqi people to murder and torture. and that he unleashed weapons of mass destruction against his own people. So I can only arrive at the conclusion that perhaps someone is insinuating that the horrific terrorist bombings that have occurred in Bali. in Riyadh. Madrid. Jerusalem since Saddam Husseins ouster would not have occurred if he were still in office. Now. that is just preposterous. I know that no one would suggest such a thing. President Bush was right when he said that we cannot distinguish between the terrorists and the states that sponsor those terrorists. Regimes like Saddam Husseins still exist. Those brutal outlaw regimes around the world who are there supporting the terrorist organizations are our enemies just as the terrorists themselves. Clearly. without Saddam Hussein. America is safer. The Middle East is safer. Just ask the Israelis. Ask them if they feel that they are not safer without the threat of Saddam and his Scuds aiming at Tel Aviv. Of course they are safer. Of course the world is safer. Mr. Speaker. I would like to close by thanking God that we have our troops and our young men and women who are volunteering their lives. risking their lives to go and take the battle to the front lines. to take the battle to the terrorists so that perhaps we can avoid another terrorist attack on our homeland.

First of all it resolves a sense of the House of Representatives. How can you have a sense of the entire House when it only has Republican authors? How can it be a sense of the House with not a single Democrat as a cosponsor? This Resolution seems to provide political cover for the President for failing to secure support from our major Western allies in the War on Terrorism in Iraq. This Resolution ignores the fact that we had no postconflict reconstruction plan. before the first bombs dropped. The Resolution glosses over the fact that our investigators. along with the United Nations inspectors. have found no weapons of mass destruction and were denied more time to complete their inspections. which could have obviated the need to go to war. This Resolution is brought up at a time when the Presidents poll ratings are slipping. The world is not safer and adoption of this politicized resolution wont make it so. Baghdad is suffering new deaths as we debate. our own home turf suffers from its own brand of terrorism. Inner city communities are losing lives in drive by shootings and Americans dont feel safer. No. the world is not safer and to get Congress to say that it is. is hypocrisy at its worst. In an election year. Congress should work to bring us togethernot to play political gotcha. I urge this body to reject this Resolution. We can do better. We can truly support our troops without political excuses. We can commend the Iraqi people for their courage without taking credit for their courage.

We must remember that work here in Congress remains to insure that both active duty soldiers and our Guard and Reserve units continue to get the support they need.

Often these patriotic deeds go unnoticed and unheralded. This is true of one such person in my district. Harvey Roffman. a resident of Omaha. Nebraska. in 1987 was working as a trade specialist for the U.S. Department of Commerce. During that time. he received a phone call from a businessman who believed that some of his product was being delivered illegally to the country of Libya. Based on that information. Mr. Roffman brought the businessmen together with the Commerces Department of Export Administration. That led to an investigation revealing that $275.000 in steel pipe was being diverted from Hanover. Germany. to the terrorist country Libya. As a result. an additional quarter million dollars worth of product destined to this same terrorist country was canceled. Mr. Speaker. I bring this story to the attention of the House now not to give Harvey Roffman a pat on the back. which he has deserved over these past many years. but because it is a wonderful example to all our citizens that their watchfulness and vigilance could save lives and stop our enemies from terrorist acts.

The victory is inspirational because the Huskies overcame incredible odds. having only one starting player return from last years championship team. With this title victory. there can be no doubt that our Huskies are certain to be remembered as one of the greatest basketball teams in sports history. The people of Connecticut are justly proud of their Huskies. who have set an example for us all with their teamwork and their standards of perfection. I know this victory was a team effort. but we are particularly proud of Maria Conlon from Derby. Connecticut. of the third congressional district. and Diana Taurasi. a fellow daughter of Italian immigrants. who was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player and Consensus National Player of the Year after she scored the third most points in Division I tournament history. the fourthmost ever in the Final Four. and tied for secondmost ever in a title game. all with an aching back. one good ankle and a heart whose size is only matched by that of the Huskies dreams. These women have shown that given the resources. they are just as talented and exciting to watch as any mens basketball team out there. They are role models for girls and boys alike across this Nation. and we should remember them as we debate title IX and its impact on women in this country. Mr. Speaker.

Incorporated. as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of their most recognized and celebrated products. not to mention my daughters favorite. Marshmallow Peeps. Just Born. with their Peeps. is a great American manufacturing success story. Over a billion Peeps are produced each year by Just Borns 400plus employees. Their candies are exported to over 30 countries. making them available to over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Innovation and dedicated employees have really been the source of the success of this company. Just Born was founded in 1923 in New York City by Samuel Born. a Russian immigrant. The company moved to Bethlehem. Pennsylvania. in 1932 and under the leadership of Bob Born. Samuels son. Just Born acquired a candy company in 1953 which manufactured by hand a small line of 3D marshmallow products. The innovative Bob Born mechanized the process of making Peeps and dramatically increased the quantity of Peeps manufactured each year. Peeps once took 27 hours to make. they now take 6 minutes. It is this innovative. entrepreneurial spirit. and great workers that make American manufacturers the best in the world. and Just Born continues to lead the way among confectioners. If we do our part here in Congress to lessen government regulations. to expand trade opportunities and to lower taxes to encourage economic growth. we will see more success stories like Just Born.

To date. AMBER Alert has been credited with the safe recovery of 53 children. We know the AMBER Alert system works by allowing communities to tap into the resources of an educated public. to prepare local law enforcement. and engage the media in reuniting children with their loving families. The media and an educated public. for example. were absolutely critical in the safe return of Elizabeth Smart to her family a few weeks ago. President Bush showed very strong and early support for our bill last year. and thanks to his good sense. he took the first steps by providing grants to States and localities to help establish local AMBER Alert programs. It is now time for Congress to codify the AMBER Alert. We need to provide additional funding.

For 30 years. women in this country have had the right to make reproductive choices over their bodies. H.R. 760 is a horrifying attempt to seize those hardearned rights away from women. What this legislation claims to do is ban a medical procedure used in late term pregnancies. but it does not. Instead. this bill is drafted in such a way as to effectively ban a womans right to choose at any point in her pregnancy. Let us be clear: this bill opens the door to outlawing all abortions. regardless of the circumstances. Furthermore. this bill makes no exception for cases when a womans health is in grave danger or when carrying a nolonger viable fetus to term would jeopardize a womans ability to conceive children in the future. Equally disturbing is the fact that this bill is blatantly unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that. when dealing with restriction on reproductive procedures. an exception must always be made to protect both the life and the health of the mother. I cannot support a blatantly unconstitutional bill that tells women that their health or future reproductive health must be sacrificed. nor can I support a bill that has a clear ulterior motive of banning a womans right to make choices over her own body. I am prochoice and believe that the government should stay out of peoples private. personal decisions. I will protect a womans right to choose. and so I will vote against this unconstitutional. antiwomans rights bill.

Ohio passed its ban on this horrific procedure known as partialbirth abortion because the people of Ohio know how inhumane and how unsafe the practice is. In my district. in Dayton. Ohio. the Womens Medical Plus Center of Dayton has performed this horrific procedure. despite the fact that the facility is not properly licensed by the Ohio Department of Health.

Ohio. hospital. when her mother went into labor before the abortion could be completed. The woman was believed to be 26 weeks pregnant.

This is why several medical and health organizations. including the American College of OBGYNs. oppose this legislation. This legislation was wrong 8 years ago. and it is still wrong. It contains no exception whatsoever for womens health. It simply puts womens lives at risk. This is a perfect example of how meanspirited and extreme this administration can be. This is a direct attack on Roe v. Wade. But more than that. it is another example in a long line of this administrations attacks on our rights. I cannot stand by and watch as one by one this White House and the leadership in this House chew up our rights and spit them out. I stand today as a woman and as an American to fight for our constitutionally protected rights. I urge a \"no\" vote on the rule and a \"no\" vote on the underlying bill. Wake up. America.",

It is true that the vast majority of partialbirth abortions are performed on healthy babies of healthy mothers. Dr. James McMahon. one of the founders of the partialbirth abortion method. in his June 15. 1995. testimony before the Committee on the Judiciary. testified that in a series of about 2.000 partialbirth abortions he performed. only 9 percent of those abortions were performed for maternal health reasons. Of that group. the most common reason given was depression. It is clear many partialbirth abortion procedures occur for purely elective or frivolous reasons. He also cited that he performed partialbirth abortions on babies with no flaws whatsoever. even in the third trimester. many as late as 29 weeks. well into the seventh month of pregnancy. No matter where we stand on the issue of life. most Americans agree that the brutal and horrific practice of partialbirth abortion must cease to exist. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 760 and to right the wrong that has existed for far too long.",

This rule makes in order the GreenwoodHoyer amendment to H.R. 760 and provides for one motion to recommit. with or without instructions. Why is the House debating this legislation yet again? Unfortunately. the answer to that is those who oppose it have claimed that Congress has no power to legislate a ban on partialbirth abortion because of the Supreme Courts Stenberg v. Carhart ruling. Many of these same House Members. however. had no objection to standing up to the Supreme Court on other issues. For example. 413 House Members voted to ban child pornography even after the Supreme Court held that the 1996 Child Pornography Prevention Act was unconstitutional. Mr. Speaker. with respect to the underlying bill. any taking of innocent life is wrong. This procedure is demonstrably offensive and wrong.

That resulted in Congress working on appropriations bills in Januarybills that should have been completed last September. With America now at war. we cannot allow that to happen again. It is my hope that the final product will be improved. so that I will be able to support the final budget conference report.",

It is an abomination that only two appropriations bills have been passed by this Congressthe Defense and Military Construction bills. We have essentially been operating without set spending levels for the Federal Government since the fiscal year began October 1. My priorities include funding for education. protecting Medicaid. and providing funds for HIV/AIDS in Africa. I understand the fiscal constraints. but I also realize that Federal agencies and our constituents need funding provided from the various appropriations bills. This resolution does extend entitlement payments including Food Stamps. Medicaid Grants to states and veterans entitlements. The appropriations bills that fund these programs have not been passed. We simply cannot keep passing continuing resolutions with set spending levels. Congress is not living up to its responsibility as stated in the U.S. Constitution in Article 1. Congress must do its work. We have eleven appropriations bills that have yet to be passed by Congress and enacted into law. The LaborHHS appropriations bill funds the Department of Education. the Department of Labor. and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Democratic priorities in education health care must be fully funded. Last year. we passed the No Child Left Behind Act. but have yet to fund the bill at levels to ensure the adequacy of the measures contained in the education bill. I am concerned about the increasing spread of AIDS/HIV in Africa. I support funding for research in this area and getting the necessary medical supplies and medicine to combat this disease to Africa. Congress adjourned last year with much unfinished business. Passing the appropriations bills must be on our list of priorities. We cannot continue this uncertainty in the budget process. This is the sixth continuing resolution. The president will soon release his fiscal year 2004 budget and we have not yet passed eleven funding bills for fiscal year 2003.",

It would bring the bill back in line with the language this House voted to include by a vote of 318 to 110 on the motion to recommit offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut last July. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that over the next 10 years corporate expatriates would cost us more than $4 billion in funds that could help pay for our Nations security. The second point of this motion to recommit would be to suspend the operation of one of the most egregious provisions inserted into the Department of Homeland Security legislation at the last minute last year. That is a provision apparently designed to shield the giant drugmaker Eli Lilly & Company from lawsuits that have been brought by parents of autistic children claiming that their childrens disease was caused by a vaccine preservative. There may be good reason to ultimately require claims of this type to be brought under the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. but if that is done. it should be done openly in the sunshine after proper hearings and deliberation. not in a back room deal at the last moment. Thirdly. this motion would restore the authority of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to review the leasing of space for the new Department of Homeland Security. replacing the provision in the CR that simply approves the administration proposal without any congressional oversight or scrutiny whatsoever. We do not stop them from going forward. we simply say that they must follow the procedure of having some review by the committee of jurisdiction before they proceed to spend a great deal of taxpayers money on leasing property which at this point has been reviewed and overseen by no one whatsoever in the Congress.",

I. too. just want to associate myself with the remarks of the earlier debate. but I do want to express the fact that the running of government impacts on the lives of individuals. particularly those who are facing stress. economic stress. and we dealt with this in the unemployment legislation that we passed. but here is my concern as it relates to my particular congressional district. My concern is public hospitals and the lack of increased funding for Medicaid. I believe it is important to put on the RECORD that we are seeing increased numbers of individuals going to our public hospitals because they have no insurance. they have no alternatives. They are utilizing Medicaid. Some of that obviously has an enormous shortfall. and so the burden is falling upon my local county government. The longer we stay in this condition. without the actual passing of appropriations bills. the longer we put the burden on the States. the longer we put the burden on local government. So I just argue that we can pass this CR to the 31st. we passed the other one to the 31st. but all the issues we are concerned about. funding for HIVAIDS. increased funding for Medicaid. funding Leave No Child Behind. all of that falls. if you will. around our feet and people are suffering. I am just hoping that we will have an opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner on the crisis that is going on in our districts. and we will come to a point where we recognize that we have got to address the needs of working people. but we have also got to address the needs of uninsured and impoverished who need this government to work on their behalf.

Methodistaffiliated liberal arts college in Mr. Pleasant. IA. In conjunction with National Volunteer Month. this week the college is celebrating the achievement of 1 million hours of service to society by its graduates through participation in its Responsible Social Involvement (RSI) program. In the 35 years since its inception. RSIwith its requirement of a minimum of 160 hours of work with a nonprofit organization. as well as the keeping of a journal. the writing of an essay and the making of an oral presentationhas become a national paradigm for public service. More than simply a requirement that must be met for graduation. participation in RSI has proven a lifetransforming experience for thousands of Iowa Wesleyan students. In 1739. John Wesley. the founder of the Methodist church. confided to his journal that \"I look upon the world as my parish.\" The young men and women Iowa Wesleyan sends from its campus through RSI discover a world in which too often the socalled \"megeneration\" succumbs to the temptation to decouple freedom from responsibility. Today it is tempting to seek freedom by abjuring personal responsibility for addressing the needs of those less well off in our communities. This renunciation of individual accountability is too easily justified by the assumption that the role of meeting societal needs is exclusively that of impersonal bureaucracies. Participants in RSI come to understand that a moral society demands that individuals not duck responsibility for improving the lot of others. that personal fulfillment comes through action rooted. not in \"I\". but \"we.\" The Responsible Social Involvement program at Iowa Wesleyan appropriately epitomizes John Wesleys Rule:",

She began her commendable teaching career in 1953 and has worked diligently to level the educational playing field for atrisk youth in lowincome neighborhoods throughout the city of St. Louis. Darden has encouraged hundreds of children by setting high expectations and implementing programs for students to gain leadership and communications skills necessary to succeed in life. She has been committed to reaching both the students and their parents with her educational outreach. Darden impressively took the initiative to create \"Home. School and Community.\" a program which introduced students to local and national newsmakers and celebrities. This innovative program allows famous guest speakers to encourage students to achieve academic excellence. while their parents attended informative workshops and seminars. Darden solidly believes that all children deserve a high quality education regardless of their socioeconomic status. As a tutor. early in her career. she took note of the way wealthy parents trained their children and introduced those same learning techniques to inner city students. Darden found that her efforts helped raise both the productivity level and esteem of children who would otherwise might have been cast off by society.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this budget resolution contains a backdoor cut that could result in an 8 percent cut in the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. In addition. the resolution contains a provision that will undermine the Pell Grant higher education program. This amendment. which is cosponsored by the chairmen and ranking members of the Homeland Security and Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittees. addresses these issues. Project Bioshield is a new program. first requested by the President in February of 2003. that will expand the Federal Governments preparedness for a bioterrorist attack by making it easier to purchase the most effective pharmaceuticals and vaccines. The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution. the discretionary limit for fiscal year 2005 was set at $814 billion. Above and beyond the $814 billion limit. the resolution assumed $5.6 billion for Project Bioshield as mandatory spending for legislation considered in the Senate. In the House. the budget resolution assumed that funding for bioshield would be discretionary. To help resolve the difference between the House and the Senate. the President submitted a formal budget request on September 12. 2003 for $5.6 billion of advanced appropriations as discretionary spending in the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Congress approved the request and the President signed the first Homeland Security Appropriations Act into law. Six months later. Chairman NICKLES has decided to disregard that agreement. His budget resolution now assumes that the $2.5 billion of Project Bioshield funding that is available for the next 4 years will all count against the $814 billion limit for fiscal year 2005. forcing the Appropriations Committee to absorb the cost. What this means is less funding for first responder grants. less funding of the Coast Guard. less funding for border security. less money for FEMA to respond to disasters and less money to implement our immigration laws. This is unacceptable. My amendment will restore the Project Bioshield scoring treatment that was requested by the President and approved by the Senate last September and strike the language in the resolution concerning Pell Grants. I urge adoption of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment would strike section 404 from the budget resolution. and provide for the release of the reserve funds originally intended for Bioshield in addition to appropriations provided for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2005. The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution established a $5.593 billion \"reserve\" for Project Bioshield. outside the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 discretionary caps. This fiscal year 2005 budget resolution. as reported. assumes that the $2.5 billion advance appropriations for Project Bioshield will now be scored against the fiscal year 2005 cap. At the same time. it imposes in section 404(b) a new procedural barrier to prohibit the Senate Appropriations Committee from getting credit for reducing Bioshield funds to live within the cap. The effect is that the Senate Appropriations Committee. unlike the House. will have to find an additional $2.5 billion in spending reductions. This will likely have an adverse impact on ongoing programs. including essential homeland security activities. Advance appropriations were provided to ensure that a stable source of funding would be available for this initiative. No new scorekeeping precedent needs to be established to protect this program.

It is far from certain all the Members of the Senate are totally familiar with everything that is enmeshed in the arcane language and complicated processes in this budget resolution. Our amendment says as we see deficits hemorrhaging and the debt limit stretched to $7.4 trillion. we want to be certain it is known this budget bill carries hidden in its mystical language an increase of $664 billion with instruction to the Senate and the House to go up to a total of $8 trillion on the debt limit. therefore. virtually automatically permitting more borrowing to take place without review and direct approval. Can my colleagues imagine how the American people will feel if tonight we add $2.400 worth of debt to each and every one of them and give them in exchange an average of $200 in tax relief? Imagine. $2.400 worth of debt and $200 worth of cash. It makes Shylock look like an amateur. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can defer any attempt to increase our debt limit unless it is clear to all what we are going to do by taking our debt limit through the roof. I hope we can get support for this so we can have an intelligent debate specifically on the debt limit at a later time. I yield the floor.",

This year the Federal funding for special education is less than half of what was promised 27 years ago. In my State of Minnesota. this broken promise for special education means cuts in Federal programs that occur across all schools for all students. and it also means higher property taxes for the citizens of my State. I cant believe the other States in this Nation dont encounter the same problems when the Federal Government doesnt fund one of its two most important commitments to education at even half the level it has promised for over a quarter of a century. The second amendment would reduce the Federal deficit by $1 million a year for each of the next 5 years. To pay for this. I would increase the top tax rate from 35 percent to 38.5 percent. The average income of Americans in that top tax bracket is over $1.1 million. Of course. they dont pay that top rate. Their income from dividends and from capital gains is now taxed at 15 percent. With the lower rates and other loopholes. most of Americas multimillionaires and billionaires pay lower tax rates than most middleclass working Americans. The question is. Whose needs are more important americas schoolchildren who have the greatest needs or Americas superrich who have the greatest connections? The answer is we have seen at least a dozen times tonight that the superrich are the best connected people in America. All of these phantom family farmers and struggling small business owners of companies the size of Lockheed whose incomes exceed over $1.1 million a year. none of whom are located in Minnesota. but they are out there somewhere.

My vote was a difficult one. but I am not convinced that the federal government should preempt state law in this area. Those supporting this bill have made some compelling arguments as to why Congress should step in and institute these reforms. They cite the national nature of insurance plans. whereby a doctor in Arizona might have to pay more for malpractice insurance due to an overthetop jury award in Texas. They also note that. as doctors close up shop or stop providing highrisk care in specialties such as emergency medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. patients are forced to cross state lines in order to seek out treatment. We have all watched with dismay as hospitals have been forced to shut their doors and doctors have opted to treat patients without malpractice insurance due to the high costs of premiums. Certainly. the trial attorneys who line their pockets with egregious fees arent suffering as a result of the mess theyve made with unscrupulous lawsuits. These arguments only underscore an already evident need for the states to pursue medical malpractice reforms. However. as one who believes firmly in federalism. I am unwilling to support legislation that would. in effect. preempt the constitution of the state of Arizona. which prohibits caps on damages. The natural evolution of health care delivery suggests that a federal solution such as H.R. 5 may one day be necessary. Even today. we need tort reform badly. Its up to the states to begin that process. and I plan to be part of those efforts. The states should follow Californias example. which has been an undeniable success over the past 25 years.",

I understand better than most the chilling effect unlimited medical liability awards have on the practice of medicine. Indeed. my father. who had a practice in Culver City. California. retired from practicing medicine in the mid1970s because of the alarming increase in premiums. Only after his retirement did California enact its Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act--or MICRA. MICRA is an experiment in limiting noneconomic and punitive medical liability damage awardsand it has succeeded. For medical doctors. MICRA has provided stability in insurance premiums. For patients. it reduced meritless claims and accelerated the time in which settlements can be reached. I strongly support MICRA. although before extending it to the entire nation. I would proposed adjusting the $250.000 cap on punitive and noneconomic awards. first enacted in 1975. to reflect its current value. Though H.R. 5 adopts the structure of MICRA. it is weighted down by dubious procedural and substantive roadblocks for a variety of causes of action against HMOs. nursing homes. and insurance companiesareas where the California legislature has enacted significant protections for patients. Californias medical professionals oppose the inclusion of these provisions under H.R. 5s MICRAlike caps and procedures. Last year. I voted for H.R. 5with the hope and expectation that improvements would be made in conference with the Senate to narrow its egregious provisions. This did not happen. and constructive amendments offered in the Energy and Commerce Committee were opposed on nearparty line votes. The closed process by which we are considenng this important bill today belies any desire by the majority to make the improvements I believe are necessary. I cannot support the bill again in its present form. Hopefully. changes will be made in the Senate to align it more closely with Californias MICRA. with the modification of the caps I noted earlier. If this happens. I will support the conference report. Medical professionals should be able to practice in a climate of certainty. and patients should be charged reasonable rates for quality care. This is what I support for every community in the country. This is not what H.R. 5. in its present form. delivers.",

We would never close the doors of our legal system to people who have legitimately suffered. But the abuse of the system is threatening the quality of care delivered by our doctors and hospitals. According to the Ohio State Medical Association. 76 percent of Ohio doctors say insurance costs have affected their willingness to perform highrisk procedures. Ive met with doctors in my district who say these high costs might force them to retire. My rural district cannot afford to lose quality physicians. This is clearly an issue of tort reform. not insurance regulation. State insurance commissioners strictly regulate liability insurers. Companies are not permitted to raise their premiums to make up for past losses. Malpractice insurance premiums are skyrocketing because over the last decade there has been an explosion in the number of lawsuits and particularly large awards. some reaching lottery proportions. Thats something the market will reflect. Reasonable limits on noneconomic damages are a sensible way to make sure that malpractice lawsuit awards address actual damages. They work. without compromising legal rights or physician vigilance. Ohio is a case in point. When my state placed caps on these awards in 1975. insurance premiums dropped. When this cap was overturned. lawsuits . . . and therefore. costs . . . went up almost immediately. What changed was the behavior of lawyers. not doctors.

It is unacceptable to have prices spiraling so out of control that care is prohibitive for many doctors and patients. I am open to a range of alternatives to provide a longterm solution. This bill focuses only on capping damages to lower premiums. siting Californias MICRA legislation as its model. Unfortunately. it ignores the other methods used in California. which may have had more impact over the longterm. The cap is eroding patients rights by failing to provide for inflation and H.R. 5 suffers the same flaw. The Republican alternative is simply an attempt to provide a partisan political response. rather than a serious effort at bipartisan legislative action. This bill is being rushed through the legislative process without an opportunity for amendment and with little relationship to the proposal that is likely to emerge from the Senate. Last fall. I voted against the same bill when it came to the floor. Unfortunately. the Republican proposal is still just a bargaining position. not a legislative solution.

I have witnessed firsthand the crux of the issue about which we debate today. My father worked as an ENT surgeon for 19 years in Southern California. both before and after Californias MICRA law was enacted. He has also helped me to better understand the issues that those in private practice face and we both have an appreciation for the problems our doctors face. Living in Southern California my entire life has also allowed me to witness the changes that have taken place with regard to medical liability reform. Numerous doctors from Southern California have contacted me about the benefit that they have seen from the liability laws that exist in our state and realize how much it has affected their ability to treat more patients effectively. Still. other states are witnessing a serious reduction in care. particularly in vital specialities including those that affect expectant mothers. We face a vote today on an issue that centers on the ability of our doctors to practice the science that saves lives daily in our country. Currently physicians in many states face the reality of not being able to keep their practice running. Our problems cannot be solved by the trend of defensive medicine. as they can only lead to higher costs to the patient. the insurer. and the doctor. The ultimate price is paid when a defensive procedure costs not only money but the life of a patient. It is unfortunate that many frame this debate in terms of political ideology. How can we continue to demoralize our doctors from working in the field that they love and providing care for those who are suffering? H.R. 5 is about tempering skyrocketing insurance premiums across the country. H.R. 5 is about providing real access to care and the continued ability for our health care system to run effectively in times of state and national budget deficits. But. most importantly.

I am a firm believer that everyone should have their day in court if they feel they have been wronged. However. inherent in this right is the assumption. if not the obligation. that this course of action will be used judiciously. However. that is not what has occurred. Medical malpractice litigation has become an industry in and of itself. with trial lawyers seeking out sympathetic courtrooms and juries where frivolous claims will be given undue credence. The courts should be forums to redress wrongs. not lotteries. We are now reaping the results of this litigious behavior. and the main result is that patients no longer have access to the healthcare they always assumed would be there. Doctors are leaving the communities they have served for decades. Try to get prenatal care in Las Vegas. Try to see a neurosurgeon in Mississippi. They arent there anymore. We have seen the doctors in West Virginia and New Jersey actually go on strike to protest the absurd rise in malpractice premiums due to frivolous lawsuits. I have spoken to doctors in my district that simply cannot afford their malpractice premiums anymore. and they are looking to us for help. We can have it one way or the otherwe can continue on the current path. where every visit to the doctor is seen as a potential windfall. or we can take these necessary actions to return an element of sanity to the malpractice equation. I support H.R. 5 because I believe it will ultimately allow many doctors to continue practicing medicine. and thus ensure our constituents continue to have access to the care they need. This legislation does not let anybody off the hookbad doctors will still be held accountable for their actions and patients injured through negligence will still have fair recourse. It simply prevents the trial bar from completely ruining our health care system. I urge my colleagues to give H.R. 5 their support.",

I understand better than perhaps any other member of Congress the burden imposed on both medical practitioners and patients by excessive malpractice judgments and the corresponding explosion in malpractice insurance premiums. Malpractice insurance has skyrocketed to the point where doctors are unable to practice in some areas or see certain types of patients because they cannot afford the insurance premiums. This crisis has particularly hit my area of practice. leaving some pregnant women unable to find a qualified obstetrician in their city. Therefore. I am pleased to see Congress address this problem. However this bill raises several questions of constitutionality. as well as whether it treats those victimized by large corporations and medical devices fairly. In addition. it places de facto price controls on the amounts injured parties can receive in a lawsuit and rewrites every contingency fee contract in the country. Yet. among all the new assumptions of federal power. this bill does nothing to address the power of insurance companies over the medical profession. Thus. even if the reforms of H.R. 5 become law. there will be nothing to stop the insurance companies from continuing to charge exorbitant rates. Of course. I am not suggesting Congress place price controls on the insurance industry. Instead. Congress should reexamine those federal laws such as ERISA and the HMO Act of 1973. which have allowed insurers to achieve such a prominent role in the medical profession. As I will detail below. Congress should also take steps to encourage contractual means of resolving malpractice disputes. Such an approach may not be beneficial to the insurance companies or the trial lawyers. buy will certainly benefit the patients and physicians. which both sides in this debate claim to represent. H.R. 5 does contain some positive elements. For example. the language limiting joint and several liabilities to the percentage of damage someone actually caused. is a reform I have long championed.

The HEALTH Act is critical to retarding the explosion in health costs and making insurance more affordable to the 41 million Americans who lack it. The dramatic increases in insurance rates which many physicians have experienced over the past year also prevent them from actually practicing medicine. Many physicians I have spoken to are at wits end trying to figure out how to maintain their practice and pay these exorbitant costs. On March 4. the American Medical Association added Connecticut to the list of states facing crises in their medical malpractice insurance rates. The organization also cited Connecticut as a state where a large number of physicians have ended their practices because of the high medical malpractice insurance rates. These malpractice reforms. which are based on a proven California law. will make muchneeded changes to the federal civil justice system without denying the legal rights of legitimate plaintiffs. It is imperative we move forward on this reform to discourage abuse of our legal system and curb the unsustainable growth of medical costs in our country. Mr. Speaker. I strongly support the HEALTH Act because it will bring meaningful reform to a flawed system. I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I attempted to offer three of the thirtyone amendments to H.R. 5. the HEALTH Act. last night. Inexplicably. these were disallowed out of hand. This rule is an abuse of the process. Yes. it might be payback to the Democrats based on some revisionist history. but more importantly. its a payoff to the Republicans generous benefactors in the insurance industry. and through this bill. a payoff to the pharmaceutical industry. The Republicans claim that the underlying bill. H.R. 5. will control insurance costs through socalled \"tort reform.\" This bill wont do that. In fact. in 1999. a senior executive at the American Tort Reform Association conceded that \"We wouldnt tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort reform would be to reduce insurance rates.\" This is the third crisis in medical malpractice in 25 years. Each of these \"crises\" happens to coincide with recessions. stock market downturns. and insurance industry investment losses. The insurance industry is an equal opportunity market abuser. They legally can and regularly do collude to raise rates and limit availability of all lines of insurance. If this \"crisis\" in medical malpractice insurance is due to a malpractice crisis then why also is there a crisis in health insurance. homeowners insurance. auto insurance. and general liability insurance? Health insurance costs are up 13 percent. homeowners insurance. 8 percent. and auto insurance. 8.5 percent. Maybe its time the insurance industry was subject to the same laws as other industries. Mr. Speaker. the solution that will bring relief and improve access to our nations physicians will start with a repeal of the antitrust exemption of the insurance industry. Legislation like H.R. 5 simply allows the insurance industry to profit off the backs of both doctors and patients.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. as we all know. and certainly the subcommittee is aware very strongly. the B1 bomber is an integral part of our bomber fleet. The longrange strike capability of our national defense is enhanced by the superior payload capability. speed. and accuracy of this aircraft. The Defense authorization and appropriation committees and my good friends. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . the gentleman from Missouri . the gentleman from California. . and the gentleman from California (Chairman LEWIS ). have recognized the importance of the B1 to the Air Force. It performed admirably in Afghanistan and Iraq. I rise today to discuss provisions in the Defense appropriations and authorization bills that address the reinstatement of Bls to the fleet. As a strong supporter of the B1 and having been closely associated with this issue since 1985 when the first B1 was assigned to Dyess Air Force Base. my support is. and always has been. a commonsense approach that advocates the best for the Air Force. The B1 fleet was recently reduced to its current size of 60 aircraft. with assurances that upgrades will be made to the fleet to increase mission capability rates. defensive systems. and lethality. I supported the Air Force decision in its plan to keep fewer. but topquality. missioncapable Bis. The Defense Authorization Act included a provision for $105 million to regenerate an additional 10 Bls above the Air Force recommendation to reinstate seven. The Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations brings to the floor today a recommendation which follows the Air Forces recommendation to regenerate seven aircraft. and also follows the Air Force confirmation that additional funding is not needed beyond the $17 million appropriated for this purpose in fiscal year 2004. My concern about the funding for regenerated Bls is the fact that $17 million may not be enough for the seven aircraft that initially cost $283 million each. Again. I strongly support the B1. but also strongly support full funding for the entire fleet. If we are going to add seven planes. I would like assurances from the chairman and ranking member today that they do believe that the Air Force is correct that $17 million is sufficient funding to keep 67 planes in the air. flying. with the mission that I know that they support.",

That takes manpower. There are some recommendations that are going forward that caused this concern. but I do appreciate the reassurances of the chairman and the ranking member. and we look forward to working with my colleagues to see that the full 67 plane force is. in fact. fully funded and operational to do the job that they have been called on to do in Iraq and Afghanistan and. hopefully. if called upon again. will be able to do as good or a better job.",

The doughnut hole. which is a gap in terms of dollars and what benefits can be acquired during that time and before and after that. the Democrats. as I have already said. have in their 1999 bill a $200 deductible and they had a cost sharing up to $1.700 and then catastrophic coverage after $3.000 out of pocket.

And CMS found during the first week. and I am talking about the first week in May now. the first week in May. which was really when all this started in terms of posting prescription drug discount card pricing information. et cetera. the CMS found that the discounted prices available through the program had already fallen 111 percent for brand names and 121/2 percent for generics over that first week. I do not know what the current picture is. I have not looked into that. But the fact of the matter is we can see what will happen here with competition. And these discounted prices are already less. already less. than what seniors without drug coverage are paying for their medications. And that is why. Mr. Speaker. it is so disappointing that some continue to demagogue this issue. When I learn of a partisan analysis. if you will. of the prescription drug discount card benefit that concludes that the program is a failure. before a single beneficiary uses the card. before a single beneficiary uses the card. it makes us all wonder.

The Sun Grant Initiativeor SGIis an effort to provide an innovative approach to creating new biobased products and markets for farmers. thereby enhancing the environment and developing new industries in our Nations rural communities. The SGI would establish five Sun Grant Centers across the Nation to stimulate needed research and development projects. while providing leadership and coordination for a regional competitive grant program that will address national research issues and educational needs at the regional and local levels. This new program will provide a muchneeded bridge between our Governments current national research efforts and the Statebased research education networks of the LandGrant universities. The SGI will forge a new partnership between the national leadership and energy expertise of the Federal Government and the agricultural and rural community development expertise of the Agricultural Experiment Stations and the Cooperative Extension System. The United States has steadily increased its reliance on imported oil. Alternative sources of energy and industrial chemicals must be developed as soon as possible. The Sun Grant Initiative will stimulate the production of bioenergy resources to complement and augment petroleum energy resources. while helping to reduce our dependence on imported oil and constrain energy costs for American industries and consumers. Additionally. American farmers need new products and viable market alternatives. Sun Grant research. development and education programs will stimulate the development bloenergy and bioproducts on American farms. creating an opportunity for an additional. significant source of income to farmers. The SGI will encourage new biobased industries and new capital investments. stimulating the economies of these rural communities. I want to thank Senator FRIST. Chairman BENNETT. and Senators KOHL. COCHRAN. HARKIN and SMITH for their support of this innovative and exciting effort to build a biobased economy that can assist our Nation in so many ways.",

As I heard that. it occurred to me that was not the case at all. History is history. and revisionist history is fun. but it is not accurate. Isnt it the case that last summer. for example. when the Republicans were in control and then one Senator moved to caucus with Democrats and the Democrats actually took control of the Senate. for 3 weeks the gavels were not turned over to the chairmen? I am not suggesting there is any justification for anything by making that point. My point is. when people come to the Chamber to talk about this. lets talk about what really happened. and if we can. lets talk about what is happening now for the moment. Isnt it the case that the reason the Senate is hung up is because the majority leader is saying: We have 51 percent of the votes in the Senate. and we want twothirds of the money to run the place?

A resident of St. Petersburg. Patrick L. McLaughlin is a broadcast engineer whose career began after service in the United States Navy in World War II and culminated with this retirement from the television industry in 1985. He. and many radioandtelevision pioneers like him. literally helped get television off the ground. laboring behindthescenes to usher in the dawn of modern. electronic television. For the technicians and engineers of those early days of TV. it often was a lowbudget. lowglamour profession. But they pressed on and built an extraordinary industry. In 1954. Mr. McLaughlin helped build up West Central Floridas first television station. WSUNTV. Channel 38. Later. he served as chief engineer at WFLATV. Channel 8. in Tampa. now one of the countrys largest media markets. Under his guidance. WFLA and other television stations initiated important technological changes that have been models for later industry transformations. Along the way. he made sure local stations remained on the air during times of crisis to provide an essential lifeline and source of information for dispersed Tampa Bay area communities when they were hit by hurricanes and riots. Nowadays. we take television so much for granted that its easy to forget that innovative technicians and engineers. such as Mr. McLaughlin. helped transform broadcasting stations into a source of entertainment and education for current and future generations. as well as a powerful medium that helps shape both popular culture and contemporary history. For this. we owe that early generation of broadcast engineering pioneers our gratitude. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me today in recognizing one of them. Patrick L. McLaughlin.0",

It may be good for headlines. it may be good for getting on television. but it does not serve this body well and it does not serve our country well. I hope colleagues will be more thoughtful in their use of language in the future.",

I recall the Chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers suggesting a war in Iraq might cost us $100 billion and then it being kind of open ended as to what it would cost us to continue to occupy that nation and keep it under control for some period of time. When we project out the deficits which you said you can see on the horizon. based on the Presidents tax cut and the current state of the economy. does it anticipate that kind of emergency situation where we would be involved in a war in Iraq or we would be involved in a longterm occupation?",

Those numbers would add to the deficit and debt I have outlined here. I might say to my colleague. it is true the Presidents Chief Economic Adviser said it could cost $100 billion. perhaps as much as $200 billion. In fact. if we are engaged in a 5year occupation. the Congressional Budget Office has told us the cost would be in the range of $250 billion. None of those numbers are in these projections.",

I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this amendment to the Interior Appropriations Bill to expand funding for the lowincome weatherization program and other important energy efficiency programs. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. Weatherization programs help all Americans in all areas of the country. from those congressional districts with hot. sweltering summers to my Third Congressional District of Wisconsin. which as you know experiences long. bitter cold winters. During this year of unprecedented rising energy prices. it is important that this Congress have an honest discussion of our nations energy policy. Importantly. this amendment shows the American people our dedication to energy conservation measures. Mr. Chairman. much of the focus on our current energy crisis has been the rising price of crude oil and natural gas. But in my district and throughout the country. the price of heating oil has risen as much as 30 percent in the past year. Conservation efforts such as the weatherization assistance program go a long way to helping us become less dependent on foreign oil. Mr. Chairman. the weatherization assistance program helps correct the disproportionate energy burden faced by lowincome Americans. The program has helped make over five million homes more energy efficient and the average home has seen heating savings of 23 percent. With many lowincome households spending over $1.200 on energy costs annually. this energy efficiency savings can further help these families afford the basic necessities of life. Mr. Speaker we do not want any of our citizens having to make the difficult choice between food and fuel. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

Let me first state that if it is such a politically expedient way in which to do things. why do they drop the date of allowing this credit to continue? The Democrats actually have a window. It is right after the election of 2004 where the $1.000 credit drops to $700. I do not know why we would frame a bill that has such an expiration date. If it is such a great idea. let us continue to give this credit past the election of 2004 to many families who desperately need this help in raising their children. As a result of their bill. millions of low- and middleincome families will receive a smaller child tax credit right after the election. The Housepassed bill ensures that the child credit remain at the $1.000 level throughout the decade. The Democratic motion to instruct does not eliminate the marriage penalty and the child credit until 2010. And even then it only does so for 1 year. Under the Democratic motion. millions of children will be denied the child credit simply because their parents are married. The House bill benefits middleincome families by eliminating the child credit immediately. The House bill does not deny that credit to military families. Military families. including those who are deployed abroad. are already receiving a refundable child credit and will continue to receive a refundable child credit under the Housepassed bill. The Democratic motion to instruct would only increase the refundable child credit for some military families by allowing them to take into account taxfree income when they compute their refundable credit. The Housepassed bill provides more tax relief to military families because it includes $806 million of military tax benefits that were not passed by the other Chamber. These provisions passed the House on numerous occasions. and they are waiting action in the Senate. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to urge conferees on H.R. 1308. the Child Tax Credit legislation. to do the right thing and act now to give lowerincome families the tax refunds they deserve. Earlier this year we enacted a $350 million tax cut that lavished tax breaks on millionaires but failed to provide lowincome families with a child tax credit. Last month we attempted to right this wrong by passing a bill that will provide lowincome families with the same $1.000 child tax credit other families will receive. However. the House failed to include an important provision that would put these refund checks into the pockets of lowincome families in the same timely way that checks land in the mailboxes of other families. Conferees should do the right thing by these 12 million children and insist upon the Senatepassed measure that would eliminate the delay and provide rebate checks to these families in the same timely manner provided to other families. This is what the President would like for us to do. and failing to quickly correct this problem is simply wrong. The Senatepassed measure has the added advantage of not adding to a deficit rapidly escalating out of control. whereas the Housepassed version adds $82 billion to a deficit that is already staggering. If the goal of this tax cut bill is to provide an economic stimulus and we are serious about stimulating the economy. then we should act as quickly as possible to get this money into the hands of families who will immediately spend it. Tax cuts resulting in an immediate return will result in a welcome shot of adrenalin to our damaged economy. Families nationwide will be receiving their tax credit this summer. just in time to purchase backtoschool supplies for their children. We owe it to lowincome families to get their refund check to them in the same timely manner. This is unquestionably the right thing to do. Conferees should put an end to their delaying tactics and deliver immediate tax relief to our Nations neediest children by adopting the Senatepassed measure.",

Working families need real relief. especially in these difficult economic times when we are experiencing an unemployment rate that has jumped to 6.4 percent. Amazingly. despite the sluggish economy and our moral responsibility to help working families. House Republicans continue to stall the Senatepassed Child Tax Credit bill in conference. House Republicans got us into this mess in the first place since they deliberately chose to drop the Child Tax Credit from their millionaire tax cut bill. and they should get us out of it. Starting on July 25. millionaires will be getting their rebate checks. However. 4 million families across the country will not get a single dime. even though they are in the greatest need of a tax break. One of those 4 million families lives in my district. The Wolfalks are like many families across the country that play by the rules. Mrs. Wolfalk works full time as an administrative assistant. and her husband is disabled. They are raising five children on an annual income of $25.000. Mrs. Wolfalk told me that any additional money means that her son will not have to wear shoes with holes in the soles. It means that she will be able to buy additional uniforms for her children who currently wear handmedowns. With this extra money her children will be able to have new uniforms for school. school supplies and books. Things are tight for her family right now. so she assures me that any additional help would make a huge difference in her family. It breaks my heart to know that Congress can do something to help these families and Republicans are refusing to provide for families just like the Wolfalks.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments this morning. I share his view about the importance of this highway bill. in particular. I wish to say a few things about both the highway bill as well as the budget this morning. We just received our report again this month about the economy and the jobs created. I think the good news is that we did see the creation of 112.000 new jobs in January. I think that is a positive development. The bad news is that it falls short of what was needed to keep us on a path to ensure that jobs are not lost during the Presidents first term. Mr. President. 150.000 new jobs in January was the stated goal of the Administration. The figure released today indicates a substantial shortfall. this is nearly 40.000 jobs short of their stated goal. Of course. it is dramatically shorttwothirds shortof what the goal would be to reverse this unemployment debacle we have witnessed for the last 3 years. 300.000 new private sector jobs would have to be created each month to erase the decline we have witnessed the past 36 months. So while we made some progress this month with 112.000 new jobs. we are falling far short of the Administrations stated goal of 150.000 and even further short of the 300.000 jobs necessary to reverse the unfortunate trend. There is another disturbing problem that we have not been able to address. and the administration has not been able to address. This is the 42nd month in a row that we have actually seen a loss of manufacturing jobs. For 42 straight months manufacturing jobs have declined. The jobs issue may be the single most critical issue as we look at the economy. There is a long. long way to go before we can say with any confidence that we have turned this economy around. that people who have jobs will keep them. and people who dont have jobs will get them. I think most of us would receive todays news about jobs this month with that sense of disappointment. but also with the realization that 112.000 jobs is better than what we had in December when only a thousand jobs were added.",

Much of their anger. as the Senator noted in the article. is directed towards the organization AARP. for their failure to stand up for citizens. and I think that is understandable. Their frustration and their anxiety goes deeper than just an organization. They are concerned about their own livelihoods and what it may mean for them and how troubling it is to them that the Government is actually forbidden from negotiating lower drug prices. which is what the goal was in the first place. So it is their inability to get lower drug prices. their concern about having to pay exorbitant premiums and fees for a limited benefit. their concern about being pushed into an HMO. their concern about whether they can access drugs from other countries like Canada where prices are cheaper: all of those and many more concerns were reflected in these discussions.

We would like to have amendments looked at. I strongly urge you to come down. We are going to stay on our timetable to try to have this completed. I appreciate the comments by the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from New Jersey. It is very important we get this done. We are beyond the point of turning back and changing things. We have spent a year working out all the elementsthe environmental portion of the bill. the safety portion of the bill. the formula portionand we have probably the best bill we have had during my time. and I go back to ISTEA when I was in the other body and TEA21 here. We have considered more than the other formulas and we have now abandoned the idea of percentages that will get 60 votes and then walking. That is not the way we should be doing it. I think we are doing it a lot better. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier this month. the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. united with the Million Mom March and the Nations leading Statebased gun violence prevention groups. published the annual gun safety report cards for every State in America. The report cards are the culmination of a comprehensive analysis of each States gun safety laws. The report cards rate each State on seven types of laws that protect children from gun violence. Extra credit and demerits are also assigned for other State gun laws. The Brady Campaign includes in its analysis such questions as: is it illegal for a child to possess a gun without supervision? Is it illegal to sell a gun to a child? Are gun owners held responsible for leaving loaded guns easily accessible to children? Are guns required to have child safety locks. loadedchamber indicators and other childproof designs? Do cities and counties have authority to enact local gun laws? Are background checks required at gun shows? Is it legal to carry concealed handguns in public? The report awarded 10 States with Sensible Safety Stars for protecting children from gun violence. Nine other States were sent to the \"TimeOut Chair\" for weakening State gun laws. Unfortunately. 31 States received grades of D or F in this years report cards. Not surprisingly. according to the report. States receiving Ds and Fs tend to have child and teen firearm death rates that are higher than the national average. For example. the average firearms death rate of youth in the 8 States that received an F grade was 33 percent higher than the average firearms death rate for the 10 States that received an A or a B. I applaud the efforts of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence to keep the pressure on State and local legislators to enact sensible gun safety legislation. and I encourage my colleagues to review this report.",

I announced my intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up S. 1896. the Tax Relief Extension Act. and H.R. 1664. the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. I did so because these bills were the only relevant amendable legislation expected to be taken up in the Senate before the end of the last session and. therefore. they provided the only opportunity to extend unemployment benefits before Federal unemployment benefits expired at the end of the year. Oregon currently has the second highest unemployment rate in the Nation with an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent. Extension of unemployment benefits is critical for many Oregonians who have or will soon run out of unemployment. In order to restore or continue benefits to unemployed workers in Oregon and many other States. I will be pushing for passage of S. 2006. the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act. S. 2006 restores Federal unemployment benefits and reforms a \"look back\" rule that affects Oregon and other high unemployment States as part of the legislation. Because there is now legislation before the Senate to restore Federal benefits for unemployed workers in Oregon and other States. I will no longer object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up S. 1896 or H.R. 1664.",

The mission of the caucus is to act on this conviction by providing the strong U.S. leadership necessary to conserve the worlds most biologically rich and diverse places. The Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act is one of the first steps in achieving our mission. Our contribution under the act will focus on providing fieldbased conservation activities within 25 million acres in Cameroon. the Central African Republic. and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

I understand why he is hostile to organized labor because he does not get many labor union votes from steelworkers or auto workers or food and commercial workers.

They liked the fact that he served this country through the National Guard honorably and fully. at least before the news broke they thought he did. and they voted for him because they thought he was sort of a standup tough guy and would stand up for American interests.

The only answer I can figure is. he is so wedded and focused on his tax policy. on cutting taxes for the very wealthy. saving literally over a trillion dollars in taxes for the richest 1 percent. that everybody else suffers. veterans suffer. school kids get shortchanged. seniors through the Medicare program get shortchanged. environmental enforcement gets shortchanged. food safety enforcement. research for -the NIH get shortchanged. and that is the only explanation I can come up with. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I think it is appropriate for us to talk about what the Democrats plan is and what we would do. I think it is important not just to criticize. although there is plenty of room for criticism in this administration. The Democratic budget that we want for veterans would increase the tax for those who make more than a million dollars a year. not all of it. As the gentleman from Ohio said. they get $123.000 back from the Bush tax plan. We would say they would only get $100.000 back. They would have to give around $20.000 of their tax cut back. Part of that money we would use. $2 billion of it. to restore the full survivor benefits to families of military retirees. $2.5 billion we would put in veterans health care. We would improve military housing for 50.000 military families. So if anyone is at home asking. what is the Democratic plan. this is our plan: $2.5 billion for health care. 50.000 families for military housing. $2 billion to restore full survivor benefits. And our legislation. if we were controlling this Chamber. the other Chamber and possibly the White House. would permanently permit Reservists to buy military health care through the TRICARE program. Many of the Reservists. almost 2.000 of them. and I hear often about the health care issues. our plan would allow them to buy permanently into the TRICARE program. We would give them pay raises. things the gentleman from Ohio talked about. the combat pay. et cetera. our future veterans would be taken care of. So the Democrats have a plan. Let the millionaire keep $100.000. we are going to take a few thousand away and invest it into our veterans and into the research and development for our amputees that will be coming back. so they have the best possible health care that the United States of America. the wealthiest superpower ever in the history of world. can at the very least take care of its veterans.",

Nothing could be further from the truth. and I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I have never and will never support taxing email. Thats patently ridiculous. On October 31. 2003. the Cincinnati Enquirer correctly reported my opposition on this very important issue: Senator George Voinovich of Ohio has been boiled in a witches cauldron this week by critics angered that he helped block an expanded ban of taxes on Internet services. The current Internet Tax Moratorium. which he supports. expires Saturday. Antitax groups making VoinovIch out to be the devil incarnate are roasting the wrong guy. Voinovich favors keeping the tax moratorium on Internet access. He helped negotiate the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998. supported its renewal in 2001 and opposes new taxes on telecommunications services. And yes. he strongly opposes a tax on email. This newspaper and others like it in Ohio have captured the essence of my argument. The debate on S. 150 is not about taxing email. This debate is about federalism. unfunded mandates. and protecting the States rights to govern their own affairs. To clarify my position. I will offer an amendment that expresses the sense of the Senate that email should not now. nor in the future. be taxed by Federal. State. or local governments.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join Chairman GRASSLEY in introducing the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003. The chairman and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN. are also original sponsors of this legislation. This legislation is very similar to the energy tax incentives bill which won overwhelming support on the Senate floor last April and provides a strong starting point for the Senate Finance Committee towards a markup of an energy tax bill. The urgency for this legislation at this point in time is particularly critical. Gasoline prices in the U.S. are at record levels. Low inventories. high crude oil prices. recent cold weather and continuing industry concern about a possible war with Iraq have raised gas prices close to the highest price ever recorded. This situation is not expected to improve in the near future. To help alleviate this situation. this bill proposes a balanced package of alternative energy. traditional energy production and energy efficiency incentives. This legislation begins from the premise that we may accomplish energy policy goals by targeting market incentivesin the form of tax deductions and credits--at certain investments. The bill would accomplish this in three ways. First. we create incentives for new production. especially production from important renewable sources. Second. we create incentives for the development of new technology. Third. we create incentives for energy conservation. Through targeted market incentives we hope to encourage the development of alternative sources of production and technologies. thereby boosting our overall energy resources. This will help promote energy independence in the United States. which will contribute to both greater economic growth and national security. At the same time. by encouraging development of sources of renewable energy and energy efficiency. we will also encourage pollution reduction and improve human health and the environment. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important piece of legislation.",

I am pleased to join the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee and the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee as a sponsor of the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003. which we are introducing today. The tax incentives we introduce today are designed to encourage commercial activities that will increase and diversify our energy supplies and help us to use those energy supplies more efficiently and productively. Our demand for energy continues to grow and we will need a broad portfolio of energy sources. including improved efficiency. to meet this demand. The energy tax package encompasses many of the diverse components that make up a comprehensive energy strategy. These include incentives for renewable resources. alternative transportation fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. energy efficient appliances and buildings. clean coal. domestic oil and gas production and infrastructure. as well as removing impediments to an integrated electric grid. This bill reflects the work of the Finance Committee last year to develop a balanced package of energy tax provisions to complement the energy policy legislation developed by the Senate. The language of the bill is virtually identical to the tax sections of the Energy bill passed by the Senate last April. While new or improved versions of some of the provisions have been developed in the intervening months. this version provides a common starting point for any further refinements of the text. I look forward to participating in the Finance Committees consideration of the energy tax package this year. By Ms. COLLINS (for herself. Mr. MILLER. Mrs. DOLE. Mr.",

Georgia for the first Girl Scout meeting. Girl Scouts of America has a current membership of nearly four million girls and adult volunteers. It is the preeminent organization in the United States committed to inspiring girls and young women with the highest ideals of character. conduct. and service to others. As the first National organization for girls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress. Girl Scouts offers girls of all ages. races. and socioeconomic backgrounds the opportunity to grow. develop friendships. and gain valuable life experiences. The Girl Scout initiatives has enabled more than 50 million women in the United States to participate in community service projects. cultural exchanges. athletic events. and educational activities that teach selfconfidence. responsibility. and integrity. Girl Scout initiatives have reflected the Nations changing social and economic climate. For example. the National organization recently began a campaign to encourage girls to develop an interest in math. science. and technology as a way to create greater diversity in the workforce and to help bridge the technogender divide. Today. one in nine girls is a member of the Girl Scouts. and over twothirds of our female doctors. lawyers. educators. and community leaders were once Girl Scouts.

As a Girl Scout. you participate in a broad range of activitiesfrom taking nature hikes to taking in the arts. You serve in local food banks and learn about politics. As your skills grow as a Girl Scout. so does your selfconfidence. The badges you earn serve as symbols for success. leadership. accomplishment. and service in your community. With help from the Girl Scouts. you can develop into a solid citizen in mind. body and spirit. As a Girl Scout. you also learn values and attitudes that serve as good guides throughout life. You learn the importance of treating other people fairly and with the dignity they deserve. You develop the confidence to know that you can reach your goals. You learn to be a leader. In todays hectic and uncertain world. Scouts are more important than ever. Young girls and boys need before and after school activities that are safe. educational. and fun. They need adult role models like the girl Scouts. who are dedicated to helping young people. They need to learn the high ideals of leadership. service. character. and good conduct. In sum.

I thank you for what you meant to me and what you do for millions of young women across the country. I hope the Resolution that Senator HUTCHISON and myself have introduced here today raises more public awareness of the good works that you do. Congratulations to the Girl Scouts on your 91st anniversary. I am so proud of who you are and what you do.",

As many people in Illinois and across the Nation know. not so long ago the women Redhawks would not have had the chance to even lace up their sneakers.

As we watched the morning headline and the evening newscast. we are struck by the brave commitment of our men and women on the borders of Iraq and perhaps. as I speak. within the borders of Iraq as they prepare for an allout invasion of Iraq. At a moment like this when we are watching this commitment. it is important to think of the significant and personal sacrifices these brave men and women are making. But at the same time that we are creating hundreds of thousands of new veterans through their distinguished service. the Congress today debates a Republican budget that mandates cuts in veterans programs. I talk to these folks at the Northampton VA. I meet with them regularly. and they point out there simply is less money every year in the VA for honoring the commitment we made to our soldiers. I know that the Republicans today through another managers amendment. only because when they went back to their membership. the membership said to them. \"what are you thinking of.\" that they have added in this amendment a few more dollars in an attempt to ameliorate some of their cuts. But the compelling truth is that this nominal increase will quickly be overcome by more than 2 percent in annual cuts in the years following. According to the Congressional Budget Office. their spending on veterans health care and benefits is not enough to maintain purchasing power. which simply means real cuts in veterans programs. As the National Commander of the Disabled American Veterans said of this budget being proposed by the majority Republican Party in this Congress. \"This budget dishonors the service of millions of serviceconnected disabled veterans. including combatdisabled veterans. and seriously erodes the Nations commitment to care for its defenders.\" Stand strong today for the Democratic proposal. Honor the commitment we made to our veterans and vote down this Republican budget proposal.",

Mr. Chairman. first I would like to commend the gentleman from Iowa on this great budget resolution that adheres to the principles that this Chamber has been speaking about forever. fiscal discipline. tax relief. and job creation. This budget resolution includes President Bushs job growth plan. which provides immediate help for Americans who are facing very difficult economic times right now. and also lays the groundwork for strong and sustained economic growth in the future. This plan will boost job growth by 2.1 million jobs over the next 3 years. In my home State alone. Florida. it will create 54.000 jobs in 2004. and almost 250.000 jobs will be created over the next 4 years. Small businesses. sometimes an entity that is forgotten so much in these conversations. will receive tax cuts averaging over $2.000 under this budget. this plan. The longterm tax incentives will not only help job growth. but it will also create. as I said before. longterm financial security for all Americans in our wonderful country. I keep hearing about this Blue Dog budget. but this Blue Dog Democratic alternative increases taxes. increases taxes on Americans that are struggling right now to pay their rent. to pay their mortgage. to keep their jobs. It increases taxes to hire more bureaucrats. They may call it a Blue Dog plan. but when you take off the dressing. it is just a dog. Increasing taxes in America in this day and age will do nothing to help the economy. It will slow down economic growth. That is why this plan. the Republican plan. makes so much sense. It is the right plan for the right time. It is one that will increase jobs. not decrease. that will lower taxes on working Americans. lower taxes on small businesses. not increase taxes to hire more bureaucrats here in Washington. It is time to bring common sense. This budget does so.",

That goes to the heart of national security. and it also goes to the heart of economic security since by far the biggest setback we could have to our economy. for another setback. which would be another major terrorist attack. This budget includes a substantial increase for the protection of our Nations infrastructure. $829 million. for instance. a more than 300 percent increase for the Department of Homeland Securitys Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection which will provide new capabilities in the war against terror by mapping intelligence and threat information about the Nations potential vulnerabilities. That includes $500 million to assess the Nations critical infrastructure and to ensure that our highestpriority vulnerabilities are properly addressed. This is important everywhere. including my home State of Louisiana. We have a vast amount of critical infrastructure there. including some of the most active ports in the world and a large portion of the strategic petroleum reserve. infrastructure that transports a huge percentage of the Nations oil and gas needs and so much more. Terrorist attacks to any of these facilities would be devastating to my State and. indeed. the entire Nation. So in this time of war. in this time of threat. providing for our military and protecting our homeland first and foremost are top priorities. This budget does both of those. It protects our economy also as a result. and I urge my fellow Members to support this strong budget.",

With America at war and with families having to make tough decisions around their kitchen tables. should we not in Congress at least be expected to make smart decisions to promote economic growth and to take a stand against waste and fraud? Many across the aisle oppose this budget and attack the tax relief. But. Mr. Chairman. less than 5 percent of this budget is about tax relief. 95 percent of this budget is about spending. 3 percent more. more. than last year. Unfortunately. much of it continues to be waste and fraud. The Department of Housing and Urban Development made $2.6 billion in section 8 overpayments. 7 percent of their entire budget just lost. That is enough money to pay the downpayment for 300.000 people to get into their first homes. The Medicare program paid out $13.3 billion in 1 year to people who did not even qualify. That is enough money this year to pay one third of the cost of a prescription drug benefit for our seniors. The list goes on. Social Security pays benefits to dead people. Twentythree percent of the people having their student loans discharged due to disability actually hold jobs. The National Park Service spent $800.000 on an outhouse. and it does not even work. In the real world when people lose this much money. they are fired or they go to jail. In Washington it is just an excuse to ask for even more money next year. Mr. Chairman. there are a thousand ways we can save money in Washington without cutting any needed services and without raising taxes on our hardworking families and our men and women in uniform. People should quit trying to fool the American people into thinking otherwise. If we fail to endorse this budget and just promote even more government spending without reform. we are simply sanctioning fraud. What an insult to the American people.",

So I am proud to stand in support of a budget that recognizes those realities today that face American families. that face our municipalities. that face our States. and make the same tough decisions that they have. I am proud that this budget. the Republican budget. controls spending. Yes. I would like to see it control spending even more. There is a lot of areas of this budget that I. frankly. do not think we are restraining the spending. In fact. I believe that the budget for veterans. actually we are increasing veterans spending under this proposed Republican budget. But what we are asking for in this budget. we are asking agencies to save taxpayers money. just as Americans are sitting down at their tables trying to find ways to save money in their family budgets. And our economic growth is contingent upon responsible spending in all sectors of our economy: business. personal spending. and government. Now. this budget protects the fiscal soundness of our government and incorporates costcutting provisions that will pay dividends well into the future. Through responsible tax cuts. we are returning the power back to the people.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I was listening to my colleagues say that this was the Joint Economic Committee. and we are supposed to talk about monetary policy. and I want to return us to monetary policy. because I am kind of reflecting back to when I first ran for Congress in 1992. That was the year that deficits were approximately $130 billion. $140 billion. All of my Republican opponents. colleagues. economists. everybody at that time was telling me that there was something sinister about budget deficits. and I could not quite understand what their preoccupation was. But I did realize over a period of time that it was projected that the budget deficit for 1993 and 1994 was going to keep going up. and at that time. the maximum budget deficit that anybody was projecting was $260 billion. It was sacrilegious for anybody to think that we ought to be projecting a $260 billion budget deficit. So it is kind of amazing to me now that I could see a Republican budget for the year 2004 project a $319 billion deficit. I was talking to a reporter before I came over here and he said. well. are you all talking about war today? I said. no. we are debating the budget. He said. oh. you are talking about money for the war? And I said. no. there is not a dime of money for the war that we are fighting in the budgets that anybody has proposed today. except for the defense spending. which would be there even if we were not fighting a war. Well. over time I came to understand that when you have those kinds of budget deficits every year accumulating. they keep adding into the national debt. and when you have a national debt. you have to pay interest on that national debt. So to see a Republican budget that in the outyears. 2009. 2010. projects that we will be paying $250 plus billion in interest only on the national debt. it does not take much for me to understand. well. if I had that $250 billion in my budget. I could do something with it. like pay for education and health care and things that are important to our countrys future. That is the microbasis that I want to talk about.",

Mr. Chairman. who want to work towards a responsible way to save Social Security. to save Medicare. As a young Member of this Congress. I believe we have to think beyond the next election and beyond the next budget to do those kinds of things. but if we cannot find 1 percent savings. then we will never. ever be able to tell the American people that we can take the giant leaps to reform those huge programs. The gentleman managing the floor for the other side on this debate has labeled some of us in this Chamber as henchmen for supporting our Presidents crusade to liberate Iraq. He has accused the President of ordering the assassination of Saddam Hussein to cover up for the fact that we have yet to find bin Laden. although we have disrupted al Qaeda. I resent that. Mr. Speaker. and I think that he should take his tongueincheek tirade back to Baghdad where some of his colleagues have trod in the past. It is unacceptable when our young men and women are at war to have those kinds of character assassinations. To label Members of this body as henchmen. to go after the character of our President who has led this Nation through so much. goes above and beyond legitimate disagreement over the priorities that this budget should have. and it is unacceptable. and it should not stand.",

With the war on terrorism and our struggling economy. our projected budget deficits are staggering. Throughout our country. State. local. community governments and businesses are cutting their budgets to respond to declining revenues. Americans expect us to do the same. Only the Federal Government tries to put together a budget where it looks to see how much it is going to spend first and then looks to revenues. and to some Members of this body the Federal Government can never spend enough. This budget asked certain Federal agencies to find 1 percent in savings in waste. fraud and abuse and efficiencies. It is amazing today that we would have a discussion over an argument over 1 penny in a dollar. There is not an agency in our government. there is not an organization that we have that cannot find 1 percent in waste and efficiency even in good times.

We must extend unemployment benefits for these Georgians and the estimated 2 million workers nationwide who will exhaust their benefits in the next 6 months. We must extend these benefits until the administration starts taking job creation seriously. The administrations policies are not creating jobs and there is no plan to create jobs either. The Bush administration has presided over the worst jobloss record in half a centurywe have lost almost 2.4 million jobs since Bush took officeand yet this Congress and the President are denying that jobless Americans even exist. That is unacceptable. These Americans have worked hard and paid into the system. but now they are unemployed and they need a safety net for a few more weeks. Until we start creating jobs. we must show compassion for these hardworking Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own during the economic downturn. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to say that this unemployment extension is unnecessary because the Gross Domestic Product is back on the rise these days. and the stock market has turned the corner. The stock market rise might be helping the wealthy who benefit from Bushs tax cut. but it is not helping the over 51.000 Georgians who cant find a job. These economic indicators are good news. but this has been a jobless recovery. Last month only 1.000 new jobs were created in this country. Until this economy starts creating jobsand lots of them. these economic indicators dont mean a thing. These Americans need jobsand until then. they need unemployment insurance. These hardworking Americans expect and deserve our help. During past recessions. Congress habitually extended unemployment insurance until there were enough jobs to make it unnecessary. The numbers speak for themselves. There just arent enough jobsand until there are enough jobs. we need to meet our obligation to these workers and their families.",

In fact. the May 6 statement of the Federal Reserve Boards Open Market Committee can itself be read as a plea to Congress to take the steps necessary to spur economic growth and prevent deflation. The Wall Street Journal on its editorial page recently said. \"In any case. Mr. Greenspans main duty is monetary policy. and that is where his words really matter. His deflation warning ought to be a wakeup call to Congress.\" Lower tax rates to stimulate growth and greater liquidity to prevent deflation is exactly the right policy mix. The Fed has supplied the liquidity. it is up to us in the Congress to supply the lower tax rates. Our Nations economy is in trouble. Americans expect the President and the Congress to take action to get the economy out of the ditch. back on the road creating jobs. Republicans and Democrats may differ on how best to use fiscal policy to help the economy. but to do nothing should not be an option. This President should be given a chance to use his policies to turn around our economy. This bill does just that. It obtains all of the elements of the Presidents economic growth and jobs proposal.

It will stimulate manufacturing jobs in a sector which has been battered by the economic slowdown. Two provisions. the increase on the business expensing allowance and a 5year carryback of net operating losses. will go directly toward preserving and creating highpaying manufacturing jobs in our economy. A strong expensing allowance is the right medicine for the ailing manufacturing sector. It significantly reduces the cost of capital so that manufacturers can invest in new equipment and machinery and in the process dramatically increase workers productivity. Allowing businesses to deduct more quickly the cost of capital investments makes those investments more affordable. This is seed corn for the economy.

Fifteen months ago. we passed one of the largest tax cuts in history.

Hospitals in Arizona and throughout the country incur uncompensated costs of over $1.5 billion annually to provide federally mandated emergency health treatment to undocumented immigrants. MTG Corporation. a Texasbased firm. and the Border Counties Coalition. through a congressionally directed study. determined that the 24 counties along the Southwest border alone incur unreimbursed costs of over $200 million per year to provide emergency health treatment to undocumented aliens. Based on these estimates. MTG Corporation has concluded that nationwide hospitals. ambulances and other providers incur costs of over $1.5 billion per year. Arizona. as an example. is indicative of the problems that all States and their providers are facing. The cost to Arizona and its providers for providing these services might well be close to $200 million. These unreimbursed costs. and other healthrelated issues. have put hospitals around the country in a state of dire fiscal emergency. As a result of these costs. many doctors are simply choosing to practice medicine in such a way that they do not have to provide emergency room treatment--in Phoenix. AZ. depending on the time of day. if you have a specific emergency a specialty doctor might not be available to treat you.

Ms. Kizito was named Woman Business Owner of the Year by the Louisville chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners. Ms. Kizito is being honored for demonstrating smart business practices that have led to the success of Kizito Cookies located in Louisville. Almost 20 years ago. Ms. Kizito began her entrepreneurial experience by selling cookies as a way to pay for her sons birthday present. Shortly thereafter. she had enough business to begin selling cookies from a street cart. Within a few years she traded her cart for a bakery on Bardstown Road. What sets Kizito Cookies apart from other businesses are Ms. Kizitos superior marketing skills. Dressed in traditional garb from her native country of Uganda. she sells cookies from a basket placed atop her head. Many Louisvillians affectionately refer to her as the \"Cookie Lady.\" Her African heritage plays a dominant part in her life and business. Born in Uganda during the 1950s. she moved to America to attend school. Unfortunately. civil unrest resulting in a civil war prevented her from returning to Uganda. She moved to Louisville in 1978 and began making cookies for coworkers. a skill she learned from her father who ran a bakery in Uganda. Each year she travels to her home country and even provides financial assistance to her relatives. Ms. Kizito continues honoring her roots by passing along to the people of Louisville a piece of her culture. Ms. Kizitos hard work and dedication are inspiring. She has created a great deal from very little. and in the process made an entire community her friend. Please join me in congratulating Ms. Elizabeth Namusoke Kizito on this much deserved honor.o",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to name the U.S. Post Office at 7401 W. 100th Place in Bridgeview. IL after Postal Police Officer Michael Healy. On June 21. 1981. while guarding the Chicago Main Post Office at Harrison Avenue and Canal Street. Officer Healys life was senselessly cut short by a random act of violence. Officer Healy was murdered by three assailants in a foiled robbery attempt. Sadly. Michael Healy became the first officer of the Postal Inspection Service to be killed while on duty. Shortly after his murder. the Postal Inspection Service retired Michaels badge. number 3972. Subsequently. Michaels name was added to the Federal Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington. DC as well as the Law Enforcement Memorial in Springfield. IL. In 2001. the Northern Illinois Division of the United States Inspection Service honored the 20th anniversary of Michaels death. The Fraternal Order of Police. FOP. has tried for two years to rename the local post office after Officer Healy. In protecting others. Officer Healy made the ultimate sacrifice. I believe it is fitting to pay tribute to him by designating the postal facility in honor of Michael J. Healy. I think that it is the most appropriate way to recognize and remember a man who gave so much to his family. his friends. the Postal Inspection Service. and his community of Hometown. IL.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today. with my friend and colleague Senator SMITH of Oregon. to introduce legislation to improve the management of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area in Douglas County. OR. For the small. rural. coastal community of Winchester Bay in Douglas County. OR. this piece of legislation is critical. Hit first in the early 90s with a steep downturn in the timber economy. closely followed by a near shutdown of the fishing industry. this community found itself on the brink of economic ruin. The final blow came in March of 2000 when the major employer. International Paper. closed its paper mill. putting 300 residents out of work and sending an economic shockwave through the community that impacted the city. the school district. the hospital district. and literally every resident in the area. Yet. since that time. Winchester Bay. OR has adopted a \"never give up\" attitude. changed its long term outlook. and focused its efforts on developing a thriving tourist industry. The bill I introduce today directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey approximately 68.5 acres from the Bureau of Land Management. BLM. in Douglas County. OR. to Douglas County to be managed for open space and for recreational purposes. The acreage is located just west of tourist and recreational area developments already owned and run by Douglas County. The County will use the land to provide a staging area for offhighway vehicles. thereby improving management of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The land transfer also facilitates the policing of unlawful camping and parking along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas. This land transfer will improve tourism on Oregons economically challenged South Coast. as well as improve public safety and reduce traffic congestion along Salmon Harbor Drive. This legislation is supported by the entire Oregon delegation. It is also supported by the BLM. Douglas County Commissioners. and the community of Winchester Bay. An identical bill was introduced in the last Congress by Representative DEFAZIO. though the 107th Congress ended before both houses could pass it. Representative DEFAZIO reintroduced this land transfer legislation in the 108th Congress. H.R. 514. in the House of Representatives. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am very pleased to introduce a bill that will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in eastern New Mexico develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System (ENMRWS). A companion to this bill. S. 2513. was introduced in the Senate by my colleague Senator BINGAMAN on June 9. 2004. There has long been a recognized need for a reliable and safe supply of potable water for this region. After years of drought and ever increasing population growth. this water supply project is now absolutely critical for the continued economic wellbeing of Curry. Roosevelt and Quay counties in eastern New Mexico. The Entrada and the Southern High Plains. or Ogallala. Aquifers currently provide 100 percent of the municipal and industrial water supplies and the vast majority of agricultural water for communities in these east central New Mexico counties. However. both the quantity and quality of these groundwater reserves have declined severely in recent decades. Despite voluntary conservation efforts and improvements in agricultural wateruse efficiencies. these groundwater supplies will not sustain current use levels in as little as 12 years and may be funcationally depleted within 25 years. The water supply project that would be authorized by this legislation builds upon more than 40 years of research. planning. and design. In 1959. after recognizing the water supply problems in eastern New Mexico. the New Mexico Legislature and Interstate Stream passed an Act authorizing the State Engineer to construct a dam on the Canadian River. thus establishing the Ute Resevoir. Since 1966. numerous Congressionallyauthorized studies addressed the feasibility of a project that would utilize the Ute Resevoir as a reliable water supply for communities in eastern New Mexico. Finally. in the late 1990s. several communities. concerned about the increasingly urgent need. came together to begin planning for the development of a regional water system. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Authority. consisting of nine communities in the Curry. Roosevelt and Quay counties of eastem New Mexico. was formed in 2001 to oversee the development of the ENMRWS. This Authority has expeditiously and effectively finalized the studies and planning necessary to move forward with this project.",

It was a crime against them. a crime against equality. and a crime against freedom. As we remember the killings of James Chaney. Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner during the 1964 Freedom Summer in Mississippi. Id like to take the opportunity to share with you the statements of that community today in 2004. These statements represent a call by community leaders. a triracial commission of blacks. whites. and Choctaws. and city and county elected officials to seek justice and forgiveness for these crimes of the past. Like the rest of the country. Mississippi still has much work to do concerning racial reconciliation. but I believe we have come further and are more committed to racial harmony than many other states.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a House resolution supporting the goals and ideas of the National Time Out Day. which the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) and over 50 other health care organizations are celebrating on June 23. 2004 to promote the adoption of a new protocol for preventing medical errors in the operating room. The number of individuals who are affected by medical errors is astounding. In 2000. the Institute of Medicine released a report entitled \"To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.\" The report revealed that between 44.000 and 98.000 hospitalized people in the U.S. die each year due to medical errors. and thousands of others suffer injury or illness as a result of preventable errors. To address this problem. the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has developed a universal protocol which calls for surgical teams to call a \"time out\" before surgeries begin in order to verify the patients identity. the procedure to be performed. and the site of the procedure. The Joint Commission is requiring nurses. surgeons and hospitals throughout the country to adopt this protocol beginning July 1. 2004. in order to curb the alarming number of deaths and injuries due to medical errors. AORN has created an Internet website and distributed 55.000 tool kits to healthcare professionals to help them implement the universal protocol. and they are celebrating National Time Out Day on June 23 to promote the protocol and its adoption. National Time Out Day has been endorsed by a distinguished group of healthcare organizations. including the American College of Surgeons. the American Society of Anesthesiologists. the American Hospital Association. and the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management. Mr. Speaker. ultimately. this issue is about health care access and patient safety. Fewer medical errors will result in better outcomes for patients. fewer medical malpractice suits. which in turn will help keep malpractice insurance rates and health care premiums down. I think it is important for Congress to recognize and congratulate perioperative nurses and representatives of surgical teams for working together to reduce medical errors and to ensure the improved health and safety of surgical patientsand that is the purpose of this resolution.",

On tomorrows date 139 years ago. at the end of the Civil War. Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston. Texas. to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and ensure that all slaves across the South were set free. General Grangers order declared that \"an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves. and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.\" Upon hearing this news. the celebration began in the streets of Galveston and has spread through the years into a worldwide celebration commemorating AfricanAmerican freedom. In 1865. AfricanAmericans began a long struggle to gain equal rights with other citizens. More than 100 years later. courageous men and women were still fighting for the civil rights of African Americans. The celebration of Juneteenth acknowledges the price. history. culture and freedom of part of our American society and helps to unify the Nation as a whole. AfricnAmericans have played an important role throughout Americas history. and we should all be grateful for their many contributions to our society. The celebration of Juneteenth that has spread throughout this nation in these 139 years observes the momentous occasions in AfricanAmerican history and the history of the United States. Each year. the Juneteenth celebration grows bigger and spreads farther than the year before. and I hope these events continue to broaden in the years to come.

To commemorate their homegrown heroes. several citizens made the decision to gather as much information as possible about Bent County residents who served in the war. The 10 members of the WWII Memorial Committee have created a book to preserve the veterans stories. On May 29. 2004 the book was displayed at the WWII Recognition Program at the old Bent County High School. The book not only contains personal stories and experiences of these veterans. but it also contains two pictures of each veteran. and information on where each veteran was stationed during the war. Other information that was entered included medals and honors veterans received during their time of service. The committee has found approximately 400 of the 1.200 veterans. and they have received responses from at least 300. Aside from desperately seeking the information needed from the remainder of the veterans they are also collecting memorabilia including uniforms. military records. and cookbooks. The committee knows that this is an ongoing project. and the book and collection will eventually be displayed in the future John W. Rawlings Museum.

Formed in 1939. the North Jersey Philharmonic Glee Club is one of the oldest all male singing groups in the MidAtlantic States. The group performs a wide variety of music. but maintains a focus on African American and European Classical music for the majority of its repertoire. The groups performances reach audiences throughout New Jersey in schools. colleges and universities. churches. nursing homes. hospitals. health centers. community centers. and countless other venues where people gather to enjoy the rich culture of our State. During the PostWorld War II era. the Glee Club regularly performed on WNJR radio. and in one of its more memorable performances of that period. the chorus shared the stage with the great Paul Robeson.

I will listen to their stories and concerns. and I will share my commitment to them to respect and honor the sacrifices their loved ones are making. It is in this spirit that I commit to working with my colleagues to adequately acknowledge what is owed to our veterans and to provide it to them both today and in the decades to come.",

Enduring and selfeffacing. this entrepreneurial genius and civic leader. who used to like to call himself \"just a ditch digger from Ann Arbor.\" was a truly unique character. He had a massive toy collection. He created a reproduction of a 19th century hardware store in his office. And most of all. he liked to wear some of the most outrageous seersucker suits and bow ties that you would ever see. at least back home in Michigan. Bob was probably one of the people in life that you would meet that you could not but befriend. I would like to extend my condolences to his family and to all who. in knowing Bob Lyons. could not but love him.",

With the Medicare bill. taxpayers will give HMOs an additional $46 billion and they will give the pharmaceutical industry an additional $139 billion. Where else in America can you invest $141 million and get a $185 billion return on your money? The GOP Congress. but of course. By overpaying private insurance companies. denying the Secretary of Health and Human Services the ability to negotiate for lower prices and blocking the free market from working and allowing Americans to get safe. affordable drugs from Canada and Europe. the Medicare bill is everything the HMOs and pharmaceutical companies paid for and requested. We are doing everything we can in this bill except the things that will actually lower prescription drug prices. Yesterday the Bush administration announced that they will provide drug coverage to patients with some serious diseases. less than 10 percent of them though. They will decide which seriously ill individuals will get their Medicare coverage now by the lottery. There are 600.000 people eligible for medical coverage. but we are denying this coverage to 90 percent of them. cancer patients. people with multiple sclerosis. and arthritis. We can do better in lowering the prices of drugs than by lottery.",

I do not support the rule because it does nothing to help Californians who have been bilked out of at least a billion dollars by Enron. It is unbelievable to me that the California members on the Committee on Rules would not make this issue that is so important to California part of todays debate. During the 2001 energy crisis. Californians begged the President for relief. but the President did nothing. Each week. $50 million was drained from the pockets of Californians by Texasbased energy producers. The President actually called this supply and demand. Californians. however. called it highway robbery. As it turns out. while this was happening. Enron traders were laughing about sticking it to Gramma Millie in California. It has taken a small utility in Washington State to do what this administration has refused to do: Bring to light the callous manipulation that harmed millions of Californians and West Coasters. Enron fleeced more than $1.1 billion from consumers while literally laughing all of the way to the bank. And even with the evidence brought out by the Enron tapes. the leadership of this House once again leaves millions of California consumers in the dark. I guess they want to hide what they have done to help Enron behind closed doors. much like the Bush administration has been working in the shadows with its energy plan for the Nation. Maybe they will not be happy until they have turned out the lights on all Americans. This bill does nothing to help California and the other western States get their retribution.",

But I do object to the rule because it is long past time to begin to rectify this massive theft that went on. Every day. today every Oregonian. every residential ratepayer. every business will pay. on average. 42 percent more for the electrons purchased from the same plants transmitted over the same electric lines as 4 years ago. Just one thing happened in between. That is the Bush administration. the Bush FERC and Kenny Boy Enron Lay. the Presidents previous largest single contributor until this year. The Snohomish utility found that on 473 of 537 days. Enron manipulated the market. How can the Bush FERC say that is just and reasonable and not require that those illegal contracts achieved through market manipulation be voided? We do not know because they will not release the documents. They do not want people to know how involved Enron was in setting the national energy policy. In the year before the Bush administration released their energy policy. Enron officials met with members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and their staff on 272 occasions during one work year. That means on every day there was an Enron official in the FERC offices. Were they also in Vice President CHENEYS office? We do not know because he is fighting release of those records. We need these illegal contracts to be voided. and we need all of the documentation released about this massive market manipulation. This is continuing to cast a pall over the economy of the Pacific Northwest. We have some of the worst unemployment in the country over the last few years. and a good part is because billions of dollars have been illegally extracted from our ratepayers by the Texasbased Enron company with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission appointed by President Bush standing by complicit. compliant and silent.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this rule on behalf of ratepayers in the West who depended on the Eshoo amendment being made in order. Time and time again. members of the California. Oregon and Washington delegations have attempted to get this House to focus on the damage caused in the western electricity crisis a few years back. We have been trying to get the House to do something to return the money stolen from my constituents and millions of others. The electricity market manipulation that went on was shameful. It was surpassed. perhaps. only by the actions or rather inaction of the FERC and this Congress. Literally billions of dollars were stolen from consumers and taxpayers by pirate firms like Enron. Recently. we were all treated to a frontrow seat to the carnage demonstrated in tapes of Enron traders figuring out how best to create shortages. to drive up prices. and rip off consumers. It was sickening. But. in reality. there was nothing new in those tapes. It was just more evidence of what I and many in our delegation have been requesting for over 3 years. Enron and other power companies were shutting down power plants. diverting electricity. and engaging in illegal actions in order to drive up electricity prices. The amendment brought before the Rules Committee by the gentlewoman from California would be a great step in bringing some justice here. It would open up all the records at FERC on these cases of price fixing and market manipulation. It would force FERC to let States participate in the settlement negotiations. and it would make some key changes in the Power Act to enable full refunds to these western States. The Committee on Rules should have made it in order and the House should have adopted it. but that would be breaking the practice of this House and this administration in doing nothing in response to one of the great hijackings in American history.

It would be a better bill if we put an amendment in there. but the Committee on Rules has not allowed that amendment. and that is wrong. It is really wrong because this is the only place where we can address that issue. The administration should address it. They have been silent. They sit by and allow FERC to continue to do nothing. FERC is a regulatory agency. This is where the consumers can go to get some protection. That is the only agency in the Federal Government that can do anything about it. and when they do not act. we have nowhere to turn. This is an agency that ought to have money withheld from it until it answers the questions. That is something that we do in the legislative process all the time. And since the administration has failed to hold them accountable. Congress should. We are asleep at the switch.

My understanding further is that these actions are in direct and total defiance of the Congress on this issue. They directly violate specific bill language in the fiscal 2004 bill which prohibited such transfers without the prior approval of both of the appropriation committees in the Senate and the House. Mr. Chairman. if the gentleman insists on pursuing his point of order. the only practical effect will be that the Congress has declined to take any disciplinary action whatsoever against the agency after the agency has determined that it is acceptable to expend taxpayers money in defiance of the law. I regret very much that the gentleman seeks to eliminate this language. If he does. there is not much that I can do about it. but I think it is a shame indeed when the Congress of the United States will not insist that an agency expends money only in compliance with the law.",

This competitive USDA/HSI grant program is designed to promote and strengthen the ability of HSIs to carry out education programs that attract. retain. and graduate outstanding students capable of enhancing the nations food and agricultural scientific and professional work force. Funded grants have supported projects in the fields of nutrition and dietetics. aquaculture. agribusiness technology. food and beverage export and intemational trade. food and agricultural marketing and management. integrated resources management. food science technology engineering. plant science environmental science and veterinary science and technology. Although Title VIII of the Farm Bill authorizes $20 million for HSIs. actual appropriations remain at 20 percent of the minimally authorized level. Only 2.7 percent of Hispanic college graduates earn a degree in agriculturerelated areas. The continued underrepresentation of Hispanics in these important areas demands a greater investment in such programs to expand funding to additional HSls to better meet USDA goals. This amendment would increase funding for HSis to $7.1 million. It is a smart investment and a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on this amendment.",

I rise today to offer my strong support for this weeks campaign. \"Uniting Our Voices: Speaking Together to Speak Out.\" against domestic violence sponsored by Lifetime Television and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in coordination with the Congressional Caucus on Womens Issues. I would like to commend these organizations for their hard work and continued efforts to raise awareness of domestic violence issues. Domestic violence is a serious problem in this country. Nearly one third of American women (31 percent) report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives. In my home state of California. it is reported that almost 6 percent of Californias women suffer physical injuries as a result of domestic violence every year. In 2001. there were more than 52.000 domestic violence arrests. and law enforcement received 198.000 domestic violence calls. Although domestic violence has traditionally been considered a problem primarily afflicting women. it does not just affect women and is not just a \"womens issue.\" It affects men. women and children. it affects American families and our communities. Each year. an estimated 3.3 million children are exposed to violence in their homes. and statistics provided by the Department of Justice show that a childs exposure to domestic violence is one of the strongest factors in transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next. increasing the likelihood of that that child will commit a violent act. continuing the cycle of violence. Domestic violence is a problem that Americans must confront headon in order to stop the cycle of violence occurring within our communities and throughout our country. I support the Violence Against Women Act. it is an important bill whose effects have been farreaching in all aspects of helping victims of domestic violence. but there is still much more to be done. We must continue to provide funding to domestic violence programs and work to close the loopholes in existing legislation. VAWA and this weeks campaign against domestic violence are just the first of many steps that must be taken in order to end domestic violence. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to further address issues of domestic violence so that we may work towards developing solutions. both locally and nationally. to end the cycle of violence in our communities and to put a stop to the problem of domestic violence.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. along with my good friend TOM ALLEN. I am introducing the Commercial Truck Highway Safety Demonstration Program Act of 2003. This bill would allow Maine to increase the weight limits for trucks on interstate highways. by granting a threeyear waiver of federal rules. It mandates a study process that will help demonstrate the positive safety effects of these changes. and permit the waiver to be extended pending these safety determinations. This bill is important both for public safety and economic reasons. The administration of the current 80.000 pound federal weight limit law in Maine has forced heavy tractortrailer and tractorsemitrailer combination vehicles. traveling into Maine from neighboring States and Canada. to divert onto small State and local roads where higher vehicle weight limits apply under Maine law. The diversion of those vehicles onto such roads causes significant economic hardships and safety challenges for small communities located along those roads. Permitting heavy commercial vehicles to travel on Interstate System highways in Maine would enhance public safety by reducing the number of heavy vehicles that use town and city streets. and as a result. the number of dangerous interactions between those heavy vehicles and other vehicles such as school buses and private cars. It would also reduce the net highway maintenance costs in Maine because the Interstate System highways. unlike the secondary roads of Maine. are built to accommodate heavy vehicles and are. therefore. more durable. Finally. this bill would ensure that Maine can remain competitive in the transportation and manufacturing sectors. and that our neighbors do not pass us by in development. This change is fair. and will promote parity in transportation throughout New England. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. which will enhance safety. lower maintenance costs. and promote economic development.",

Mr. William Rix. Mr. Hartwell. and Reverend J. W. Conley started Sunday School meetings that were held in various homes. In 1891. an unsightly building formerly used as a pest house was cleaned and renovated. This is where the first Sunday School session was held with George L. Vance acting as Superintendent. In 1895. property was purchased on the southeast corner of Brown and Leach Avenues at a cost of $400. A Chapel was built and dedicated in November 1896. at a total cost of slightly more than $2500 and at that time was nearly debtfree. On March 8. 1903. 32 people met in the chapel and organized themselves into what has since been known as the Ridgewood Baptist Church. During that March. a church covenant was adopted. a baptistry was built and the Piano Baptist Church donated their old church pews. Out of this humble beginning. Ridgewood Baptist Church emerged. The Church has grown in many ways since its humble beginnings. Today. around 300 people attend services at Ridgewood Baptist Church. In 1974. the Church opened its doors to their new school. Ridgewood Baptist Academy. Reverend Albert Baker is the current pastor of the Church. Reverend Bakers vision for the church is to have more land for the sports programs at the school.

I want to first thank my colleagues. Mr. EHLERS and Mr. GILCHREST. for all of the hard work. initiative. and time that they and their staffs have invested in this much needed legislation. My district in Upstate New York is impacted. environmentally. economically. and socially. by the health and future viability of the Great Lakes. I know that New York State is only one of many states that directly feel the negative effects of invasive species. Aquatic invasive species are destroying the environment of the Great Lakes. damaging the Great Lakes fisheries. and costing taxpayers an estimated $138 billion annually. It is important that we set interim standards for balanced water treatment systems so that we can control and see a significant decline in the increasing threat posed by aquatic invasive species to our aquatic ecosystems and natural resources. These two pieces of comprehensive legislation would reduce the introduction of aquatic invasive species from ships and from other pathways through a variety of standards. research. and management programs. They complement one another in a variety of meaningful ways and I am hopeful that this body will be committed to moving these important pieces of legislation through the legislative process so that we. as a Congress. can properly address this problem. Aquatic invasive species is one of many reasons I have long stood in opposition to the Great Lakes Navigation System Review study that was recently funded in the Fiscal Year 2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. If expansion and dredging of the St. Lawrence Seaway were to occur. we would inevitably see the introduction of and exponential increase of aquatic invasive species. The reasons I voice my support today of the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act and the Aquatic Invasive Species Research are consistent and unwavering with the stand I have taken long before today on this incredibly important issue. I am committed to the discovery of methods. and to fully funding those methods. that would work to decrease. and I hope. one day. eradicate. invasive species of all kinds in the waters of our region.",

Caesar Clark could not continue in school past the seventh grade because his help was too valuable to the family farm. He ultimately educated himself during his teenage years and earned admittance to Bishop College from which he graduated in 1946. In 1950. he became pastor at Good Street Baptist. While his professional focus has always been squarely on the valued worshippers at Good Street Baptist. Dr. Clark is also an involved community leader who continues to enjoy membership on the Boy Scouts of America Advisory Committee and the Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce. In addition.

Senator MIKE DEWINE. to introduce legislation designed to prevent our nations children and youth from succumbing to the dangers associated with underage alcohol use. The legislation that we introduce today. the STOP (Sober Truth On Preventing) Underage Drinking Act. will greatly strengthen our Nations ability to combat the too often deadly consequences associated with underage drinking. An initial examination of the problems presented by underage drinking is truly alarming. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug among Americas youth. More young people drink alcohol than smoke tobacco or use marijuana combined. In 2002. 20 percent of eighth graders had drunk alcohol in the previous 30 days. Fortynine percent of high school seniors are drinkers. and 29 percent report having had five or more drinks in a row. or binged in the past 2 weeks. Tragically. we know that this year underage drinking will directly lead to more than 3.500 deaths. more than two million injuries. 1.200 babies born with fetal alcohol syndrome and more than 50.000 youths treated for alcohol dependence. We also know that the social costs associated with underage drinking total close to $53 billion annually. including $19 billion from automobile accidents and $29 billion from associated violent crime. And while no one can argue with the tragic loss of life and significant financial costs associated with underage drinking. too few of us think of the equally devastating loss of potential that occurs when our children begin to drink. Research indicates that children who begin drinking do so at only 12 years of age. We also know that children that begin drinking at such an early age develop a predisposition for alcohol dependence later in life. Such early experimentation can have devastating consequences and derail a childs potential just as she or he is starting out on the path to adulthood. The consumption of alcohol by our children can literally rob them of their future. The truly alarming and devastating effects of underage alcohol use are what initially led Senator DEWINE and I to begin work to address this important issue. Over the last few months we have worked extensively with Representatives ROYBALALLARD. WOLF. DELAURO. OSBOURNE and WAMP to craft the broad legislative initiative that we introduce today.",

However. more than 5.500 workers die while at work annually. This means that. on any given day. 15 workers will not return home to their families. The fact that these accidents are occurring is not because employers dont care about workplace safety. On the contrary. the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. or OSHA. estimated that 95 percent of employers are striving to create a safer workplace. The vast majority of employers want to comply with safety laws. Therefore. any effort to significantly improve workplace safety by focusing solely on the small percentage of bad actors who willfully break the law is doomed to failure. We dont need political rhetoric. we need workable solutions. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment. Safety and Training. I felt responsible for finding a solution that will succeed in protecting more workers from harm. I feel a responsibility to every worker and every workers family to do all I can to prevent workplace accidents and deaths. The SAFE Act will provide the systematic safety improvements that American workers and their families deserve. This legislation helps the vast majority of good faith employers who want to achieve compliance with safety laws. They just need help doing somore help than OSHA can currently give them. The SAFE Act also allows OSHA to effectively target the few bad actors who willfully place their employees at risk. It also includes provisions to improve hazard communication and reduce injuries and illnesses caused by the presence of hazardous chemicals in the workplace.",

Increasing the maximum jail sentence for bad actors will do nothing to help improve the workplace safety records of the 95 percent of employers who want to do the right thing. I want to prevent the accident in the first place. not just penalize the employer for an injury or death that could have been avoided. By then. its too late for the victim and their family. We need a system that encourages the good faith employers to find out how to achieve safety voluntarily and without fear of retribution.

It would authorize $300 million to respond to the unfolding catastrophe in Darfur for the next fiscal year and to provide additional funds to begin reconstruction in Sudan upon the conclusion of a viable. comprehensive peace. Events in Darfur constitute a moral and humanitarian tragedy of incredible proportions. The people of the Darfur region of Sudan are experiencing the full force of an ethnic cleansing campaign by the Government of Sudan. Numerous credible reports by U.S. and U.N. officials indicate that the Sudanese Government has armed and employed a militia of Arab Sudanese. called Janjaweed. to join it in a coordinated effort to kill and rape Darfur inhabitants and systematically destroy homes. villages. and all means of subsistence. This campaign has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 1.2 million African Sudanese of which 200.000 are now refugees in Chad. A second phase of this campaign may prove to have the most devastating effect through the onset of famine and diseaseunless. the international community responds quickly. The United Nations is meeting significant obstacles to providing lifesaving food. medicine. and shelter to the displaced Sudanese. The Sudanese Government has established bureaucratic and administrative obstacles to the provision of assistance. In addition. the international community has not provided adequate resources given the magnitude of the human suffering in Darfur.

One of those flawsand it was something I pointed out during the Senate debate and offered an amendment to fixis known as the coverage gap. Heres how it works: Seniors will have a monthly premium and a $250 deductible and then they pay 25 percent of their prescription drug costs. So far so good. But then once they have drug costs of over $2.250. the benefit stops. it shuts down. And seniors have to pay the next $2.850 of drug costs on their own100 percent of their costsbefore their coverage starts again. Does this sound like prescription drug coverage to you? I know that my insurance has no such thing. and I know of no other insurance that has such a policy. So today. Senator MIKULSKI and I are introducing a bill that closes this coverage gap and will better fulfill our promise to seniors to provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. Under our billthe Closing the Coverage Gap Act of 2004seniors will pay the premium and the $250 deductible and then pay for 25 percent of their coverage until they reach their catastrophic limit of $5.100. After that. Medicare will pay 95 percent. Let me give you an example of how this works. A constituent from San Marcos. California wrote me about her prescription drug costs. They exceed $10.000 a year. In 2006. she will be helped by the new law. but will still end up paying nearly $4.000 for her prescriptions.

All flight attendants should be trained and ready to respond to these types of incidents. As part of the Department of Homeland Security legislation in 2002. we passed strong flight attendant security training. which I helped write with former Senator Bob Smith. Unfortunately. last year. much of that was repealedat the insistence of a single member of the Housein the FAA Reauthorization bill. Therefore. I am introducing legislation today that would reinstate the flight attendant security training included in the Homeland Security bill. The bill would restore the law requiring uniform antiterrorist training for all flight attendants. We took a great step forward in 2002. We should not have gone backwards to create a loophole in our aviation security. We cannot stop fighting terrorism. Welltrained flight attendants are key. We do not have enough air marshals on planes. and the Administration is slowwalking the guns in the cockpit program. We need to rely on our flight attendants now more than ever. We must ensure they get the training they need. By Mr. DODD (for himself. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. DURBIN. and Mr.",

H.R. 1 asks every Member a fundamental question. what do you want Medicare to be? If you want Medicare coverage that is guaranteed. dependable. universal and fair. you will vote against H.R. 1. If you want Medicare to cover every senior everywhere. you will vote against H.R. 1. If you want Medicare to offer the same coverage to seniors on Park Avenue as seniors in Appalachian. Ohio. you will vote against H.R. 1. But Mr. Speaker. if you want Medicare to offer unreliable. selective. discriminatory coverage. you will support H.R. 1. If you want Medicare to offer seniors in Appalachian. Ohio. less coverage than seniors on Park Avenue or no coverage at all. you will vote for H.R. 1. If you want Medicare to offer rural seniors coverage. but at three or four times the price. then you will vote for H.R. 1. If you want a plan written by the drug companies and by the insurance companies because of their huge contributions to the Republican Party. if you want that. then you will vote for H.R. 1. and if you want a bill that will force people who now have prescription drug coverage. a bill that will force seniors who now have prescription drug coverage to drop that coverage. then you will vote for H.R. 1. The gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Michigan will offer a substitute amendment with a different version of Medicare. The RangelDingell substitute strengthens Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit. no unaffordable cost sharing. no gaps in coverage. The RangelDingell substitute would maintain Medicares guaranteed coverage. remaining faithful to the trust Medicare has earned from Americas seniors. The RangelDingell substitute harnesses seniors purchasing power to demand better prices from the drug industry. My friend from Kentucky had it all wrong when he said the Republican plan does that. The Republican plan. because it was written by the drug companies. does nothing to bring prices down. Vote \"no\" on the rule. Vote \"no\" on H.R. 1. Vote \"yes\" on the RangelDingell substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I support this bipartisan. Republicanled. legendary. historic event that we are participating in here today. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to comment Chairman THOMAS. Chairman TAUZIN. and the House Republican leadership for their work on H.R. 1. This landmark legislation will provide Americas seniors with a lifetime prescription drug benefit through Medicare. This new benefit will mean permanent prescription drug access. lower drug costs and a limit on catastrophic drug expenses for all beneficiaries. I am especially pleased to see that this bill enacts meaningful Medicare reforms that specifically affect California and my constituents in the 49th Congressional District. H.R. 1 includes language that allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate plans that serve special needs beneficiaries as Specialized Medicare Advantage plans. This provision enhances the development of more effective approaches to chronic illness care by providing an opportunity for additional frail elderly demonstrations to move into mainstream Medicare. One example of this type of demonstration is the SCAN program. which currently serves over 50.000 Southern Californians--including 10.000 who live inside the 49th Congressional District. I also want to thank leadership for their work to ensure stable funding in the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) program. H.R. 1 provides all states with a one time 20% increase in their DSH allotments. This 20% increase means an additional $184 million in Fiscal Year 2004 for Californias safety net hospitals. This additional funding will help ensure that services to the most vulnerable populations remain available. I believe that we must bring Medicare into the 21st century and that no American should be denied needed prescription drugs because he or she cannot afford them. I recognize that the lack of a prescription drug benefit for our seniors signifies the fact that Medicare has fallen behind the times. H.R. 1 is the best prescription drug benefit plan for America and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.",

I want to speak about a provision in the bill that still cuts. even with yesterdays revisions. hundreds of millions of dollars for cancer care. A cut like this will be devastating to seniors with cancer. If this bill is passed. cancer centers will close. especially satellite centers that are located close to where seniors live. Those that remain open will admit fewer patients and lay off oncology nurses. Medicare beneficiaries do pay too much for their oncology medications. We all agree that we must fix this. but Medicare also pays way too little for essential oncology services. The overpayments for oncology drugs has been used to pay for treatments oncologists provide to cancer patients. So we must fix both parts of this problem. The bill fixes overpayment of drugs. but still cuts some $300 million from cancer care to do it. The quality of cancer care will suffer. The gentleman from Georgia and I submitted amendments last night to fix both parts of this problem and protect the quality of cancer care for all Americans. but these amendments were not made in order. and now seniors will not only not get sufficient prescription drug coverage but those with cancer. seniors with cancer. will see their treatments jeopardized. thwarted. cut off.

As a result. Members are denied the opportunity to address many disturbing provisions in this bill. To mention just a few. the failure to address the rapidly rising cost of prescription drugs that will soon render this benefit meaningless. the tremendous gaps in coverage that will result in less help for those who need it most. and the provisions that fundamentally alter the structure and entitlement of Medicare by requiring the program to compete with private plans beginning in Mr. Speaker. the list of Members concerns with this bill goes on and on and on.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. We have heard a lot about the new benefits and protections that will be afforded by this bill. Unfortunately. most of the benefits and protections will not go to seniors in need. they will go to the pharmaceutical and the insurance industry. This bill will do a good job of protecting the monopoly profits and price gouging by the pharmaceutical industry. Perhaps the gentleman from Kentucky has not read or at least he doesnt understand the bill. Section 1801 prohibits the Federal Government. Medicare. from negotiating lower prices from the pharmaceutical industry. a provision inserted at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry to protect their profits. The VA negotiates very successfully. and that would lower the cost of drugs much more than the puny benefits in this bill at a cost of $400 billion. But. no. that is prohibited in this legislation. The bill does not allow the reimportation of U.S. manufactured drugs from Canada because that would provide a greater benefit than the puny benefits in this bill. Here are three drugs: Tamoxifen. If we could just reimport. if Americans could just buy the drug by mail from Canada. they would save 90 percent. But a couple with a $4.500 a year drug bill will get a 22 percent benefit under this legislation. For Vioxx. for arthritis. 52 percent if you could just buy it in Canada and bring it back into this country. Under this bill. a 22 percent reduction for seniors who pay $4.500 a year for drugs. And then Xalatan. for glaucoma. a little closer. 33 percent from Canada. 22 percent under this bill. So without any cost. without spending $400 billion and without spending a penny. but impinging on the profits of the pharmaceutical industry. we could provide much better benefits by negotiating or allowing reimportation. But it does not stop there. It also benefits the insurance industry. It is going to drive seniors from Medicare into private insurance. provide subsidies to private insurance to provide unspecified benefits at a cost to be determined in the future when those benefits might become available in the year 2006. and they can be withdrawn at any time by those industries. This is not the security our seniors deserve and it is outrageous that this should be offered without any amendments being allowed to this party.",

September 11. when we came together to bind the Nations wounds and provide for the national security of the Nation. Unfortunately. this legislation does not rise to the occasion. It does not deliver an adequate prescription drug benefit or hold down the cost of drugs. What it does do is open the door to the privatization of Medicare. It turns it over to the HMOs. to the private insurance market which has dropped over half of the Medicare enrollees in my State of Connecticut over the last 4 years. And seniors have not forgotten. This bill does nothing to contain costs. It prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from even engaging in negotiations with the drug companies to lower prices. As a result. many seniors will pay more than they do now and their premiums will rise as the cost of drugs rises. Throughout my time in Congress. the single most common concern I have heard from seniors at the local stopandshops where I meet with them every weekend is how expensive their prescription drug bills are. Seniors know that they are being taken advantage of. They know they can get drugs cheaper in Canada and overseas. And when seniors find out that we are doing nothing to hold down the excessive profiteering of the pharmaceutical companies. when they find out that their coverage essentially stops during midsummer while they still have to pay the premiums. they are going to feel betrayed. And they are being betrayed. If we allow this bill to become law. we would be saying that guaranteed health care for our seniors is no longer the obligation or the responsibility of this government. I did not come to the Congress to preside over the dismantling of Medicare. Our social contract with our seniors must be honored. and I urge my colleagues to support a plan that does that and not this Republican sham. Oppose the rule and oppose the bill.",

Number one. health care legislation that works must not be partisan. This bill is almost an entirely Republicanonly bill. That dooms it to failure from the start. Second. real health care reform must not be overly complex. This is one of the most complex bills that seniors could ever imagine facing. The red tape is incredible. And. third. this bill should not be overly burdensome to seniors. but it is. Watch out when your seniors back home realize they have to pay $35 a month for a very questionable benefit. There is a donut hole in coverage. and that is almost too complex to explain in the 2 minutes I am allowed here. but this bill is so inferior to the Dooley bill. which solves these problems in a simple. clear and fair fashion.

It is a lowincome benefit for our seniors. But. most importantly. it is universal in its benefit. Everybody would get it. There would be a minimum of a 25 to 30 percent discount on drugs. One of the biggest debates here is not only a benefit under Medicare of prescription drugs. but it is making the drugs that our elderly need every day when they go to the drugstore or their local pharmacy. making those medications affordable. The benefit accounts for all drug spending. That is the core principle here. It is a universal benefit. So this is the right type of approach. The other day the Washington Post endorsed it.

The same statistics I read before show Presidents back through Jimmy Carter have had each around 10 court of appeals appointments per year. It is a little bit more for the Republican Presidents. a little over 10. and a little under 10 for the Democrats. but there is no real difference. That is why it is very balanced. and we are just coming off two terms of a Democrat President. We are now in one term of a Republican. The next election is probably going to be close. I think that is probably what is working here. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle who are filibustering dont continue to compare apples to oranges. Let us at least be fair. If you want to talk about how many were filibustered. it isnt 4 out of 168. If they follow through on this threat. it will be 12 out of 46. which is about a quarter. That was not a high point. even though that is just about a quarter. That means that only around 75 percent of them are going to be given an upordown vote. My friend from Arkansas and I work on a lot of things together. She is a great Senator. She was saying if her kids brought home 98 percent in math. she would be pretty pleased about it.

She is the officer of the Litigation Section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and a prominent plaintiffs attorney. She probably gave money to my opponent in the last election. Here is what she said: I am a lifelong Democrat. I am also a plaintiffs attorney. My political views are and always have been liberal. I firmly agree with U.S. Supreme Courts opinion In Roe v. Wade. and I trust that the decision will remain viable. I am opposed to the appointment of any judicial nominee who is incapable of ruling based upon a considered and impartial analysis of all the facts and legal issues presented In any matter. Judge Kuhl is not such a nominee and she is welldeservIng of appointment to the Ninth Circuit. That is what Senators would have said 5 years ago on this floor. Dont say it hasnt changed. Anne Egerton. former law partner of Judge Kuhl: I understand some have raised concerns about Judge Kuhls commitment to gender equality and reproductive rights. I dont share those concerns. Anne Egerton goes through her background with the Arizona Womens Political Caucus. I have been a registered Democrat for 30 years. and I have supported [Democratic legIslators]. I have no reservations in recommending Judge Carolyn Kuhl for appointment to the Ninth Circuit. I know her to be committed to the rule of law and the application of governing precedents In the area of reproductive freedom. that precedent. of course. includes Roe v. Wade and the many cases which have applied. I dont think there is anything more to be said. I wish we could get consent to vote on these nominees and then we could go on to other business of the Senate. This is important. What is happening to these people is wrong.

It is a contradiction then to come to the floor and say: We can use the rules of the Senate. We can use these rules and we can deny judges. but if the Democrats choose to use the rules of the Senate to challenge a judicial nominee of the President. Bush or otherwise. that represents a violation of the Constitution. That is my point. The point is borne out regardless of the residue of judges of either administration.

The punch line. as funny as it may sound. is $80 billion. is what we are being told by our colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle that it takes to correct the $3.5 billion omission: $80 billion. And if it is not a joke. then it is either a very smart. some might say sneaky. others might say sinister. ploy. to try to sneak in all of these other tax cuts for very wealthy American families into what is a good package for working families. and a lot of our men and women who work in uniform who were left out by this House in the tax cuts under the child tax credit.

Either it is a real joke on the American people. or it is a very cleverly planned. intentional way of sneaking through $76.5 billion of additional tax cuts that have nothing to do with the working families that we are trying to help. Now. it would not be so sinister or such a joke if it were not for the fact that our Federal Government is running a $400 billion deficit this year. and next year. we are being told by the White House and by our own congressional budget estimators that we will probably have about a $500 billion deficit next year.

They raised it $100 billion in a month. So $400 billion at 4 percent is an additional $16 billion next year just to pay the interest on the operation of this government that has lasted over 200 years. They sit here and they talk about spending. We are spending this country silly. and they are doing it by borrowing money that we have to pay interest on every year from now on. Last year we paid or accrued $336 billion in interest. for which nobody gets a job. nobody gets an aircraft carrier. nobody gets health care. nobody gets an education. It is gone. It is payment on past consumption that we either did not have the courage to ask people to pay for. or we did not have the guts to cut the programs that need cutting. Members want to talk about spending. let us talk about it. Here is $30 billion right now that we can save if Members want to accept what we have done with the motion to recommit.",

It is an impressive feat just to win one state title. but winning two in three years is a real testament to preparation. character. and purpose. I think it also demonstrates the spirit of determination and hard work that has always distinguished Arkansans. As a concerned parent. I understand even more that paramount among my duties as a U.S. Congressman is to provide the necessary resources to our students. teachers. and schools that will enable our young men and women to excel and succeed in all their endeavors. Educating the next generation is an important issue not only in the classroom. and the halls of Congress. but also around our kitchen tables at home. I have long been an advocate of athletics and extracurricular activities as a supplement to academic excellence for their ability to instill leadership. character. and perseverance. Activity outside the classroom instills a habit of serving the community. preparing them to take leadership roles and eventually shape the larger world around them. Championships are won in the heart as much as on the field. The will to overcome adversity. the daily drive to succeed. and the mental toughness to perform under pressure carried the young men during their championship season. and will provide them with a well to draw from throughout their entire lives. That is why it brings me so much pleasure to again congratulate the Warren High School football program on winning the AAA Boys High School Football Championship: It is evidence of a culture of excellence and hard work among the student body. coaching staff. Warren High School faculty. and the community. We can all take great pride in the accomplishments of this team. and how they achieved their goals. I am proud of you.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I just want to explain how this bill helps HMOs and hurts those patients that are victims of HMOs. Many of us for the last 4 years on a bipartisan basis tried to push a patients bill of rights that basically would say that if you are denied care by your HMO. you can go to an outside maybe administrative agency and then finally can go to court and sue because of the denial of care and what the consequences of that were and actually get damages from a jury or a judge. This bill would kill that. In many States. as well as in some Federal courts right now. patients have been given the right to sue an HMO. which is exactly what we were trying to do here in Congress when we supported a patients bill of rights. But this bill says. no. you are not going to be able to do that anymore because it limits your ability to recover noneconomic damages as well as punitive damages against an HMO or another private insurance company. I think there is a great deal of hypocrisy here. There are Members on the Republican side of the aisle that have said for years that they want to expand victims rights if they have been denied care or hurt in some way by an HMO. but they turn around today and they pass this bill which they are going to pass which basically limits those victims and their ability to sue an HMO even though the State courts and even though a lot of the Federal courts are now expanding victims rights to sue. What we are doing here is preempting the State law. If a State says. as mine in New Jersey says. that you can sue an HMO. this bill comes in and says. well. you can do it only under very limited circumstances. You cannot come here and say that you care about the victims. You do not care about the victims not only because you are putting a cap on them of $250.000 but you are not even going to let them sue the HMO in a fair way.",

I believe that the sensible reforms contained in this bill will go a long way toward alleviating the medical liability insurance crisis many States are facing and will also help prevent future crises from occurring. On Tuesday of last week. the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. which I chair. approved H.R. 5. which was subsequently approved by the full committee on Thursday. In both cases. approval was by voice vote. The severity of the current crisis has necessitated that we act now. I would note that our committee has held numerous hearings over the past year to explore this issue and consider potential solutions. That is why I continue to be disappointed with the rhetoric surrounding this debate. As chairman. I had wanted to focus a good deal of our last subcommittee hearing on how the insurance industry sets medical liability insurance premiums. In fact. the majority invited both the American Academy of Actuaries and the Physician Insurers Association of America to come testify at our hearing. Unfortunately. in spite of all the rhetoric on insurance. unfortunately the minority did not invite any insurance witnesses. Instead. they once again played politics. including inviting a witness to discuss something called Proposition 103. which he claimed is the real reason why California has been largely insulated from the current crisis. That struck me as somewhat odd. considering that the organizations working to defeat H.R. 5 never mentioned this ballot initiative during our debate on H.R. 4600 in the last Congress. even though this initiative passed in 1988. What this tells me is that many people would rather play politics than work towards a real solution. I respect that some Members may feel that it is never appropriate to place any limit on subjective. unquantifiable. noneconomic damages regardless of the cost to the health care system. However. I do not respect those who will do or say anything to derail this process. I am voting for this bill because by doing so I am moving us one step closer to a solution.

It is a crisis. and they need some immediate relief. Unfortunately. the bill we have before us today will do nothing to give any doctor in my State any immediate relief. It will not do a single thing to reduce frivolous lawsuits. There is nothing in this bill that will reduce frivolous lawsuits. So. Mr. Speaker. what should we do to address this situation? In Pennsylvania. we have just recently last year passed three laws that I believe are going a long way to address the problem. Number one. Pennsylvania has prohibited venue shopping for oversympathetic jury pools. We have established tough sanctions against lawyers who filed frivolous suits. We have reformed joint and several liability provisions to ensure all liable parties are truly responsible for their fair share of the judgment. We have established strict new standards for expert witnesses. We have allowed courts to reduce verdict amounts if the award will adversely impact access to health care. We have imposed a 7year statute of limitations on filing of claims. and we have required insurers to offer patients safety discounts to medical facilities with good track records. These are the types of reforms that will help deal with the situation. Putting a $250.000 cap on noneconomic damages disproportionately hurts poor people. These damage awards. they are not the cause of the problem. Twothirds of patients who file claims receive nothing. Only 7 percent of these cases go to court. Let us not cap damages on people who can least afford it. Let us let States like Pennsylvania enact meaningful reforms like we have already done.",

If you add up all the malpractice premiums in this country. they represent onehalf of 1 percent of the $1.4 trillion we spent on health care last year. Now. some States have problems. Maine does not impose caps on noneconomic damages. yet we have comparatively low insurance premiums. Maine has a mandatory prelitigation screening panel for every medical malpractice case. The panel consists of one attorney. one doctor and one retired judge. This panel process weeds out the frivolous lawsuits and encourages legitimate cases to come to a fairly quick resolution. Sixteen other States have similar screening panels. States with screening panels should be exempt from the cap on noneconomic damages. There is no reason to impose this law on States which have figured out how to deal with this problem on their own. But this bill imposes a onesizefitsall Federal rule in a traditional area of State jurisdiction. And this bill does something else. This bill sticks individual plaintiffs. particularly those who are children or unemployed or elderly. with perhaps a huge lifetime cost because of severe injuries. instead of sharing those costs through our insurance system. So. once again. the Republican majority is basically saying it is better to stick the loss on those who suffer it than to share that loss broadly through insurance. A $250.000 cap does not mean $250.000 will ever go to a plaintiff. because they always have expenses and attorneys fees and all of that. It seems to me that this cap is unbelievably low. it is imposed arbitrarily on States which have figured out another way to deal with this problem. it is bad policy. and I urge my colleagues to vote down H.R.",

If you were on a jury. you just might feel they deserve more than $250.000 for the pain and suffering they have suffered and will suffer. H.R. 5 would take that right away from you and other citizens. \"On May 19. 2000.\" writes my constituent. \"I went for an outpatient surgery. During the surgery. the oxygen ignited. unbeknownst to the surgeon. the anesthesiologist and three to four other highlytrained medical personnel in the room. While the surgery continued. my entire face was burned. \"After a year of failed treatment to deal with the scarring. essentially I lost my entire upper lip. the front of my nose. the floor of the nose and immediate interior of my nose. I was referred to a specialist in Boston for reconstructive treatment. For these past three years I have been in a mask covering my face and I have nasal tubes to stent open my nose for 23 hours a day. With my mask on. I can only drink through a straw. My breathing was entirely cut off for almost 2 years. and is still not stable due to the scarring inside my nose. I have to travel to Boston monthly. I have been through eight surgeries and have two to four more pending. plus oral surgery and orthodontics. \"My claim is not frivolous. in spite of the rhetoric of the medical insurance and political spokespersons favoring legislation to cap awards for pain and suffering at $250.000. \"Legislation to cap damages fundamentally punishes again the victims of these horrendous medical mistakes. It is astonishing that federally proposed legislation would first target the victims of these errors before addressing the errors themselves.\" The other one is from a grieving father of Rabbi Josef Yitzchak Lefkowitz. 28yearsold. who went into the hospital for an adjustment to his bite. In the recovery. the breathing tube fell out of his nose. but his jaw was wired shut and they could not find wire cutters to open his mouth. He died an agonizing and painful death. These are not lottery winners. These are not people who won the jackpot. They deserve better than H.R. 5.",

But I heard earlier from the other side that trauma centers are closing. and they are closing in Los Angeles. But it is not because of frivolous lawsuits. it is because we have not provided adequate reimbursement for Medicaid for those poor hospitals. That is why. and we are not even addressing that. I have to say. with all due respect. that the bill will not lower insurance premiums. Caps in California did not lower premiums. Insurance reform did. Proposition 103. and only slightly. because we are still above many other States in the country. We need to bring insurance providers to the table and we need to have that kind of discussion. not one that talks back and forth here on the floor. Caps on noneconomic damages unfairly penalize children. retirees and stayathome moms. And you know why? Because they do not make an income. Mr. Ed Whiddon. a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force. was a victim of malpractice at the hands of an anesthesiologist who left him a paraplegic. His compensation was almost entirely for pain and suffering damages because he was retired. no income. did not qualify for lost wages. The bill would unfairly limit damages for retirees like this former member of our Armed Forces and others who earn no wages. like poor moms and children. Let us protect patients rights. Let us help those poor people. Let us open up those trauma centers by really addressing the issue adequately. This way is the wrong way.

The same thing happened last year on prescription drugs. It is frustrating. We are fighting for democracy all over the world. but we do not get to have a voice here on the floor of the House with an alternative. I have a district in Texas. and we have a medical malpractice crisis. Of course. we have gone in and out of this for the last 30 years. but it has been dealt with by our State legislature in Texas. and literally as we stand here today. there is legislation that is out of the committee on the floor of the House for consideration that will solve our problem in Texas where it should be dealt with. Thirtyseven States. including my home State of Texas. are considering legislation that would address the malpractice situation. We do not need Congress to tell us what to do. We can deal with it. If Congress makes a mistake with H.R. 5. and I consider it a mistake. it is onesizefitsall. Washingtonknowsbest for all 50 States. instead of letting the States deal with it.

We do not need to tell California or Texas or any other State what they can do. They can deal with it. instead of us dealing with it here. But let me talk about H.R. 5 just a little bit. It does not deal with medical errors. we have separate legislation on that. it does not stem the tide of frivolous lawsuits. and it does not help us deal with physician shortages.

I mean this most sincerely. and I pledge to do everything I can to help them. but this bill is not the way to go. It will adversely impact patients who are injured. These are people whose lives are irreparably harmed and this legislation. in my opinion. punishes them even further. We can find a balance. but the majority is ramming this legislation through the House without regard to how it will hurt victims of negligent practices. A $250.000 cap on economic damages disproportionately affects those who do not earn a lot of money. Someone with a minimumwage job or a stayathome mom or dad cannot place a value on their work. but a corporate executive will walk away with millions in economic damages. This is not what we should be advocating in the House. Further. the legislation limits the statute of limitations to 3 years from the day the injury occurred or 1 year from the day the injury is discovered. This is not fair. I had an amendment which I tried to put forward in the Committee on Rules in the hope that they would allow us an upordown vote on the floor. It was turned down. There are some injuries. for instance. HIV/AIDS or blood transfusions. where people do not find out about their injuries for more than 3 years. So I believe this bill is not the way to go. It should be voted down. and I hope we can come back with good compromise legislation that helps doctors with malpractice rates.",

I tried to perfect this bill. During the Committee on Energy and Commerce markup. I offered an amendment to ensure that the savings from the bills caps on damages for patients pain and suffering would be passed along to the doctors in the form of reductions in their liability insurance premiums. Every Republican voted no. They each voted with the insurance industry. This bill deserves to be defeated. as long as there is no effective guarantee that savings from the bills caps on damage will go not to doctors. but to the insurance industry. This bill claims to be a cure for the high cost of insurance premiums paid by doctors. but it is really just insurance for insurance companies. It is a public policy placebo that only offers the illusion of relief from skyhigh insurance premiums. while pumping cash into the bottom line of insurance companies. Capping damages may save insurance companies money when their policyholders are sued. but the bill does not require insurers to pass along one cent of savings to the doctors so that they can stay practicing in local communities across this country. We can all agree that health care liability insurance is a critical issue that has significant impact on patients. on doctors. on insurance. but this bill leaves out one critical link: the doctors who will not receive the benefits of the lower premiums that have been promised.

The former Marsha Smulevitz began her career as a nurse in Chicago where she met my father. Benjamin. during his medical residency. They soon thereafter wed and settled in Chicagos North Andersonville neighborhood where they went on to have four children: me. my brothers Ezekiel and Ariel. and my sister. Shoshana. As if raising four children was not challenging enough. my mother continued to dedicate herself to public service and the civil rights struggle of that time. working to build a just society for all Americans. In the early 1960s. my mother served four years on the Congress of Racial Equality. founded by students at the University of Chicago. through which she participated in the Freedom March in the South. Following her activism in the civil rights movement. my mother traveled an entrepreneurial path. She went on to own the Daisy Patch Night Club on Chicagos north side where many local bands came to play their first performances. As her children entered their teens. my mother returned to school.

Cadet 2d Lieutenants Daniel Umpa and Nicholas Calarco were presented with the General Billy Mitchell Award. and Cadet Captains Ryan Elliott and Matthew Cooney were presented with the Amelia Earhart Award. The Civil Air Patrol has a long history of service to our nation as the official civilian volunteer auxiliary of the United States Air Force. Formed in 1941. just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. the Civil Air Patrol sank two enemy submarines and rescued hundreds of crash survivors during Worid War II. Currently. the Civil Air Patrol focuses on cadet programs. aerospace education and emergency services. The four cadets that I honor today are sure to continue that legacy. The General Billy Mitchell Award is earned by cadets who have completed the first eight achievements of the cadet program. fulfilled physical fitness requirements and passed an exam on leadership theory and aerospace. I commend Cadet 2d Lieutenant Daniel Umpa and Cadet 2d Lieutenant Nicholas Calarco on this great accomplishment. The Amelia Earhart Award is awarded to recipients of the General Billy Mitchell Award who have completed the first eleven achievements of the cadet program and passed an exam on leadership theory and aerospace. I commend Cadet Captain Ryan Elliott and Cadet Captain Matthew Cooney. who join nearly 10.000 other cadets who have received this prestigious award over the last 30 years. The Civil Air Patrol is actively involved in protecting America from the threat of terrorism. and I am confident that these four cadets will continue to make important contributions in securing the safety of our nation.",

The YOPA is dedicated to providing support as well as raising public awareness about Parkinsons disease. Ms. Reilly is one of many volunteers whose tireless efforts help to make the foundation a success. Parkinsons disease is a debilitating disease that affects 4 in every 1.000 Americans. and while the disease is more prominent in older people. five to ten percent of all Parkinsons cases are eariyonset. Parkinsons has no known origin or method of prevention. but with the assistance of organizations like the YOPA and the American Parkinsons Disease Association. treatments and a cure are coming closer to becoming a reality. The YOPAs mission is to raise public awareness and to offer support for those living with earlyonset Parkinsons disease. In addition. the association has coordinated with local. regional and national Parkinsons organizations in fundraising efforts for Parkinsons research. Ms. Gina Reilly is one of the most prominent volunteers who has helped make this mission a reality. Prior to her diagnosis. Ms. Reilly was a renowned competitor in U.S. adult ice dancing competitions. In addition to being a champion ice dancer. she was also a ballroom dancer. nightclub singer. and owner of a successful graphic arts and computer embroidering business. After her diagnosis in 2003. Ms. Reilly refused to let her disease prevent her from further achievements. In addition to continuing her pursuits in athletics and business. Ms. Reilly has begun working with the YOPA. Her incredible courage and fortitude provide a role model of how one can live their life while afflicted with Parkinsons disease. Mr. Speaker. I ask that my colleagues recognize the outstanding work of the Young Onset Parkinsons Association. and I congratulate Ms. Reilly for her outstanding achievements and bravery.",

President Bush has chosen someone who possesses a rare blend of work experience and background that makes him an asset to the commission. With a background in both government and the maritime industry. Mr. Anderson is positioned well as a knowledgeable and forceful advocate for a strong United States maritime industry. I have known Paul for more than 20 years. working with him in the Senate with former Senator Paula Hawkins when I was chief of staff. He is well qualified with Senate experience. 8 years with Hvide Marine. a U.S.flagged diversified marine transport company in Florida and 9 years with JM Family Enterprises. the nations largest distributor of Toyota vehicles. Clearly his knowledge of business in addition to the maritime industry will be invaluable in his position. He balances knowledge of government responsibilities and the needs of private companies.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week millions of Americans got a surprise when they filed their tax returns. This year a record 44 million tax returns. onethird of all returns filed. have no income tax liability because of the available credits and deductions in the Tax Code. This is a 50 percent increase in the number of zerotax filers in just 4 years. The vast majority of these 44 million filers are from lowincome households who saw their tax liability disappear thanks to the tax cuts pushed by President Bush and this House. The expansion of the 10 percent bracket. the increased child tax credit. and the marriage penalty relief are the leading reasons that so many people were able to have zero liability. All these tax provisions are in jeopardy if Congress does not act to extend them by the end of this year. These are not tax cuts for the rich. They are tax provisions designed to help working men and women bring home more of their paychecks. In fact. 75 percent of the 44 million will earn less than $20.000 per year. and 97 percent will earn less than $40.000 per year.

First. employment growth slows under his plan with 225.000 fewer jobs created per year under his policy. in contrast to the fact that in the first quarter of this year. 513.000 new jobs have been created. Secondly. GDP growth slows for the next decade. underperforming by $20 billion in just the first 5 years. Third. aftertax income shrinks. And this makes sense. Taxes go up. takehome pay goes down. And under the Democrat plan. takehome pay plummets $240 billion below current projections. And. lastly. savings plummet.

Ohio has lost one out of six manufacturing jobs since George Bush took office. Ohio has lost almost 200 jobs every single day of the Bush administration. Yet the Presidents answer invariably is more tax cuts for the wealthiest people. the most privileged people in the country. hoping that it trickles down and creates jobs. His other answer is more trade agreements. like the North American Free Trade Agreement. that continue to send jobs. continuing to hemorrhage jobs out of the country. Mr. Speaker. instead of these failed economic policies that have cost Ohio more than 200.000 jobs. we need to extend unemployment benefits. pass CraneRangel that actually gives benefits and rewards those companies that manufacture in the United States rather than giving tax brea.s to those companies that continue to ship jobs overseas. rl 2000",

I have sought recognition regarding the renaming of the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in memory of the former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Matthew J. Ryan. Matt Ryan. whom I knew for many years. cared deeply for the people of Pennsylvania. He loved the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and made service his calling. Elected in 1962. he was one of its longest serving members and one of its longest serving Speakers. presiding for six terms. As much as Speaker Ryan loved Pennsylvania. the people of Pennsylvania and his colleagues from both parties loved him. Known on both sides of the aisle for the fair manner in which he presided over the House. Matt was a committed leader. tough debater. parliamentary tactician. and Pennsylvania booster. He spoke with great passion. and often was praised for his statesmanship. compassion. openness. Irish wit. and intelligence. Upon his death earlier this year. he became the first person whose body lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg since Abraham Lincoln. A true friend of animalsespecially his black Labrador. MagicMatt Ryan was very proud of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. It is in no small part because of his decades of support that the school today is one of the finest in the world. Founded in 1884. the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine was established at the urging of Penns School of Medicine. It was recognized that prevention and control of animal diseases had important implications for human health. This is as true today as it was thenperhaps even more soas we face a future in which advances in veterinary medicines ability to understand biological threats will be critical in our ability to fight bioterrorism. In February 2003. the month before Matts untimely death. the University decided to honor his support by renaming the Veterinary Hospital after him. Benjamin Franklin is the only other State politician for whom a building on the Universitys campus has been named. The renaming ceremony took place on Friday. September 19. 2003. and so I ask my colleagues to join me in reflecting on the legacy of Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. one of the truest Pennsylvanians and a champion of people.",

Unfortunately. this agency seems to have forgotten the stewardship portion of their mission. The Department has decided to ignore 10 years of scientific study by the National Park Service. which concluded that the best way to protect and preserve Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. two of our greatest national treasures. would be to phase out the use of snowmobiles. They have decided to ignore the conclusion that emissions produced by snowmobiles force park rangers to wear respirators. adversely affect the health of visitors. and obscure visibility around the famous Old Faithful geyser. This decision is an affront to the health of our national park system. That is why I strongly support an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill that will call for a phaseout of the use of snowmobiles in these parks. Our national parks are irreplaceable.

Andrew Wilkie. was a senior intelligence analyst at Australias Office of National Assessment until his resignation a week before the war. The Bush Administrations recent blame shifting and backpedaling on the Iraq uranium claim is profoundly embarrassing to this Nation. In an effort to protect the Bush presidency.

They. of course. have completely neglected to mention that the claim was disputed by Tenet in October. 2002. and that the Vice Presidents office learned of the forged evidence back in February of 2002. They have refused to divulge what transpired during Vice President CHENEYS multiple unusual visits to meet personally with CIA Iraq analysts. in which they reportedly felt pressured.

There is bipartisan and complete agreement that the contest fails to state grounds sufficient to change the result of the election and therefore should be dismissed. The contestant challenged the late Representative Patsy Mink in the 2002 Democrat primary. where he received 15 percent of the vote. The contestant argues that Representative Mink. who was seriously ill at the time of the primary and passed away 1 week later. should have been disqualified as a primary candidate. that he should have been declared the Democrat nominee by default and that as the nominee he therefore would have been the inevitable general election winner.

The contestant. a candidate on the November 2002 ballot against the gentleman from Tennessee . filed a notice of contest under the Federal Contested Elections Act contending that the gentleman from Tennessee is unqualified for the office because the Constitution bars an incumbent from running for reelection without first resigning his or her seat and being an inactive member of the State Bar Association.

    "speech": "At this stage we have two options in the conflict that has engulfed us in Iraq. We can continue to carry on unilaterally. which is the course we have taken. a course which. in my judgment. will be continued through this $87 billion supplemental appropriation. or. second. to the maximum degree possible. pursue a real internationalization of the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. a sharing of the burden of blood and treasure and responsibility for decisionmaking while also including a central role for Iraqis in determining the future of their country. Of these two options. the second. the commitment to real internationalization. has significantly more potential to get us out of Iraq as honorably and as expeditiously as possible. If we do not change from our current unilateral course. we will continue to bear the unilateral burdens alone: One soldier killed per day. 10 soldiers maimed per day. an increasing cost of occupation. Last year the occupation cost $1 billion a week. Under the supplemental appropriation we have just voted. it will now be $1.3 billion a week. The total cost of reconstruction. including the funds we have just voted. through September 30 of next year will be almost $25 billion. This administration has avoided answering the question: How much will we spend before we exit Iraq? As a result. I am concerned that this $87 billion supplemental appropriation is in essence a blank check for the Presidents failed policy. It will remove a substantial portion of the pressure for real progress in the internationalization of the occupation and reconstruction efforts directed at Iraq. Passage of this supplemental spending bill will remove the incentive for this administration to negotiate. Mr. President. the reality is that it is only through significant international troops and money. only with significant decision sharing by the United States with those foreign countries that our Nation has any reasonable expectation of an honorable and expeditious exit from Iraq. This appropriation leads us in the opposite direction. We will do it alone. It will increase the risk to our brave soldiers. It will unnecessarily transfer reconstruction costs to the U.S. taxpayer. and it will lengthen the time when the United States can honorably and expeditiously leave Iraq. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today has been a very good day in the Senate. as well as in the House of Representatives. with a strong bipartisan majority vote in both Houses of Congress approving the funds necessary to support our soldiers and civilians serving in Iraq and to move quickly to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe this is a major victory for the President of the United States in his efforts to bring stability and peace to Iraq. Personally. I am very pleased with the overwhelming bipartisan support for the Presidents proposal in the Senate. When the package was first sent to the Hill several weeks ago. very few thought it possible. We have had to make a number of difficult votes and. indeed. we worked very late last night. into the early hours of this morning. completing this bill. now. just several hours ago. I am certain the Senate- and Housepassed bills will allow us that opportunity to negotiate a final legislative package that. indeed. will give the President everything he requested. It was important to do. It was important to complete this legislation today especially. not only to get the money to our troops as soon as possible and to rebuild the civilian infrastructure in Iraq as soon as possible but also because of the donor conference in Madrid next week. The President. indeed. has made a strong stand for freedom and democracy in Iraq. as well as Afghanistan. and he has taken forceful action against brutality and terrorism in the region. and by doing so has made America safer and our citizens more secure. Indeed. we are at war in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. The funds in this legislation provide both the direct support for our soldiers. as well as an investment in creating a safer environment in the countries where they serve. The legislation will make them safer and. in all likelihood. will get them home sooner. I also want to take this opportunity to commend Senator STEVENS for his tremendous leadership on this particular legislation. as well as Senator WARNER and Senator MCCAIN and Senator MCCONNELL. all for their tireless efforts to pass this emergency funding request.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. On May 1. 2003. Senator KENNEDY and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act. a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law. sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Pittsburgh. PA. On April 19. 2002. Adam Bishop was bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer by his own brother. Ian Bishop. 14. and alleged accomplice . Robert Laskowski. 15. As several witnesses testified. the killing was because Ian thought his brother was gay. The victim was struck by his brother at least 15 times with the hammer and was moved to various parts of the home before he was left to die in a bathtub. I believe that Governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United. with the Million Mom March. released a report entitled \"Disarming Domestic Violence Abusers.\" This report provides a guide for closing loopholes in State gun laws that allow domestic violence abusers to purchase or possess firearms and offers Congress some insight into how to help our States effectively enforce gun safety laws. Under current Federal law. domestic violence abusers subject to restraining orders or convicted of domestic violence are prohibited from owning guns. Despite the law. some domestic violence offenders continue to gain access to firearms. The Brady report proposes a number of ways to keep guns out of the hands of domestic violence offenders. Among the suggestions are ensuring that restraining orders clearly state that the possession of a firearm is prohibited and that restraining orders be entered into state and national databases used to conduct background checks on gun sales. Further. the report recommends that law enforcement remove firearms from the scene of domestic violence incidents. Finally. stopping domestic abusers from buying additional guns requires background checks on the sale of all firearm transfers. including those that take place at gun shows. The deadly combination of domestic violence and guns put many women and families at great risk. While Federal laws provide a general framework to prevent abusers from purchasing or possessing firearms. the Federal laws will not be effective in protecting women from armed abusers until every State enacts complementary laws. I urge my colleagues to read the Brady Campaigns report and to support Federal efforts that assist States with enforcing our Nations gun safety laws.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently I hosted a luncheon of the American Chemical Society on nanotechnology. It was a pleasure to be in the company of so many brilliant minds. and those concerned with the technological and economic future of our Nation. Of all the areas of scientific innovation being developed today. none is more profound than nanotechnology. The ability to manipulate individual atoms is unprecedented in human history and could lead to the redesign of most products we know of today. Some have even said it could lead to the \"Second Industrial Revolution.\" Its scope is nothing other than breathtaking. In the area of national security. nanotechnology has been identified as one of the most important strategic research areas. Revolutionary applications could include: very lightweight but extremely strong armor. vastly smaller and more powerful computers. microscopic sensor systems. and tiny unmanned vehicles. These could provide vastly increased capabilities for our armed forces. Conversely. to fall behind in these new areas will present us with a critical security risk. Unfortunately. the United States is no longer the only world leader in many areas of nanoscience. as many countries have recognized its importance and are greatly increasing their funding. With stakes this high. we must pay close attention to the choices we make. I understand the stakes and stand foursquare behind publicprivate efforts to keep America in the lead in nanotechnology. Just as we led the industrial revolution. America will lead this new scientific revolution for the benefit of generations to come.",

In fact. it was the encouragement and support she received from the Mobile County Schools Music Supervisor that fanned the flame of ambition within her. and it was a generous gift of bus fare from a former principal that allowed her to head to Oakland.

It was In California that Lil Greenwood was to be \"discovered.\" During a performance at the famed Purple Onion in San Francisco. she was heard by no less than the legendary Duke Ellington. Needless to say. the Duke was suitably impressed. After hearing her sing. he commented that \"the girl has a voice thats a mixture of Marian Anderson. Ella Fitzgerald. Dinah Washington. and Mahalia Jackson.\" These women were the embodiments of jazz and blues singing. and it is inconceivable that a greater compliment could have been paid.

Professor Metod Klemenc of Celje Slovenia. who will be honored at the Slovenian Cultural Gardens in a ceremony to open up this years Games. I cannot think of a more appropriate person to honor in conjunction with the Games than Professor Klemenc. nor a better place to recognize the Intemational Childrens Games and Professor Klemenc than at the Slovenian Cultural Garden in Cleveland. Metod Klemenc organized the first International Childrens Games on June 5. 1968. in Celje. Born in Ljubljana. Slovakia. 70 years ago. Professor Klemenc is the spiritual father of these Games whose simple goal was bringing school age children from different nations to better understand one another. A Slovenian sports instructor. Professor Klemenc explained: \"My childhood suffered from the 2nd World War. It destroyed my family. Since Iwithin .my possibilitieswanted to create a better world based on friendship. sports seemed to be one of the best means to bring together young people from different countries. Therefore you need willpower and friends who are enthusiastic about sports. and who are willing to give up their spare time.\" The Cleveland Cultural Gardens consist of 23 individual gardens. including the Slovenian Garden. The Gardens are an important part of the Clevelands history. reflecting the ethnicities and cultures that were instrumental in the citys development. The symbolic meaning of the gardens is that people of diverse backgrounds. lifestyles. traditions. and religions can exist side by side in peace and harmony with the freedom to exercise their beliefs and cultures. Built in the 1920s and 1930s. these gardens stood for the unity among all people of all nations. and to this day remain a unique embodiment of that purpose. Mr. Speaker and colleagues. it is appropriate to open up the Intemational Childrens Games in Cleveland at a place in Cleveland that stands for international brotherhood and peace. And among these gardens. it is my pleasure to recognize the role Slovenians have played in building Cleveland. the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. and the Intemational Childrens Games. I ask you to join me in honoring Professor Klemenc. the founder of the Intemational Childrens Games.",

An explanation of this bill for the RECORD follows. SUMMARY H.R. 5026. the Textiles and Apparel China Safeguard Act. creates a comprehensive program to respond to the WTOmandated expiration of textiles and apparel quotas at the end of 2004. Foreseeing within the expanded trade resulting from Chinas WTO accession the potential negative impact on the U.S. and world markets from quota expiration. the Clinton Administration negotiated the right for the United States to use a special safeguard against imports of textiles and apparel products from China. Despite 345.000 U.S. jobs lost in the textiles and apparel industry since 2001. and estimates of hundreds of thousands more after quotas expire. the Bush Administration has failed to actively implement the special safeguard or to create a comprehensive approach to the issue. The Textiles and Apparel China Safeguard Act is critical for the U.S. textiles and apparel industry and the 700.000 U.S. jobs it supports. The Act ensures active enforcement of the special safeguard against imports from China and creates a comprehensive approach to the impending crisis. The Act has three key elements. Specifically. it would: (1) direct the President to make two changes to the overly restrictive rules issued by the Bush Administration to implement the China safeguard so that the safeguard will be meaningful for the U.S. textiles and apparel industry. (2) direct the President to use the special China safeguard to negotiate a comprehensive agreement by immediately entering into formal consultations with China over textiles and apparel imports that threaten to disrupt the American market. and (3) enforce aggressively U.S. rights under the special China safeguard by imposing restraints on imports if China does not agree on a mutually acceptable solution.",

I rise today to explain why I voted against S. 2634. the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. which authorizes $82 million over three years for federally funded suicide intervention. prevention and treatment programs in public schools. I most certainly empathize with those who have lost a loved one as a result of suicide. Many of us have been affected by this particularly painful form of tragedy. whether directly or indirectly. We need to do whatever it takes to reduce the number of suicides occurring each year in our Nation. and help the suffering realize that taking their own life is never the right answer. However. \"whatever it takes\" does not mean we take the role of suicide prevention out of the hands of friends and family and local health care providers and into the hands of the poorlysuited federal bureaucracy. Those contemplating suicide do not need help from the governmentthey need help from those who know them by name. Mr. Speaker. no one can argue that this bill came before the House with anything other than good intention. Unfortunately. good intention doesnt always translate into good legislation. This bill costs taxpayers $82 million over 3 years and creates two new Federal programs and a new technical assistance center. with virtually no mechanism to measure effectiveness or actual benefit of new services. Dont our loved ones deserve better. more direct care than that? I think absolutely they do. and so do the experts: In a December 2001 study published by the Joumal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) entitled \"Suicide in Teenagers\" researchers concluded that \"Suicide awareness programs in schools . . . have not been shown to be effective either in reducing suicidal behavior or in increasing help seeking behavior.\" Additionally.

Yet all too often. we hear chilling stories of boys and girls taken from their rightful guardians. stolen by strangers or even by members of their family. Today. I want to recognize a program in my district that is working to prevent these awful occurrences. In Weirton. volunteers have organized an initiative that is called WINK: Watching Its Neighborhood Kids. This twopart program is bringing the community together to help keep children safeand to help recover them if they should ever be lost or taken. Under the WINK Program. safe houses are being established across the city. These are homes and businesses. screened by the Weirton police. that volunteer to open their doors to children who are lost. hurt or threatened. The goal is to eventually have one on every block. The approved safe houses are given a logo sign to post in their windows. They also are given information on helping children in danger. Children are told about the program in school. and parents are encouraged to show them where safe houses can be found in the neighborhood. Mr. Speaker. this kind of vigilance and communication is a good way to protect our children. But sometimes. no matter how careful the precautions. young people are lost or missing. That is why the second part of this program is vitally important as well. In addition to the safe houses. WINK has established a child identification program. It sponsors free registration events across the community. Parents bring in their children for digital photos. for fingerprints or footprints. and for a DNA mouth swab. All of these itemsthese key identification toolsare given . to parents to take home. and keep close at hand. Experts tell us that when a child is missing. an immediate response is the best response. It helps to increase the odds of a successful recovery. Thanks to the child I.D. program. parents have uptodate information ready to give to police should the unthinkable happen. Mr. Speaker. the safety of children is a concern that we all share. Today.

I believe there are three areas of the current Act that need to be changed. While the language I am proposing may not be the best way to address these concerns. I would like these proposed changes to spark a debate in the coming months. In addition. I am including language to amend the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab rationalization program to address what I believe was an oversight in the plan. I believe this plan to rationalize the Bering Sea crab fishery is a living plan which will continue to be modified as changes are needed. I believe that the safety issues of this fishery necessitate some action. and I dont believe that no action is an option. Congress asked the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to give the Congress a proposal and they did so. We have studied this fishery for too long without doing something to make it safer. Having said that. I also believe that the plan to rationalize this important fishery needs to be dynamic and we need to be able to make adjustments as we see how the plan works. Everyone involved in this debate has good intentions. but we need to be mindful that good intentions sometimes cause unintended consequences. We need to watch the implementation of the plan very carefully. Finally.

But Virginia reached out to me to provide guidance and vision that helped chart my course to achieve elected office and to serve all Nevadans with the passion and principle epitomized. I hope my service measures up to her example. Virginia never shied away from helping a good cause. From Common Cause. to Planned Parenthood. to the American Civil Liberties Union. she served with distinction and was always there for people in need. to right a wrong. and to help build a better state. Nevada is a better place. and her citizens enriched. because of the life of Virginia Demmler.",

Colorado for 105 years. and I am pleased to call the attention of this body of Congress to the many contributions the bakery has made to the Pueblo community. Otto Zoelsmann and his wife immigrated to the United States from Germany in the late 1800s. In 1898. the couple moved to Pueblo. where they opened a bakery. The Zoelsmanns were expert bakers and their delicacies were immediately popular throughout the Pueblo community. Horse drawn wagons. and later Ford Model T trucks. initially delivered the baked goods to Zoelsmanns loyal customers. Aside from technological advancements. little about Zoelsmanns Bakery has changed over the years. The bakery is still dedicated to creating and selling the best baked goods possible. The current coowners. the Petkoseks and the Paradisos. along with their staff. always serve their customers with a kind word and a friendly smile. The Petkoseks and Paradisos took over the store after its longtime owner Chuck Martinelli retired. Chuck was a beloved figure in Pueblo and a master chef. Chuck handpicked his successors and. before retiring. he taught them his trade and entrusted them with his famous recipes. Chucks memory lives on with Zoelsmanns Bakery as it goes about its business each day. Mr. Speaker. it is my honor to rise and pay tribute to Zoelsmanns Bakery. The bakery is entering its second century of dedicated service to the people of Colorado and I am pleased to call attention to Zoelsmanns contributions to the community of Pueblo.",

Torture is a horrible tool used in more than 150 countries to silence. intimidate and oppress people around the world. Many survivors of torture arrive in the United States every year. This legislation provides vital funding of support for victims of torture. Mr. Speaker. more than 500.000 survivors of torture live in the United States today. A significant number of these survivors live in New York City. These survivors need vital support in terms of rehabilitation. medical care and psychological care. Fleeing from their persecutors. most often leaving their families behind. they arrive with no documentary evidence to prove their persecution. All they have are their scarred bodies and their stories of horror. Once they arrive. the survivors are forced to face a culture and a system different from what they have known. They face numerous challenges in their effort to integrate into our society and become fully participating members. They have difficulty telling their stories to the immigration officers and even to their own attorneys because of the abuse they have endured by those in power in the past and thus are wary of authorities. Among the few they can turn to are the torture treatment programs. These programs. armed with experience and dedication. are instrumental in helping survivors document their stories of torture. providing them with clinical care and psychosocial support. and enabling them to embark on a new life. The lifesaving work done by these torture treatment programs should be commended and appreciated by all Americans. for they open their doors. extend their hands. and offer",

We will appoint conferees and then we will go to work out the differences between the House and the Senate. We have differences between the House and the Senate. but in my 24 years in the Senate we are probably closer with the House in the 2 budget resolutions--the Senate resolution is probably closer to the House resolution than most times in the past.

We had 1 year we didnt pass a budget in the Senate. They did in the House. This year the numbers are pretty close. I have a couple of comments. I heard a statement in the budget debate on the floor. I would say. my staff has compiled the amount of spending that was in the amendments that were debated on the floor. Our Democrat colleagues offered amendments that would have 1year tax increases of $86 billion and 1year spending increases of $81 billion for 2005. For 5 years. that figure would be tax increases of $443 billion. and 5year spending increases. $382 billion. That is assuming no inflation. If you take the first year and extrapolate. some said we only spend for 1 year. but there are programs which would obviously be spent further. I have a chart that extrapolates and continues those.

The Senator once again says the budget before us will reduce the deficit in half in 3 years. The problem is. if you look at increases to the debt in each of those years. you dont see a reduction.

Effectively. if we follow the way that the Senator from Iowa suggests. we are going to have to tax more people a lot more so that those programs are going to be there because we refuse to have employers do what they should do. and that is to pay a fair wage.

Again. she has very eloquently laid out a very thoughtful argument about exactly the problems which exist across the country when it comes to job creation. As someone who has spent an earlier part of her life in the private sectorvery successfully. I might addshe brings a very special knowledge and awareness to these issues and this debate and discussion. I wonder if my colleague has seen the most recent statistics. In fact. they were released today from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I do not believe my colleague referenced them. but they illustrate the point she is making. According to them: As of February 2004. 35 states have failed to get back to their prerecession employment levels. Furthermore. 49 states have not created enough jobs to keep up with the natural growth in the number of potential workers. as job growth has lagged in workingage population since March 2001. As for the unemployed. 43 states have higher unemployment rates than when the recession began. And. lastly. they go in and point out a projected job creation of 306.000 jobs per month. Obviously. we are way off those numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. which does not have a political ax to grind at allnational job creation has fallen over two million jobs short of that pace .... job growth projected for the Bush Administrations economic plan has fallen short in 49 of the 50 states as of February 2004. Thirteen states have actually lost jobs since the Administrations tax cut was supposed to start creating job growth. I was not sure if my colleague was aware of those numbers. Dont they make the case even further? These are numbers released today. not going back 6 months. But they point out. once again. the sluggishness. to put it mildly. of job creation.

Without greater support for childcare. parents of young children may be forced to choose cheaper. poor quality care for their children or fail to provide it entirely. These families need to know their children are cared for while the parents do their part to attain selfsufficiency and to provide for their families. At 73 percent. my State of South Dakota has the highest percentage of children six years of age and younger with both parents working and the highest number of children under the age of 6 in paid daycare. at 47 percent. This is almost double the national average of 24 percent. On average. 1 year of childcare costs families in South Dakota $4.000. This estimate is close to a semester of college at a State institution. A study done by the South Dakota Coalition for Children found that parents seek a safe. nurturing environment for their children when they are under someone elses care. As more and more families need both parents to work in order to make ends meet. safe reliable day care has become essential to the peace of mind of working families in South Dakota and across the country. Without the increased funding for childcare that the SnoweDodd amendment provides. more parents will be forced to seek childcare that meets their budgets rather than their hopes for the care of their children. In some cases. families may go without childcare all together. Without the increase in childcare funding provided by this amendment. hundreds of thousands of eligible children will lose childcare assistance over the next 5 years. At a time when only one out of seven eligible children is currently served. I urge my colleagues to strengthen our commitment to children in working families by supporting the Snowe amendment and providing additional resources to increase the number of children able to receive quality care.",

Today that crisis line operates 24 hours a day. and the organization has 12 board members. 14 paid staff. and more than 40 volunteers who address the problems related to all forms of sexual assault. Over the past 30 years. UASA as greatly expanded the services offered to the people of Sonoma County. It provides extensive training on helping victims. including not only women and girls. but also men. children. and the families of victims. Staff and volunteers also accompany victims and their families for police reporting. court appearances. medical exams. or other personal situations. Prevention programs include outreach to elementary through high school youths. reaching approximately 6.000 young people every year. as well as parents and school personnel. Other efforts include bilingual outreach to Hispanic teens. teen peer education training. antiracism curriculum which deals with violence against the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender community. and a unique mens program featuring men educating men. All services are offered at no cost.

This collaborative project makes services easily accessible and minimizes the stress felt by victims. The agency is also working with the District Attorneys office to establish a countywide Family Justice Center by 2005. In May 2004. Executive Director Gloria Young was named \"Outstanding Director of the Year\" by the Califomia Coalition Against Sexual Assault for shepherding the agency through many of these transitions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act . First. this bill would prohibit civil lawsuits from being brought against a person who donates firecontrol or firerescue equipment to a volunteer fire company. under state or federal law. for personal. property damages or loss. or death caused by the equipment subsequent to the donation. But this prohibition against lawsuits would not apply in cases where the donors actions constitute gross negligence. intentional misconduct. or where the person is the manufacturer of the firecontrol or firerescue equipment. Second. the bill would preempt state laws to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the bill. But it would not preempt state law that provides additional protection from liability for an individual who donates firefighting equipment. Finally. the bill would also require the U.S. Justice Department to review and report to Congress on donations of equipment made to volunteer firefighter companies in each state during the previous fiveyear period. Such report would include an analysis of the most effective way to fund firefighter companies for each state. whether firstresponder funding is sufficient. and the best method to make sure donated equipment to volunteer companies is in usable condition. This bill protects people. who out of the goodness of their own hearts. donate muchneeded equipment to our brave firefighters who selflessly volunteer to defend our communities. We all know that there are many pressing and unmet needs among volunteer fire departments across the country. Yes. I was pleased to vote for the FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill when it passed the House last June and it provides $32 billion to improve our nations homeland security. including several billion for our firefighters and other first responders. We would like to have done more. but the dire fiscal condition of the federal budget precludes us from doing so. It makes common sense to me that we then make certain that these socalled good Samaritans can make supplementary donations of equipment to help meet the needs of volunteer firefighters. This bill does that. while also safeguarding against shoddy donations that might jeopardize the lives of our volunteer firefighters and in our communities.",

It. unfortunately. would be affected most heavily by the gentlemans amendment. Some $428 million from highway construction programs would be lost under the gentlemans amendment. That would greatly diminish our ability to work upon the $400 billion backlog that we have throughout the country. the tens of thousands of dangerous bridges that we are trying to address through the funding in this bill. There are other impacts upon other agencies. but most especially. it would affect the highway program which we have gone to great lengths to adjust priorities in this bill to try to give the taxpayers something for what they have been paying at the gasoline pump. namely. some improvements in the road situation that is costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year in lost income and in delays due to the heavy amount of congestion and difficulty they have in traffic.

This amendment would eliminate from the present list of roughly 40 routes that Amtrak operates 16 of these routes. including such routes as Chicago to St. Louis and Chicago to Pontiac. which are two of the key routes within the Chicago hub system. routes which. interestingly enough. are part of a hub system. which has been much touted for in the longterm highspeedrail development. In fiscal year 2003. Amtrak did not initiate additional changes in its long distance routes because the individual long distance routes would not result in any significant savings. and no savings at all in the first several years. In the interim. severance costs would be very costly expenses. estimated up to a billion in the first year for taxpayers if one were to eliminate the longdistance routes. I have not analyzed whether these routes are exactly the same routes. but there is a great deal of overlap between the routes that have been considered for longdistance elimination and to what I have said applies. that there would be no savings in the short run. and. in fact. would have considerable severance costs involved. The gentlemans amendment bans the use of States to subsidize these routes. routes like the Chicago to St. Louis and the Chicago to Pontiac or to Detroit. those represent part of a closein system where urban areas are close to each other and which by every indication the President himself has been suggesting that these should be routes that ought to be supportable for operating purposes and for some capital purposes by the States. that they ought to be involved. This amendment. as I understand it. bans the uses of States to subsidize routes. 0] 1430 I do not know if we should be in the business of telling States how to spend their own money.

It seems to me we should do one of two things: we should either make the pain greater for the Cuban people. as we so with the embargo. or we should make some changes to improve communications. How do we make those kind of changes? One change that I think of is perestroika in Russia. In the late 80s. when more open communication was started. when the Russian people started learning about what America was and what we were doing. we saw the beginning of change in Russia. How can we better communicate with the Cuban people? I was down in Cuba about a year and a half ago. and most people of Cuba that I talked to do not seem to really know what America is all about. what the free market and free enterprise and liberty is all about. Of course. because under Castro they have not had it. I think it should be clear that none of us support Castro. None of us disagree that Castro is bad. None of us disagree it would be good to have Castro out of the way. The question is. how do we do something better than what we have done for the last 43 years? We talk about some of the prisoners. saying. keep up the pain and keep your embargo going. I would quote one of the prisoners. Espenosa Chapa. who said. \"The policy of isolating Cuba. far from bringing freedom. has only served to give the regime an alibi that the embargo is the cause of all the ills the country suffers. and it has kept Cuban society away from a greater flow of democratic ideas and values.\" The current ban on travel is only one element of the embargo. Mr. Chairman. I would say it is somewhat akin to increased free trade worldwide where there is freer interaction and more open communication. So I just call on my colleagues. do not go along with the status quo. Let us make a change. because the last 43 years have not accomplished the goals that we want to accomplish.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I have said in the past. doing business with Cuba means doing business with Castro. So long as Castro maintains his stranglehold on every aspect of Cuban life. lifting any aspect of the embargo or allowing Americans to travel to Cuba could mean subsidizing Castro. Most Cuban tourist operations and resorts are owned and operated by fronts for the Cuban military and internal security services. These socalled \"companies\" funnel money directly into Castros military. earning the regime the hard currency it needs to perpetrate its oppressive policies. Is that where Americans should be spending their money? Castro has come to rely almost solely on his income from tourism. formerly profitable industries like sugar now only represent a small amount of the islands income. Proponents of travel will lead you to believe that if only Americans were allowed to travel to the island. then the Cuban people would realize the great freedoms they are missing and rise up and demand political and humanitarian reforms from their leaders. But. Mr. Chairman. the people of Cuba are not ignorant. Most speak regularly with their families here in the U.S. and they are fully aware of their lack of freedom and opportunities. In fact. the people of Cuba have risen up in protest to their government. only to have Castro throw over 80 nonviolent opposition leaders behind bars. sentencing many of them to life sentences in subhuman conditions in Castros jails. Tourist travel to Cuba will not increase purposeful contact with the Cuban people. Europeans and Canadians have been traveling to Cuba for years and clearly they have had no positive effect on Cubas leaders or political machine. By lifting these sanctions with nothing in exchange from the Cuban government. we are betraying the very people these policies were designed to help.

One of the many arguments I have heard from the proponents of this amendment is that the Cuban citizens would be better off if they had American tourists. Arguably. Iraqi citizens would have been better off if we had a free flow of Iraqi oil throughout the world and the prosperity that that might have brought. but not if Saddam Hussein was using the profits to terrorize his own people and to export terrorism and totalitarianism elsewhere throughout the world. That is precisely the predicament we are in. Fidel Castro. as long as he is alive and in charge in Cuba. will use every last dollar to terrorize his own people. to basically jail dissidents. to execute people that disagree with him. and to export terrorism throughout the world. He is the single last remnant of the 100year terrorism that communism plagued upon our entire planet in the last century. Yet. he stands just 90 miles off of our shores in Florida where he put missiles aimed at the people of the United States less than 25 years ago. I will tell my colleagues that when the lambs lay down with the lions. lambs get slaughtered. and the day to capitulate and to acquiesce and to acknowledge Castro as some reality that we have to put up with. condone. and even support with tourism dollars is not here and it will never be here. as long as those of us who truly believe that the way to freedom is to show up and stare down dictators. not cooperate with them.

This young man Antunez is serving 18 years because ever since he has been in high school he has been fighting for democracy in Cuba. and he says it would be unconscionable to send resources to the dictatorship. Let us be clear and on and on. Marta Beatriz Roque. the leaders who represent the Cuban people. who are in prison. do not want resources sent. The gentleman from Arizona . who keeps on saying that he knows that the dictator is a bad guy but he keeps on introducing amendments that would have the effect of sending billions of dollars to the dictator. has said this time that the dictator. and others have said. that he should not be believed. the dictator should not be believed when he says. yes. I want billions of dollars. I want billions of dollars. Imagine if the Flake theory would hold and every enemy of the United States now received billions of dollars from the United States because they are enemies of the United States and they cannot be believed because since they are really enemies of the United States. but we cannot believe enemies of the United States. it is good to send them billions of dollars. Imagine that theory. Imagine that theory. That is the Flake theory and of the United States. billions of dollars. Do not believe enemies of the United States. billions of dollars. Let us vote down this amendment. and let us stand with the people in the Cuban prisons. and let us vote to support the sanctions until there are free elections in Cuba. Mr. Chairman.",

I would maintain that none of us really know when Fidel Castro is telling the truth and when he is not. I do not think that we should pretend that we do. I do not think we should even try. Therefore. we simply ought to adopt a policy that is right and consistent with our objectives. That is what ending the travel ban is all about. It is doing what is good policy regardless of whether we think Fidel Castro supports it or whether he does not. I should mention there are others that have called for an end to the travel ban. other dissidents. Oscar Espinosa Chepe has been cited here a couple of times. This is a man I met just weeks before he was imprisoned in what for him may be a life sentence. He said. \"When the travel of Americans to Cuba is approved. the struggle for democracy and freedom will by no means end. To the contrary. these measures create better conditions to achieve these objectives.\" That is what we are trying to do here. We are trying to comport with the wishes of the dissident community in Cuba and to do what is right for us as well. to lift the ban on Americans to travel. We need today to strike a blow for freedom. We can do that by allowing Americans to travel freely as they wish. If it is freedom that we want for the Cuban people. let us start by exercising a little more of it ourselves by allowing our citizens to travel to Cuba and to take their values with them.",

Title IX has been a successful program that has helped open doors for women in education and employment. I dont understand how people can argue with success and try to change such an important piece of legislation. Times have changed in this nation for competitive sports. and it is all because of Title IX. Title IX has helped change assumptions and attitudes about sexual stereotypes. It is hard to comprehend that less than 30 years ago people believed women were physically incapable of running the marathon. It was believed that female body composition made it impossible for them to run long distances! It wasnt until women began defying this irrational and unfounded notion by competing anyway that the world took notice and a crippling stereotype died. It is a myth that women are not interested in sports or competition. It is a myth that women would rather be cheering on the sidelines than competing on the field. the court. the green. track. or the diamond. Any effort to repeal a program that allows access to sports and education for women reincarnates myths and stereotypes that should have been put to rest decades ago. Title IX has helped knock down the senseless barriers that have prevented women from engaging in competition by requiring that equal funding be contributed to womens sports throughout all levels of education. Girls have an equal right with boys to receive at a minimum a basic education and to compete for scholarshipswhether they are academic or athletic. Since 1972. the number of women playing collegiate sports has quadrupled! And the number of girls playing high school sports has increased to 3 million in the 30 years that",

In response to Rauf Denktashs refusal to allow a referendum vote. an opposition party in Northern Cyprus. the United Cyprus Party. planned to hold its own vote to explicitly demonstrate the desire of TurkishCypriots for a resolution to the Cyprus Question.

Edith Palmer will be honored by her community on the occasion of her retirement from the Springville League for the Handicapped and Preschool Learning Center. For 43 years. Edie has been the heart and soul of a facility that has given new hope to parents and new opportunities for the more than 160 preschool children who come through its doors each year. I know that not only because Edie lives in my hometown. but also because I am one of those parents. In May. 1960. Edie answered a newspaper ad calling together parents of disabled children to meet and discuss the special educational needs of their children. These concerned parents first met under a tree on East Avenue. where they planted the seeds for what has become one of the premiere educational facilities for handicapped and learning disabled children in all of New York state. Edies devotion to the Springville League for the Handicapped began from her own experience as the parent of a hearing disabled son. Like other parents of handicapped children in the 1950s. Edie felt. as she said in her own words. \"adrift on the ocean with no help on the horizon.\" That first day. Edie volunteered to handle all the groups secretarial work. and later that year became Board Secretary for their volunteer board of directorsa post she would hold for 20 years. For its first dozen years. the League provided volunteer help for children. using donated space. volunteer staff and providing help to children at no cost to their parents. Thanks. in part. to Edies leadership. dedication and passion. the Springville League for the Handicapped and Preschool Center opened the doors of its own facility in 1987. and today employs 95 people. serving 160 disabled preschool children each year.

He is rightly remembered as a largerthanlife figurea man who conquered first Hollywood. then California. and then Washington. DC. and whose message of freedom and democracy spread around the world. Though I did not know him well. I did know his daughter Maureen very well. and she is also missed. President Reagan was naturally possessed of the qualities that make a great leader. As Governor of California and later as President. he used a blend of humor. kindness and boldness to communicate with the American people. to challenge and defeat the Soviet adversary. and to promote his uniquely American vision of how things should be. While I disagreed with a number of his policies. I always admired his ability to convey his ideas and his power to persuade. The enormous outpouring of emotion and love for this man comes as no surprise. When we think of Ronald Wilson Reagan. we will remember his infectious optimism and grace. and his belief that there is always a better day ahead for America.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. along with all of my colleagues here today. I rise to honor President Ronald Reagan. I was first elected to Congress in 1988. on the same day that President George H.W. Bush was elected. Because Members of Congress officially take office on January 3. while a new President does not take office until January 20. my first 17 days as a Congressman were during the last 17 days Ronald Reagan served as President. So when people ask me who was the President when I first came to Washington. I reply that it was Ronald Reagan. I had the opportunity to see Ronald Reagan in person only one time. with his wife Nancy. during the inauguration of President George H.W. Bush. I remember thinking that together they had a larger than life presence. Although I differed with Ronald Reagan a great deal on domestic policy. I nevertheless admired him for the strong leader that he was. He had an affable manner that allowed him to interact well with people who both supported and opposed his policies. He was a strong leader who had a lot of charm. strength and enthusiasm. The gulf between the Republican and Democratic policies can sometimes seem vast. But the bridge that spans that gulf is our common heritage as Americans and belief in this great nation. Ronald Reagan had the gift to make that bridge seem very small. I am pleased to honor him today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week our nation honored the life of one of the most beloved. and most important. presidents of the twentieth century. During the 1980s. President Reagan did what many considered the impossible. As we faced great challenges at home and abroad. he helped us believe that it was \"morning in America.\" and that we would overcome our difficulties. With the will of the nation behind him. President Reagans steadfast leadership led to the defeat of communism and a robust economic recovery. When President Reagan took office a quarter century ago. communism was on the march. threatening to bring the free world to its knees. But President Reagans policy of \"peace through strength\" starved the Soviet bloc and made it safe for freedom to flourish in new nations. \"No weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will of free men and women.\" he said. Here at home. our country was in the worst recession since the Great Depression. with high unemployment. inflation. and interest rates. But President Reagan trusted the entrepreneurial spirit and cut taxes from 70 to 28 percent. creating 19 million new jobs and twenty years of growth. His economic policies formed the foundation upon which American families prosper. \"We believe that no power of government is as formidable a force for good as the creativity and entrepreneurial drive of the American people.\" he said. By rallying the will of our country. by reminding us of our remarkable abilitiesof what it means to be Americans. President Reagan reunited us as a confident and hopeful nation. And with a focused vision. he set us on a course that preserved our liberty and allowed our domestic economy to prosper again. In life. President Reagan was a guiding light for our nation. Even when times were tough. he rejected the idea that Americas best days were past. insisting that there is no limit to what our nation and our people can endureor accomplish. And he was right. Today we face a new enemy of liberty. in the war on terror. It is my hope. Mr. Speaker. that the confident optimism and clear vision that President Reagan gave to this nation will light our path. May God bless President Ronald Reagan.",

This is an extraordinarily difficult time for any family. but I hope they can find some comfort in the joy and inspiration that President Reagan brought to so many around the globe. Ronald Reagan was a true American original. a Midwestern boy of humble beginnings who chased his dreams of stardom in Hollywood and evolved into one of the foremost political leaders of the 20th Century. His legacy is so profound and pervasive that its easy to take for granted. But we should not forget that it was Ronald Reagan who restored strength to the Office of the President. It was Ronald Reagan who reshaped the federal government and ushered in two decades (and counting) of lower taxes and economic growth. It was Ronald Reagan who bolstered Americas strength as a world military power. And it was Ronald Reagan who reminded us that America was indeed that \"shining city on the hill.\" and we had bountiful reasons to be proud to be Americans.",

The formidable responsibility of molding and inspiring young minds to the avenues of hope. opportunity and achievement partially rests in the hands of our teachers. Today. I would like to recognize a teacher from Jackson. Michigan that significantly influenced and motivated exceptional students in academics and leadership who were winners of the LeGrand Smith Scholarship. John W. Moody teaches Mathematics and Physics at Concord High School in Concord. Michigan. He is credited with instilling in students an enthusiasm for not only these subjects. but also for life. As two of his students said. Matthew Wixson and Michael Horosko. \"He takes time to explain something if I dont understand it. and he is always there to give a bit of wisdom. He has helped shape who I am and I will be forever grateful to him for that.\" And. \"Mr. Moody taught me excellent math and science strategies. but even more important he taught me lessons about life. He is an excellent teacher. but even more so. a good friend.\" The respect and gratitude of his students speaks well of Johns ability to challenge young minds and encourage them to always put forth their best effort. John W. Moodys extraordinary work as a teacher has challenged and inspired countless students to move beyond the teenage tendency of superficial study and encourage them to foster deeper thought and connections to the real world. Arguably. no profession is more important because of its daily influence upon the future leaders of our community and our country. and Johns impact on his students is certainly worthy of recognition. On behalf of the Congress of the United States of America. I am proud to extend our highest praise to John W. Moody. We thank him for his continuing dedication to teaching and his willingness and ability to challenge and inspire students to strive for success.",

We are fighting to improve the health benefits for veterans. to end the Widows Tax and the Disabled Veterans Tax. Last year.

But as Democrats continue to fight for our veterans. Republicans continue to underfund the programs that are so important to our veterans. House Republicans have passed a budget that underfunds veterans health care by $1 billion. meanwhile they have managed to find room for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Our brave men and women in uniform are serving our country. They are sacrificing for our freedom. It is our duty to make sure that they are taken care of when they retum home. Republicans have broken the promise the GI bill made 60 years ago. Not one Republican has taken a stand against the Bush budget proposal. Our soldiers are fighting our enemies abroad.

Its a place that puts a great emphasis on the importance of family and friendship. MomandPop businesses are often passed down from generation to generation and its citizens continue to honor traditions from years past. For that reason. I rise today to recognize one of these long and celebrated traditionsthe 40th anniversary of the Petunia Festival. In 1830. Father John Dixon purchased land in the western parts of Illinois and soon began ferrying people across the Rock River to settle the area that would later be named after its founder. Unfortunately. in the 1950s a combination of Dutch Elm disease and major highway expansion resulted in the removal of all trees along the communitys major roadways. Nonetheless. in 1960. a small group of residents. better known as the Dixon Mens Garden Club. grew tired of the arid landscape and planted 4.000 petunias along South Galena Avenue to enhance the aesthetic beauty of the small Midwestern town. The following year. the Garden Club planted 6.000 more petunias. this time along North Galena Avenue. Each year since. the residents of Dixon pay tribute to the Dixon Mens Garden Club by planting and caring for 24.000 petunia plants. which now extend along all major streets throughout the town. In recent years. Dixon has received much attention for their annual Petunia Festival celebration. In fact. in 1999. the 91st General Assembly of Illinois passed a resolution declaring the city of Dixon. Illinois. the \"Petunia Capital of Illinois.\" In addition. the funspirited festival has earned the town national recognition and is often referred to as the \"Petunia City\" by passing travelers. Once again. I want to congratulate the city of Dixon as it celebrates its 40th anniversary of the Petunia Festival and wish its citizens. and my constituents. all the best in the years to come.",

I have been informed we have 58 amendments remaining. This is the first one. I ask the Senator. what is a reasonable limitation on the Senators comments?",

Senator WARNER. which seeks to address the damages at Department of Defense installations in those States impacted by Hurricane Isabel. The State of Maryland was particularly hard hit by Hurricane Isabel and the strong winds and flooding that accompanied it. Entire communities were submerged. power was lost in some areas for a week and countless individuals sustained damage to their homes. businesses and property. A number of Marylands military facilities were similarly affected. Perhaps the hardest hit was the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis which suffered approximately $39 million in damage. Several weeks ago. I met with the Academys Superintendent. Vice Admiral Rodney Rempt. who shared with me photographs of the destruction brought on by the hurricane. Hurricanerelated swelling of the Chesapeake Bay. the Severn River and the Annapolis Harbor resulted in the flooding of academic buildings and laboratories. the submerging of athletic fields and the destruction of electrical systems. Our future Naval officers are now forced to take classes wherever they can be offered in the chapel. on a Navy barge. in administrative offices. Hurricane destruction was not limited to Annapolis alone. Officials at the Armys Aberdeen Proving Ground. Patuxent River Naval Air Station and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division. among others. also report significant amounts totaling in the millions of dollars to repair roofs and buildings. replace piers. and clean up debris related to the storms. As you know. Operation and Maintenance funding at our bases is routinely among the most thinly stretched. And that is in years without a major natural disaster. This amendment provides $500 million to cover the muchneeded cost of repair at facilities along the East Coast facilities whose continued operation are vital to our national defense.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the administrations justification materials for the $20 billion in reconstruction funds for Iraq. which we received just last week. contains broad categories of projects with no supporting details about how the administration arrived at the expected costs of those projects. For example. they want $400 million for two prisons. at a cost of $50.000 per bed. How is that possible? Are we going to ship the cement over there? They budget $150 million for a tertiary care. pediatric hospital. with no details about how they arrived at that number and no explanation of why this is the best use of these funds in Iraq. versus far less costly public health clinics and immunization programs. They want to spend $100 million for seven housing communities. Housing is short in Iraq. but should American taxpayers really pay $100 million? We simply do not have nearly enough information to justify these exorbitant expenditures. My amendment says that before funds are allocated for capital projects like prisons. hospitals. railroads. and government buildings. the Coalition Provisional Authority must submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations describing the estimated cost on which the request for funds for the project is based. The amendment also says. that in order to control costs. to the maximum extent practicable. Iraqis with the necessary qualifications should be consulted and utilized in the design and implementation of reconstruction projects. We want to employ Iraqis. not $500 and hour consultants. I dont doubt that Iraq needs new prisons. government buildings. and housing. although I am not yet convinced the American people should pay for these things. This amendment does not prevent any project from being built. But we hear about spending millions of dollars in Iraq for thingsfrom vehicles to cement factoriesthat with a minimum of frugality could be bought or built for a fraction of the price. Before we spend 5 or 10 times more than we need to. lets find out what we are paying for to be sure it is the best use of the money. That is what my amendment does. It requires the administration to give us the information that justifies these costs. before the funds are allocated. The American people deserve to know what their money is paying for. before it is spent. I thank the managers for agreeing to this amendment.",

So we owe the Senator from New York a great deal of gratitude for his leadership on this issue because it is a matter of very grave national security importance.

It seems to me one of the ways we might really get to the bottom of this in a hurry would be if those who leaked the information to the journalists were to release the journalists from any obligation to hide the sources. I ask the Senator. would it not be possible for the President of the United States to call in all of his senior staff. have them sit down at a desk and sign a piece of paper releasing Mr. Novak and any other journalists from protection of his or her name as a possible source of the leak? Couldnt the President just have all of the senior White House people. senior administration people sign such a thing?

    "speech": "Mr. President. the United States is experiencing a serious shortage of veterinarians in rural agricultural and innercity areas. Veterinarians are needed in these areas to support our Nations defense against bloterrorism. improve food safety. and prevent disease outbreaks. Unfortunately. the financial constraints of loan repayment obligations prevent many new veterinary graduates from working in these underserved areas. Today. I am pleased to introduce. along with the distinguished Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. legislation that addresses these challenges. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assist veterinarians in repaying their educational loans if they agree to provide veterinary medical services in areas where the Secretary has determined that a shortage of qualified veterinarians exist. In addition. at the request of the United States Department of Agriculture. the bill authorizes the Secretary to provide additional loan repayment for those veterinarians in this program who agree to provide services to the Federal Government in emergency situations. When epidemics of animal diseases break out in specific locations in the United States. there is often a serious shortage of trained veterinarians available to respond. Examples include the Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak in California and an outbreak of low pathogenic Avian Influenza in Virginia in 2002. This legislation would enable the Department of Agriculture to locate trained veterinarians where they are needed in an emergency situation. This legislation has the support of the Department of Agriculture and the American Veterinary Medical Association which have worked together to develop this legislation to ensure that we have the veterinary health professionals available to protect our food supply. This is an important step in resolving the serious shortage of veterinarians.",

This bill will offer veterinarians a valuable opportunity to serve where they are needed most. while receiving help in paying off their often burdensome student loans. The cost of becoming a veterinarian is tremendous. Unless aspiring veterinarians come from a wealthy background. they will have accumulated substantial debt by the time they leave school. Because of this debt. their postgraduate opportunities for employment are greatly limited to the geographical areas and types of jobs where incomes meet the burden of student loan repayment. By defraying some of this debt. this bill will help veterinarians to take jobs where there are shortages of veterinarianssuch as meat and poultry inspectors in the Federal Government. or in rural areas where large animal practitioners are needed. Many of these unfilled positions are essential to ensuring the health and food security of Americans. We need to keep the Federal Government staffed with skilled veterinarians in order to maintain a safe food supply and the health of our livestock and poultry. We have all seen the devastating effects diseases such as E. coli 0157:H7. Salmonella and Foot and Mouth Disease can have on the livestock and poultry industries and the human and economic toll they can take. I have worked on many initiatives to address the uneven distribution of medical professionals. Although it often can require extra incentives to get these professionals where they are needed. they often transform these shortage areas by providing critically important services. I have been very happy with the ability of past bills to enable medical professionals to go where they are needed. and I am confident the National Veterinary Medical Service Act will be as successful for veterinarians. I am proud to cosponsor this bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it. By Mr. DURBIN:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor for the National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2003. a bill introduced today by Senator JIM JEFFORDS. This bill serves a need that we already have seen in Hawaiito reduce litter and increase recycling by encouraging businesses to work together in a partnership with government to reclaim glass. plastic bottles. and cans that accumulate on our shores. in our landfills. and along our streets. The bill sets up a deposit charge that can be reclaimed when the beverage container is returned. The legislation sets a measurable performance standard of 80 percent recovery rate for used. empty beverage containers for recycling or reuse. The bill was crafted to address the concerns of industry. retain the authority of individual States. and promote a healthy environment. It empowers the beverage container industry to design a container recycling program that best fits its business requirements to meet the 80 percent goal. States like Hawaii and 10 other States across the Nation that already have bottle bills will be able to continue their programs as long as the programs meet the national performance standard. It aims to protect and preserve our Nations natural resources and reduce costs to counties. cities. and residents. In my own State. Hawaii recently enacted a beverage container bill which will take effect in 2005. As our Nation prepares to celebrate America Recycles Day on Saturday. November 15. I am optimistic that the National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2003 will help keep our parks. beaches. and roadsides cleaner. reduce burdens on landfills. decrease ground water contamination. save energy. lower taxes for disposal costs. and create new industries and jobs.

It is regrettable that. at least at this point. we have not reached a time agreement on the FAA conference report. A lot of work has gone into the bill on both sides. A lot of negotiation has gone into the conference agreement itself. Because there is no public assurance on the part of the administration that they are not prepared to at least examine the impact of privatization. we are unable to reach agreement with regard to the time on the FAA conference report at this time. I am still hopeful that perhaps before the time we reach the cloture vote. the scheduled time for the cloture vote on Monday. the administration will at least give additional thought to a proposal that has been made now on both sides of the aisle that they simply join with us in examining more carefully the implications of privatization prior to the time it is decided. A 1year moratorium. an examination of the ramifications of privatization is what we are seeking. With that assurance I think we could get a vote of 100 to 0. perhaps. on this bill. I am very hopeful that is still within the realm of possibility. If it were not for that. I think we would have agreement this afternoon. So I only note that. given the fact that we still have time before next Monday to come to some agreement with regard to how to proceed on privatization.

I have worked to make it easier for other families to experience the joy my family did through adoption. This legislation will help that process by removing financial obstacles to adopting a child. As anyone who has been through an adoption knows. it can often by a very long. expensive process and for some families. the costs are so high as to be prohibitive. This legislation will help ensure that a family is not prevented from adopting a child simply because of the high costs involved.

That is very simply what we think is inherent in our rights as citizens. This law will strike at those rights on behalf of a powerful and influential industry. in this case the gun industry. There has been some suggestion we are trying to protect the courts from third party lawsuits when. in fact. the reality is these actions are based on the actions of the manufacturers and the dealers. not the actions of someone with a gun. This is based upon the standard of care of the manufacturer and the dealer. not what an individual may or may not have done with a firearm. These are not third party lawsuits. These are lawsuits brought by victims. Americans who have suffered themselves personally or suffered through the death or injury of their family members. They are going to court and they are simply saying these manufacturers or these gun dealers have violated their duty to be reasonable. their duty to be prudent. the duty of every individual who lives in an organized society to behave in a way that does not unnecessarily bring harm to others. That is the essence of our law. This legislation turns all of that on its head and says for a very special class. the gun lobby. the rules of the game do not apply.

I used to have a lot of respect for my friends on the other side of the aisle when they called themselves fiscal conservatives. The Republicans can never again call themselves fiscal conservatives. The American people are not foolish. Each person. each household in America understands that in a budget you only spend as much as you have. If you keep overspending year after year. if you spend more money than you take in time and time again. bad things happen. and that is what is happening here. We are having an orgy of tax cuts. and we have an unbalanced budget. and we are passing on a legacy of debt to our children and our grandchildren. Shame on us. We fought long and hard in this Chamber to balance the budget during the Clinton Presidency. We succeeded by making hard choices. Yet today we are presented with an easy choice. borrow and spend. The borrowandspend Republicans have hit once again. Shame on the majority for this sham budget. When the House debated the budget resolution earlier this year. I rose in opposition to it because it is a big fat IOU to our children and grandchildren. It is unfair. Shame on the majority for abandoning PAYGO for spending and tax cuts. We should vote down this quick and easy fix. Let us make the hard choices that we were elected to make. Let us pass a budget that balances soon. not one that never balances. and not a phony one that is only 1 year because we want to masquerade the sham that we are causing.",

The budget of the United States of America should be a blueprint for our Nation. but this budget only extends 1 year. We used to make 10year budgets. and then our friends on the other side of the aisle got more modest in their expectations. It was reduced to 5 years because they were afraid for the American people to see what lay in the 5 years beyond. Now. they are apparently afraid for the American people to see what lies beyond 1 year. We should be preparing for the future. We should be living within our means. And for all the good things that have been said about this budget. it hides the largest budget deficit in American history. Now. if that were temporary. that would be one thing. But what we are looking at are permanent structural deficits that will burden this economy and burden our children and grandchildren for generations. They are doing irreparable harm to our Nation. There were some good reasons for a temporary deficit. but not for a permanent structural deficit. My Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle are good people. but they have been misled by ideology into abandoning principles like payasyougo. which helped rescue our Nation before from a sea of debt. They have abandoned the principle of fiscal responsibility that used to be the lodestar for the Republican Party.

    "speech": "ida. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to be here this evening to discuss how well we treated the veterans in this budget. Since Republicans took control of Congress in 1995. we have made great strides in improving the benefits for our Nations veterans. During that period. total spending on veterans has increased from $38 billion to $60 billion. That is a 58 percent increase compared with only a 36 percent increase during the previous 10 years when the Democrats were in control. And since 1995. payments per veteran have actually risen by 79 percent. Let us take a moment to review some of the most important improvements. For example. in veterans medical care. the Republican Congress has expanded eligibility for medical care in 1996 and 1999. As a result. the number of veterans using the VA medical care has increased from 2.5 million in 1995 to almost 4.7 million today. Since 1995. the total spending on veterans medical care has increased from $16.2 billion to $28.3 billion this year alone. That is a 75 percent increase. In veterans educational benefits. since 1995 monthly education benefit levels under the MontgomeryGI bill increased from $405 to $985. a 143 percent increase. This compares with only a 35 percent increase during the time that the Democrats had control. . And under the 40 years of Democrat control prior to us taking control. there was no progress made whatsoever on concurrent receipt. We are very fortunate now that military retirees who are injured in combat or while training for combat or who are 50 percent or greater service disabled are eligible for the first time to receive retirement benefits concurrent with their veterans disability compensation. There is no doubt that the Republicans have helped the veterans in this budget.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this Budget Conference Report and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support. I want to thank Budget Chairman JIM NUSSLE for his yeomans work under difficult circumstances. My friends. this is a wartime budget. We are at war. a war started on September 11. 2001. This is world war. stretching from Afghanistan to Iraq. to almost every other continent on the globe. This war has two battlefields. One is the foreign theater. where our troops are fighting a more conventional war. fought by our brave soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Department of Defense is coordinating this fight. The other battlefield is here at home. where we are fighting against unknown terrorists. Our Department of Homeland Security is coordinating that fight. This budget includes responsible increases for both Departments. It also includes 50 billion dollars for possible additional expenditures on the war. Everything else is kept at a freeze level. To those who dont like this budget. I say this is the most fiscally responsible budget conference report we have considered on the House floor since I have been in the Congress. Now some of our friends on the other side of the aisle dont like the modest number we include for tax relief in this budget. But they wont be satisfied until we raise taxes on every man. woman and child in America. We keep the tax cuts in place because the tax cuts keep the economy growing. In fact. since we last met on the floor to talk about the budget. the economy has grown so quickly. that the estimates of the 10year budget deficit have dropped by a hundred billion dollars. That is why we want to keep the tax cuts in place. To keep more people working. to keep the economy growing. to keep America strong. and to win this war. That is why we need to pass this budget. Mr. Speaker. lets pass this budget and start the process of getting our work done for the rest of the year.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we know. the policies weve put in place to support economic growth are working. But in addition to getting and keeping the economy going. we must also control spending. It matters. If youre going to say that deficits matter. youd better believe that spending matters. All spending must be paid for. either through taxes or borrowingand both are burdens on the economy. And for that simple reason alone. controlling spending is itself a policy for sustaining stronger economic growth. This budget calls for several measures to help us get our hands around what has become an unsustainable rate of spending growth. This includes holding the line on all nondefense. nonhomeland security spending. As Chairman NUSSLE mentioned earlier. this wont be easy. Many of us here in Congress have gotten pretty comfortable signing off on huge spending increases. and freeflowing new spending. But success at keeping taxes and spending down will mean a stronger economy and better standards of living for our Nation. If we dont control spending the result will be higher borrowing or higher taxes. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has agreed that we need to control spending. not raise taxes. if we want to make sure that we dont harm our economy and our standards of living. Here is his quote: Tax rate increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks are very difficult to estimate. but they are of enough concern. in my judgment. to warrant aiming to close the fiscal gap primarily. if not wholly. from outlay restraint. The simple translation of what he said is that we need to restrain spending because the economy would be hurt by higher taxes. Our budget resolution does just that: it restrains spending and keeps taxes from increasing. Thats good for our economy. and its good for our Nation.",

Arizona. the Bob Stump Veterans Affairs Medical Center. I would like to thank members of his staff. Delores Dunn.

Mr. Speaker. what I did was I submitted legislation to provide vouchers for health care to local hospitals. That legislation is not in this particular bill. However. this legislation expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should take steps to ensure that an appropriate mix of facilities and clinical staff is available for health care for veterans residing in rural areas. I really applaud members for getting that in there. because I think that is badly needed. In addition. the legislation also contains a requirement that 120 days after the date of enactment of this legislation. the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the Committee on Veterans Affairs of the Senate and the House a report describing the steps the Secretary is taking to improve access to health care for veterans residing in rural areas. So I applaud Members for getting that in there and also requiring at least a 120day report. We appreciate this. I would like to thank my colleagues for including these important provisions. and thank them for this bill. I urge support.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment would provide an additional $375 million for VA medical care to address the medical needs of returning veterans from the war in Iraq. This funding would be used to meet the funding requirements of the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 which entitles. for 2 years following participation in combat. that any active duty service member is immediately eligible to receive VA health care upon release or separation from service. These funds will be needed at some point in the future but this amendment does not meet the requirements of this supplemental as funding that is needed immediately to address concerns related to homeland security or the war in Iraq. And while I agree with my colleagues that VA medical care is not meeting the medical needs of veterans in a timely manner and there is much to be improved. the problem is as much systemic as it is funding. However. this funding is not needed now on the heels of the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill in which we appropriated some $23.9 billion for VA medical care. This funding level was an increase of some $2.6 billion over the fiscal year 2003 level and $1.15 billion over the fiscal year 2003 Budget Request. The VA medical system has all the funds that it can absorb this year and will be able to meet the medical needs of any returning veterans from the war in Iraq. We will need additional funding for VA medical care in the future but that is the job of the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2005 appropriations bills. I also do not want to leave my colleagues with the false impression that VA medical care is broken. Yes. there are problems with patient backlog. but I can assure you that Secretary Principi has made a commitment to fix VA medical care and has made significant strides in addressing veteran concerns. reducing patient backlog and improving VA medical care.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it seems the issue now is not whether we are going to meet this responsibility which we have taken on ourselves by a vote of this Senate and the House of Representatives to provide to returning combat veterans. men and women who actually were under fire. a 2year period of access to the Veterans Administration health care services. The issue seems to be when we should make this commitment. My answer to that question would be: Now. The fact is. unless this war goes on much longer than the administration or any American prays that it will. there will be returning veterans. particularly reservists who. as soon as they complete their period of active duty. are going to be eligible for these health care costs. I hope we are not taking the position that this war is going to drag on so long that no reservist. no National Guard member will be eligible for these benefits prior to September 30 of this year. There also will be regular duty combat soldiers who will be separating from service and therefore become eligible. I believe. if we are concerned about the morale of our service men and women and wish to show American support for their gallant service. there is no better way to do it than to indicate that we are fully committed to meet our responsibilities to those men and women when they return home. The issue is. is there enough money in the VA budget to accept this new responsibility? The VA. just 2 months ago. terminated the eligibility of several hundred thousand veterans because of the financial pressures that they were under at that time. The increase in the veterans budget. which is applauded. essentially represents the cost of medical inflation from one year to the next. There are no significant real dollar additional resources for the VA to carry this new responsibility. I urge the Senate not table this amendment but. rather. to enthusiastically endorse it as a tangible statement of our commitment to the men and women of America who are. today. putting their lives at risk in order to achieve Iraqi freedom.",

Just to know how this would affect an employee of a given company. an officer of a given company. or anyone else. I think creates a whole miasma of very real problems.

I am one who voted to authorize the President with the use of force. Most of the larger countries in the world disagree. Additionally. the French and the Germans. in many ways in the war against terror. have been helpful to the United States. Those of us who serve on the Intelligence Committee know this. We know that intelligence comes from both of those nations which is instrumental in helping in the war on terror. The unilateral approach of this country is subject to some concern by other countries. That is not necessarily a bad thing. This is the first time in Americas history we have unilaterally. with Great Britain. with the help of a couple thousand Australians. and with some tacit support of other countries in different ways. some public. some not public. essentially invaded another sovereign nation. There is a difference of opinion as to whether we should have stayed at the United Nations. I happen to share that view. I believe we should have worked to have made this more multilateral. I believe we should have taken the time to do so. But we chose not to do that. The administration chose not to do it. For the Senate to pass this amendmentyou might as well include a whole host of other countries in thissets us upon a very bad course of action.

Our amendment narrows it. It was said there are countries that have been opposing America around the world. not just France and Germany. I agree. But it is France and Germany that have been leading the fight. That is the reason we targeted those two countries. In World War II. European security was threatened. America came to the rescue. In Kosovo. European security was threatened. America came to the rescue. With Iraq. American security is threatened and Germany and France are AWOL. It would be entirely inappropriate for the money from an emergency supplemental bill to pay for the war and pay for reconstruction of Iraq. for those moneys to go to countries that have attempted to lead the world against us in protecting our own security. in liberating the Iraqi people. and in ridding the Middle East of one of the most brutal dictators it has ever seen.

It goes on to point out: Blair visited Bush at Camp David last week and readily acknowledged the bruises left by the rancorous United Nations debate before the war. When Bush was asked about the many nations that declined to join the Iraq war alliance. he replied only that the United States and Britain had plenty of Western allies that continue to stand with us. Blair. however. frankly conceded that many countries disagree with what we are doing. How that divide Is handled now and after the war will affect global relationships for years to come.

Both newspapers call for a special counsel to investigate the White Houses role in this leak. and the Chronicle suggests that Congress might need to conduct its own inquiry. The Washington Post and ABC News recently conducted a poll that found that seven out of ten Americans support a special counsel to investigate this serious matter. I support many of my colleagues in the House and Senate who have called for a special counsel for similar reasons as stated by these newspapers. It is not credible that the United States Attorney General. John Ashcroft. can independently investigate a potential crime by this White House when not only was he appointed by President Bush but he employed the presidents top political adviser on numerous occasions to help him in his Senate election campaign. The credibility of this Administration is already low. when you consider their failure to revive the economy. the clearly misleading nature of the evidence they provided to justify a war in Iraq. and their failure to properly prepare for the postwar conflict.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor the life and accomplishments of Mother Teresa of Calcutta who will be beatified by Pope John Paul II in Rome on October 19. 2003. Born in Albania on August 26. 1910. Mother Teresa decided to become a Roman Catholic sister in 1928. She was assigned to a convent in Calcutta and became a teacher of geography and history at St. Marys School. In 1948. Mother Teresa founded a religious order known as Missionaries of Charity to help the poor. the suffering. and the dying in Calcutta and around the world. Today. there are approximately 5.000 sisters in the order and over 400 missions around the globe. Later in life. Mother Teresa focused her energies on hospice programs for those with AIDS. She offered unconditional love to everyone. regardless of class or position in life. Because of her actions. she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985. Few people in recent history have done more to help their fellow human beings than Mother Teresa. It is a privilege to recognize a person who has brought care and comfort to millions. I hope you and my other distinguished colleagues will join me in honoring her lifetime of service and dedication to the people of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor one of the United States most reliable allies. the Republic of China. on the occasion of its National Day. October 10. That great nation. better known as Taiwan. has served as a mirror on our times. reflecting the agonies and dreams of the 20th Century and the soaring aspirations of the new century. The ROC was born of the tragedy of Communist betrayal. reared in the tension of the cold war. and reached maturity during the information age. The ROC was the first casualty of Imperial Japanese aggression and our staunch ally in the fight to free the Pacific of that tyranny. In 1949. Chinese Communists seized power on the mainland and the central government of the Republic of China relocated to Taiwan. Since that time. we have rightfully considered Taiwans security of vital interest to the United States. In 1950. President Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan from attack by the Chinese Communists and we have maintained a presence in the area ever since. Moreover. the Congress has consistently expressed its support of the ROC since the passage of Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Mr. Speaker. Taiwan has developed into Asias premier democracy. having peacefully evolved from one party rule to the vibrant home of multiparty elections. It has seen opposition parties succeed the ruling KMT. the party of National founder. Chiang Kaishek and the popular election of its legislative branch. Taiwans political development has been complemented by its economic rise as one of Asias \"Four Tigers.\" along with Hong Kong. Singapore. and South Korea. Since 1949. the ROCs economy has moved from a leader in agricultural exports. to a major manufacturer of small electronics and consumer goods. to todays premier Asian producer of capital- and technologyintensive commodities. such as personal computers and machinery. Because its economy has achieved such rapid growth. Taiwan boasts one of the worlds highest standards of living. with only 1 percent of its population below the poverty line in 2000. Today. the ROC is an irreplaceable part of the world economy and vital to continued growth here in the U.S. I know that my colleagues will join me in wishing Taiwans President Chen Shuibian. its Representative here in the U.S.. C.J. Chen and the 23 million people of Taiwan a most happy National Day and continued peace and prosperity.",

I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate President Chen Shuibian and the people of Taiwan for their continuing political reforms and economic achievements. Mr. Speaker. over the last decade. Taiwan has established itself as a strong and successful model of democracy. Under the leadership of President Chen. the government and people of Taiwan have continued to implement domestic reforms and strengthen diplomatic relations with surrounding nations. This continuing commitment to democratic progress can best be seen in next years elections. With both the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for 2004. next year will likely prove to be a politically dynamic and exciting year for Taiwan. I applaud the robust multiparty democracy that Taiwan has become. Mr. Speaker. along with its democratic development. Taiwan remains an important economic partner for the United States. We are Taiwans largest market. but Taiwan is our 7th largest trading partner. This is a remarkable achievement for this island nation of 22 million people. Taiwans accession to the World Trade Organization last year will set the stage for even greater opportunities for U.S. business. Mr. Speaker. as Taiwan continues to earn international acclaim as a model of democratic progress and free market economics. I call on my colleagues to join me in commending Taiwan during the upcoming celebration of Taiwans National Day.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the more than 70.000 Americans and their family members who are currently affected by Spina Bifida. October is National Spina Bifida Awareness Month. Spina Bifida is the Nations most common. permanently disabling birth defect. It is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central nervous system does not properly close during the early stages of pregnancy. Each year more than 4.000 pregnancies are affected and of these 1.500 babies are born with Spina Bifida. I would like to especially recognize Angeline GonzalezAbreu. the niece of my Chief of Staff. Arthur Estopinan. Angie is a precious little three year old who was born with Spina Bifida. She is an absolute delight who brings great joy to all who are blessed to know her. I have had the great pleasure of spending time with this vivacious little bundle of joy. and am moved by the tremendous progress she has made in her life thus far. The Spina Bifida Association of America (SBAA). an organization that has helped people with Spina Bifida and their families for nearly 30 years. works tirelessly to prevent and reduce suffering from this devastating birth defect. I would like to acknowledge and thank SBAA and the local chapters in my State for all that they have done for the Floridian families affected by this birth defect. The exact cause of Spina Bifida is not known. but researchers have concluded that women of childbearing age who take daily folic acid supplements reduce their chances of having a Spina Bifida pregnancy by up to 75 percent. I am proud to be a member of the newly established Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus. The Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus will bring increased attention to this condition and advance initiatives that will improve the quality of life for those individuals and their families living with Spina Bifida. I again wish to thank the SBAA and its chapters for all of their hard work to prevent and reduce suffering from this birth defect and for their commitment to improve the lives of those 70.000 individuals living with Spina Bifida throughout our Nation. I wish the Spina Bifida Association of America the best of luck in its endeavors and urge all of my colleagues and all Americans to support its important efforts.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of House Resolution 173. This resolution recognizes the achievements and contributions of the National Wildlife Refuge System on the occasion of its centennial anniversary and expresses strong support for the continued success of the National Wildlife Refuge System. On March 14. 1903. President Theodore Roosevelt set aside Pelican Island off Floridas east coast to preserve the natural beauty of the islands for future generations. This act gave birth to a vision for America that has become the National Wildlife Refuge System. Each year. millions of people who share Teddy Roosevelts passion for the outdoors and his devotion to preserving these places visit and enjoy more than 540 refuges and nearly 100 million acres nationwide all set aside for the wildlife that live and visit these areas and for the people that treasure these natural wonders. In my Southern New Jersey District. we have much to be thankful for with the trio of jewels that are the Supawna Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Salem County. the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Atlantic and Burlington Counties. and the Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in Cape May County. These three refuges provide both a welcome respite for important species who visit in this area as well as places for thousands of visitors to see these species in their natural habitat. Throughout my service in Congress. I have been proud to work to preserve and enhance these wildlife refuges. However. much of the credit for the hard work of protecting our wildlife refuges must go to the dedicated employees and volunteers at each of our local refuges. Without their dedication and drive. these refuges would not be a living realization off Teddy Roosevelts dream which began a century ago. It is my hope that one hundred years from now. those who visit these national treasures are as astounded and inspired by the same beauty that the National Wildlife Refuge System is working so hard to preserve today.",

S. 162 authorizes a plan for the distribution of a $7 million dollar final judgment award to eligible members of the Gila River Indian community. Pursuant to the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. the Secretary of the Interior must submit to Congress for approval a plan for the use and distribution of such judgment awards. In 1951 the community filed a complaint before the Indian Claims Commission claiming failure of the United States to protect the communitys use of water from the Gila and Salt Rivers. After the Commission and the Court of Claims found the United States liable to the community. the community agreed to a monetary settlement in the amount of $7 million. Final judgment was entered against the United States in that amount. This legislation represents the final step in resolving the litigation and is a product of close consultation between the community and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker. I am proud to support S. 162. which is before us this afternoon. and pleased that we are dispensing with this bill early in the session. This bill will provide the authority needed to distribute judgment awards funds to members of the Gila River PimaMaricopa Indian community in the State of Arizona.

That is 52 years surrounding the failure of our government. the United States Government. to adequately protect the use of water from the Gila River and the Salt River on behalf of the tribal community. In 1972 the Indian Claims Commission found the United States liable to the community with regard to the underlying complaint. and in 1982 the U.S. Court of Claims agreed with that finding. A monetary settlement in the amount of $7 million has been agreed to. and today we will ratify the distribution of those funds according to the wishes of the community. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker. again.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the author of H.R. 274. I am pleased the House is considering this legislation to expand the boundaries of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. which is located in my congressional district. Garrett Island. which consists of approximately 180 acres. was the site of Marylands second settlement in the 1600s. I( is the only rocky island in the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay system. and it is a vital link between the Susquehanna River and the Bay. It also provides habitat to 44 different bird species. including eagles. Common Loons. Tundra Swans and 14 species of ducks. I have visited Garrett Island and there is no question that its rich history. geographic location and wildlife resource values make it an excellent candidate for inclusion within the National Wildlife Refuge system. As a nation. we can ill afford to allow unique places. like Garrett Island. to be lost forever. While I am disappointed that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not endorsed this idea. I was pleased to hear the agency testify that. \"Given the Islands historic and archaeological values. its recreational opportunities. and its environmental education and interpretation potential. a concerted effort should be put forth to provide longterm protection and management of the island.\" This is the goal of H.R. 274. The Cecil Land Trust has done everything it can to protect this important property. contributing $150.000 toward the purchase of the island. Based on our hearing. Federal acquisition costs will be less than $400.000. and little. if any. maintenance or personnel will be required in the future. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation had it right when it wrote that steps must be taken to \"ensure protection of this largely unspoiled. historical and ecological gem.\" I would urge my Colleagues to vote \"aye\" on H.R. 274! This is an important and necessary inclusion in our National Wildlife Refuge system. which celebrated its 100th birthday last month. This is exactly the type of place that Theodore Roosevelt had in mind when this unique system of public lands was created.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the perseverance of Noe Gutierrez. who has been chosen the National Adult Learner of the Year for 2003. The Shelbyville. Tennessee. resident has overcome many obstacles in his life while pursuing an education and a better way of life. The Council on Adult Basic Education chose Noe to receive the award because he epitomizes those who want to empower their lives through knowledge. Noe has not faltered in that pursuit. Twenty years ago Noe had to leave his native Guatemala to avoid being forced into fighting with a band of guerrilla soldiers who were engaged in a bloody civil war against the government. At just 12 years old. Noe said goodbye to his parents and eight siblings and migrated to the United States where he worked as a migrant farm worker until some Good Samaritans intervened on his behalf. Noe received his high school diploma through the Bedford County (Tennessee) Adult High School. a much more difficult task than simply attaining a General Educational Development certificate. Now Noe works at the WalMart Distribution Center in Shelbyville. where he has been welcomed with open arms by the community. Noe is an inspiration for not only immigrants to the United States. but also to anyone who has had to overcome hardships in life. I congratulate Noe for his outstanding achievement and wish him and his family the best of luck in their future endeavors.",

National security does it. its team. There is a domestic team. There is an economic team. So when the CIA probably said. no. you cannot use this. everybodys eyes in State. Defense. NSE. everybodys eyes saw that it was not valid. That is the same team that edits and previews and reviews the Presidents speech in January. So everybody who was participatory in the October speech was the same body sitting in the room participating in the State of the Union speech. I think again people this weekend. for whom George Tenet seems to be wearing the laundry. or they are throwing him under the truck. remember. this was not good enough 2 weeks later for the Secretary of State who said. and I am quoting. \"This is crap. I am not going to use this.\" The Secretary of State threw it out. We had George Tenet sitting behind them at the U.N. 2 weeks after the State of the Union. They knew it was not good then. If it was not good enough for the Secretary of State 2 weeks after the State of the Union. it was not good enough for the President in October. but somehow it has become good enough for the President at the State of the Union. a speech on the doorstep of a war where the world was hanging on every word.",

Yet when we talk this week about increasing funding for Head Start. we are told no money. Last week when we voted and there was a 6year freeze put on Pell Grants. college assistance for people trying to open up the doors for higher education for themselves. we are told there are no resources. Yet we will be asked later on to commit resources to the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq to the tune of $50 billion. Yet here at home. we will be told there are no resources for health care or infrastructure. The gentleman may say that the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. I wonder if anybody knows what they are planning in Iraq and what they are planning here at home when it comes to our own economic development. The American people from World War II forward have been tremendously generous around the world. and yet they cannot continue to be asked to be that generous when their own needs and hopes and dreams for their own children are being denied. whether that is in the area of health care. investment in our environment. or our own economic development.

Earlier this evening the gentleman from the other side of the aisle mentioned the talk shows and the statements that are being made have a political context to them. We have been here. as the gentleman well knows. for 5 weeks posing these questions. This is not motivated by Democratic intent to secure political advantage. If we did not do this. we would be abrogating our responsibility within our system to find the truth. It is about a search for the truth. and I dare say it is now time for the President of the United States and Congress to come together to create an independent commission. not one that has partisan overtones. but one. for example. that served this country well under the leadership of two former Senators. a Republican from New Hampshire. Warren Rudman. and a Democratic from Colorado. Gary Hart. who I think made an extraordinary contribution by a years worth of hearings. even more. which ended up with a product that tragically predicted what occurred on September 11. We need that because I do not want to hear on this floor accusations about partisanship. This is about the future of America. That is what this is about. This ought not be about politics. Let us depoliticize that now and let the Republican and the Democratic leadership with the White House create an independent commission to reveal to the American people the truth.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I do not know if the gentleman from Washington is familiar with the report that was printed last week in The New York Times that a senior intelligence agent. Iraqi intelligence agent by the name of Ahmed AlAni was arrested. I imagine the gentleman does remember. however. that some suggested he had met in Prague and the Czech Republic with Mohammed Atta. who was the ring leader in the attack on the United States back on 9/11. That appeared in the media and administration officials said that that evidence held up. That alleged meeting occurred in April 2001. 5 months before 9/11. Since then. most intelligence agencies. both American and allies. have cast doubt on the credibility of that purported meeting. but it was used by administration officials to argue there was an alliance of some sort between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. And of course we all know that the rationale for the attack on Iraq was based on two premises: Saddam Hussein had in his possession weapons of mass destruction. particularly nuclear weapons or close to achieving the development or the possession of nuclear weapons. and that he could provide and was purportedly inclined to use terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda for the use of those weapons against the United States. So that theory. as the gentleman suggests. was crucial. that fact of the alleged meeting was crucial to that particular theory. But again. there is serious doubt as to whether that meeting occurred. It is interesting to note that both the FBI and the CIA investigated and could find no evidence whatsoever that at the pertinent times did Mr. Atta leave the United States to go to the Czech Republic for that meeting. However. it did serve the purpose of creating a sense of urgency that quick action had to be taken against Iraq.",

Yet this is the one time in history that while we deny American people the access to education. health care and improved investment in their environment and economic development. we are asking them to call forth in a tremendous effort not seen since World War II to make an investment in another countrys economic future when we have told them to shorten the horizons for their own children. to shorten their own homes and dreams for what they can provide their family. Yet we are calling upon them to once again show their generosity to Iraq that talks about a health care plan. an economic development plan. an education plan for Iraq and yet those same agenda items that we talk about here at home. we do not have. As we know. a number of my colleagues have signed on. I have my own bill called the American Parity Act that says whatever we invest in Iraq. whatever goal we set in Iraq. we have to set here at home equally. Whether that comes from half the population getting health care. half the schools being reconstructed and modernized. teachers being paid. 4 million kids in early childhood education. reconstruction of a port for economic development purposes. we have got to do that agenda item here at home. Otherwise. the generosity of the American people showed over the last 60 years will come short and rightfully so.",

Let me ask my colleagues to respond to what we would like to see happen in Iraq. There are 8 or 10 or 15 things perhaps that we might recommend. I would suggest one. and perhaps my colleagues can make further comment. I think we need to start with a full explanation by the President of his vision for what is happening. for the costs that he believes will be necessary to complete the reconstruction. the timetable for that. the number of U.S. military forces that would be needed. The President needs to come clean. He has a growing credibility gap in my view because of the use and possible misuse of the intelligence leading up to the war. the statements made with such certainty that we are now learning the White House was being advised by intelligence agencies that things were not so certain at all and by the fact. as we have commented earlier tonight. that since the President. as our colleague from Illinois says. flew onto that aircraft carrier and declared victory. that 30 American soldiers have been assassinated and 84. as the gentleman points out. have died in some fashion since military victory has been declared.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on that point in reference to what the gentleman from Washington said and the gentleman from Pennsylvania observed to kick off this discussion. as the gentleman from Pennsylvania can see. his question was so pertinent that we have not gotten much further in it. and for good reason. because it requires some explication. The problem is here. if we do not do this. is a credibility gap. What will the President be able to say about North Korea? What will he be able to say about the Philippines? What will he be able to say about Colombia? What will he be able to say further about Afghanistan? Afghanistan seems to have disappeared. yet I know there were two attacks yesterday. one on the American base and one on U.N. personnel. I do not believe anybody was killed. but who knows? Now we are told there are more attacks in Iraq than necessarily are being reported. I suppose that gets quotidian now. If they are on the 11 oclock news at night. they have got fires to report. they have assaults to report or basketball players or the latest boxer to embarrass himself or something of that nature. They hardly have time to fit in anymore how many people got killed today. It is almost a loss leader in the news. And so if we do not have some answers here. if the President does not take control and stop being dismissive of these questions as merely revising history or some other sarcastic observation. he is not going to be able nor will the administration be able to convince others who may find it in their interest to join with us in other circumstances. He will not be able to find anyone who is going to be willing to take us at our word. That is why this is so serious. It is way beyond partisan. Other people will occupy these seats down here. Other people will come to occupy our place. We are here only as long as the faith and trust of the people in our constituencies are willing to put us here. No one owns a seat in this Congress. No one owns a seat at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue either. We are only as good as the credibility with our own people before we can hope to influence others.",

The members of the Queens Chapter #32 have truly earned our gratitude. admiration. and appreciation. At the dedication ceremony for Vietnam Veterans Lane. the \"Order of the Silver Rose\" will be presented to several Chapter members who have suffered from a multitude of illnesses and symptoms associated with exposure to \"Agent Orange.\" These veterans continue to pay a price for their willingness to serve our country. and it is only fitting that we acknowledge their sacrifice on behalf of all of us. Although it has been just over three decades since our troops engaged in active combat in Vietnam. we will never forget the bravery of all those who served and the ultimate sacrifice of the more than 58.000 military personnel who gave their lives in service to their country.

She came up to me with a small container of sand in her hand and shared with me her desire to return that sand to Vieques with me after the Navy bombing practices ended. With passion and sincerity this girl represented what so many had felt for so long. I told her that sooner or later such a day would come. and we would return that sand to Vieques together. Fl 1600 Indeed. such a day is upon us. As of today. Vieques is no longer a Navy bombing range. and has become the newest addition to the National Wildlife Refuge System. I have with me a copy of the letter and memorandum of agreement signed between the Navy and the Fish and Wildlife Service making official that land transfer and ask that it be made part of the RECORD. For the first time in over 60 years. Viequeses awoke this morning. their island not having been bombed last night. the island not to be bombed today. and knowing for certain that the island shall never be bombed again. Now the shore of Vieques will be dominated only by the sound of the surf. the birds. and the wind. The thousands of Puerto Ricans living in Vieques achieved their longsought peace. Today \"Pas para Vieques\" is a reality. For generations. the Viequeses have not known life without bombing. Thousands of families have lived their whole life with the concussion of bombs and shells upon their island at night. during the day. in the coastal waters. Vieques became a bombing and training range for the Navy in the 1940s during World War II. Without a doubt. much has been changed since then. While the bombing has continued. awareness about the island of Vieques has grown. Viequeses and Puerto Ricans reached out. and shared with people what was happening to their island. Well. over a hundred Members of Congress actively supported bringing an end to the bombing. I must note a few of them. particularly the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and my colleagues. the gentleman from Illinois . the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from New York .

This committee would be tasked to oversee the realm of collaborative efforts of not just health. but also benefits and other areas to promote increased resource sharing between the two departments. While statutory authority to allow resource sharing has existed for more than 20 years. the latest figures tell us that the level of sharing between the VA and DOD remains relatively low. The Federal Government can and must do more to increase resource sharing whenever and wherever feasible. This bill would allow the Joint Executive Committee to identify changes in policies. to improve services. efficiencies and opportunities for collaboration in order to deliver benefits and services to beneficiaries of both departments. Inefficiencies and duplication not only waste taxpayer dollars. they shortchange military personnel. retirees and veterans seeking the services offered by VA and DOD. I believe the expansion of this Joint Executive Committee would facilitate necessary discussions and decisions that will ultimately lead to greater efficiencies within and between the two departments. I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey of the Veterans Affairs Committee for his cooperation in developing this very important piece of legislation. It is time that these departments seize the opportunity and take full advantage of the benefits that come from sharing their extensive resources.",

Justice Enoch filed a concurring opinion. joined by Justice Baker. Justice Gonzales filed a concurring opinion. joined by Justice Enoch. Three Justices dissented in this case. each filing the own separate opinion. The dissenting opinions were written by Justice Hecht. Justice Owen. and Justice Abbott. Justice Gonzales. in his concurring opinion. very clearly voices criticism of the dissenting opinions: The dissenting opinions suggest that the exceptions to the general rule of notification should be very rare and require a high standard of proof. I respectfully submit that these are policy decisions for the Legislature.... Thus. to construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses. or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute. would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism. As a judge. I hold the rights of parents to protect and guide the education. safety. health. and development of their children as one of the most important rights in our society. But I cannot rewrite the statute to make parental rights absolute. or virtually absolute. particularly when. as here. the Legislature has elected not to do so. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee states that Justice Owen did not write the opinion that Justice Gonzales criticized. I fail to see how Senator HATCH can reach that conclusion.

And they are timely. and they are timeless. In the year 55 B.C.. Cicero wrote. \"The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must be reduced. the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to foreign governments must be reduced. if the Nation does not want to go bankrupt.\" Real Federal spending today is at its highest level per person since World War II. And despite the conservative instincts of many of our appropriators in this Congress. the current budget process adopted by a liberal Democratic Congress in 1974 was designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to guarantee the growth of the Federal Government. And that Big Government Democratic spending scheme has worked like a charm for 30 years. In a word. Mr. Chairman. it is not the appropriators. it is the appropriation process. So let us gather tonight in that spirit. to focus on the changes that will give our spending committee the tools that they need to do what Republicans came to Washington to do. to practice fiscal responsibility. to put our fiscal house in order and achieve a balanced Federal budget. And the stakes could not possibly be higher. Abraham Lincoln said. and I quote. \"If we do not make common cause to save the good old ship of the Union on this voyage. nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another.\" Let us get behind these resolutions. these changes in this budget process. let us engage in the debate and serve the publics interest in the best way that a Republican Congress knows how. through fiscal discipline. through real reform.",

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are right on one thing. this Congress does need to control the outrageous budget deficit that is fast approaching $500 billion. However. if we want to make serious progress in reducing this deficit. PAYGO rules must be applied to spending and tax cuts. Exempting tax cuts from these budget enforcement rules makes no fiscal sense. Additionally. it threatens to increase the deficit and the burden on our children and our grandchildren. the one that they will have to bear is unfathomable if we do not act responsibly today. The original PAYGO rules passed by Congress and signed by the first President Bush were essential to restoring this countrys fiscal health the last time we faced record deficits. Those rules worked because they applied it to both sides of the equation. spending and tax cuts. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are serious about fiscal responsibility. they would be offering a PAYGO proposal that applies it to entitlement program spending as well as tax cuts. Failing to apply PAYGO rules to tax cuts is little more than a smoke screen that seeks to hide the major contributing factor of this Nations growing deficit. As this country faces record deficits in increased spending on homeland security and the war in Iraq. now is the time for fiscal discipline. When I was a freshman. the thing I was most proud of. the issues I was most proud of serving were that we had a good surplus. we had low unemployment. and we had a good budget. This is a shame to all of us that are here. We ought to act responsibly on a bipartisan basis and come up with a decent budget proposal that not only affects spending but tax cuts as well.",

The underlying bill continues to avoid the elephant in the room. the cost of endless tax cutting and its role in helping create the largest deficits in American history. The Spratt substitute. on the other hand. will reinstitute real PAYGO provisions that might just reign in the reckless Republican majoritys mismanagement of the Federal budget. I believe that this mismanagement is intentional. While my colleagues on the other side say that they believe deficits do matter. their actions speak otherwise. In this session of Congress alone. the House has passed hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts. The tax cuts come even as we do not even have a budget. and the supporters do not care that the cost of these cuts will be borne by our children in the form of more debt that they will get saddled with. Why are we allowing these huge and growing deficits? It is called \"starving the beast.\" making the deficit so huge that it gives an argument against spending for the very programs the vast majority of Americans support. support because of our beliefs in what this country stands for and where we place our values. This fiscally irresponsible underlying bill ill serves this country. Also. disappointing. but not surprising. is the process under which these amendments are being debated. denying the House an opportunity to have a full and open debate on such an important issue. For example. the Stenholm substitute was not allowed on the floor and the reason is simple. It would probably win. The Republican leadership simply does not want to allow the House to vote on issues where the leadership cannot win. and we have seen this time and time again. Amendments where the majority of the House is in opposition to the leadership just never see the light of day.

Instead. we could go back to a tried and true method that worked in the 1990s. a payasyougo rule that made sense and brought balance and then budget surpluses that actually allowed us to reduce the national debt.

    "speech": "Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4663. the Republican Budget Enforcement bill and in support of the Spraft Democratic substitute. This bill is an irresponsible attempt to place the burden of reducing the large budget deficit brought about by huge. new tax cuts on the backs of the vast majority of Americans. The bill relies on onesided payasyougo rules that will worsen the deficit rather than improve it. The Budget Enforcement bill slashes spending on public services important to all Americans but allows unlimited deficits for tax cuts. If that wasnt bad enough. the Republican amendments also included this paygo provision as well as an entitlement cap that would put important government services at risk. Republicans would require that any improvements in entitlement programs be offset with cuts in programs like Medicaid. Medicare. veterans programs. food stamps. and student loans. As a result of the entitlement cap. veterans will get $1.3 billion less than what the House Veterans Affairs Committee says it needs for veterans health care programs next year. Education would be cut by more than $1.5 billion in 2006. All these programs would be cut so that important national priorities like tax cuts for the wealthy can be spared. This is their definition of compassionate conservatism. Because the republican bill would cap nondefense discretionary spending. investments in real priorities like education. veterans medical care. and law enforcement would be reduced. More Americans will be without access to adequate health care. more students will be left without financial resources to go to college. and more families will be left without hope. Instead. I support the Spraft substitute amendment. which would establish effective paygo rules for both spending and tax cuts. Just in case I need to remind anyone. that is the plan that led us out of the first Bush recession into an era of record surpluses in the 1990s.

There have been Members from time to time who have said. well. if an agency happened to sunset. then all the laws we passed that that agency administers would then go away and a lot of valuable programs disappear. We specifically have language here to ensure that the laws that administer various programs. and that are important to a lot of constituencies. do not disappear when the agency disappears. Having said that. in practical terms. when a sunset commission makes a recommendation to the Congress. if the Congress failed to be able to come to grips with the recommendations of the commission. what happens in most States. and it has certainly happened on a couple of occasions in Texas. is that the legislature. and I would hope the Congress. would simply extend the agency as it is and set a new sunset date to allow the process of review of that agency to continue. What we are trying to do here is create a bipartisan entity that has the credibility to make recommendations for change in operations of an agency. create new efficiencies. eliminate obsolete programs and obsolete offices. and to do it in a way that that commission and its recommendations have the same kind of weight that we all hope the 9/11 Commission will have. where once they have reported. there is some momentum behind what this bipartisan group has recommended to the Congress.

The Internet is a medium that in under a decade has completely changed the way we live in this country. And it still has enormous untapped potential to enrich our lives and improve and expand communications and commerce for all of our citizens. Email has been called the \"killer application\" of the Internet. and it is truly ubiquitous in our daily lives in a way that no one could have predicted only a few short years ago. But over the past few years. the spam problem has come to threaten the utility of email in very serious way. By passing this bill. the Senate has begun to address some of the worst abuses false and misleading headers and subject lines. fraudulent and pornographic solicitations. the harvesting of addresses and the hijacking of addresses to send unsolicited email. I am pleased also that the bill will allow legitimate commercial email to continue to be sent as long as the sender provides a way for the recipients to indicate that they do not want to receive such email in the future. Not all unsolicited commercial email is bad. Email is an inexpensive way for businesses to advertise their products and we should not try to stamp out all such communications. At the same time. some people dont want to receive such emails at all and they should be able to make that fact known and have their wishes respected. In addition to requiring that unsolicited commercial email give consumers the ability to opt out of future such communications. I am pleased that portions of Senator SCHUMERs bill. which I have cosponsored. will be incorporated into this bill because I believe a DoNotEmail List. modeled on the very popular DoNotCall List recently activated by the FTC. is something that should be created. Senator SCHUMERS proposal is a sensible and measured approach that I think will help get a DoNotEmail List off the ground promptly. It is time to stop spain from bogging down the great promise of the Internet and email. I am pleased to have voted for this important bill. and I appreciate all the efforts of the Senators who have brought us to this point.",

However with 24.6 million acres of forestland in the State of Georgia. which is nearly twothirds of my home State. major outbreaks of disease caused by pathogens and insects such as the southern pine beetle pose a significant threat to forests in the South. In 2002 alone. damage caused by the southern pine beetle totaled over $150 million. The forest community has waited long enough for comprehensive forest management legislation. It is time for the Senate to pass this legislation so that Americans have the tools to manage our Nations forestsby putting out fires and by reducing disease and insect pressure.

To many. he was Senator Mansfield. Majority Leader Mansfield. or Ambassador Mansfield. To us in Montana. he was just Mike. He was our Mike. He was humble. self effacing. and didnt want people making a big fuss about him. Although he wouldnt have wanted one. Id like to thank the University of Montana and their alumni for hosting an event here in the Capitol to commemorate the life and times of Mike through this new book. . Mike had three great loves in his life: his wife Maureen. his State of Montana and serving in the United States Senate. Maureen was the love of his life. He always said that his successes were because of her. The last time I visited Mike in the hospital his face lit up when he talked about her. \"What a gal.\" he said. \"What a gal she was.\" Mike was a good friend and a great inspiration to many people. including myself. Mike encouraged me to get into public service. he was my mentor when I was first elected to Congress. and he provided me sage counsel until his death. Mike would think that tonights event was too much. That is just the kind of man he was. But its our job to keep his memory alive and educate others on what a great impact he had on Montana. the Nation. and the world. Its our responsibility to ensure others can learn from his example of working together to do whats right. The University of Montana Alumni Association. the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library. the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center. and the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation here in Washington. D.C. all put forth a great effort to make this event possible. I greatly appreciate their hard work and dedication to the legacy of Maureen and Mike Mansfield. And finally. I wish to recognize Don Oberdorfer for his persistence and dedication in writing about Mikes life. I thank Don for honoring a great man. our Mike. Montanas Mike Mansfield.

His example has left a lasting impression on innumerable graduates of our medical school. The innovations he began at the University of New Mexico have served as models for other schools both in the United States and around the world. and many institutions have benefited from the leadership that Dr. Scott Obenshain has provided over the years. Finally. Dr. Obenshain has demonstrated continuing dedication to meeting the needs of poor. rural. and underserved communities in New Mexico. and has steadfastly achieved this by including such populations in the primary care curriculum. For example. he implemented the rural clinical practice component for fourth year medical students in 1974. which became a requirement for all students soon thereafter.

My constituents who face disabilities depend on those at the Disability Determination Services office to evaluate their claims and issue a fair and timely decision. Issuing these decisions quickly is of the utmost importance and makes a real difference to a lot of Montanans. The regional Social Security Administration Commissioner in Denver has recognized Montanas Disability Determination Services office for having the Nations best processing time for claims. The Helena office averages 68 days processing time as compared to the national average of 110 days. This important honor is for work accomplished during Federal fiscal year 2002. This office won the same award for fiscal year 1999. Additionally. in 2001. they were awarded the Commissioners Citation for Quality. Michelles office reviews about 12.000 claims for benefits each year. 2000 of which involve children.

Our home state of New Jersey has recently enacted Johns Law. which allows police agencies to impound the vehicles of drunken drivers. Johns Law is named after Navy Ensign John Elliott. John was driving from Annapolis to his home in Atlantic County. New Jersey for his mothers birthday. En route. his car was struck by a drunken driver. Both Elliott and the other driver were killed. Three hours earlier. the other driver had been arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. He was released into the custody of a friend. who drove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind the wheel. This tragedy brought attention to a loophole in State law which has since been corrected. The LoBiondo amendment would not mandate any action by the states. Rather. we hope it will encourage them to impound vehicles of DWl drivers as another important tool in the arsenal of alcoholimpaired countermeasures. If someone is arrested for drunk driving. it is logical that they not be allowed to get right back behind the wheel of their car. endangering other drivers. Police and public safety groups in New Jersey have praised this policy and I hope that other states will do the right thing by enacting similar laws that will save lives. On a personal level. I want to recognize the efforts of Bill Elliott. Johns father. who has not rested in his work to ensure that such a tragedy would never be repeated. Passage of the LoBiondo amendment will help Bill in his quest for better public policy. We can all hope for a day when what happened to the Elliott family will never happen to other families.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. vicarious liability laws in 3 states impose unlimited liability on car and truck renting and leasing companies for injury and property damage solely because they own the vehicles. Eight other states have some limited form of vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is \"liability without fault\" in that these companies have no involvement in or ability to prevent the accident. They cost consumers an average of $100 million annually. Companies nationwide are affected. not just in the few vicarious states. because the laws apply based on where the accident occurs. not where the car or truck is owned or registered. As a result. a car registered and rented in a nonvicarious state that gets into an accident in a vicarious state is subject to that states vicarious laws. Companies have no way to protect themselves against these laws. I propose adding to H.R. 3550 (TEA LU) a provision to eliminate vicarious liability nationwide. Under this provision. only a company that is at fault or negligent in an accident could be held liable for damages. T&I Chairman YOUNG. Highways Subcommittee Chairman PETRI. and Highways Subcommittee Ranking Member LIPINSKI all support this provision. Ranking Member OBERSTAR is noncommittal at this point. The amendment eliminates liability under state law for an owner of a motor vehicle who is engaged in the business of renting and leasing motor vehicles provided there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the motor vehicle owner. the owner must maintain the required state limits of financial responsibility for each vehicle in accordance to the state where the vehicle is registered. elimination of vicarious liability commences on the date of enactment. and defines \"motor vehicle\" and \"owner.\"",

I believe most members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee would agree we should provide at least as much funding nationally as the other body has. I remain concerned about ongoing attempts to raise the minimum guarantee rate in this bill to 95 percent. Raising the minimum guarantee not only destroys the concept of needsbased aid. it does so at a time when assistance is most urgently needed. Mr. Chairman. as this legislation moves to conference. it is critical that we remain committed to providing funding to the States that require improvements the most. That is how this body can serve the Nation best. and that is what this bill should aspire to.",

I only wish that the leadership of this House and the White House would follow their lead and the lead of the entire membership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. There are lots of good things in this bill. but I continue to believe that the overall funding level is not enough to meet our needs. In States all across this country. including Massachusetts. roads and bridges are crumbling under the burden of age and heavy use. Adequate infrastructure is essential for economic development. We can do better. and I am hopeful that in the very near future we will have the opportunity to return to transportation policy to finish the work that this bill begins. I was glad to hear the distinguished Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chair say that he would be back fighting for more money. and I will certainly stand with him in that effort. Mr. Speaker. I am also concerned about efforts by some Members to decrease highway safety and quality by increasing truck size and truck weight.

Every other administration has done better at creating jobs and growing the economy than the Bush administration has. For example. the gentleman from Virginia was just showing this other chart. which shows that it is the worst private sector job growth since World War II. In fact. if you look at this chart again. what you see is that since President Bush took office. we have lost almost 2.6 million private sector jobs in this country. No wonder the administration is concerned. In every other administration. except only the second term of the Eisenhower administration. there has been job growth in this country.

I am pleased that a bill has finally come forward that looks headed for passage into law. Through all this time. the flood of unsolicited emails has only grown. ISPs have become more and more overwhelmed. and consumers more aggravated. I know that this bill will come as a welcome relief to many who are fed up with opening their email accounts only have to unwanted commercial emails clogging up their Internet mailboxes. Consumers have to waste time deleting numerous spam emails. and even worse. if they do unsuspectingly open one of these emails. they are often faced with offensive pornography. I commend the members of the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees for their ongoing efforts to address this problem. and I am pleased to support this bill. I do believe that the bill falls short in one area. in that it does not provide a private right of action for individual consumers to seek their own remedies. But this legislation does much to strengthen enforcement. provide protection from harmful pornographic emails. and to set up a Do Not Spam Registry. which I can only guess will be as popular as the Do Not Call Registry. I hope that this bill will put control over Internet mailboxes back in the hands of consumers. so that they can choose to receive emails that they want. and to get rid of emails that they do not. And to those businesses and individuals that violate these provisions and send out spam illegally. this bill will provide the Federal Trade Commission. state attorney generals. and Internet Service Providers with the tools to crack down on these violators.

No one disputes the great utility of email. the fact that it has brought great efficiency and productivity gains. not only to our professional lives but also our personal lives. Nonetheless. our daily routine of scouring through and reviewing our email also tells us that email as a critical communications medium is under assault from unwanted emailmost peddling goods or services ranging from the real to the absurd. I do not have a problem with emarketing per se. after all. our consumer based economy is highly dependent on marketing. However. email communications make accountability more difficult. Therefore. unscrupulous people use it to advance fraudulent and deceptive acts and even good commercial actors are tempted to take advantage of this lack of accountability. Effective and narrowly tailored legislation. like the one before us today. can help bring greater accountability to email solicitations. That greater accountability is achieved by making sure that fraud and deception is prosecuted and subjected to severe penalties. Legislation is only part of the solution. and in my view a smaller part. Rather. technology. consumer education. and industry cooperation. in my view. are the key tools in combating spam and injecting real and effective accountability. Finally. combating spam requires international cooperation. I think my bipartisan bill.

I told a story of a constituent who had her purse stolen and ended up spending hours trying to clean up her credit files as a result. It got so bad. in fact. that the police officer suggested it would be easier for her to change her name than to deal with the damage caused by the result of a theft. At that time. I continued on to say that something is wrong with the law when a law enforcement official suggests changing your identity in order to protect yourself from identity theft. Well. I am ecstatic to report to everyone that after 4 years struggle. the law is changing. Today the House and Senate conferees met and approved the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act. a bill that will do many things to protect consumers and safeguard our Nations credit system. Above all. however. this legislation will put in place landmark protections against identity theft. the fastestgrowing crime in the United States. This legislation has been a long time coming and is the result of a lot of hard work by a number of Members of Congress. I would especially like to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Ohio for all of their incredible work. Senator SARBANES and Senator SHELBY for the leadership they have shown through a bipartisan conference process. and a special thanks to the gentleman from Alabama and the gentleman from Ohio",

It has many different tools to ensure that our credit information is accurately reported and that our private information and confidential information such as medical records are not shared.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. this bill has a number of Important and positive provisions. The idea that consumers will receive free credit reports is important. The provision strengthening identity theft is also very important. But basically. the positive provisions in this bill do not outweigh the negative. And. in my view. this bill should be defeated. It should be defeated because it preempts States throughout this country from going forward with stronger consumer protections. And to my mind. States. in fact. are the laboratories of democracy. and it is a bad idea. especially from our conservative friends. who year after year have told us how bad it was for the Federal Government to have all this power. to now give power to the Federal Government and tell the State of Vermont. the State of California. that if you have specific needs dealing with consumer issues. you may not go forward. That is wrong. And for that reason alone. this legislation should be defeated. sent back. and strengthened in terms of consumer needs. I would point out that virtually every consumer organization in America. the Consumer Federation of America. U.S. Public Interest Research Group. et cetera. oppose the preemption aspects of this legislation. Second of all. Mr. Speaker. one of the great ripoffs that is taking place in America now deals with credit cards which. at a time of very. very low interest rates. are charging people up to 25 or 29 percent interest. And one way they do it. Mr. Speaker. is they send out notices and they say. come in and sign up: zero interest rate. What they forget to tell the consumer is that for any reason whatsoever. through a baitandswitch scam. they can raise interest rates. So 5 years before. you were late on a student loan. you were late on an automobile payment. suddenly. you are going to be paying 15. 20 percent interest. and you do not know it. This legislation rejected any effort to protect consumers in that way. not only outlawing this baitandswitch scam. but even preventing strong disclosure. This legislation should be defeated. sent back. and Improved.",

I think that many people were confused by that. so I really appreciate the clarification that this information is not a consumer report under the Fair Credit Act neither before it was passed nor after it has been amended. So I really appreciate that clarification. In fact. I think one of the biggest problems has been that the fraud and identity theft has created billions of dollars of losses in the U.S. economy and continues to create serious problems for individuals. The technology allows criminals to perpetuate this fraud with increasing rapidity. Financial institutions and law enforcement need to fight the increases in fraud and identity theft with technology. So the proposed amendment would free the antifraud networks from compliance with certain requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. But the amendment preserves the consumer protection features in the Fair Credit Reporting Act because it requires a notice to consumers and an opportunity to respond. What is exciting about the Florida bankers is they actually created something called Fraud Net in 2000 and it was implemented in 2002. This is really sort of a neighborhood watch for bankers. if you will. Because banks post alerts when they experience a fraudulent or criminal act. It does not deal with individual transactions. opening accounts. credit insurance. or employment. Today 14 States are employing the specific program. and they expect 10 additional users next year. So I thank the gentleman from Alabama for clarifying.",

Mr. Speaker. the Fair Credit Reporting Act has been crucial to extending credit services to underserved populations and in protecting consumers from egregious abuses of their financial and personal privacy. However. the violations and abuses continue to persist. I have assisted a number of constituents who have had credit problems because of inaccurate credit reporting. In many instances. people have no idea there is a problem until they try to secure a loan or credit. What I found especially troubling is larger than expected numbers of inaccuracies credit reporting agencies have on consumers. So H.R. 2622 provides a number of new important consumer protections that will make credit reports less frustrating for our consumers. The bill would give every person in America the ability to consider request an annual free credit report. I certainly hope every American takes advantage of this. The bill deals a tremendous blow to identity thieves whose crimes are rising rapidly. Consumers will be able to place fraud alerts on their credit report when erroneous information is present.

The Coast Guard estimates that required port security upgrades will cost $5.4 billion over the next 10 years. and despite this estimate. the administration has requested less than 1 percent of that amount for port security improvements.

Border Security and Claims efforts to include additional fulltime border patrol agents in this legislation. I also appreciate the fine work of your staff to create awareness about the significant need for additional resources to the MexicoNew Mexico border. As Customs and Border Protection augments its efforts through additional money. agents and technology to the more highprofiled southern Border States such as California. Arizona and Texas. New Mexicos border law enforcement agencies are left understaffed and unprepared for the increased drug trafficking and human smuggling resulting from the crackdown in neighboring states. Today. after $19 billion spent for border security and technology in the last 2 years. DHS has increased its emphasis on Arizona border security through its Arizona Border Control Initiative. This Initiative invests $10 million in the Tucson Customs and Border Protection region to hire more border agents. improve technology and provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As a result. more than 2.000 border patrol agents will be assigned to the region. This makes an average of six agents for each mile of border in Arizona. However. with only 425 border patrol agents in New Mexico. there are fewer than 2 agents per mile of border. Yet. increasing pressure against illegal activity on the Arizona border has resulted in increasing drug and human trafficking spilling over into New Mexico. For example. in FY 2004. agents in Lordsburg. New Mexico made 141 percent more apprehensions than all of last year. I strongly encourage my colleagues to consider providing New Mexico with additional resources to make our border more secure. I look forward to working with the Committee to ensure the necessary resources are provided to protect our border. Mr. Chairman. I urge passage of H.R. 10.",

As we are well aware. in late August the bipartisan 9/11 Commission issued the report they diligently prepared regarding the circumstances surrounding the horrific and tragic terrorist attacks that took place on September 11. 2001. I immediately called upon the Majority to bring Congress back in session to respond to the 9/11 Commission Report. Sadly. the Majority has ignored a great number of the recommendations of the bipartisan report. As part of their report. the 10 members of the commission made 41 recommendations to prevent future terrorist attacks. In fact. H.R. 10 contains only 11 of these recommendations. Equally alarming to the number of recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission that are not included in this bill. is the number of recommendations not made by the 9/11 Commission that are included in this bill. Amazingly. the Majority has inserted over 50 extraneous provisions not found anywhere in the 9/11 Commission Report. Several of these are so controversial that even the 9/11 Commission itself and families of victims of the tragic events of 9/11 have voiced their opposition to H.R. 10. Mr. Chairman. thankfully for those of us who recognize this legislation for what it is. a partisan attempt at political gain. we can take solace in the fact that the Senate just yesterday passed the bipartisan CollinsLiebermanMcCain legislation. This legislation reflects the unanimous. bipartisan recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and is also similar to Mr. Menendezs substitute that I will support today. It is my hope that the legislative product that emerges from conference with the Senate will much more accurately reflect the 9/11 Commission recommendations that H.R. 10 does today.

Indeed. several of these provisions are things that this body has passed before and I support. such as providing the SEC with increased emergency authority. or authorizing Treasury to produce secure currency for other countries. Indeed. one provision of the bill builds on recent legislation I cosponsored. I worked with Rep. KELLY to pass an appropriation of $25 million in funding for FinCEN to make key technological improvements in FinCEN systems. This bill authorizes noyear funding for that purpose. and that is commendable. Other provisions are unobjectionable. such as making technical corrections to money laundering statutes. or requiring Treasury to prepare an annual Money Laundering Strategy. These are things we should have done some time ago. My bigger concern in this Committee is with what we have not done as we come to the end of this session.

The Financial Services Committee voted out legislation extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Actbut the leadership has failed to bring this to the floor.

As the Ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. I have been engaged in the debate on intelligence reorganization ever since 9/11. I was privileged to join 8 of my colleagues in April to introduce H.R. 4104. the Intelligence Transformation Act. which helped to inform the 9/11 Commission and was a precursor to the great debate we have had on intelligence reform over the last two months. The bill the House is now being asked to consider does not come close to reflecting the legislation that I and others introduced this April. and its flaws are many. The provisions contained in Title I are intended to strengthen intelligence. but they are far too weak. Where is the strong budget authority for the National Intelligence Director? Where is the strong hiring and firing authority for the National Intelligence Director? Where are the detailed provisions necessary for improving counterterrorism information sharing? Where is the National Counterterrorism Centers real power to coordinate counterterrorism operations? They are not in the Republican Leadership bill. Senators COLLINS and LIEBERMAN have led a remarkable. bipartisan effort in the other body. They consulted with the 9/11 Commission and the 9/11 families. Their bill is a battietested product.

This will create jobs in Florida through its repeal of tax rules that have led to escalating European retaliation against U.S. exports and through its inclusion of offsetting tax relief for domestic manufacturers. producers. farmers. and small corporations. The sales tax deductibility will provide a direct economic boost to our consumers. especially middleincome families. In closing. it is not only an issue of fundamental tax fairness. it is also an economic stimulus that will create jobs and improve the lives of 55 million Americans living in State income taxfree States. On a personal note. Florida has been devastated by four hurricanes. three of which have crossed my district. This bill is going to be so important to those Floridians who will have a chance once again not only to rebuild their lives and their homes but a shot at that economic viability and restoration. I urge its passage.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to thank my colleagues for voting last night in favor of the Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003. Time is of the essence for disaster victims. small businesses across the country have been waiting 8 months for Congress to take action and force the Small Business Administration to comply with the law and open its disaster loan program to them. They are frustrated. and understandably so. You see. the SBA doesnt treat all drought victims the same. The agency only helps those small businesses whose income is tied to farming and agriculture. However. farmers and ranchers are not the only small business owners whose livelihoods are at risk when drought hits their communities. The impact can be just as devastating to the owners of rafting businesses. marinas. and bait and tackle shops. Sadly. these small businesses cannot get help through the SBAs disaster loan program because of something taxpayers hate about government bureaucracy. The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its lawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a disaster by definition. However. contrary to the agencys position that drought is not a disaster. as of July 16. 2002. the day this legislation was introduced last year. the SBA had in effect drought disaster declarations in 36 States. That number has grown to 48. demonstrating that problem has gotten worse and even more small businesses are in need. As I have said time and again. the SBA has the authority to help all small businesses hurt by drought in declared disaster areas. but the agency wont do it. For years the agency has been applying the law unfairly. helping some and not others. and it is out of compliance with the law. The Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003 would force SBA to comply with existing law. restoring fairness to an unfair system. and get help to small business drought victims that need it. I thank the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Senator SNOWE. for all her work to ensure passage of this bill. as well as our many colleagues who are cosponsorsSenators BOND. LANDRIEU. ED-",

His deep intellect and unyielding candor will be missed. As a junior colleague. I was struck by Senator Moynihans generosity with his time and graciousness of spirit. I had the privilege of sitting next to Senator Moynihan on the trip to Rhode Island for the funeral of our colleague the late Senator John Chafee. As we traveled. I was out of my depth listening to him discuss different styles of architecture in between offering endearing stories about our departed colleague. Of all his gifts. Pat Moynihans ability to recognize great issues before they were commonly observed was his greatest. In public policy. he had an ability to appreciate and make sense of the larger picture rarely found in a politician. From the plight of broken families and inner cities. to the collapse of the Soviet Union. to the danger of ethnic conflict in the Balkans. to Social Security reform. Moynihan was prophetic. In one of his last public speeches. at last years Harvard Commencement. Moynihan again offered words that carry far more weight today than when he delivered them less than a year ago: Certainly we must not let ourselves be seen as rushing about the world looking for arguments. There are now American armed forces in some 40 countries overseas. Some would say too many. Nor should we let ourselves be seen as ignoring allies. disillusioning friends. thinking only of ourselves In the most narrow terms. That is not how we survived the 20th century. Nor will it serve in the 21st. Senator Moynihans wit and wisdom will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers go to Liz Moynihan and the Moynihan family.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to give congratulations to one of the great local fire departments in Delaware. the Georgetown Fire Company. which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this month. This anniversary is a tribute to those who had the vision to found the fire department and to those volunteers who have carried on this tradition all the way through today. We are very lucky in Delaware to have such a rich history of volunteer community fire departments. With the addition of the Georgetown Company. we have had 15 fire companies in our state celebrate 100 years of service. In fact. we have even had 3 companiesLewes. Carlisle of Milford. and Good Will of New Castlecelebrate 200 years of service. With such successes though. it is easy to forget the humble beginnings of many of these departments. On April 11. 1903. the town commissioners of Georgetown announced in a town meeting that it would be forming a fire company to bring down the cost of fire insurance. Before the establishment of a fire company. the community had relied on socalled bucket brigades and a handdrawn ladder wagon. When it was founded. there were fourteen charter members of the Georgetown Fire Company and only one piece of fire equipment. Today. there are almost one hundred members of the company and an entire fleet of state of the art fire equipment. And as a testament to the unceasing dedication of the volunteers who serve in this company and to the respect and veneration it has in the community. almost half of the members of the Georgetown Fire Company are life members or honorary members. Many members of the company who have served their town as volunteer firefighters for decades never stop serving. The Georgetown Fire Company has become an integral part of the community it has served. It has saved the lives and the property of many. In the town of Georgetown. everyone knows who the real heros are. It is my privilege to share the companys great history with my colleagues and with our fellow citizens today. We honor the companys 100th anniversary and the extraordinary commitment that it has never stopped showing to its community. Congratulations to all of the officers. members. and friends of the Georgetown Fire Company. It is very well deserved.*",

NE at Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge. Before he arrived at his \"dream location\" of Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge. he was stationed in the South Dakota communities of Madison. Pierre and Waubay. John has now managed the Sand Lake NWR for 15 years. This refuge has a wonderful reputation within the refuge system. and that reputation reaches far beyond its borders. In 1988. because of its importance to migratory birds. Sand Lake was designated as the 16th Wetland of International Importance in the United States. This designation was proposed under Johns guidance. and supported by myself and U.S. Senator TOM DASCHLE. During his time in South Dakota. John has been instrumental in reaching out to the public he serves through effective outreach and environmental programs. The annual Eagle Day event held at Sand Lake Refuge has grown from one carload of visitors attending the first Eagle Day event to well over 1.200 visitors attending in 2002. John has also enhanced the youth. education and outreach programs during his time at the refuge. John has been an articulate and outspoken voice on water and conservation issues concerning the James River. His coordination efforts with local. State and Federal agencies. during major flooding events and daytoday operations have been an asset to Sand Lake Refuge and to the communities and landowners up and down the James River. His knowledge of the James River has been very helpful to South Dakotas congressional delegation. Johns coordination efforts with all of South Dakotas congressional offices have been beneficial to both the FWS and the citizens of South Dakota. His knowledge of FWS history. compatibility issues. and his vast experience has provided him with a \"common sense\" approach to resolving issues before they become major problems. I know that John Koerner has provided extremely valuable assistance to my offices in working through many of the difficult issues that have been brought forward during his tenure. I commend John Koerner for his work with the U.S Fish & Wildlife Service. His contributions will benefit many generations to come.A",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today it is my pleasure to congratulate the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn. MI for 75 years of distinguished service addressing the needs of children. seniors. and the disadvantaged throughout the Dearborn community and my home State of Michigan. As a member of Kiwanis International. the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn is part of a larger organization that holds community service at its core. Since its founding in 1915. Kiwanis International has united individuals to respond to the changing needs of their communities. Kiwanis groups promote awareness of vital issues such as child health and development. literacy. substance abuse. and senior care. Kiwanis Clubs nationwide take practical steps to respond to these concerns through volunteer service projects and fundraising. Today. the Kiwanis family includes 500.000 members in over 80 countries. Since 1928. the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn has taken an active role in performing community service. Through their annual \"Peanut Sale\" fundraiser. the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn has generated thousands of dollars each year for charity organizations. Recipients of the money raised at this benefit include Childrens Hospital. the Salvation Army. the DeSales School for the Deaf. the Hemophilia Foundation. and the Special Olympics. This year. the club raised a record $54.000. a sum which has earned them recognition as a leader in fundraising initiatives. Furthermore. the club can be commended for donating all moneys raised to charity. due to the absence of administrative costs. The Kiwanis Club of Dearborn also produces \"Kiwani Talk.\" a television show that informs viewers of services available to the public. In the past 10 years. this program has aired 500 episodes relaying pertinent information to the community. The emergence of two additional clubs. the Outer Drive Kiwanis Club and the East Dearborn Kiwanis Club. is testament to the commitment of the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn to continued community service and the appeal of their message. I am confident that my Senate colleagues will join me in thanking the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn for their 75 years of service dedicated to improving the lives of many in the Dearborn community. Their dedication to community service is an inspiring example of human kindness and selflessness. We wish them continued success as they work to make our communities better places to live.*",

Senator HUTCHISON to introduce legislation that will allow publicly traded partnerships to sell their stock to mutual funds so they can raise sufficient capital for new investments in pipelines and infrastructure. Because of current restrictions. publicly traded partnerships are hindered in their ability to sell their equity to mutual funds even though their equity is sold on public exchanges. The overwhelming majority of these partnerships are energyrelated companies that need the ability to raise capital from mutual funds to build pipelines and other facilities. This legislation would be a strong shot in the arm for the economy as it encourages companies to begin new projects that are currently on hold for lack of capital. It also provides us with the ability to expand our pipeline network to meet our current demands for natural gas. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Tax Court Modernization Act. I am joined in this legislation by my colleague Senator BREAUX. and by the Chairman and Ranking Democrat of the Finance Committee. Senator GRASSLEY and Senator BAUCUS. The United States Tax Court plays an important role in our tax system. However. it has been years since Congress has taken a good hard look at the Tax Court. This bipartisan piece of legislation will improve this Court in a number of ways. and I would like to take a moment to summarize some of its provisions. First. the TCMA would make minor changes in the Tax Courts jurisdiction. These are small changes that will have a big impact on the Courts efficiency. For example. the bill would allow the Tax Court to hire employees on its own. just as other courts do. Currently. the Tax Court is forced to hire through the Executive Branchs Office of Personnel Management. entangling the executive power with the judicial power. Restoring the constitutional separation of powers in the hiring process will increase the independence of the Tax Court. Second. the TCMA would improve the way that Tax Court judges receive retirement benefits and other nonsalary benefits. I believe that Tax Court judges should be treated the same way that bankruptcy. Court of Federal Claims. and Article III judges are treated when it comes to fringe benefits. Tax Court judges are often not provided with the same benefits as similarly appointed Article I and Article III judges. For example. Congress allows Article III. bankruptcy. and Court of Federal Claims judges to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan in addition to the Civil Service Retirement System. while Tax Court judges are ineligible to participate in this program. These disparities in the treatment of our Tax Court judges affect the Courts ability to attract and retain seasoned judges. as well as talented employees. I have spent many years observing the Federal judiciary. I have spent many years trying to improve the Judicial Branch of our government and to make it the very finest court system the world has ever known. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues. both on the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole. to support this legislation.",

But now that it has been signed into law it should be properly funded and this bill does not do that. In fact. some good programs are no longer funded under this bill. including the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Improvements program and the Conservation Security Program. Not funding these programs steers our agriculture policy in the wrong direction. The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Improvements would help farmers improve energy efficiency and even sell back energy created on their farms. This program would help farmers become more profitable as the margins on their commodities get smaller. But this program. which was supported by Congress last year. is zeroed out. The Conservation Security Program has provided an incentive program for farmers to improve the ecological management of working lands. This program rewarded farmers for taking proper care of their land to prevent erosion and to help keep the land fertile. This often means not maximizing the full profitability of the land during a growing season to ensure that the land will continue to be productive in the future. Again. this is a program that was supported by Congress last year but the Majority Party in the House has decided not to fund it. There is a long list of other programs that are cut: From the Women. Infant. and Children program. which helps insure that young children and their mothers get the nutrition they need. to Farm Ownership Loans. which help farmers and ranchers buy their own facilities. to the Rural Housing Service. which helps rural residents obtain adequate and affordable housing. and the list goes on and on. The annual Agriculture Appropriation Bill often is not very controversial and I have supported it in the past. But this years bill will hurt Americas farmers and ranchers because it doesnt provide the funding needed. This is particularly true for those farmers and ranchers who are still reeling from the effects of drought. There are a lot of critical programs that are funded in this bill and I would like to support the bill. but on balance it does not do enough and therefore I cannot.",

While this disease has yet to be detected in humans. little is known about how chronic wasting disease is transmitted from species to species. Illinois is fortunate to have unique multidisciplinary research collaborations. such as the Conservation Medicine Center of Chicago (CMCC). positioned to conduct important chronic wasting disease transmission research. The CMCC is a unique collaboration between Brookfield Zoo. Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine. The CMCC brings together an exceptional team of nearly twentyfive physicians. veterinarians. researchers and clinicians from many disciplines to study conservation medicine. Chronic wasting disease is a growing problem across the country and the Committee has included funds for chronic wasting disease research in the Department of Agricultures budget. I would like to urge the Department to utilize unique multidisciplinary research collaborations. such as the CMCC. to study this emerging disease and its transmission.",

As a representative from Iowa with an economy heavily dependent on farming and farmrelated businesses. I have a keen interest in this legislation which funds many of our agricultural research. food safety. and export promotion programs. As Chairman of the House Budget Committee. I am also interested in ensuring that this bill complies with the House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2004 . The bill provides $17 billion in new discretionary budget authority-$221 million above the Presidents request. While H.R. 2673 falls within its budgetary allocation. I would point out that the bill includes $538 million in mandatory savings. which are under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. Overall. funding for agriculture appropriations has increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent over the last five years. This rate is 4.5 percent below that of discretionary spending as a whole. I commend Chairman BONILLA and Ranking Member KAPTUR for their ability to work to produce a fiscally responsible bill. The bill complies with sections 302(f) and 311(a) of the Budget Act. The first of these prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations subcommittees 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays established in the budget resolution. The second. section 311 (a). prohibits consideration of legislation exceeding the aggregate levels of budget authority and outlays established in the concurrent resolution on the budget. In conclusion. I express my support for H.R. 2673. which makes an important contribution to ensuring that Americans continue to have the most abundant. inexpensive. and safest food supply in the world.

This is a tough bill. but it is a fair bill. and the gentleman brings up some very good points that need to be addressed. But. again. having done the best we can possibly do under the circumstances. I hope that people understand that we wished we could have done more but we were just not able to. Certainly the accounts that this amendment would increase were not treated unfairly in any way. and this is how they are funded in the bill. For example. the Office of Civil Rights is at last years level plus increased pay cost. Departmental Administration is at last years level plus increased pay cost. HispanicServing Institutions is held at last years level. so there is no cut there. which in this day and age I believe people should be pleased with an outcome like that. The Outreach Program is also at last years level. The gentlemans amendment would do the following: It would more than double the Office of Civil Rights. giving that office a 104 percent increase. increase the Departmental Administration account by 5 percent. increase HispanicService Institutions programs by 15 percent: and increase the Outreach Program by a whooping 144 percent. Let me emphasize that if we had the money to do this we would be doing cartwheels in supporting these kinds of increases. but we are doing the best we can under the limitations we have in putting this bill together. The money that would be taken from the USDAs Common Computing Environment Account. and while that does not sound like a grand program. let me emphasize that this takes care of the way that a lot of these programs are processed. like the work at the Farm Service Agency. the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Rural Economic and Community Development Programs. This amendment would take $8.6 million away from USDAs ability to meet those needs. and that would indeed create a lot of hardship out in the heartland.

On March 5. 2002. the President imposed tariff relief for a period of three years. One year later. the proof is irrefutablethe Presidents steel program is working. It is critical to the continuous success of the Presidents plan that tariff relief remain in effect for its full term. U.S. steel companies. such as WheelingPittsburgh Steel Corporation and Weirton Steel Corporation. have made tremendous efforts to remain competitive in the world market. Labor and management have worked together to make brutal decisions. Wages have been cut. the number of workers and managers has been reduced. new efficiencies and technologies have been pursued. bonds have been restructured to reduce interest expense and avoid bankruptcy. Despite these sacrifices and improvements. these steel companies were still suffering from illegally dumped foreign steel. Since implementation of Section 201 tariff relief. the industry has made significant progress toward restructuring and consolidation. and these efforts will continue. The international talks on overcapacity and subsidies are making real progress. In addition. domestic producers have enjoyed improvements in revenues. operating income. and capacity utilization. A number of companies have returned to profitability. while others have shown significant improvement even though they have not yet become profitable. There have however been significant surges of imports from certain excluded countries. and. to the extent there is any concern about the program. it is that too many imports could be undermining relief. In fact. imports of flatrolled steel increased substantially after imposition of Section 201 measures in 2002. as compared to the same period in 2001. Therefore. the Section 201 tariff measures must be fully enforced if our industry is to arrive at a successful conclusion. While recovery will take time. the Presidents plan has allowed the industry to make a real start.",

While this bill contains many provisions worthy of support. it also removes the only means by which many widowed Texas public school teachers can receive the same spousal social security benefits as every other American. As I am sure my colleagues are aware. widowed public school employees in Texas. like public employees throughout the nation. have their spousal social security reduced if they receive a government pension. The Government Pension Offset even applies if the public employee in question worked all the quarters necessary to qualify for full social security benefits either before or after working in the public school system! The effect of the Government Pension Offset is to punish people for teaching in public schools! However. current law provides widowed Texas public school teachers a means of collecting the full social security spousal benefits. Unfortunately. this bill removes that option from Texas teachers. Since I believe the Congress should repeal the Government Pension Offset by passing H.R. 524. which repeals both the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision. another provision that denies public employees full social security benefits. I must oppose this bill. Instead of punishing public school teachers. Congress should be encouraging good people to enter the education profession by passing my Teacher Tax Cut Act which provides every teacher with a $1.000 tax credit. as well as my Professional Educators Tax Credit Act . which provides a $1.000 tax credit to counselors. librarians. and all school personnel. Congress should also act to protect the integrity of the Social Security Trust Fund by passing my Social Security Preservation Act . which ensures that Social Security monies are not spent on other programs. Congress should also pass my Social Security for American Citizens Only Act . which ensures that noncitizens who have not worked the required number of quarters and illegal immigrants do not receive social security benefits.",

This legislation responds to the real problems in the medical malpractice insurance marketnamely. higher prices driven by lack of competition and investment losses by insurers leading to a boom bust cycle. To respond to these problems. Title I of the bill insures that the antitrust laws apply to medical malpractice insurers. price comparisons can be easily obtained. and procedural checks are in place to insure that premium increases are warranted and can be challenged by health care providers. Above and beyond these requirements. the bill responds to concerns that medical malpractice is not available in parts of the country. As a result. Title II would create a Federal medical malpractice insurance association. housed within the Department of Health and Human Services. to provide medical malpractice insurance where it is not available at reasonable terms. In addition. the bill responds to the complaint that medical malpractice insurance premiums are being driven higher as a result of frivolous complaints. Title Ill of the bill provides for a series of measures designed to insure that the lawsuit itself is not frivolous and that the pleadings filed in connection with the suit are accurate and meritorious.

His excitement for space travel was solidified when on his first and last mission he exclaimed. \"there is so much more than what I ever expected. its beyond imagination. until you actually get up and see it and experience it and feel it.\" The tragic loss of the Columbia Space Shuttle crew and their sacrifices will never be forgotten. not by William McCools family. the families of the other crew members. and not by his countrymen. They were as gracious. courteous and giving in the last weeks of their lives as they were in all the other weeks. William McCool will forever be remembered for his dedication and contributions to science. His adventurous and brave personality is what made this man into an American hero. The legacy of Commander McCool will vicariously live through the next generation of space explorers. for his bravery in the face of death will surely inspire others to pick up where he left off. We thank you William McCool for your dedication and love of country. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I join my colleagues in remembering the seven extraordinary men and women aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia who gave their lives for the pursuit of science and discovery. and in expressing my condolences to their families. Until the tragic events of last Saturday. shuttle flights for many had become routine events. however. each mission is a highrisk endeavor. We are fortunate to have an astronaut corps comprised of highly trained men and women who regularly bear this risk. Their strong passion for space exploration has immeasurably benefited our nation and the world. We will never forget the dedication and sacrifice of the crew of the Columbia. As a member of the Science Committee. I have followed the space program closely for many years. But its full impact was brought home for me and my constituents in April of 1996. when our hometown hero. Dr. Sandra Magnus. joined NASA. Sandy was born and raised in Belleville. Illinois where she attended Central Junior High School and Belleville West High School. I had the pleasure of accompanying the Administrator of NASA. Mr. Sean OKeefe. to the Kennedy Space Center for Sandys first launch on October 7. 2002. To witness a launch is to truly know that space flight is inherently dangerous. But it is also a vital part of the American spirit and the advancement of knowledge. and it is these elements that drive the men and women in the astronaut program to strive for the unknown. If we are to gain a greater understanding of our universe. we must continue the cause of the heroes we lost on Saturday and take every step we can to make future space travel as safe as possible. We come together today in a period of national and international mourning. Our prayers are dedicated to the heroic crew of Columbia and their families. Their namesmission commander Rick Husband. pilot William McCool. payload commander Michael Anderson. mission specialist David Brown. mission specialist Kalpana Chawla. mission specialist Laurel Blair Salton Clark. and payload specialist Ilan Ramonwill live forever in our hearts and minds as dedicated pioneers yearning to reach the stars and who never lost their sense of adventure. I again express my deepest condolences to the families of the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia.",

These seven brave men and women aboard the Columbia represented the best of our country. the community of nations. and of humanity. I have had the privilege of working with NASA scientists. engineers. and astronauts. To these dedicated men and women. their work is a mission. their colleagues are family. Working together across ethnic. religious. and geographical boundaries. they exemplified the synergism of teamwork. in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Just as they did so well. we must continue to display the courage to take on new challenges. seek answers to the mysteries of nature and the world around us. and we must do so together. Through their spaceflight. the Columbia crew inspired us to think. imagine. and dream beyond the world we can see. They bravely faced daunting challenges in order to reveal the wonders of science. Their lives were dedicated to scientific exploration and the betterment of humankind. They were truly pioneers. bridging the gap between the known and the unknown. venturing into the depths of space. As scientific voyagers. they expanded the boundaries of knowledge. enabling us to learn more about our universe and our own planet. Their quest to answer as yet unanswered questions embodied mankinds continual search for knowledge and truth. In honor of their memory and their legacy. we must carry on where they have left off. We must reaffirm our commitment as a nation to space exploration and scientific discovery. We must continue to fund our national space program. to explore our solar system and beyond. We must set ambitious and daring goals. such as landing man on Mars. We must. and we shall. continue the journey that the crew of the Columbia so bravely began.",

The seven Columbia astronauts possessed an unquenchable passion to explore and push the boundaries of science and technology. Michael Anderson. David Brown. Kalpana Chawla. Laurel Clark. Rick Husband. William McCool and Ilan Ramon were not names familiar to most Americans until Saturdays catastrophe. But as the pain of the loss of these seven brave explorers ebbs with time. the resolve to keep their work ongoing must remain ever vigilant. I. like many Americans. remember huddling with classmates in excitement as Alan Shepard blasted off in the first American manned space flight in May 1961. Ever since then. I followed both the highs and lows of the space program. From the outset of our manned space program. it was known that lives could be lost exploring spacejust as when man explored previous frontiers. Despite the recent tragedy. there are schoolchildren throughout the world that will be inspired by the Columbia seven. As the nation grieves over its terrible loss of this past Saturday. we must also strengthen our resolve to press forward. Those who died did so as heroes. We must not let them die in vain. I know all Americans share in the sadness brought about by this event. One measure of mankind is the amount of risk taken for the greater good. These astronauts are clearly heroes whose acts we will remember for all of history. My thoughts and prayers are with the crew of Columbia and their families.",

Today we offer the respect and gratitude of a grateful nation for their service and their sacrifice. Over the last few days our Nation has prayed for the family and friends of the lost and have learned of the lives of seven truly extraordinary individuals. Commander Rick Husband. Pilot William McCool. Payload Commander Michael Anderson. Mission Specialist David Brown. Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla. Mission Specialist Laurel Clark. and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon understood the risk and were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the advancement of humanity. The crew conducted more than 80 scientific experiments in the physical. life. and space sciences during their voyage. The objective of their mission was to help us solve problems here on Earth through experiments such as growing bone and prostate cancer tissue in search of new treatments. testing new techniques of encapsulating anticancer drugs to improve their efficiency. and examining the physics of combustion and fire quenching to gain insights into firesuppression that cannot be obtained on Earth. Their mission is a reminder of the importance of our space program and the benefits that can be achieved through these efforts. Our search for understanding and our basic desire to reach into the darkness just beyond our grasp are both the hallmark and the calling of our humanity. As we take these moments to grieve for the lives lost and the families and friends left behind. we also stand here today resolved that space exploration and the cause of research and discovery must go on. Perhaps it is testimony to the greatness of our society when sending men and women into the heavens seemingly becomes commonplaceand perhaps it is regretful that many of us take notice only when a tragedy such as this occurs. Nevertheless. we were reminded on Saturday that all great endeavors involve great risk. We will go on and continue the work these seven astronauts began. They will go down in history as heroes who paid the ultimate price as pioneers in the frontier of space exploration. For their memories and in their names. we rededicate our efforts to unlock the mysteries of the heavens.",

I am introducing legislation. along with my colleagues Congressman DICKS and Congresswoman HOOLEY. to provide $500 million in Emergency Supplemental funding for the Forest Service and the Department of Interior to maintain our nations wildland firefighting efforts this year. We all know how devastating it would be if the Forest Service and Department of Interior were to stop fighting fires because of a lack of funding. Without passage of this legislation. it is likely that these agencies will quickly deplete the funds that Congress designated for this fire season. When this funding runs out. the Forest Service will be forced to choose between cutting back its firefighting efforts or taking funding away from other essential forestry programs. As a result of funding concerns. the Forest Service and the Department of Interior have employed almost 3.000 fewer firefighters this season than they did at the same time last year. The legislation I am introducing today would provide the additional funding that is needed to employ more firefighters and protect our communities from the devastating effects of wildfires. The passage of this bill is critical to protecting the health of forests and communities in my home state of Utah. Weve seen too much devastation and damage in recent years due to the extreme drought conditions in the West. I am committed to the passage of this legislation as an important step toward protecting Utahs communities from the devastating effects of forest fires.",

Today. we can say with great certainty that the waters off the New Jersey and New York coast have benefited a great deal thanks to the efforts of COA. and its volunteers and the many citizens who have participated in COA activities. In commemorating their 20th Anniversary. COA certainly has much to celebrate. Since its inception. this group has organized over 30.600 volunteers for biannual beach cleanups that have led to the removal of millions of pieces of trash and debris that typically pollute our coast. COA has compiled statistical information on the trash collected during their sweeps. which provide a very valuable tool to determine the leading source of debris pollution on our beaches and in our coastal waters. The Beach Sweeps were also chosen as a \"Local Legacy.\" for the 200th celebration of the Library of Congress. As a passionate supporter of our oceans and our coastline.

Yet. as I was running for Congress in 1998. I was diagnosed with this disease. Fortunately. within 10 months of treatment I was able to stop my bone density loss and my bones actually began to strengthen again. Because of my personal experience with osteoporosis.

With this deep love of freedom and country. Guams seniors were always the pillars of our island community. Through them the beautiful Chamorro culture is passed on to younger generations. They keep our island traditions. our language. and our ways of life alive and vibrant. They have taught our children the love of nature. the love of God and the love of family and neighbor and in so doing. ensure that our heritage will survive. Mr. Speaker. I honor the seniors of Guam. proud citizens who have participated in the growth of Guam as a showcase of American democracy in the Pacific. May every American remember and give honor to the forefathers who shaped this wonderful country and who were the architects and builders of a nation founded in the love of freedom and the inalienable rights of humanity. During this month dedicated to seniors. let us all honor these great Americans and say \"thank you.\"",

My family and I are privileged to live in Haddon Heights. a small town located in southern New Jersey just outside Camden and 7 short miles from downtown Philadelphia. While its proximity to one of the largest and most vibrant metropolitan centers in the country makes Haddon Heights a culturally diverse and enriched community. the town is also a world removed from the bustle of the city. reflecting values and a sense of community characteristic of small towns far removed from our urban centers. Haddon Heights was first settled in 1699 when John Hinchman built a oneroom brick house. However. the borough was developed primarily as farmland. divided between crops and orchards for nearly 200 years. The borough was named Haddon Heights because of its proximity to Haddonfield and its high elevation. During the late 1890s. the towns first homes. church. rail station. and a general store were constructed. and by 1904. Haddon Heights had become large enough to incorporate as a borough. The towns residents elected Benjamin A. Lippincott as the towns first mayor. Viewed as a resort town because of a direct rail connection to Philadelphia. its proximity to the lake. and the warmth and friendliness of its small town atmosphere. the population of Haddon Heights swelled during the summer months as vacationers escaped the cities. The rail station served as the hub of the town. and a small downtown began to emerge surrounding the railroad that brought the towns visitors. Rail passenger service ended in 1965. but Haddon Heights retains to this day a character",

The indictment alleges that the defendant unjustly enriched himself by obtaining money from third parties upon the false representation that he was working with the CIA on a secret operation to obtain funds allegedly stolen from Cuban leader Fidel Castro. According to the prosecution. in furtherance of the alleged fraud. the defendant or his coconspirators provided to third parties a fictitious letter purportedly signed by Senator GRAHAM. The defendants trial is scheduled to commence on or about November 1. 2004. The prosecution has requested testimony and the production of documents from a member of the Senators staff who has evidence relevant to the charged offenses.

As members of the Governmental Affairs Committee labored over legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security. we became well acquainted with the daunting array of programs and policies that are part of our homeland security effort. In creating the Department. and through efforts we have undertaken since that time. the committee has worked to help supply the Department of Homeland Security with the tools it will need to be successful. Our oversight work has demonstrated the need to have a strong national strategy to guide our homeland efforts. I agree with my colleague that GAO and others have identified ways in which our homeland security strategy could be strengthened and updated. This legislation will facilitate improvements by requiring that the administration lay out its homeland security strategy anew. and coordinate this strategy with its annual budget requests. This should bring out strategic vision into sharper view. and ensure that adequate resources are sought and secured to carry out homeland priorities.",

They have families in Nevada. Their kids go to school in Nevada. Fallon. 400 miles away. is a very large naval air training center. Fallon Naval Air Station. And there it is the same thingTop Gun is there. Hundreds and hundreds of people from Fallon are now in the Middle East. That aircraft carrier I watched before I came in hereI can almost guarantee you those people taking off in those airplanes were trained at Fallon. They also have children going to school in Churchill County. They also have wives and husbands who are there waiting for their return. In addition to that. we have a very large ammunition depot at Hawthorne and it has gotten real busy because they are bringing ammunition out of there. hauling it to the Middle East. In addition to that. we have large Guard and Reserve components. We have over 1.000 Guard and Reserve people who have been called up and are gone. Their families are gone. Some of them dont know how they are going to make the rental payments. their house payments. What I hear from the Senator from North Dakota is that maybe the Senator from Nevada sometime during the day should give a speech talking about the people in Nevada who have sacrificed to protect my freedom. my familys freedom. Is that what the Senator is saying?",

I think putting the marines on the boats offshore is clearly a step in the right direction. but this should have been done a couple of weeks ago. Although it wasnt. the marines are in transit. and that is a step in the right direction. What do we need to do? I think it is clearly in the interest of the United States that we diplomaticallyin addition to the military actionmake sure the ceasefire we are trying to get in place stays. and to reach out to all sides. including the rebel side. I think they have an interest in having the ceasefire. We need to make sure that ceasefire sticks. Then we need to work out an arrangement whereby the African troops come into place. At that point. once there is a military presence stabilizing the country. I think we should have a simultaneous evacuation of Taylor with our U.S. Marines coming in with a presence for a short period of time. with mainly the peacekeeping burden being put on the ECOWAS or African troops. Clearly. we. the United States. need to be directly involved in order to stabilize that region. with a minimum of involvement of U.S. troops. It is clearly in our interest that part of Africa be stabilized. We are going to have to help with it.

So they were never given a hearing. never given a vote. One of those nominees is now the dean of the Harvard Law School. In fact. the chief judge. as I recall. a Reagan appointee. said they definitely didnt need more judges. they didnt have the workload. He took that position consistently throughout President Clintons term. Now we have a new President. The workload has gone down in that court. But we have several people suddenly nominated for the seats that just a few months ago were unneeded. we were told. by all the Republican leadership. We were told by the Republican leadership on this very political court that we didnt need anybody. Suddenly we need somebody.

Senator TOM DASCHLE worked with me. along with Senator LOTT and Senator MCCONNELL. to move them. So we were able to move them. actually. in a matter of 20 or 30 minutes.

I mention that because we have now confirmed 145 judges for President Bush. We stopped three. This stands in tremendous contrast to the time of President Clinton. when the Republican leadership stopped 60 of President Clintons nominees. For very good reasons. because of their ideology. their obvious intent to politicize the courts. we have stopped three. So we have confirmed 145 and stopped three.

It is unfortunate that it took an entire month for the Senate to take up this simple bill that keeps in place special simplified bankruptcy provisions for family matters. But with the harvest season just around the corner in many of our States. I am pleased that the Senate has taken this action. We have helped many farmers who are in difficult financial straits. That is a good thing. It is high time that the Congress made chapter 12 permanent. It has been in place since the mid1980s and has worked well. Along with the Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. I have championed taking this step along with the number of important improvements to chapter 12. including adjusting the income limitations for inflation. which has never been done. The major bankruptcy bill that has been before the Congress for a number of years includes those improvements. I oppose the overall bankruptcy bill. but I believe that the provisions dealing with chapter 12 can and should be passed independently. Family farmers in difficult financial situations deserve our support.

I voted for the Democratic Energy bill. H.R. 4. last Congress. When the same bill came up for a vote last night as S. 14. I was announced against it. The reason is that debate on the Energy bill was closed down prematurely before consideration of important provisions such as renewable portfolio standards. clean air standards. and climate change could even take place. Furthermore. there is no indication that the Senate and House conference committee is going to lead to any type of meaningful bipartisan negotiations. In fact. the Republican leadership has already boasted they will do little if anything to defend the Senate position. Instead. they have announced that intention to rewrite the bill in conference. Apparently the Senate process has little meaning in this regard. It was just a ticket to a conference committee and a free hand in drafting a partisan bill. The Nation needs a progressive. forwardlooking energy policy that strengthens our national energy security. safeguards consumers and taxpayers. and protects the environment. Unfortunately.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Marc Wheat. who is leaving the State Departments Bureau of Legislative Affairs after 2 years of outstanding service. As a Senior Advisor for Senate Affairs. Marc Wheat worked closely with my staff on the Foreign Operation Subcommittee on a range of important and controversial issuesfrom Plan Colombia to reconstruction in Afghanistan to Iraq. To be sure. my staff tells me that Marc was a tireless and forceful advocate for the State Departments position on these. as well as other issues. But. they also emphasize that he was always honest and forthright. responding promptly and fully to the committees requests for information. Perhaps what comes through the most is what a decent and genuine person Marc is. That was obvious to me when I met him after a committee hearing with Secretary Powell. The State Departments loss is a gain for the House of Representatives. Marc is leaving his job at the State Department to be the Staff Director of the Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. Drug Policy. and Human Resources. I know Marc will be a great asset to Chairman SOUDER in his new position. This is the latest move in a distinguished career for Marc. which includes service as a Counsel on the House Commerce Committee and Legislative Assistant to Congressman HASTERT. I know my staff will miss working with Marc. and I wish him the best of luck in his new job.o",

Clarence McGinley. known to friends and family as Doyle. dedicated his life to a career in journalism. His profession took him on adventures across the country. finally settling down in Glenwood Springs. Colorado. As we reflect on his passing. I would like to recognize Doyle for his journalistic accomplishments and the impact that he had on his community. When Doyles skills as a plate maker for newspaper presses became outdated. the paper presented him with an opportunity to work as a reporter. Doyles career flourished. winning a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Vietnam protests only two years later. While Doyle did not have traditional schooling as a reporter. he was widely known for his ability to track down a story. He continued his career in journalism and began a new career in the bail bond business when he moved to Glenwood Springs in the 1980s to care for his aging parents. Doyles son. Wayne. noted that Doyle will be remembered by the community as a friend to everyone and by his children as a loving father. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to stand before this body of Congress today to recognize the positive impact that Doyle had on my district and the State of Colorado. Individuals like Doyle provide the spirit and strength of character that make this nation great. I extend my deepest sympathies to Doyles family and friends during this difficult time.",

Michigan. who died Sunday. June 22. 2003 at the age of 83. Peter Koks obituary appeared in papers around the world in the week following his death. and with good reason. It was his refusal to bomb a defenseless and innocent village in northern Italy while a captain in the Army Air Force during World War II that became the basis for Joseph Hellers famous 1961 novel. Catch 22. and the subsequent 1968 movie of the same name. Rather than bomb the village. he dropped his B25s payload on an open field outside the village and the rest of the bombers in his command followed suit. For his heroism in completing 67 bombing missions over Italy and southern France as a member of the 488th Bomb Squad of the 340th Bomb Group. Peter received the Silver Star. the Distinguished Flying Cross. the Airmens Medal and a Purple Heart. After the war. Peter returned to Grand Rapids and established a real estate brokerage firm. Later. he decided to jump into the political fray by running for the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1964. defeating two incumbents in a primary. he was then reelected to a total of seven terms before retiring from public office in 1978. Peter Kok became a champion for open housing legislation that prohibited socalled \"redlining.\" Other pet causes included mental health services. special education and environmental legislationall before these causes became popular issues. As I said before. Mr. Speaker. Peter Kok was the ideal public servant. He was decent. honest and a truly superb legislator. I had the pleasure of working with him when I was a member of the Kent County Board of Commissioners and later had the honor of holding his former seat in the Michigan House a few years after his retirement. For those who remember Peter Kok as a pilot. as a real estate agent or as a legislator. we all mourn his loss. and we offer our condolences to his family.",

Wherever they threaten. we must gird ourselves for battle. This war presents many foes on many fronts. but we fight it for one purpose: the security of American people. This week. the House considered one of the tools that will help us win this war: President Bushs \"Project Bioshield\" initiative. Project Bioshield. as you know. is a comprehensive program to research. develop. and acquire vaccines. drugs. and countermeasures to protect Americans from terrorism. It will streamline governmentsponsored research of biological. chemical. nuclear. and radiological weapons and medicines to combat their effects. And it will authorize a special reserve fund to purchase enough of those countermeasures to respond to catastrophic terrorist attacks. Project Bioshield is another way to protect America. and further evidence that there is no difference between national security and homeland security. Both agendas are designed to win the war on terror and protect the American people from future attack. Thus. we will implement Project BioShield for the same reason we defeated the Taliban and liberated Iraq: Security. Without security. peace and prosperity will be difficult to find and impossible to preserve. Without victory in the War on Terror. no fiscal. domestic. or social policy will even survive. Those are the stakes. Mr. Speaker: the preservation of civilization and hope for peace in the world. One man who understands those stakes is British Prime Minister Tony Blair. one of the heroes of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terror.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on June 27. 2003. this House of Representatives passed a poor excuse for a solution to the Medicare prescription drug crisis. The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 provides minimal benefits to our Nations disabled and senior citizens and fails to address the underlying problem of skyrocketing prescription drug costs. On July 9. Families USA released a report appropriately called \"Out of Bounds: Rising Prescription Drug Prices for Seniors.\" Between January 2002 and January 2003. the price of the 50 drugs most commonly used by seniors rose at threeandahalf times the rate of inflation. With the Republican prescription drug plan. these rising prescription drug costs will continue to restrict patient access to much needed medications. What is the solution to these skyrocketing drug prices? We must hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable! The cost disparity between identical prescription drugs sold in the United States. Canada. and Mexico must be eliminated. Generic drugs. whose prices grow far more slowly than brand name drugs. must be allowed to quickly enter the market. Drug companies must begin to hold the welfare of patients above the richness of their own pocketbooks. Until we convince pharmaceutical companies to treat our senior citizens justly. Congress must take action. A fallback prescription drug benefit must be offered through Medicare. which would have the power to negotiate drug prices. We must allow drugs to be reimported from Canada. Members of Congress must be held accountable for the prescription drug benefits we give to seniors. We must urge the conferees to maintain in the final bill Senator MARK DAYTONS amendment which calls for Members of Congress to receive comparable prescription drug benefits to those of Medicare beneficiaries. Members of Congress. I urge you. do not allow the wellbeing of our Nations seniors to be controlled by the greedy hands of the pharmaceutical industry.

It has been there for 10 years. It says that cities must provide information about immigration and they cannot stop the flow of information from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That is what it says. They are doing it. Now. if we do not like the law. then. of course. as I said in my opening remarks. introduce a bill to repeal it. But it is there.

And. unfortunately. there was a point of order raised on the CAPPS2 language and some very important language relating to privacy was stricken from the bill. This is a rather simple amendment. The fact is the Departments privacy office has huge responsibilities and a limited budget. The amendment increases funding for the Departments privacy office by $2 million. The charge of the Departments privacy office has grown far beyond what was originally envisioned in the Departments budget projection. The Secretary delegated Freedom of Information Act oversight to this office in addition to its privacy duties. The privacy issues at the Department are huge. particularly with the TSA. CAPPS2. and transportation worker identification cards programs. and MATRIX. The privacy office will also be the last point of passenger appeals. Because we eliminated the Capps language which required GAO to do a review of the Departments efforts to put CAPPS2 in place. and because there are new requirements being issued by the Department and how they are going to put their CAPPS2 list together. again we have a requirement in the Capps amendments that GAO review that process. That was deleted from this bill. Because of this vacuum by what we did because of a point of order. there is increased sensitivity and responsibility for this office to deal with some of what I think are the most crucial privacy issues that are involved in the Department of Transportation security. So I think they are going to have significant additional. they were going to have significant increase in work load before the elimination of the TSA language. That simply increases their job responsibilities and some sensitivity of what they have to do. I urge adoption of this amendment.

And the Department of Homeland Security continues to be slow in hiring. The current vacancy rate in the Office of the Secretary. which includes the Office of Privacy. the vacancy rate is over 30 percent. A lot of that is due to the slow process of clearing people for these jobs. And we do address that in the bill in another section.

However. the money in the bill already allows the Office of Privacy to hire eight new staff. and I do not think they can get that many hired anyway.

Mr. Chairman. one issue that is partially dealt with in this bill. but not to the degree that I think it should be. is the whole question of the screening of cargo on passenger aircraft. Last year. the House passed by an overwhelming margin a provision requiring all cargo on passenger planes to be screened. Then that did not survive conference. We continued to do some work in that area. A very limited amount of cargo is being screened. This bill says it should be doubled. but doubling a small number still leaves us very little cargo being screened. I think it is one of the most vulnerable parts of airline security. I think most of the people in this country have no sense that most of the cargo going into the passenger plane that they are flying is not screened. We clearly have the potential and the capability to do more. At times we have gone to heightened security alert in this country. and the screening has gone up substantially. It is an area where we should be moving aggressively and increasing the screening. I offered a committee amendment that would have called for a fivefold increase in the amount of cargo to be screened. I thought it was doable. Unfortunately. that amendment was defeated. So I just want to express my concern that this is one area which clearly has been a target of terrorists for a long time. the aviation industry. where we remain very. very vulnerable. and I just think it is urgent that the agency and the Congress pay much more attention to the question of cargo screening on passenger planes than we have done and an area where we need much more aggressive action in the future.",

I want to commend the gentleman from Kentucky and the committee for adding money to this item over and above what the President requested. The committee added $50 million to help purchase radiation portal monitors. But unfortunately. as the committees own report states. the Presidents request includes 165 additional radiation portal monitors. and the committee is aware of the need for 1.000. What I was attempting to do by this amendment is to increase the funding for radiation portal devices so this next fiscal year we could fully deploy radiation portal monitors in all of our ports to be sure that we are prepared to defend against the possibility of a terrorist group putting in a container some nuclear device or dirty bomb. I recognize it is a significant increase. but I believe in light of the urgency that it is the right thing to do rather than continue on what would probably be a 2- to 3year program to fully deploy.",

And while great progress has been made in aviation security. we are still lagging behind in screening cargo carried on passenger flights. Currently no more than 10 percent of cargo on passenger flights is screened or inspected for explosives or other dangerous materials. This is a glaring loophole in our aviation security. and the legislation before us today provides too small an increase in screened cargo that is carried on such passenger flights.

Texas. when his captain dropped a grenade during a demonstration. Lewis rolled onto it with his helmet. and then tossed it into a nearby ditch where it exploded into bits of shrapnel. Had the grenade gone off where it was dropped. he says. it likely would have injured or killed many of the 29 infantrymen watching the demonstration. It was 1945. shortly after U.S. troops defeated Germany in World War II. but after Japan surrendered and. at the time. Lewis thought nothing of his heroic act. The longsinceretired technical sergeant. who went on to become a wellknown Fremont educator. has not received any recognition or medals for his heroic efforts to save the members of his infantry. while still a young recruit. Because Lewis act took place nearly 60 years ago. securing the necessary documentation would require months of research. An eyewitness would be almost impossible to locate as most of Lewis fellow soldiers and superior officers have died. Lewis may be eligible for the Soldiers Medal. which is awarded for an act of heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy. For the time being. Lewis who once guarded 1.400 German prisoners in Bazencourt. France. says he is content with the small green patch. emblazoned with a gold wreath. on his Army jacket. Its a meritorious service unit citation. awarded to his outfit for postwar service. Lewis not only distinguished himself during his military career but also in his profession as an educator.

The research project is one of the most comprehensive and innovative health and wellness studies by and about teenage girls in Alameda County. Girls. Inc. launched this project as an outgrowth of its strategic plan which revealed that it was extremely difficult to find or gain access to disaggregated data about teenage girls on a range of critical factors relating to their physical and mental health. access to medical care. educational experiences. perceptions of school and community. and support networks. among others. The core intent of the Project has been to gather robust qualitative and quantitative data about the health and wellness of teenage girls to enhance youth programs and inform policy agendas while at the same time teaching girls themselves about the power of data and guiding them to become leaders and advocates for positive health outcomes in girls lives. The project is unprecedented in Alameda County and has surpassed all original expectations. Successful written surveys were conducted in 11 public and alternative high schools in Berkeley. Oakland and San Leandro yielding responses from more than 1.900 girls in the 9th through the 12th grade. representing more than 21 % of the entire female high school population in the target school district. A dedicated group of 20 young women were trained to conduct almost 100 oneonone interviews of their peers. They also helped analyze and interpret both the qualitative and quantitative data collected through the research efforts. The resulting analysis presents a mixed portrait of girls in Northern Alameda County. A portrait. which on the one hand. demonstrates the resilience and enthusiasm of teen girls. while on the other hand. reveals continued areas of concem relating to girls physical and mental health. their engagement in risk behaviors. their negative attitudes towards some academic areas. as well as their perceptions and experiences of safety and violence in their schools and communities. I applaud Girls Inc. of Alameda County for initiating and completing the Girls Research Project. I am confident the research findings will provide valuable guidance for families. educators. health care professionals. policymakers. and the myriad organizations tocused on the health and wellbeing of teenage girls.",

The Walters Art Museum is one of the most important cultural institutions in Baltimore. It is loved and cherished by the thousands and thousands of people who visit it every year. During the 19th and early 20th centuries. William Thompson Walters and his son. Henry. collected nearly 22.000 works of art. building the foundation for what would later become the Walters Art Museum. The museum was first opened to the public in 1934. In 1974. a new. larger wing opened on the corner of Centre and Cathedral streets. In 1991. the museum opened another building. the Hackerman House. to hold much of its Asian art collection. Since taking the helm of the Walters in 1994. Mr. Vikan has presided over a major renovation of the museum and expansion of its collection. As Director. he helped raise $3 million to renovate the Centre Street building. and another $8 million to reinstall the Renaissance and Baroque collections. During his tenure. the museums endowment has grown from $38 million to $60 million. and its membership has increased by more than 60 percent. He has been responsible for securing three major collections: the John and Berthe Ford Collection of Arts of India. Nepal and Tibet. the AustenStokes Foundation Collection of the Arts of the Ancient Americans (10 year loan). and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Collection of SouthEast Asian Art. Between 1995 and 2003. Mr. Vikan assembled the finest collection of Ethiopian art outside Ethiopia. The Walters is intemationally renowned for its vast collection that ranges from predynastic Egypt to 20th century Europe. The many treasures in the collection include Greek sculptures and Roman sarcophagi. medieval ivories and Old Master paintings. Art Deco jewelry and 19th century masterpieces. I hope my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives will join me in saluting Gary Vikan.

I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding. Madam Speaker. I rise to express my grave concern with the potential termination of the successful Welfare Waiver Program in my State of Oregon because of Federal action or inaction. Today we are moving forward again on legislation to extend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. or TANF. Program through a period of time until we can do the full reauthorization. Also today in Oregon. a successful Statedesigned welfaretowork program which has provided a gateway from welfare to work for thousands of Oregonians may expire through our action or inaction. My State of Oregon currently operates its welfare program under a Federal waiver. In Oregon. the program is known as the Oregon option and in the last 6 years. it has seen caseload reduction rates above the national average. Our innovative program allows Oregon the flexibility to consider individuals on a casebycase basis. Some folks simply need a little job training or job search skills and then they are ready to transition back into the workforce. Others need more extensive drug and alcohol treatments or basic education before they are able to hold down a job. This combination of rehabilitative services to the most needy and more education and job training activities for others has proved to be a great success. For 18 months. I have sought to protect and extend the successful State innovation. My friends and colleagues have acknowledged the success of the Oregon program and the importance of preserving individual State innovation. However. with the passage of todays extension. we find ourselves punishing. rather than rewarding. innovation. I ask the gentlewoman from Connecticut to assist the citizens of Oregon and the Nation in this matter. and I am seeking it here tonight.",

I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. and I think it is ironic when I hear representatives of the administration say we do not want to load down the Iraqi people with debt. Well. I wish that they would share the same concern for the American people because recent reports in the media indicate that here in the United States poverty has increased dramatically. More than 1 million Americans. an additional 1 million Americans are now below the poverty line. That is a historical first. the median income. the median household income. that is halfway if you count all of the households in the United States. right at the 50 percent mark. the median income for an American family has gone down for 2 consecutive years. Ironically. there has been a significant increase in the number of millionaires. That went up some 14 percent. Of course. they have benefited from the recent series of tax cuts put forth by the President and enacted by this Republican Congress. But debt. the deficit. is breaking all historical records. This year it will exceed $500 billion. and we are not talking about this particular supplemental. this socalled war supplemental. So when we talk about debt. let us remember the American people because we are going to have to answer to those people when they ask us who pays the bill. Well. it is you folks and your children and grandchildren. and possibly your great grandchildren because while we were projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus. we are now looking at a $3.3 trillion public debt. Let me tell you what the cost of that $87 billion will do to the communities that the gentleman from Massachusetts and I both represent. The $87 billion in additional war spending will cost Massachusetts taxpayers $2.6 billion. If that money were spent on other priorities in our home State. it could pay for $334 million for school construction resulting in over 8.000 new jobs. almost 1.900 new affordable housing units creating 4.500 jobs. $445 million for local and State roads and bridges. creating 10.000 new jobs. and 9.300 new firefighters. and health care coverage for 150.000 people in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who are not currently receiving it.

The Republican leadership has continually refused to reinstate these important. common sense enforcement tools that simply require offsets for spending and revenue changes in law that would otherwise increase the budget deficit. These socalled \"payasyougo\" provisions require government to pay its bills and stop the fiscal bleeding. Budgets are all about priorities. The alternative budget proposal I support makes education a priority by providing $51.4 billion more than the Presidents budget over 10 years. helping local school districts meet the requirements of No Child Left Behind and making college more affordable for all students. It makes veterans health care a priority by providing $6.6 billion more than the majority over five years. meeting the request of the Veterans Affairs Committee and veterans organizations. And it makes job creation and worker training a priority while proving tax relief for working families.

We now have the specter of the Republican budget causing another $1.3 trillion in national debt. while at the same time spending the entire $1 trillion Social Security surplus. and cutting critical education. environment. and veterans programs. The good news is that not even the Republican leadership will take their budget resolution seriously. They will not follow this blueprint. The bad news is that Republicans in Congress will combine the worst of both worlds. grudgingly increasing the spending for some critical programs. while at the same time continuing to pursue a reckless plan of tax cuts that ignores the greatest needs of middleclass families. The Alternative Minimum Tax. under the Republican plan. will tax tens of millions of American families. penalizing them hundreds of billions of dollars. For the Republicans. it is more important to give the richest few Americans more tax cuts than rescue millions of middle class families from the Alternative Minimum Tax. This plan means we will have to fight harder to meet the needs of our veterans and they will not be treated as generously as they would have been treated under the Democratic Budget alternative.

For 3 years. the administration and the Republican leadership have insisted on speeding ahead with misguided fiscal and economic policies. Ignoring all warning lights. they have taken us where we are todaywith an economy in the ditch and a budget deep in deficit. And. despite their claims to the contrary. when you look at the full picture you can see that this budget resolution offers only more of the same. For example. while they claim that they are putting the budget on track to cut the deficit in half. that claim is based on the fact that this budget covers only 5 years instead of the usual 10 years. When we broaden the picture to cover the full decade. we see that the deficit would be increasing again. meaning that we would be adding more and more debt that would have to be repaidwith interestby our children and grandchildren. This is not a policy that deserves our support. We should be changing course. not persisting in error. That is why I supported the Spratt substitute. and why I also voted for the Blue Dog substitute. Neither was perfectand in particular I thought the Blue Dog substitute would have not allowed for adequate investments in science and research or for environmental protectionbut each was preferable to the Republican budget now before us.

The Presidents budget proposes to reduce these programs to $362 million. a cut of $22 million. Since the Violence Against Women Act was implemented. there has been a 25 percent decrease in violence against women. This 25 percent decrease demonstrates the effectiveness of the policing and prosecutions that these programs fund. Without full funding. thousands of women and children will not be able to access the services they need to escape from domestic violence. We need full funding for these programs to support this vulnerable section of our population. Violence against women is a global epidemic. It is not a womans issue and it is not a \"private\" issue.

It is fiscally irresponsible. fails to address the tremendous challenges facing America today. and fails to invest in Americas future. Rather than ensuring a stable source of income for seniors and the disabled. the Republican budget raids the Social Security trust fund. Rather than investing in health care. education and job creation. Republicans have chosen to spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts. As a result of the Republicans misguided priorities and fiscal irresponsibility. America is facing record deficits. with no end in sight. These deficits threaten to lead to increased interest rates. uncertainty in financial markets and slower economic growth. The Republican budget fails to help those Californians who need it most. Republicans refuse to provide funds for the extension of unemployment benefits. despite the fact that an estimated 300.000 Californians will have exhausted their benefits by the end of June. Likewise. the Republican budget cuts funding for important child and family services like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. the Earned Income Tax Credit. affordable housing and Medicaid. I am also concerned because I believe our troops and veterans have earned our honor and support. Yet despite their brave service to our country. the Republican budget denies promised benefits to our military personnel and their families here at homeby cutting funding for veterans programs. On the other hand. Democrats have a budget that reflects the priorities of the people of California. and of all Americans. It extends unemployment benefits for workers looking for jobs. invests in programs that create good jobs. ensures retirement security. provides for affordable and accessible health care. funds education. including the \"No Child Left Behind Act\". and supports our troops and veterans. It is a fiscally sound plan that brings the budget back into balance within eight years. Moreover. to ensure fiscal discipline in the future. it requires that future tax cuts and mandatory spending initiatives be paid for without adding to the deficit. For those reasons. I will vote for the Democratic alternative.

Instead of ensuring that all our children have equal access to education and opportunity. this budget underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by $8.8 billion. Instead of securing our nations harbors and waterways. this budget proposes a 63 percent cut in port security grant funding. Under this budget. more than 250.000 families could lose affordable housing. Veterans will face millions of dollars in new enrollment and access fees for health care. The list goes on and on. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to think about how we will be judged in the eyes of history. I urge my colleagues to reject this irresponsible budget resolution and let us work together. from both sides of the aisle. to head this country in a direction that makes us stronger. safer. and more prosperous.",

Res. 393. the first concurrent resolution on the budget. which will set this Houses spending and revenue priorities for the next fiscal year. Mr. Chairman. I am opposing this resolution not only because it freezes the rate of growth in the domestic programs that are so important to my constituentsprograms that fund education. health care. community development and affordable housing. but also. because does so while making additional future tax cuts permanent and because it devastates the Medicaid program by reducing it by $2.2 billion over the next 5 years. Mr. Chairman. unlike the Republican leaderships budget resolution. both the Congressional Black Caucus substitute and the Democratic budget alternative promote necessary domestic investments in homeland security. education. job training. and workforce development. The Congressional Black Caucus substitute invests in education and the workforce by fully funding the No Child Left Behind Act and by extending unemployment benefits for those who have exhausted their regular jobless benefits. Furthermore. neither the Democratic budget alternative nor the Congressional Black Caucus substitute reduce the Medicaid program. Mr. Chairman. the Medicaid recipients and their families in my Congressional district want assurances from the leadership in this House that the critical needs that the most vulnerable in my State of Illinois will continue to be met. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Congressional Black Caucus budget substitute and the Democratic budget alternative so that this Congress can work toward a sane and balanced budget policy which meets the critical needs of the citizens of this Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I know that the Budget Committee weighed several pressing national priorities as it prepared the FY 2005 Budget Resolution. including the continuing war on terrorism. facilitating economic stimulus. and maintaining fiscal responsibility. I support the Budget Committees determination to curb overall spending in this years budget resolution. While I recognize that the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have critical funding needs. I am disappointed that Function 250. which includes basic scientific research and development. did not receive the same level of support. Function 250 was flat funded at $22.8 billion. This clearly does not provide necessary increases in critical basic science programs such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energys Office of Science. I am a strong advocate of these programs. and those at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). because scientific research and development underpins our economic and national security. Scientific research and development forms the foundation of defense and weapons development. increased innovation. and economic vitality. Scientific research is an investment that promises. and has historically delivered. significant returns on that investment. Basic research is essential to advances in medicine. military applications and continued economic prosperity. including the development of cancer therapies. GPS- or laserguided missiles. and the Internet. NSF is also the primary source of Federal funding for nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities. It underwrites the education of the next generation of scientists. engineers. and technical workers. As a nation. we cannot afford to starve basic science research and education. Continued underfunding of scientific research and education will erode Americas technical and scientific preeminence. diminish our ability to compete economically. and undermine our childrens economic prosperity and national security. While I am disappointed that the FY 2005 Budget Resolution does not increase basic research funding in function 250. I. along with many colleagues who also support science funding. will fight for these programs during the appropriations process. Even in a tight budget year. we must remember that we cannot afford to sacrifice the research and education which current and future generations need to ensure their economic prosperity and domestic security.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 393. the budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2005. One of the main reasons why I oppose this budget resolution is because it appears to parallel the Presidents budget by also underfunding the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). I have strongly urged Congress to fully fund the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) for Fiscal Year 2005 and I believe that the funding levels incorporated into this resolution fail to do so. It is disheartening that we are approaching the first presidential election since the 2000 voting irregularities and the President and Congress still appear unwilling to commit the financial resources needed to make HAVAs envisioned success a reality. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support for HAVAs passage. this budget resolution seems to provide for only $65 million of the $600 million authorized in that landmark law for fiscal 2005. Under HAVA. the Federal government authorized $3.9 billion to the States to upgrade their voting procedures in the wake of the 2000 election. State and local governments have traditionally borne these costs with virtually no assistance from Congress. By passing and signing HAVA into law. Congress and the President demonstrated that the Federal Government needs to provide States with a minimum of electionrelated resources and technical guidelines. We must make this modest investment suggested in HAVA. If fully funded by Congress and the President. HAVA will strengthen confidence in our electoral process by facilitating the replacement of outdated voting equipment. the training of poll workers. and the development of improved election procedures. Just this week. the new agency created by HAVA. the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). held its first public meeting to discuss election issues. The EAC is now our national resource for Federal election procedures. Thus. the EAC has a very important role in the future of our election process. and an equally important role in ensuring that we do not repeat the frustrations of the past. Mr. Chairman. Congress should guarantee that the work of the Commission and other components of HAVA are provided for in our budget resolution. which is one of the reasons why I oppose House Concurrent Resolution 393 and would like to urge my colleagues to do the same.",

During much of that time I was the Cochair of the Congressional Caucus on India and IndianAmericans and Keshavan helped me stay abreast of the issues facing India and IndianAmericans and stay in contact with the vibrant community here. Keshavan had a love for two countries. His adopted home. the United States and his ancestral home. India. So few people modestly and selflessly served to help U.S.-India relations through such dramatic periods of growth and change. Keshavan was an early and vocal advocate for a different kind of relationship between the oldest and largest democracies in the world. He saw the possibilityin fact the necessityof India and the United States working closely together well before it was evident to leaders in either country. In a clear example of bringing the two cultures closer together. Kesh was one of the IndianAmericans who made the October 23. 2003 First Deepavali Event at the White House happen. Born May 31. 1950 in Hyderabad. India. Keshavan was a graduate of Andhra University (Visakahapatnam. India) where he received a BA in Pharmacy and Osmania University (Hyderabad. India) with a BA and MA in journalism. Over his impressive career as a journalist. Kesh was respected for his vision and commitment to politics and IndoU.S. Relations. In addition to working for the Congressional Caucus on India and IndianAmericans. he was the Founder and Executive Director of the IndianAmerican Republican Council. and President of the IndianAmerican Forum for Political Education (NYC and LI chapter). He also was a founder of the IndoU.S. Parliamentary Forum. He served as a mentor to countless individuals of all ages and faiths. deeply touching the lives of many here and in India. even those he knew only a short time. People loved Kesh for his honesty. intelligence. and humor. Kesh. passed away on Thursday. November 13 after he appeared on CNN in a interview with Lou Dobbs where he defended India in the growing political issue of outsourcing. Keshavan is survived by his father and sister.

Today. I am introducing four more such memos. Besides confirming the fact that these groups are demanding. and apparently receiving. the power to delay or even block President Bushs nominees. they expose the double standard these groups apply to women and minority nominees who dont share their extreme political views. One memo shows that these groups identified Miguel Estrada. a nominee who received the American Bar Associations highest rating. as \"especially dangerous\" because. among other things. \"he is Latino.\" Another memo reports that liberal lobbyists and their supporters in Congress proposed \"a strategy for dealing with conservative Latino Circuit Court nominees.\" That memo also reveals that these lobbyists were using their contacts in the \"Latino media\" to undermine Mr. Estrada and others like him. Nominees Caroline Kuhl and Priscilla Owen were also singled out for opposition. It is both ironic and tragic that these groups. which so loudly proclaim their support for the \"civil rights\" of women and minorities. would deny a judicial appointment to any minority or woman candidate who exercises his or her civil right to hold different opinions.

There are currently 4.821 Lutheran schools operating in America. instructing over half a million students. These schools not only provide a traditional education. but also produce students strongly dedicated to their faith. values. and morals by providing an environment that encourages honesty. trust. respect. and responsibility. In a world which faces such grave social. political. and economic choices as ours today. it is especially important to remember the words of Martin Luther and recognize the contribution that the Lutheran Church has made to education in our own Nation and around the world. I congratulate our Lutheran schools and I thank them for all that they have done for the spiritual and educational wellbeing of our youth.",

VNAA. is the official association for notforprofit. communitybased home health organizations known as Visiting Nurse Associations. VNAs care for patients of all ages. from infants to the elderly. and offer comprehensive services that begin with maternalchild health programs and end with hospice care. VNAs provide a broad range of essential home health care and support services to patients in the security and comfort of their homes. These services include skilled nursing. rehabilitation. physical and occupational therapies. speechlanguage pathology. home medical equipment. and behavioral and mental health counseling. to name just a few. Many VNAs provide homemaker services that help patients remain independent in their home while reducing the burden on family members. These services can include cooking. housekeeping. shopping. transportation. personal care. and a variety of other essential nonmedical services. These services are critical at a time when the latest projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. published in the November 2001 Monthly Labor Review. estimated that more than 1 million new and replacement nurses will be needed by the year 2010. The U.S. Department of Labor projects a 21 percent increase in the need for nurses nationwide from 1998 to 2008. compared with a 14 percent increase for all other occupations. Furthermore. according to a July 2001 report released by the General Accounting Office titled Nursing Workforce: Emerging Nurse Shortages Due to Multiple Factors (GAO01944). \"a serious shortages of nurses is expected in the future as democratic pressures influence both supply and demand. The future demand for nurses is expected to increase dramatically as the baby boomers reach their sixties. seventies and beyond.\" As baby boomers age. the role of visiting nurses is more important. as patients spend less time in the hospital and demand the same quality of services at home. VNAs contribute to the wellbeing of the Nation. and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as we pay special tribute to those who come into our homes. into our places of being. and bring not only their technical and professional services. but also bring the individuality of their care.",

Nurses are leaving the profession in droves. and fewer people are choosing to enter the profession. We have to do more to not only retain the nurses that we have but also to increase their numbers. We need to send the message that nursing is a rewarding and much needed profession. We need to do our best to make sure that nurses get the recognition that they deserve so that we can turn around the shortage. Nurses need to know that they are needed. I support H. Con. Res. 54 because it helps bring more recognition. not only to the individualized profession of visiting nurses. but also to the profession as a whole. Visting nurses deserve all of the recognition that can be afforded. They are a valuable group of professionals that travel to the homes of some of the sickest individuals to ensure that they are receiving muchneeded health care in the comfort and privacy of their own home. By supporting Visiting Nurses Associations we are supporting a system of health care that is compassionate and that allows patients to receive care while maintaining their dignity. In my district. The Visiting Nurses Association of the Inland Counties works hard to bring care to patients all over the area. I know that they are working to obtain the necessary grant money to implement essential technology so that they could treat more patients while offering the individualized care that every patient deserves.

As you know. Mr. Speaker. the visiting nurse associations are nonprofit home health agencies that. for over 120 years. have been united in their mission to provide costeffective and compassionate home and communitybased health care to individuals. regardless of the individuals condition or ability to pay for services. There are more than 500 visiting nurse associations. which employ more than 90.000 clinicians. provide health care to more than 4.000.000 people each yearwith 95.000 visits in Florida aloneand provide a critical safety net in communities by developing a network of community support services that enable individuals to live independently at home. In my home state. the Visiting Nurse Association of Florida serves 13 counties with a complete array of home health services. With headquarters in Stuart since 1976. VNA last year provided more than $346.000 in charitable care to the most vulnerable in our communities. The establishment of an annual National Visiting Nurse Association Week would increase public awareness of the charitybased missions of visiting nurse associations and of their ability to meet the needs of chronically ill and disabled individuals who prefer to live at home rather than in nursing homes. and would spotlight preventive health clinics. adult day care programs. and other customized wellness programs that meet local community needs.

I think in Pennsylvania. in western Pennsylvania. if you are traveling around today. at the Eatn Park restaurants on their lighted signs. they say it all: \"Fred Rogers. we miss you.\" He studied childhood development at the University of Pittsburgh. Then he went on to be an ordained Presbyterian minister. His landmark show. \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.\" inspired. taught and encouraged children. families and adults since its first nationwide broadcast on February 19. 1968. with messages of love. peace and comfort. Mr. Rogers created over 200 of his own songs for his show. which always began in a comfortable family living room as he changed into his trademark cardigan sweater and sneakers. to encourage the healthy emotional growth of children and their families through imagination and friendship. He encouraged millions of children across the world to love themselves and their neighbors and to deal with complex emotional issues in a safe and reassuring way. On July 9. 2002. in recognition of the contributions of Mr. Rogers. President George W. Bush presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony and said. \"Fred Rogers has proven that television can soothe the soul. nurture the spirit and teach the very young.\" We all know that does not happen on television every day on many programs. but it did on his. The final show of \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" aired in August 2001 after completing 33 television seasons and nearly 1.000 episodes. He was always called on whenever we faced a crisis in this country that would put fear in the hearts of children. September 11 the most recent.

He was a believer in a world of skeptics. He was kind in a world of cynics. Fred Rogers set the example that every parent probably wishes they could set for their children. one that says. I like you for who you are. .no matter your differences. no matter your failings. As he used to say. \"Its you that I like.\" He invited everybody to the neighborhood. Mr. McFreely. others. the king. the queen. all the funny little characters that children grew to love over the years. and interestingly enough. I am of the generation who enjoyed Fred Rogers as children and now our children are enjoying Fred Rogers. and hopefully through television generations to come will be able to enjoy and come to love Fred Rogers as we all did. His loss is a great loss. His mission was a great mission. Where so many seek riches in this world. Fred Rogers sought to teach people to love and he succeeded. He leaves a legacy of love. of goodness. of kindness again in a world that lacks that all too often. I am fortunate to have lived in Pittsburgh and to have met Fred Rogers several times. Unfortunately. I did not get to know him terribly well. He was the kind of man one did not have to know terribly well to understand. to take a little bit of him with one as they went about their day. I have three nieces and a nephew who now benefit from Fred Rogers and from his message and his love.

In many parts of the country. Farm Credit is an important and significant lender to the farming and commercial fishing industry. Over onefourth of the total credit used by farmers and fishermen derives from the FCA through a network of Farm Credit Banks. Federal Land Banks. Production Credit Associations. and Banks for Cooperatives. Under the current law. Farm Credit institutions are also authorized to finance individuals furnishing farmrelated services related to their operating needs including custom fertilizers. irrigation installation. and land leveling services. It has been brought to my attention by a local Farm Credit institution in my District that a similar authorization to provide credit and financial services for individuals furnishing services to producers and harvesters of aquatic products does not exist. As a result of this limitation. Farm Credit institutions are not authorized to finance businesses such as boat repair shops. net makers. ice suppliers. or dock operations that provide necessary services for commercial fisherman. This omission in the Farm Credit Act means that Farm Credit institutions cannot serve the commercial fishing industry in the same manner that they currently serve the farming industry. The Farm Credit Act clearly states that it includes fishermen. but then does not go on to include those who support the industry in the same way it includes those that support the farming industry. An amendment is needed to the Farm Credit Act to authorize Farm Credit institutions to serve businesses that provide services related to the operating needs of producers and harvesters of aquatic products. This bill would extend the Farm Credit Act to numerous commercial fishing industry providers such as boat repair shops and dock operators that provide the necessary business needs to these fishermen.

The wastewater investment needs in our cities. counties. towns and townships are far greater than the amount of money now being made available at the local. state. and federal levels. The GAO. the EPA and the Water Infrastructure Network have all found shortfalls in wastewater infrastructure funding over the next 20 years in the hundreds of billions of dollars. It is critical for the federal government to do more to help meet these needs. Local ratepayers already pay 90 percent of the burden and face rising water and sewer rates every year. The federal government must once again become a partner with local and state governments to provide the necessary funds to protect our watersheds and citizens. Additional investment in the Nations water and sewer systems also creates jobs for Americans. For every $1 billion spent on water and wastewater construction. 42.000 jobs are created. Billions of dollars are needed to help keep our water infrastructure strong and sound. The President requested $3.7 billion for water and sewer projects in Iraq. highlighting its critical importance to a working society. Yet we are neglecting our own wastewater systems here at home.

United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morganthau reported at that time. \"Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress under a pretext of reprisal against rebellion.\" Not content with perpetrating this atrocity. the Young Turks denied a genocide had taken place. Generations have since been raised denying this tragedy. Such denials are refuted by the archival documents and firsthand accounts found in such recent scholarly works as Peter Balakians The Buming Tigris and Samantha Powers A Problem From Hell. Director Atom Egoyan presented the horror of the siege of Van in his film Ararat. which was based. in part. on the memoirs of Clarence Ussher. an American physician and missionary working in Turkey at the time. In Detroit and its surrounding suburbs live one of the largest ArmenianAmerican communities in the United States. many of whom are the children and grandchildren of survivors or actual survivors themselves. This weekend. I will be attending a commemoration ceremony at St. Johns Armenian Church in Southfield. Michigan. in which some of these individuals will be in attendance. To those who suggest that this ruthless genocide of a people and culture did not happen. I ask. what further testimony could the world possibly want? Mr. Speaker. for myself and my constituents. I rise today to urge those who deny this genocide to accept it as fact. Only then can we move forward and stop these atrocities from repeating themselves over and over again.",

Senator McCAIN has said publicly that it is possible this war will require our soldiers to be in Iraq for 10 or 20 years. and if the administration currently in power and the people who are advising this President remain in power and they continue the same kind of foreign policy that we currently have.

September 11 came from a group trained in the camps of Afghanistan. and we appropriately. on a bipartisan basis. started a war in Afghanistan because it was necessary. but now it is. in a way. abandoned by this administration because this administration has not given what we need in Afghanistan to finish the job. to build up a meaningful stable government in Afghanistan. The very place that attacked us has been put on the back burner. Senator GRAHAM the other day disclosed that a year before the Iraq war started. General Franks or one of the generals told him that they had started to move Predators that were being used in the hunt for Osama bin Laden to get ready for the attack on Iraq.

Even without the problems caused by drought. projected population growth for the United States indicates that water demand will continue to increase in coming years.

Seguin. hero of Texas War for Independence. Juan Seguin believed in the freedoms that we enjoy today. many of which we take for granted. He was fair minded. did not tolerate injustice. and fought for basic human rights for all people. despite the constant risk of imprisonment or death. He was one of the key leaders of Texas War for Independence. As territorial governor of Texas. he protested the dismantling of the Mexican Republic of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. and was the first to sound the alarm in response to Santa Anas tyrannical actions. He renounced General Santa Anas overturning of the Mexican Constitution of 1824. which had granted all citizens and subjects of Mexico their basic human rights. This was what the men in the Alamo were fighting to restore. as represented by the famous image of the Mexican flag with the number \"1824\" painted across the middle. In October 1934. Seguin convened the first revolutionary meeting protesting the actions of Santa Anas government. Once the revolution was underway. he fought in the successful battle to retake San Antonio from General Martin Perfecto de Cos. Later he was one of the 189 defenders of the Alamo. and his life was spared by Colonel William Travis decision to send him with a request for reinforcements to Colonel James Fannin at Goliad. Texas. He left on March 5. 1836. the day before the fall of the Alamo and the slaughter of its defenders. He was able to rejoin the remainder of the Texas Army under General Sam Houston. and thus became the only man to fight at both the Alamo and San Jacinto. Juan Seguin was a legendary leader in the Texas Revolution and an unsung hero of Texas. Though he is seldom given credit for his contributions. he helped establish the Texas that we are so proud of today. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.",

In this case. the cost of the poll and the sources of its funding must be reported to the Federal Election Commission. along with a count of the households contacted and a transcript of the questions asked. The Push Poll Disclosure Act of 2003 is a simple bill. It will not hinder the traditional use of polling. nor will it burden polling firms with excessive regulations. What this bill does do. however. is regulate push polls for what they arecampaign activities. and questionable ones at that. This legislation is noncontroversial and should be bipartisan. and its passage will make campaigns for Federal office a little bit cleaner.",

I rise today to acknowledge the accomplishments of Dr. William Claiborn during his 21 years of outstanding and dedicated service as Executive Director of the Alexandria Community Services Board and Director of Mental Health. Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse. Over the course of his career. Dr. Claiborn has taken the Alexandria Community Services Board from an organization of four facilities to a nationally recognized provider serving over 4.000 Alexandrians in 63 facilities. Under his dynamic leadership. the Community Services Board has made many tremendous accomplishments. From creating a nationally recognized Sober Living Unit at the Alexandria Detention Center to establishing the ParentInfant Education Program that assists infants with developmental disabilities and their families. Dr. Claiborn has consistently gone above and beyond the call of duty to help others. Dr. Claiborns extraordinary commitment to improving the lives of his fellow Alexandrians. Virginians and Americans suffering from mental health problems. mental retardation and substance abuse has been a true blessing to those in need. His work in partnering with state and regional leaders led to the development of new Medicaid rules in 1989. representing a major positive change in social policy. Dr. Claiborn also spearheaded a regional cooperative effort to provide funding and carry out the discharge of people from state hospitals into the care of the Community Services Boards. where they would receive better treatment and higher quality care. Mr. Speaker. it is with the greatest pleasure that I recognize Dr. Claiborn today. He is a brilliant and exceptionally compassionate public servant who has devoted his life to the betterment of our society and the people of Alexandria. Virginia. a city in which he has long served. The benefits of Dr. Claiborns tireless efforts on behalf of the less fortunate will resonate not only in the present. but throughout Alexandrias history for decades to come.",

With the establishment of the Carter Center in 1982. President Carter embraced one of humanitys loftiest and most widely shared goalsthe alleviation of human suffering. The Carter Center has worked to virtually eliminate the crippling Guinea worm disease in Africa and treat millions of others who suffer from river blindness and trachoma. The Centers efforts to promote peace and democracy throughout the world are also wellknown. monitoring elections in emerging democracies such as Sierra Leone and East Timor while promoting peaceful conflict resolution in places like the Sudan. There is certainly little doubt that Jimmy Carter has earned the title of elder statesman and has become a voice of authority on foreign policy issues. His Nobel lecture was an affirmation of the principles that have guided his efforts for so many years. He articulated his vision of a world sharing the goals of \"peace. freedom. human rights. environmental quality. the alleviation of suffering. and the rule of law.\" But he also sounded a stern warning. a reminder that we live in a dangerous time that requires international cooperation and resolve. rather than preemptive unilateral action.

January 1. 2003. marks the 227th anniversary of the raising on Prospect Hill. Somerville (then in Charlestown) the first flag of the United American Colonies. It is also the 100th anniversary of the building of the monument on Prospect Hill to recognize this event. On January 1. 1776. General George Washington authorized that the Grand Union Flag be flown to celebrate the formation of the Continental Army. Thus. the Grand Union Flag. also known as the Great Union Flag. the Continental Union Flag and the Congress Flag. was raised at the fort sited on Prospect Hill. The brigade of Continental troops commanded by the legendary General Nathaniel Greene stationed at Prospect Hill produced a rousing cry and fired a salute of thirteen guns as the flag proudly flew on that cold winters morning. Washington himself fondly recalled the scene. writing in a letter to his friend Colonel Joseph Reed. \"we hoisted the Union Flag in compliment to the United Colonies.\" Our first flag itself bears only a similarity to our current flag. although. surprisingly. it bears a strong resemblance to the flag flown during the 18th century by the East India Company. The Grand Union Flag was an alteration of the British meteor flag. It featured thirteen alternating red and white stripes to signify the thirteen American colonies. A contemporary British Union flagthe red cross of St. George and the White cross of St. Andrew on a blue backgroundformed its canton. It was felt that this combination aptly reflected the unity the colonists felt in their struggle and the loyalty many still felt to England. While the Continental Congress never passed a resolution recognizing the Grand Union Flag as the official American flag. it was used until mid1777 by the Continental Army and is considered the first flag of the United States. I am proud that it was first raised on Prospect Hill. Somerville. in what is now the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts.",

This is the first comprehensive free trade agreement between the United States and a major South American country. Passing this trade agreement will help American businesses and farmers gain better access to foreign markets. Currently. Chile already has a trade agreement with the European Union. with Mexico and Canada. but not with the United States. As a result. American businesses and farmers do not enjoy the same preferential benefits and advantages that their counterparts in these countries do. Of course. that results consistently in our losing contracts to Canada. the EU and Mexico because we must pay the 6 percent tariff in Chile since we do not have an agreement and they. of course. pay nothing which makes the cost of their goods and services much less. By leveling the playing field. this trade agreement will ensure that 85 percent of United States consumer and industrial products will receive tarifffree treatment in Chile immediately. For our farmers. over 75 percent of agricultural goods exported to Chile will be dutyfree within 4 years. Furthermore. both nations renewed their commitment to continuing to work on resolving sanitary and phytosanitary issues so that artificial barriers will no longer be used to inhibit legitimate trade. . For the people I represent in the Pacific Northwest. this trade agreement will require Chile to comply with intellectual property rights protections beyond the current international standards and will improve enforcement against piracy and counterfeits. It is my hope that the IPR provisions in this agreement will be a model for our efforts with the Central American FTA and the impending Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. This agreement is not only about expanding market access. it also reflects our commitment to strengthen our relationship with our friends and our neighbors in South America. It will also underscore our commitment to move forward with a hemispheric free trade agreement through the FTAA. While twoway trade between our nations was only $6.4 billion last year. this agreement will help to expand foreign investment that will strengthen both our economies. I urge passage of this bill.",

When signed into law. this agreement. as with other free trade agreements. will help boost exports of Americans goods and services. It will help create more net jobs for American workers and will help fuel economic growth. Mr. Speaker. when trade grows. income grows. Free trade not only creates opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed. it helps increase wages and improves the standard of living of our workers and consumers at home and abroad. It is that simple. and we have 200 years of experience to prove it. For example. free trade benefits small business. the job engine of America. Ninetyseven percent of U.S. exporters are small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Free trade benefits farmers. U.S. agricultural exports support hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nearly 25 percent of farmers gross cash sales are generated by exports. Perhaps most importantly. trade benefits families through a greater choice of goods through lower prices so more families can get better products using less of their paychecks. But. Mr. Speaker. besides the obvious economic benefits. fundamentally we must recognize that it is not nations that trade with nations. it is people that trade with people. Every American should have the right to determine the origin of the products they want to purchase. be these products from next door. down the street or even Chile and Singapore. With the exception of national security and safety considerations. it should not be the role of the Federal Government to tell consumers from where they should buy their goods.

I appreciate the leadership of the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman CRANE) in opening these new markets for American companies. There is a principle involved in every piece of legislation we deal with. The principle in trade is this: If. as Americans. we build a better mouse trap. we ought to be able to sell it anywhere in the world without discrimination. If someone else builds a better mouse trap. we ought to be able to buy it for our families and for our businesses. This type of free trade is important to America if we look at the most important thing. jobs. It is important to us because now. one of every three new jobs we are creating in America comes from international trade. No one sells more than our country outside. No one buys more than our country inside. And one out of every three acres that our farmers plant are for sale overseas. so it is important that these markets are open to companies and our farmers. This is important in our State as well. It is important to Texas already. Just Chiles trade is responsible for almost 180.000 new jobs in Texas. That is enough new Texas workers to fill the Astrodome three times over. We have not even yet begun to scratch the surface of what new jobs we can create through free trade. and as the State which is the largest exporter. in other words. no one sells more. ships more overseas than our State. this is real jobs for our communities. These are real jobs for our families. But let me state that. though we have not scratched the surface. other countries are not waiting for us to get our act together.

Unfortunately. those increases will take place in Chile and Singapore and not in the United States. Since the first contraction of the United States gross domestic product in March. 2001. our trade deficit has risen by 31 percent. During the same period we have lost over 2.4 manufacturing jobs. Congress should be considering measures to grow the economy and create jobs instead of agreements before us today that are just one more step down the road of growing trade deficits and lost employment. These bills represent a significant step backwards from the progress made on the Jordan Free Trade Agreement and even a step backwards from the bill authorizing fast track. Passage of these agreements will set a horrible precedent for future trade negotiations and will be an omen for even more U.S. job losses. The devil is in the details: The Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements contain only one workers rights provision protected by a dispute settlement procedure. and this is that a country enforce its own labor laws. However. the bills do not commit Chile or Singapore to even have any labor laws or to ensure that their labor laws meet any international standards. These agreements also create a totally new visa category for the temporary entry of professionals into this country. even if there is no shortage of workers in the United States. These visas are temporary in name only because the bill provides that they are renewable indefinitely. It is absurd to allow new sources of lowwage labor into this country when we are not facing a labor shortage. quite the contrary. but are facing the highest unemployment rate in 9 years. The Singapore Free Trade Agreement also is a large loophole that allows goods made in other countries to be treated as made in Singapore and imported into our country duty free if they simply pass through Singapores ports. This practice will allow goods made all over the world to escape U.S. duties. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to reject both of these trade agreements.",

Today. our unemployment rate is at a 9year high and American wages are stagnant. If these trade agreements were part of a grand foreign aid program to develop poor countries.

But that is not the case either. as the business communities in Central America and East Asia are just as myopic as the American corporate lobby. The countries this administration proposes to expand trade with have little to no environmental or labor protections. and their workers wages reflect this reality. Under this Singapore and Chile framework. these countries will not be required to abide by International Labor Organization standards.

The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that the lack of an agreement between America and Chile causes our companies to lose more than $1 billion in sales each year to other countries. For example. when Chile reached free trade agreements with Europe. sales to Europe automatically increased. In fact. it expanded by 30 percent in the year just ending in February. while our increased sales to Chile were negligible at best. We did not have an agreement. Our sales faltered. Germany had an agreement. and their sales grew by almost 50 percent. France had an agreement with Chile. They grew by 41 percent. We have to ask ourselves. if these free trade agreements are so bad. why do other countries pursue them so much. and why do immediately they begin selling more of their products to Chile. and why do they start creating more jobs in their countries?

It is about the obligation that we have to sustain a viable Armed Forces. It is my understanding that the judge in the FAIR case did not disagree with the Secretary of Defenses obligation to build up our Armed Forces and did not disagree that there should be equal access and treatment of our recruiters. but I think that the findings were that there was not explicit statutory direction or authorization to do so. and that is why we are here. As the gentleman from California previously stated. this is about abandoning the Vietnamera rejection of the values associated with service in the military. I find it ironic. There is a lot of discussion today on the floor about these institutions of higher learning that enjoy such a worldwide reputation and a lot of talk about their enjoyment of their freedom of expression and protection of free speech. and at the same time what they are doing is trying to advocate a specific position and denying choice to our students. I commend the gentleman and urge the passage of this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is an honor for me to be here today with the gentleman from Alabama. I appreciate very much his leadership to promote the ROTC and Military Recruiter Equal Access to Campus Act of 2004. I have heard the comments by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. the gentleman from California. and I agree with him that this is about providing choices. It is also about providing opportunities. I know firsthand. I had the opportunity to experience a career of 4 years of ROTC at Washington & Lee University in Lexington. Virginia. From that it led to my ability to serve in the National Guard for 31 years. I am very grateful for what ROTC did for me. Additionally. my oldest son is a graduate of Francis Marion University in Florence. South Carolina. ROTC. He went on to law school and now is serving in Iraq. I am very proud of his service because of ROTC and the opportunities it has provided. And in 5 weeks I am looking forward to attending the graduation of my third son from Clemson University. He is in Army ROTC. as one might expect. I am just really proud of his service and the opportunities that he will have to serve in the military. I also am aware of opportunities for minorities in the State of South Carolina. A classic case is someone who is known here in Congress. General Abe Turner. General Turner is a graduate of South Carolina State University. which is one of our historically black colleges which is very distinguished. I was with General Turner. He is now the commanding general of Fort Jackson in South Carolina. These are opportunities that have been provided to young people to go to college and have the ROTC experience. Finally. I want to point out that particularly for law schools. I think it is Important to have access. I served in the Judge Advocate General Corps for 29 years. There is no better way to get trial experience. to learn about the law and the laws of the United States than to serve in the JAG Corps. I urge that this bill be passed. that indeed we have access for law schools. I am just grateful for this and urge my colleagues to support this act for ROTC recruitment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the ROTC Campus Access Act. This bill is wrong. It isnt about promoting military recruiting. its about punishing institutions that promote equal access to opportunity. The fact is this bill will prohibit colleges and universities from applying their same nondiscrimination policies to the military that they apply to other employers. And. if they try to do so. it will bar them from receiving federal funding. Passage of this legislation is not only wrong. its unnecessary. Current law already provides the federal government the ability to deny federal funding to colleges and universities that refuse to allow military recruiters or ROTC programs access to their campuses. This bill takes that law a step further by requiring that such access be equal to the access provided to other potential employers seeking to recruit new employees on college campuses. The problem with taking this extra step is that it would require many colleges and universities to explicitly ignore their own nondiscrimination policies or lose their federal funding. Many colleges and universities require employers to sign a nondiscrimination pledge before they recruit on campus. That means employers cannot discriminate against prospective employees on many basesincluding sexual orientation. Yet. our Militarys \"dont ask. dont tell\" policy is straightforward discrimination and in direct conflict with college policies of this nature. If this bill becomes law. and a college or university attempted to downplay the prominence of the ROTC recruiting effort by placing them in a notsocentral location for their recruiting efforts. they could lose all federal funding. This is draconian. extreme. and wrong. We ought to be voting today to overturn the militarys dont ask dont tell policy and instituting a policy that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. But. this Congress is unwilling to take the right step. Theyre putting the wrong foot forward on this one. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up to oppose discrimination and vote \"no\" on this bill.",

H.R. 3966. purports to provide military recruiters entry to college campuses. and access to students that is equal to what any other employer has. However. the military is actually seeking special access that is not afforded to other employers that practice discrimination based on sexual orientation. Equality was not a concern for the military in 2002 when they discharged 16 Arabic linguists from the Defense Language Institute in my district. Despite the high demand for Arab linguists. the military discriminated against these service members based on nothing more than their sexual orientation. Schools should not be forced to choose between federal funding and their commitment not to endorse discrimination. The schools standards of nondiscrimination should apply to any organization. be it private sector or public that is seeking access to a campus and its students. One of the Congressional findings that is incorporated in this bill states that \"the presence of ROTC programs on college campuses benefits even those students who are not enrolled by making them aware of the presence and role of the United States military.\" I wonder what the benefit is to the gay and lesbian students whose talents and skills are utterly disregarded by the military. simply because of their sexual orientation.

I have the greatest respect for him and the greatest respect for the bipartisanship that exists on the Committee on Armed Services. The issue here and the only reason this bill is on the floor is that a court determined that the Secretary of Defense did not have a basis in law for being able to make some of the kinds of decisions which the bill in front of us allows the Secretary to make. The issue involved here is one of access. It is one of equal treatment. The arguments of whether one accepts them or do not accept them have been made that the armed services. I suppose by extension of the bill. the Department of Homeland Security. the CIA. are not allowing equal access to every American and at least in some instances on the basis of their sexual orientation. There may be other issues that are raised in that regard. too. That is worthy of discussion. surely.

The measure will help States in their efforts to enroll incomeeligible children in the States Childrens Health Insurance Program. commonly referred to as SCHIP. As you know. Mr. Speaker. despite gains in recent years. nearly 9 million children in the United States remain uninsured. Of those. nearly 7 million children are eligible for public health insurance coverage. H.R. 4031. the Childrens Express Lane to Health Coverage Act. builds on the successful legislation of the 106th Congress that provides States with the option of using the National School Lunch Program. the Womens. Infants. and Children Program to identify uninsured children eligible for benefits under the SCHIP and Medicare program. Many States have used this costsaving option successfully to promote the wellbeing of incomeeligible children. While existing law does allow children to be incomeeligible for WIC based on their enrollment in the Medicare program. it does not give the States adequate flexibility to make an income determination for eligibility for the Medicaid and SCHIP program based on the uninsured childs enrollment in WIC or another public program. The Childrens Express Lane to Health Coverage Act will give States the option of establishing that their Medicaid or SCHIP financial eligibility rules are satisfied when a family presents proof that their child is already enrolled in another program with comparable income levels. Current Federal law does not provide the flexibility that is necessary for this. If we are to give our children. Mr. Speaker. a jumpstart with quality health care and quality health insurance. I would encourage strongly that my colleagues consider becoming cosponsors of H.R. 4031. which is affectionately known as the Childrens Express Lane to Health Coverage Act.

After its first humble meeting in the home of Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Harris in 1903. the church assembled in a series of buildings for short periods until 1930 when the congregation settled into the church building at 55 Mary Street for the next 43 years. Scott United Methodist Church then held services at First United Methodist Church on Colorado Boulevard for 2 years before arriving at the current site on Orange Grove Boulevard. Despite the many moves in its history. Scott United Methodist Church. acting on its motto. \"the church at the heart of the community with the community at heart.\" continually dedicated itself in service to the people of Pasadena. That commitment remains to this day. The Aspires WestPasadena Program supports atrisk youth in the Pasadena area. and the \"Clothe the Pasadena Unified School District School Children\" project provides school wardrobes for children from lowincome families. Scott United Methodist Church also provides assistance to the needy with its rent relief and holiday food programs.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the CooperDeLauroKilpatrick amendment to H.R. 2989. This amendment would transfer $75 million from the Internal Revenue Services EITC enforcement initiative The money would instead be used to audit large and mediumsized corporations. In former IRS Commissioner Rossottis endofterm report. the IRS lacks the resources to address 28% of the mid and large corporation workload that should be accomplished each year. This lack of enforcement translates into the government losing $6.5 billion in direct tax revenues on an annual basis. according to the GAO. The $75 million provided under the CooperDeLauroKilpatrick amendment would give the IRS just over half of the $180 million that the IRS needs to conduct nearly 7.000 more mid and large corporations audits. Given that the IRS lacks adequate resources to perform audits and investigations. I cannot understand why the IRS has recently launched a new program to overhaul the EITC program. As you know. the EITC is the governments primary assistance program for lowincome working families. Last year. about 19 million taxpayers claimed more than $32 billion in EITC benefits. This money can be the determining factor for whether a lowincome workers family will live above the poverty line. This is a vulnerable population. Mr. Chairman. I can tell you that many of my constituents who are eligible for the EITC are already deterred from claiming the credit because of existing filing requirements. I fear that forcing them to submit a new form will only increase the likelihood that eligible lowincome parents will be further dissuaded from claiming the credit. That would be a terrible shame. Mr. Chairman. as I said before. given the IRS limited resources. I cannot. for the life of me. understand the rationale behind spending $75 million on overhauling EITC procedures especially since EITC overclaims account for less than 3 percent of the estimated total taxes that go uncollected. Why hasnt the IRS made a similar commitment to capturing the $40 billion that the GAO says that businesses underreport on an annual basis? Finally. Mr. Chairman. as a matter of fairness. the IRS should not require lowincome Americans to meet a higher standard than every other taxpayer. while at the same time they fail to crack down on fraud in business and higher income taxpayers. I call on my colleagues to join me in support of the CooperDeLauroKilpatrick amendment.",

Colorado has served as a minister for twentyfive years. Before joining the ministry. Eugene worked for twentyfive years as a plant manager and industrial engineer. His devotion. hard work. and humility inspire those around him. and his dedication to his career shows a spirit of loyalty all too rare in todays society. I rise to honor his service here today. Eugene is the pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in La Junta. He has served all across this country as a pastor. teacher. coach. and counselor. He came to La Junta after trying to retire and finding that he still wanted to work. His parishioners refer to him as a \"God send\" whose tireless work has strengthened and uplifted their church. Eugenes remarkable loyalty is shown not only by the twentyfive years he has devoted to the ministry. but also by the twentyfive years he devoted to his career as a plant manager and industrial engineer before he took up his pastoral studies. Eugene leads by example and often draws on his experiences to better relate to his parishioners. Mr. Speaker. Eugene Fenton is the kind of devoted leader our community looks to for guidance and inspiration. He has devoted twentyfive years to his chosen career guiding his parishioners.

Durand Union Station has survived fire. neglect. dilapidation. and even the wrecking ball. Over the years. the proud citizens of my district have banded together to restore and preserve this local treasure. In 1903. construction began on Durand Union Station. at a cost of $60.000 the rail depot was an architectural marvel. The Chateau Romanesque style depot was constructed of Missouri granite brick with an interior of oak woodwork and wainscoting of Tennessee marble. However. just eighteen months after its construction. fire tore though the boiler room of the station in April of 1905. Firefighters had the blaze contained until the Eastbound train forced the firefighters to pull their hoses back across the tracks and allow the train to pass. The fire of 1905 destroyed nearly all of Durand Union Station. After being rebuilt. Durand Union Station served the people of Michigan until 1974. Unfortunately. the struggling railroad industry forced Grand Trunk Western Railroad to completely abandon the building in 1974. Consequently. Durand Union Station was stripped. gutted. vandalized and ready for demolition. But. state and local officials along with the citizens of Durand determined to restore the building were able to save Durand Union Station at the demolition zero hour. Today. Durand Union Station has been preserved and restored by Durand Union Station. Inc.. a nonprofit corporation founded to manage the historic building. The Michigan Legislature has designated Durand Union Station as the natural site for the Michigan Railroad History Museum and Information Center. Under the leadership of Durand Union Station Inc.. the station is slated to undergo nearly $4 million in improvements and expansion. Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the one hundredth birthday of Durand Union Station. Over the past one hundred years. the station has become a monument to the American spirit. The people of Durand. Michigan have overcome numerous setbacks in their quest to preserve this wonderful Michigan landmark.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to say that I will be voting for H.R. 5006. the fiscal year 2005 Labor. Health and Human Services. Education Appropriations bill. but doing so with some reluctance. While I support many of the funding provisions in this legislation. I also believe that this bill shortchanges many important needs in education and health care. Almost three years after the historic No Child Left Behind legislation was passed into law. I remain concerned about Congress ongoing failure to commit the resources promised to our Nations teachers. parents and students. While I support the intentions of the education reform promise to leave no child behind. I am also convinced that the success of this new law will be determined in part by the investment made in this historic reform effort. I am deeply disappointed that this funding plan falls more than $7.2 billion short of the resources promised for lowincome and disadvantaged districts. thereby making up the vast majority of the total $9.5 billion NCLB shortfall contained in the bill. Not only does this bill fall short on critical funding for education. but it also makes cuts to the Rural Hospital Flexibility and Outreach grant programs. important resources to North Dakota health care providers. It is my understanding that Chairman REGULA has committed to work to restore this funding in conference. and I intend to actively support those efforts. Certainly. this bill includes many provisions that I applaud. While I was pleased that the Rural Education Achievement Program once again received funding to help rural districts manage the No Child Left Behind Acts new accountability requirements. I strongly believe this program merits an increase in funding. I was also pleased that this bill restores the federal overtime protections to six million workers who saw their overtime pay threatened by the Department of Labors new rules. Ultimately. I cast my vote in favor of this legislation in order to ensure that the appropriations process could move forward. I remain hopeful that the Senate will include higher funding levels for these programs and that we can work on a bipartisan basis to develop a fiscally responsible funding plan that provides adequate resources to strengthen our schools. address our public health needs. and support our Nations workers.",

Although still suffering injuries suffered during the Korean War. Mr. St. Laurent has devoted countless hours to Ocean Countys veteran population. Those injuries have given him a special insight into the problems of veterans who are trying to navigate through the bureaucratic maze and receive the benefits they have earned and to which they are entitled. Larry was a leader in the effort to raise $3 million to erect a memorial to the men and women from New Jersey who died during the Korean War. The New Jersey Korean War Memorial was dedicated in 2000. thanks in great part to his efforts. A lifelong public servant. Larry has devoted his life to his fellow veterans. beginning in 1952 as Service Officer for Jackson VFW Post 4703. He has been an officer in several veterans organizations. including Disabled American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. as well as his current position as Director of the Ocean County Veterans Service Bureau. His understanding of the needs of our veterans has enabled him to provide veterans with the opportunity to improve their lives. I have enjoyed working with Mr. St. Laurent and his Veterans Service Bureau over the years. and I salute his commitment to Ocean County and its veterans. for whom he will continue to advocate even in retirement. His will be difficult shoes to fill.",

Mr. Speaker. last week. the foreign minister of Sweden was brazenly assassinated. I hope the people of Sweden will accept Congress heartfelt sympathy for the passing of their Foreign Minister. Anna Lindh. I had the greatest respect for this very talented woman. I certainly agree with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straws comment that \"she represented everything that was wonderful about Sweden and about Europe.\" Anna Lindhs devotion to all of the citizens of Sweden and to the betterment of our world was very laudable. That she was considered a possible future prime minister is not surprising. Her reputation as one of Swedens most popular government officials was recognition by you of her unimpeachable integrity and great vision. Anna Lindh saw all that was good about a nation already held in high regard around the world and strove to polish its image even more. Everyone who considers government service a noble calling had an excellent role model in this wonderful woman. Far from putting an end to the goals she had set for herself and her people. her death will encourage others with similarly high ideals to continue and expand on her work. taking it to new heights. That would be the best way to honor her memory. and Sweden deserves nothing less. We are all much poorer for this terrible tragedy. Sweden has lost a great leader. and the world has lost one of its finest citizens. After our period of grief. all of us. government leaders and common citizens alike. must rededicate ourselves to the work of making our nations and our world the kind of places Anna Lindh wanted for us. As we go forward. her spirit will be guiding us.",

I rise to recognize the accomplishments of the Republic of China on Taiwan and call for its rightful return as a member of the U.N. Taiwan has become a stable. democratic presence in Asia. a bulwark of support for human rights and a world economic power. It is a thriving multiparty democracy. with free and fair elections held at all levels of government. Taiwan also has a thriving capitalist economy. It is now the United States eighth largest trading partner and a major investor in East Asia. The R.O.C. has long demonstrated its commitment to the well being of the international community. It has a history of heeding calls by the U.N. for emergency relief and assistance to countries that suffer disasters and wars. Its generosity and humanitarianism have included Kosovar refugees. Afghanistan reconstruction. Iraqi food supplies. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. and victims of natural and manmade disasters in El Salvador. Turkey. Nicaragua. and New York City in the wake of the September 11. 2001 terrorist attacks. Denying Taiwan U.N. membership is not in the best interests of the world community. The memberships of the now unified East Germany and West Germany and the divided Republic of Korea and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea are examples of parallel representations of divided nations in the U.N. The U.N.s role in exchanges between East and West Germany assisted in the eventual unification of the country in 1990. Taiwans membership in the UN will have enormous benefits for the international community and it is imperative that this unfair and untenable situation be resolved.",

He was a 1952 graduate of Princeton University and earned his law degree at the former Western Reserve University Law School in Cleveland. I consider myself blessed to have known Judge Skok for many years. and I looked to him as a mentor while I served as County Prosecutor before coming to Congress.

Judge Skok will also be remembered for his great devotion to Lake Metroparks. and maintaining the environmental beauty of Lake County. As a 30year resident of Concord Township. few things brought more pride to the judge than preserving the sprawling park space by his home and throughout the county. The passing of Judge Skok brought great sadness to those who knew him. On behalf of the 14th Congressional District of Ohio. I share my heartfelt condolences with his family.",

SIFE teaches college students that they have the potential to change the world. In todays global economy. it is no wonder more than 500 schools overseas have joined the 797 SIFE chapters nationwide. As the Journal article detailed. SIFE allows students to put their untested business skills through rigorous opportunities like teaching school children about business concepts and going overseas to teach remote villages about the prosperity of free enterprise. In keeping with the goal of acclimating students to the real business world. the SIFE chapter at my own alma mater. Southwest Baptist University. has held events such as resume workshops. financial planning seminars and mentoring programs. More than two decades ago. \"March Mania\" was created to teach public school children about free enterprise. SIFE team members teach the students lessons about supply and demand. international trade and consumer behavior. These experiences. coupled with the business competitions and training opportunities. not only teach young adults necessary business principles. but also demonstrate the importance of mentoring the next generation of business professionals.

She has devoted countless hours to helping children of Western Colorado. and has committed her life to making a difference. Mrs. Kimberly Cannedy was born in Denver. Colorado. where over twenty years ago she gave up her highpowered position with Rolls Royce Motors. With this. Kimberly began what she considers the most important work of all: being a mother. Her work does not stop with her own family. but rather it extends into her community. She has opened her doors to numerous foster children over the past ten years. Kimberly. along with her husband of twentyone years. recently adopted four young girls. and are currently in the process of adopting another. Her growing family includes three children of her own. all between the ages of 15 and 19. In addition to being a foster care provider. Kimberly has assisted many young mothers by teaching classes on parenting and opening her home to those in need of any additional help. Kimberly believes that if her work reaches and improves the life of one mother or one child. then it is enough. However. her compassionate work has reached many mothers and children alike. and her personal philosophy of helping people through difficult times has reached into and improved the lives of innumerable people whom she has encouraged and helped throughout the years. Mr. Speaker. it is with great privilege that I recognize Mrs. Kimberly Cannedy before this body of Congress and this nation today.

Taking advantage of global attention being focused on Iraq and noting the worldwide tendency to ignore or minimize the deplorable human rights condition in Cuba. the Castro regime has launched a fullscale assault on those who are struggling to bring freedom and democracy to this enslaved nation.

All voices must condemn the recent crackdown by the Government of Cuba against political dissent. Those arrested include two dozen independent journalists. leaders of independent trade unions and opposition political parties. and prodemocracy activists involved in the countrywide reform effort known as the Varela project. It makes no difference whether you are for or against change in U.S. policy towards Cuba. On this matter we speak with one voice. These arrests are unacceptable. The summary trials and harsh sentences merit universal condemnation. Mr. Speaker. I have had the privilege of traveling to Cuba many times and have met directly with Cuban independent journalists and members of the dissident community. Many of these individuals were arrested in the latest crackdown. They are receiving harsh sentences for actions we take for granted here in the United States: the right to hold meetings. have discussions. and express opinions different from those held by our government. The Cuban Government has said that these arrests are in response to actions by U.S. Ambassador Cason and the U.S. Interests Section that are perceived as deliberate attempts to foment subversion in Cuba. Mr. Speaker. those grievances should be raised and resolved between the two governments. but no action of the United States Interests Section justifies in any way these recent arrests. The right of diplomats to meet with people who represent a range of views. including people who peaceably dissent from the policies and priorities of their own governments. should not be impeded. In fact. Mr. Speaker. I believe the restrictions on U.S. diplomats in Cuba and Cuban diplomats in the United States are just plain wrong. Mr. Speaker. I am seriously concerned about the increased tensions and hardening of positions in U.S. Cuban relations. They do little to advance human rights or open political space in Cuba. in fact. quite the opposite. I fear that without a concerted effort to change our policies towards one another for the better. it will only lead to greater restrictions in both countries and fewer opportunities for moderate voices in both countries to engage directly with one another. I will conclude by urging the Cuban Government to release immediately all these prisoners and all prisoners of conscience.",

Mr. Speaker. I have addressed this House on several occasions regarding Castros continued assault on and disregard for human rights and democracy. I and several of my colleagues have spoken recently of Castros decision to arrest and try over 80 nonviolent human rights advocates. prodemocracy leaders. and independent journalists in what has become a campaign by the regime to silence all voices of peaceful opposition on the island. Inside of a month Castro has arrested. arraigned. tried. and sentenced many of the dissidents. some receiving prison terms as long as 27 years. Mr. Speaker. there is an article in todays New York Times that I would like to enter into the RECORD. and it mentions James Cason. the U.S. diplomat that has been spoken of. and it says that the reason this is happening is because they have become such effective advocates that the government attacks them. The reason this is happening is these dissidents are having an impact. People believe in them in Cuba. They are having an impact on basically changing and reforming the government ultimately. They have become voices of change. That is why it is so important that we here in the United States basically condemn what Castro is doing. because otherwise people like them will not continue. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. These recent actions by the Castro regime are simply the next step in the systematic denial of even the most basic human rights for the citizens of Cuba. Congress must send a strong message to Castro that despite his hopes that the world would be looking the other way. that his actions have not gone unnoticed and will not be allowed to continue.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to offer my strong support for H. Res. 179. The recent crackdown by the Cuban government on political dissidents is without reason or measure. The Cuban government must recognize that if it wants to become a full member of the family of democratic nations. and reestablish ties with the United States. it must abide by the fundamental rules of a democracy. At the very top of that list is freedom of expression. I believe that the United States can assist Cuba in its move towards greater freedom and openness. The American Congress and the Administration can lead by example. by lifting the travel ban. and lifting the trade embargo. How can we advocate for greater freedom when we prevent American companies and consumers from benefiting from trade with Cuba? How can we call for greater openness when we do not let American citizens exercise their constitutional right to travel freely. to Cuba if they so desire. America can also lead by example by avoiding needless antagonization of Cuba. Wherever they are. our diplomatic community must always act diplomatically. Current U.S. policy towards Cuba has proved a failure. It makes no sense to continue down the path of isolation. The recent actions by the Cuban government. while reprehensible. do not change that central fact. U.S. policy should be based on U.S. national interests. not a system of rewards and punishments for good or bad behavior. In this instance. the Cuban government has behaved badly and they should be properly sanctioned for it. in America and in the world community. This resolution is an appropriate measure. I do not think. however. that it should affect policy. This should not lead to greater restrictions. To the contrary. the response should be greater exchange between the U.S. and Cuba. Greater freedom and openness will lead to a more free and open Cuban society. As we call on Cuba now to change its policy. we must also ask ourselves what we can do to have a more free and open policy. Lifting the travel and trade ban on Cuba would be a good start.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this legislation. I want to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his leadership in this area. The visa waiver program is a critically important program. under which countries that send citizens that do not engage in visa fraud or overstay their visas do not have to obtain visas to visit our country for business or tourism. It has proven to be a very effective program for dealing with the increased global travel of the past few decades. However. I firmly agree with my good friend from Wisconsin that citizens from countries who do not have to go through the visa process should have secure. tamperproof passports to ensure that the visa waiver program is not abused by individuals who try to enter our country with counterfeit passports. Indeed. the statutory deadline of October 26. 2004 in the Enhanced Border Security Act of May 2002 encouraged International Civil Aviation Organization to accelerate its ongoing efforts in the development of uniform standards for secure passports. including the use of biometric data in such passports. Given the progress so far. I have no objection to an extension of this current statutory deadline to allow countries to implement these standards. However. I believe that the Congress should seriously consider a twoyear extension rather than the oneyear extension in the current bill. I understand that ICAO did not complete preliminary biometric standards using facial recognition technology until May 2003 and is on only now finalizing these standards. In order for the new passports and the technology needed to read these passports to become mature and to be fully tested. as well as producing the new passports and acquiring and deploying the devices necessary to read the new passports. more than the one year extension being approved today may well be necessary. In this context. I think it may well be prudent to consider moving towards a twoyear extension as this legislation moves through the legislative process. and I would support that approach. if we do not. I predict we will be back here at the same time next year. approving a further one year extension. I want to once again thank my good friend from Wisconsin for his leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support this legislation at this time.",

I am pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this bill and encourage all of my colleagues in the House to support it. The Brigham Young University mens volleyball team made history before they ever set foot onto the court for the 2004 NCAA championship game. The Cougars regular season successes included a new school record of 21 straight victories. a 161 home court winloss record. ten straight weeks on the USA Today/AVCA Coaches Top 15 Poll. and an average fan base of 2.600 at home court appearances. The Cougars entered the NCAA Final Four as the top seed and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation regular and season tournament champions. They defeated Lewis University. the defending national champions. during the semifinal match. This win led the Cougars to their fourth appearance in six years in the NCAA championship match. where they overcame a 106 deficit in game five to defeat Long Beach State University to win the national championship. I congratulate the BYU mens volleyball team and Coach Tom Peterson on their championship season and wish them continued success as the build upon these accomplishments in the years to come.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4278. The bill is a culmination of many months of bipartisan efforts to reauthorize the Assistive Technology Act. This law is an important component in ensuring that individuals with disabilities can access assistive technology to attend school. to maintain employment. and to live independently. As Members know. this bill is critically needed. This legislation finally ensures that States grant programs can counts on a stable source of Federal funds to support their operations. The last reauthorization of the Assistive Technology Act in 1998 sunset the State grant program. For the past 3 years. many States have wondered whether a certain year would be the last year of Federal funding. This bill erases this doubt by ensuring that all States will be eligible for funding through 2010. I want to mention the inclusion of the American Indian Consortium as a funded protection and advocacy system under this legislation. Individuals with disabilities in Indian Country are some of the most disadvantaged when it comes to the ability to access assistive technology. This bill will provide resources to this consortium to ensure the needs of Native Americans seeking assistive technology are represented. This provision alone will have a tremendously positive impact on Indian Country. The momentum behind this bill would not have been possible without a real bipartisan effort to move this bill. I want to thank particularly the gentleman from Ohio . the gentleman from California . and the gentleman from Delaware . its former governor. for his hard work on this bill. and I want to thank their staffs for working closely with my staff. We have truly created a bill that will improve the ability of individuals with disabilities to access assistive technology. This legislation is an excellent example of what we can accomplish if we put our effort.. into working together. Madam Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. technology has become tremendously important in everyones daily lives. but there are perhaps few places where technology plays as important a role in an individuals daily life than for individuals with disabilities. That is why I am pleased to be a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Improving Access to Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2004. considered in the House of Representatives today. Assistive technology devices and adaptations are critical to ensuring that individuals with disabilities can live with independence and pursue work. education. communication and other aspects of daily living. Since the Assistive Technology Act was enacted in 1998. assistive technology state grants have provided funds to states to startup and establish systems for distributing assistive technology devices and services. States have since made significant progress in building and improving these systems. The Maryland Technology Assistance Program. for example. provides a lowinterest loan program to help people gain access to and afford critical technologies. The previous authorization originally included a sunset provision to phase out the state assistance grants. However. as it has become clear that technology was increasingly important and that this program provided crucial assistance. support has grown to make this program permanent. I am pleased that over the past several years. we have been able to include language in the LaborHHSEducation bill to waive the sunset provision and adequate funding. so that states would not have to eliminate their programs. With this important reauthorization bill. we will no longer have to include this language on an annual basis. and individuals with disabilities can be confident that this program will continue to provide states with needed assistance. I am also pleased that this bill has been written to revise the program with greater focus on providing direct benefits to individuals with disabilities. I hope all of my colleagues will support this bipartisan legislation.",

This renowned dancer was born in Illinois in 1909 and started studying dance in her early teens. She was one of the first African Americans to study at the University of Chicago. where she earned a doctorate degree in anthropology. As part of a research fellowship. Dunham studied the anthropological roots of dance in the Caribbean. Her research led to the creation of the anthropological dance movement which focuses on folk. ethnic and cultural choreography. In 1931. she started the first AfricanAmerican ballet company in the United States. Later she joined the faculty of Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville. where she helped create a performing arts training center and established a dance anthropology program. She went on to create a communitybased arts education program for impoverished young people in East St. Louis. the St. Louis metropolitan regions only multidisciplinary arts organization devoted to the study. appreciation and celebration of diverse cultures. Throughout her illustrious career as one of the words most respected dancers. choreographers and teachers. Ms. Dunham used her talents. fame and resources to call attention to social injustices at home and abroad. In closing. Madam Speaker. Katherine was dedicated to improving the lives of Americas youth and correcting the social injustices at home and around the world. using her fame to increase support for the civil rights movement and to fight injustices worldwide. She is a good example of a person who has followed her passion and used her success for the greater good. We need more Americans to follow her fine example. Madam Speaker.

He is a despicable human being. The President talked about the chemical and biological threat. and he talked about the fact that he used chemicals on his own people. What the President failed to say was that he did that in the late 1980s when the Presidents father was in the Oval Office. when Colin Powell was a part of the administration. and we did nothing except block the efforts of Congress to impose sanctions. My point is all of these years later to come forth and try to use that argument to convince the American people that we should launch a preemptive war that to this point has cost over 530 precious American lives. has resulted in the injury of thousands of our troops. has consumed about $150 billion of resources. the word \"hypocrisy\" comes to mind here. The American people. when we hear that Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against his own people. assume that we are talking about something that happened within the last few months or last few years. not over 10 years ago.

Fred was always there for a laugh. a serious discussion. a game of cards. and was more than willing to take a good humored poke at someone whenever an appropriate occasion arose. Fred was an educator. banker. and businessman. He was as devoted to his professions as he was to his friends and family. He was restless in every venture he undertook. I think this came from his need to find his place in the world. This I can say for sure. he brought an unending amount of energy with him and will forever be remembered for his storytelling. You can rest assured that he probably never believed what he said himself. Fred will be missed very much by all who knew him.",

His breadth of knowledge and experience in national security. terrorism and intelligence issues have made America markedly safer in the wake of September 11. 2001. Mr. Gebhardt entered on duty as a Special Agent with the Bureau on July 7. 1974. and began his career investigating organized crime and narcotics. Mr. Gebhardt was the recipient of the FBI Medal of Valor as a result of action taken during an airplane hijacking event in Denver. Colorado in 1976. More recently as a Special Agent in Charge. Mr. Gebhardt oversaw numerous operational success in organized crime. counterintelligence. counterterrorism. cyber crimes and white collar crimes. But today. more than ever. America owes a debt of gratitude to Bruce Gebhardt for his work to retool and reshape the FBI after September 11. 2001. In August 2002. Mr. Gebhardt was appointed by Director Mueller to serve as Deputy Director for the FBI and for the last 2 years he has been responsible for restructuring the FBI into a counterterrorism and intelligence focused agency. As Deputy Director. Mr. Gebhardt has made important contributions to the national security of the United States and more fully prepared the Federal Bureau of Investigation to fight terrorism both at home and abroad. Mr. Speaker. I would like to offer my best personal regards to Deputy Director Gebhardt on his retirement from the FBI and wish him all the best in the future. I would also like to ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him on behalf of the American people for his service and commitment to our collective security.",

Before departing for their duty location in Northem Iraq they will return to Tennessee where they will appropriately have a sendoff on Veterans Day. Headquartered in Knoxville. the 278th is the only enhanced Armored Cavalry Regiment in the National Guard and one of only two in the United States Army. The 278th is the largest unit in the Tennessee Army National Guard. with units stretching from one end of Tennessee to the other. A large portion of the 278ths soldiers live in the 4th Congressional District. While visiting the 278th at Camp Shelby I talked with soldiers from across the 4th District. Every soldier I talked with expressed a devotion to family and country. Our troops have the energy and patriotism needed to encourage democracy abroad by promoting strong American values and ideals. The families should know that their loved ones are receiving world class training and equipment. In a State that claims Sgt. Alvin York as its native son no one should be surprised that Tennessee is appropriately named the Volunteer State. This largest callup of Tennessee National Guardsmen only further demonstrates our commitment to country. I would like to ask everyone to pray for our brothers and sisters who will shortly be put in harms way. May God look after our troops and their families.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the contributions of the late Henry Ford as the \"Father of Industrial Education\" and to express my deep gratitude for his enormous contributions to education. particularly technical training. Henry Ford was a strong advocate of providing educational opportunities. At Highland Park. where the Model T was produced. he organized English classes for newly hired immigrants. which assisted them in receiving their first citizenship papers. In 1930. Henry Ford announced that he would spend $100 million and devote the remainder of his life promoting and supporting educational concepts. Of the some 60 schools supported by Henry Ford. the one that brought him the greatest satisfaction and pride was the Henry Ford Trade School. The Henry Ford Trade School. established in Highland Park in 1916 with one instructor and a class of six disadvantaged students. quickly emerged as a pioneer of the modem concept of combining vocational training with related formal classroom instruction. Upon its move to the Rouge Complex in Dearborn in 1931. the school continued to offer educational opportunities to young men through the year 1952. At its peak. there were more than 2.800 students. aged 1317. and 135 instructors. A hot lunch was furnished without charge and for their effort. students were awarded a weekly cash scholarship and a monthly stipend to deposit in a bank savings account until they left school. The training offered at Henry Ford Trade School took on new meaning with the advent of World War II and the technical skills of the graduates were employed and challenged in various capacities to support the war effort. Many students also served in the military. In order to properly acknowledge the inspiration and guidance of Henry Ford. the members of the Henry Ford Trade School Alumni Association. some 400 strong. will perpetuate his memory with the unveiling of a lifesize bronze statue to be displayed at the welcome center for guests touring the factory at the newly reopened Rouge Complex. Mr. Speaker. I ask that you and all of my colleagues rise and join me in honoring the members of the Henry Ford Trade School Alumni Association on the occasion of their celebration. and to pay tribute and recognize the commitment and dedication of the late Henry Ford.",

TN. who have opened their home and their hearts to children in foster care. I am proud to announce that the Goodales are this years Angels in Adoption from the Fifth District of Tennessee. As many of my colleagues know. Angels in Adoption is an annual award sponsored by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute to honor families such as the Goodales who are among the nations heroes of adoption. The Goodales have a story that is nothing short of amazing. After raising four biological children of their own. the Goodales decided to fill their empty nest by adopting children out of foster care. The first of these children was Richard. who came to the Goodales home at the age of 2 for what was intended to have been a 2week stay. Richard. who is severely mentally disabled. was in the process of being institutionalized at a local facility when he came to the Goodales home. Richard. however. never left their care. and instead became their first adopted son. Now 18. Richard is still severely developmentally delayed and cannot speak. He also suffers from emphysema. and requires roundtheclock supervision and assistance. As nurses by profession. the Goodales have provided Richard with the ideal loving home. Shortly after Richards adoption. the Goodales adopted two brothers. Jonathan and Christopher. who were 11 and 9 at the age of their adoption and are now 24 and 23. They then adopted another group of siblings. James. Tracy. Jerome. and Lorri. Now also grown. these children were 7. 5. 4 and 2 when they joined the Goodale family. The Goodales. who are white. are blessed with a diverse. multiracial family. Richard is AfricanAmerican. Jonathan and Christopher are white. and the remaining four are biracial. Despite their commitment and perseverance. the Goodales have had to battle skepticism from caseworkers who initially believed these diverse placements to be inappropriate. Eventually. the Goodales even moved into an allblack neighborhood to demonstrate their respect for their childrens racial heritage. The Goodales are a truly remarkable family. and I am privileged to have been witness to the strength of this familys love.",

I am pleased to join with Congressman MARTY MEEHAN and Senators JOHN MCCAIN and Russ FEINGOLD to introduce the 527 Reform Act. which will close an election law loophole created by the Federal Election Commissions (FEC) failure to enforce the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). This failure on the part of the Commission is a longstanding tradition underscored by federal judge Colleen KollarKotellys September 18 decision in Shays v. FEC. which struck down 15 poorlydrafted rules promulgated by the FEC that undermined. rather than enforced. the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Our legislation will require 527 groups to register as political committees with the FECas they should have been doing all along. It also establishes new. effective allocation rules to ensure groups primarily focused on impacting federal races are regulated accordingly. For too long. the FEC has looked the other way as 527 groups have channeled soft money into federal elections. clearly violating the letter and the spirit of the campaign finance law. The 527 Reform Act does the job the FEC has failed to doit brings 527 groups under the same set of rules as every other political committee. In doing so. it ensures all groups acting primarily to influence federal elections play by the rules Congress and the Supreme Court intended. rather then allowing some to exist in a parallel world of election law anarchy. The bottom line is. groups that are in the business of influencing federal elections should be regulated by federal election law. and. by overriding the FECs longstanding misinterpretation of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act. that is exactly what this legislation will accomplish.",

Kentucky in February 2003. had been in Kuwait and Iraq since April 2003. When they returned home in midMay 2004 they were surrounded by loved ones who hadnt seen them in over a year. The transportation company was involved in various aspects of transportation. convoy operations and supply missions. Within the first 96 hours of arriving in Kuwait they pulled their first missionnot an easy feat. Often. they drove Humvees mounted with .50 caliber machine guns. escorting vital equipment throughout Iraq. The unit logged some 2.3 million miles in the 13 months they were overseas. I am very proud of the safety and performance record of the 1175th. They served with distinction by implementing the largest track vehicle movement since World War II not once. but twice in the matter of a few months. while training in the U.S. They also had the best safety record and operational readiness status of the other 15 plus transportation companies working in Iraq/Kuwait. Iraq is hot. dry. and dusty. Sometimes temperatures reached upwards of 135 to 140 degrees. Knowing the numerous dangers and environment it surprised me to read and hear statements from soldiers such as Sergeant Tommy Adcock say. \"Our Country has taken care of us. now its payback time.\" It is sad that the 11 75th lost two of its own. Staff Sergeant Nathan Jerome Bailey and Staff Sergeant David Leroy Lyod lost their lives defending a country they cared so deeply about. We need to remember that our countrymen are making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of this country. These men and women have served honorably and with distinction. What makes our country so great are all of the brave Americans that step up and defend this great nation. For that I say thank you and God Bless.",

As the Senator from Montana pointed out. general revenues will be used to cover the costs of the Dorgan amendment. We are in a deficit situation. Everybody acknowledges that. So where does the Senator think these revenues will come from? They will raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for the Dorgan amendment.

There is no dispute that for every $1 billion we spend on public works projectsfor example. building highways. roads. bridges. dams. water systems. sewer systemsfor every $1 billion we spend. we create 47.000 jobs. The math is simple. By spending just a few billion dollars compared to the multitrilliondollar tax program that has been recommended. we could create many more jobs. Those are direct. highpaying jobs. Every $1 billion. 47.000 jobs. Multiply that and it comes out to lots of jobs. especially those that would be created indirectly. I hope some day we have a real jobs bill. instead of what we are talking about. jobs and growth. call a pig a horse all you want. but it is still a pig. You can talk all you want about this tax bill and how much growth it will create. the fact is it is a program for the elite of this country. Simple and direct to the point. it is what it is. It is an effort to devastate the ability for domestic discretionary spending and cause tremendous harm to programs such as Social Security and Medicare. I hope when we vote on this measure there will be a resounding yes vote. I understand there will be a technicality raised because. under this rule. gerinaneness is a very tight rule and it will require 60 votes. That is not such a high burden. We should be able to have 60 Senators vote to put Social Security before giving tax cuts to the elite. My amendment goes only to the dividend tax cut. I hope we have support on that. If 60 Senators do not agree to support Social Security over a dividend tax cut. I feel very sorry for the remainder of the session and what it will do to the American people.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in support of the resolution commemorating the 50year history of rock n roll. Senator FRIST. the sponsor of this resolution. and myself are both from the State where rock n roll was bornTennessee. On July 5. 1954. Elvis Presley recorded his first record. \"Thats All Right.\" at the legendary Sun Studio in Memphis and rock n roll was officially born. Memphis being the birthplace of rock n roll should be of no surprise. since rock n roll isnt the first genre of music to be officially born there. During the Civil War era another musical tradition was born from the sons and daughters who followed freedom up the Mississippi River. The soulwrenching folk melodies of black Southerners laid the foundation for what would become the blues. Memphis has a vast history of being the center of American musical innovation. The heart of this music innovation is grounded in the cultural life of Beale Street. It was Beale Street where W.C. Handy. a wandering black musician and composer. was the first to put down on paper the sometimes grim but always hopeful fix of field hollers. gospel songs. cottonbaling calls. and African tribal songs. Forty years later. Beale Street and those same rhythms infected a young. aspiring musician named Elvis Aaron Presley. Elvis Presley came to Sun Records to make a record for his mother and ended up forever changing music and society. Sun Studios is the place where Sam Philips created his Rockabilly dynasty with Carl Perkins. B.B. King. Roy Orbison. Johnny Cash. Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis. Rock n roll evolved in the 1950s from rhythm and blues. and was characterized by the use of electric guitars. a strong rhythm with an accent on the offbeat. and youthoriented lyrics. Last July. Senator FRIST and I joined Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton in a singing ceremony. which designated Sun Records recording studio as a National Historic Landmark. Sun Records in Memphis. TN. is the true home of the blues and the birthplace of rock n roll. No other city in the United States can claim equal influence on the music of this Nation.",

Whereas Elvis recording of \"Thats All Right\". with Bill Black on bass and Scotty Moore on guitar. paved the way for such subsequent Sun Studio hits as Carl Perkins \"Blue Suede Shoes\" (1955). Roy Orbisons \"Ooby Dooby\" (1956). and Jerry Lee Lewis \"Whole Lotta Shakin\" (1957)--catapulting Sun Studio to the forefront of a musical revolution.

TN. that a young Elvis Presley recorded his first record. It was called \"Thats All Right.\" And at that point. rock n roll was born. That recording by legendary producer Sam Phillips at the now famous Sun Studio in Memphis paved the way for such subsequent hits which titles we all know: Carl Perkins \"Blue Suede Shoes\" in 1955. Roy Orbisons \"Ooby Dooby\" in 1956. and Jerry Lee Lewiss \"Whole Lotta Shakin\" in 1957. These early hits catapulted Sun Studio and Memphis to the forefront of that musical revolution. Throughout the 1950s. the unique sound. tremendous vision. and incredible talent coming out of Memphis. TN. with such artists as Elvis Presley. the \"King of Rock n Roll.\" B. B. King. Johnny Cash. Jerry Lee Lewis. and Carl Perkins. just to name a few. became the hallmark of that Sun Studio and later the hallmark of American rock n roll music. Indeed. some of the most meaningful contributions to American music were made at that Sun Studio. It is where our country. in many ways. came together and spoke with a new. a uniquely American voice that was and still is heard around the world. The fact that rock n roll was born in Memphis is no coincidence. That citys location on the banks of the Mississippi River made it a place where the diverse cultures and musical styles of our Nation came together. where they converged. blending the blues with country and with gospel and with jazz. That merging of cultures and styles continues today. The year 2004 provides the opportunity for our Nation to celebrate the birth of rock n roll and those many streams of music that converged in Memphis to create a truly American sound known throughout the world.",

Let me read something about a packing plant in Mexico for the interest of the consumers in this country. In May of 1999. one inspector paid a surprise visit to a meatpacking plant in Mexico. This is what he said he found: \"Shanks and briskets were contaminated with feces . . . diseasedcondemned carcass was observed ready for boning and distribution in commerce.\" But then the Mexican officials went to work to restore that plants ability to sell meat into America.

Do you want to know whether this meat came from that plant? I do. The American consumer ought to know. This Omnibus appropriations bill contains something that is pernicious on this issue.

He said if we went at last months pace of 1.000 jobs being created. it would take 200 years. That was 1.000 jobs last month. Over the last 5 months. 280.000 jobs were created. according to the Department of Labor. He forgot to mention that. But for December. I think he is correct as reported by the Department of Labor. It is kind of interesting. He also said we have to have a vote on increasing the minimum wage but those Republicans havent allowed us to do it. He said they havent allowed us to do it for the last several years. I remember a period with not necessarily the greatest fondest of memories. But for almost 2 years. the Democrats were in control. Senator DASCHLE was the majority leader. I believe from about June of 2000 or maybe 2001 until the end of 2002. He was the majority leader of the Senate.

PACT Act of 2003. which my friend Senator KOHL and I introduced on June 3. 2003. The managers amendment makes the PACT Act even stronger than as introduced. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and I originally introduced the PACT Act because of our concern that contraband cigarette trafficking both damages the economies of several States and contributes heavily to the profits of organized crime syndicates. including global terrorist organizations. When we reported this bill from the Judiciary Committee on July 31. 2003. I pledged to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address any and all concerns they had with the legislation. The result of this bipartisan effort is a piece of legislation that will prevent cigarette and smokeless tobacco smuggling and ensure the collection of tobacco excise taxes without infringing upon the rights of Native Americans or consumers. Internet sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are an impediment States face in their collection of tobacco excise taxes. A recent General Accounting Office report indicates Internet tobacco sellers rarely comply with requirements under the Jenkins Act of 1949 (15 U.S.C. \ufffd\ufffd375378 (2003)). The Jenkins Act. as modified by this legislation. is a Federal statute that requires tobacco retailers to register with the tax authority for each State in which they sell cigarette and smokeless tobacco products and to file monthly reports providing shipment information within each state. Failing to comply with the Jenkins Act damages not only individual States. but also retailers that are put in unfair commercial disadvantage. By ensuring the collection of state excise taxes from all tobacco retailers. the PACT Act will neither inconvenience nor hinder smokers and smokeless tobacco users in their ability as consumers to purchase the tobacco products of their choice over the Internet. This legislation merely removes any uncertainty regarding the scope of the Jenkins Act by explicitly mandating Internet tobacco retailers also comply with existing requirements under the Jenkins Act. This strong vehicle with which to collect taxes from Internet tobacco retailers will allow States to finally claim their rightful revenue and level the playing field for all tobacco retailers.",

I commend Senator M1KULSKI and Senator ENSIGN for this bipartisan proposal to strengthen current standards and do more to reduce the tragic toll of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. exceeded only by lung cancer. It strikes more than 200.000 Americans a year. Over 39.000 will die from breast cancer this year. Early screening is essential. More than 90 percent of breast cancers are now detected at an early stage of the disease. when treatment can be most effective. Because of early detection through regular mammograms. the death rate from breast cancer fell by 20 percent between 1990 and 2000. even though the overall incidence increased slightly. All women deserve access to mammograms of the highest quality. Its a tragedy when tumors are missed and lives lost because a screening was conducted poorly or interpreted inadequately. The legislation that Senator MIKULSKI and Senator ENSIGN have proposed will improve the quality of manmograms and help reduce the unacceptable toll of breast cancer and I urge my colleagues to approve it.

Presumably at that point the Democrats control the House of Representatives. presumably we will elect a Democratic Speaker. and. under the law of succession of 1947. that person is now in line for the Presidency of the United States. That is my understanding of the status quo as it exists in law today. I would just ask the gentlewoman if she is comfortable with that or disputes that is the status?",

He said the question before us. in essence. is whether you will have an elected Congress or an appointed aristocracy. The true question is. will you have any Congress or not? Not my bill. not the bill of the gentlewoman from California . not the bill of the gentleman from California . not the bill of Senator CORNYN. not any of the bills put forward would in fact ban elections. as the chairman repeatedly says. It is deeply frustrating to me to have a matter of this importance be misrepresented. No one disputes. and I firmly agree with you. that the mechanism to replace House Members should be direct election. ideally. and we should have them as promptly as possible.

It is true there were no hearings on the amendment of the gentleman from Washington during this Congress. There was a hearing in the last Congress. There was not very much support for the notion of appointing replacement Members of the House of Representatives. The gentleman from Washington introduced House Joint Resolution 83. Until the day it was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary. it had no cosponsors at all. Then there were two people who added their names to the joint resolution. including the gentleman from New York. There was one amendment that was offered during the committee markup when the resolution was open for amendment at any point. and it was subsequently withdrawn. When the Committee on Rules had its hearing last night. none of my Democratic friends offered any amendments for the Committee on Rules to consider. The gentleman from California did offer an amendment. I would point out that on November 15. 198a. when the Democrats were controlling the House. the House considered the Equal Rights Amendment. a very important constitutional amendment under suspension of the rules where there was only 40 minutes of debate and no amendments were offered. Twothirds vote was required under suspension. as it is for constitutional amendments. and it was voted down. But anybody who complains about this process where there is 90 minutes of debate. no amendments because it is a closed rule and. except for the gentleman from California . nobody offering any amendments. I think really ignores how the ERA was considered 21 years ago. Now. finally the gentleman from Washington filed a discharge petition. He wanted to bring the bill up out of the regular order. without any hearings. and without any committee consideration. What I did is there was a full markup at the committee where the amendment was open for amendment at any point. There was a vote in the committee. And the majority of the committee reported it out adversely. So I think that anybody who says we need more hearings should not have been on that discharge petition. Mr. Speaker.

I myself was elected to serve in the House of Representatives 3 years ago this month in a special election when my predecessor passed away. If my predecessor had been forced to make a list of successors. would have I been on it? I do not know the answer to that question. But I do know that it is unlikely that my constituents would have wanted their representative decided for them in any other manner than by election. In a time of national emergency. the people I represent should have a right to choose their next representative. To deny them this right would be autocratic and unjust. no matter how well intentioned the motive. Today. Mr. Speaker. we are considering a powerful amendment that could alter the very nature of our government. It would strip the voice of the people at a time of national emergency. a time when the peoples voices are most necessary and most moving. Without elections. our government becomes bureaucracy in action rather than democracy in action. It is precisely at such a time in such an emergency that we need to guard and defend the rights of our citizens to vote and not yield to the temptation to absolve that right. This bill undermines the legitimacy of the House of Representatives. It is no accident that our Founders designed the House of Representatives to be composed solely of elected representatives of the people. George Washington said: \"The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply. perhaps as finally. staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\" Mr. Speaker. our experiment with democracy has worked. As a Nation we have survived many national emergencies. disasters. and tragedies. We are the oldest working democracy because we make it clear that power in this government must remain with the people. I urge my colleagues to vote against House Joint Resolution 83.",

I do not believe it accomplishes the purposes that the sponsors have set out for us. Today is not the day of the vote for this proposal. It is still in a draft form and needs more work. The second question. What does one consider to be the essence of democracy? Is it continuity of government. or is it the right of a free people to be represented by those people whom they elect? If one believes in a seamless continuity. there has always been a way to do that. We have had kings. The king is dead. Long live the king. Succession just passes to the son or daughter. This particular proposal says succession will pass to people who we select. We die and the government will appoint one of those two people. That. in my view. provides continuity. but it does not preserve what I think is the essence of democracy. the right of a free people to be represented by those whom they elect. Finally. on the motion to recommit. which I believe is coming. the language that I read. I believe it is the current draft. says that this resolution will be sent back to committee for full hearings on this resolution. In the spirit of what has been said by the gentleman from New York and others.

I am probably the least likely person to be supporting a constitutional amendment. and I rise today neither in support of nor in opposition to H.J. Res. 83. the proposed constitutional amendment that the gentleman from Washington has offered. What I am disappointed about is that we have taken this very weighty national issue and turned it into what has essentially become a partisan issue. a political issue. and we have used this opportunity. instead of as an opportunity to hear from the people and to try to form a consensus about what should happen under these circumstances. to basically oneup the other side. Let me rush this thing to the floor without any real debate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first of all. I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker. Article I. section 2 of the Constitution states as follows: \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen by the People of the several States. When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State. the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such vacancies.\" The Constitution emphasizes the right of the people to govern themselves through their elected representatives. We should not ignore that Constitution. However. the constitutional amendment we are considering today would create unelected representatives. It would have vacancies during a disaster filled by appointees. The House already has passed H.R. 2844. introduced by the gentleman from Wisconsin . which passed by a three to one margin. It requires special elections to occur within 45 days of a disaster that kills more than 100 Members of Congress. While some wonder how the government would operate while we are waiting for those elections. there is a House rule that provides that a quorum shall consist of all Members who are living. During a time of disaster when many Members have died. the Speaker can adjust the required quorum to reflect the number of Members still living. On the other hand. by law. Senate vacancies are filled by the governor of the affected State. So if a significant number of House and Senate Members were killed during an attack and if House Members were appointed as well. as this constitutional amendment we are considering describes. we would then have a Congress of mostly unelected officials. That is another reason we must preserve the right of the American people to have elected representatives in the House. Some claim that a constitutional amendment providing for the immediate appointment of representatives is necessary for a government to function. but Congress has granted the President significant powers to act during a national emergency. Congress could utilize that reduced quorum until elections are held. Mr. Speaker. any constitutional amendment that would deprive the American people of the right to elect their representatives should be defeated. Democracy is always better than bureaucracy.",

Over the last three years. theyve locked in tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the very richest families in Americathose with incomes of over $1 million a year. As a result of this reckless tax policy. the federal deficit has ballooned to over $400 billion this year and these budget shortfalls are projected to continue as far as the eye can see. Another result of this tax policy is that we dont have the resources needed to fulfill the promises this Congress has made to the American people. The Republican budget passed earlier this year. which enabled the latest round of tax cuts. promised a $3 billion overall increase for education. The bill before us breaks that promise. Funding for special education in this bill is $1.2 billion short of what was promised in the budget resolution. Funding for Pell Grants to help families afford the rising cost of a college education falls $410 million short. and the maximum Pell Grant award is frozen. Title I funding promised in the budget to help school districts meet the new accountability requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act falls $334 million short of what was promised. Funding for improving teacher quality and afterschool programs is likewise significantly less than what was promised in No Child Left Behind. The bill before the House also shortchanges medical research. lowincome energy assistance. and healthy care for unemployed workers. The Majority likes to pretend that it can pass more than $2 trillion in tax cuts without any consequences. This is simply not true. The tax cutsagain. the lions share of which disproportionately benefit the very wealthyare being paid for by breaking promises made to adequately fund education. medical research. health care and energy assistance.

Despite the overwhelming support from people in my community and around the country for investing in the future. and for funding our commitments in the Presidents signature No Child Left Behind legislation. this bill would systematically undercut funding promises. This Congress has authorized funding levels that would help school districts implement costly new programs and provide Pell Grants to help lowincome college students struggling in a difficult economy. The House finds itself allocating far less than it authorized just months ago for IDEA programs. The administrations fiscal management leaves us with shamefully low funding levels for these programs and soaring budget deficits. While our school districts fight their own fight back home. this Labor/HHS bill cuts education funding for Oregons children by a total of $98.039.089 below the levels authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act and the IDEA Reauthorization Act. This is illustrative of the impact that will be felt in every state. and we ought to avoid this added burden on the nations school systems. At a time when so much has been done for a few who need help the least with massive tax cuts. it is unconscionable that we are not meeting obligations under prior legislation or even the minimal levels established under the Republican Budget resolution.",

Under this legislation. the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program would receive only half its discretionary allocation. This inadequate funding level stands in stark contrast to President Bushs budget. which proposes full funding for the program. The bill also ignores a bipartisan plea from the Chairman and Ranking Member of the authorizing subcommittee to fully fund this important program. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program (Title IVB. Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act) provides grants to states for four kinds of child welfare services: family preservation. family support. timelimited family reunification. and adoption promotion and support. The program represents the most significant effort by the Federal government to support services that may prevent child abuse and neglect from occurring. and that helps children move quickly from foster care to permanent homes. With over half a million children currently in foster care. and nearly one million cases of child abuse or neglect substantiated every year. funding for this program is vitally important. If we really care about helping and protecting our most vulnerable children. then we should be willing to make at least a modest investment to achieve that goal. Congress has approved nearly $3 trillion in tax cuts for mainly wealthy Americans in less than three years. Surely. we can spend a tiny. nearly imperceptible fraction of that amount on preventing child abuseand on helping struggling families. As this debate moves forward. I hope we can make progress on a goal President Bush laid out not only in his budget. but also in his 2000 campaign for the Presidency.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. clearly if this point of order is upheld. what the majority would succeed in doing is. again. hiding from the public the practical consequences to education and to health care. worker protection programs of the majority partys past actions on tax cuts. What the majority party is trying to do is to use the rules to segment the discussion of the budget process so that one day without any context whatsoever. the House considers tax cuts and then after they have done that. then separately they consider what will happen to the rest of the budget. We think that is going to wind up with an unhealthy result for the public. We do not control the House. Obviously. the majority party does. and so they have the capacity to use the rules that way. But when they do so. what they do. in my view. is to make meaningless virtually all debate and discussion in this House. And so if the gentleman insists on his point of order. we will have no choice but to concede it. and at that point I would simply then have a preferential motion at the desk which would ask that the enacting clause be stricken from this bill until such time as the House reconsiders its action on the tax package so that we do have room in the inn for the children this bill is supposed to serve.",

I want to point out once against that this budget is double what it was 8 years ago when we took over for all of these good things. Having said that. I oppose the amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote \"no\" on this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I raise this point of order respectfully and regretfully. but it is important that this section be struck. In 2001. I helped author and pass in this House a requirement that providers be required as of this October to submit all Medicare claims electronically. Because most electronic billing systems eliminate inaccurate and duplicate claims. the user fee is unnecessary. as Medicare will get dramatically fewer mistakes after October. Harnessing a new claims processing and billing technology is preferable to using a punitive. perclaim tax to reduce mistakes. In addition. current law gives small providers the leeway that they need. Hospitals with fewer than 25 fulltime employees or a physician practice with fewer than 10 fulltime employees are exempted from this requirement. In sum. the current law that goes into effect October 1 covers this matter and provides the proper small business exemption. But in addition. the issue of what is a clean claim can be a very controversial issue and intermediaries have enormous power in this matter.",
