    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I wish to speak in favor of the Sugar Stabilization Act as reported by the House Agriculture Committee. and to express to my colleagues why I believe this legislation is worthy of support. Everincreasing amounts of foreign sugar have been dumped or. our market by foreign producers unable to find any other nation willing to accept their excess stock. As a result. U.S. domestic prices are severely depresed. and producers in Texas. the State I represent. and in other States throughout the Nation. are losing money on every pound of sugar cane and sugar beets they produce. Surely the necessity of legislation to stop damaging imports and to assure the domestic producer a fairer price of production should take on an urgency because we have seen employment opportunities and investment potential lost through shutdown of sugar industry facilities. In addition. the Agriculture Committees formal report and other studies indicate many further reasons for enactment of this measure. four of which I believe bear special attention: Inflation control: During the 5year period of the program which would be initiated by the Sugar Stabilization Act. receipts to the U.S. Treasury are exoected to be almost $2 billion through imposition of import fees. Reduced Government interference: In addition. the legislation cuts Government costs by eliminating costly support programs and Federal controls on producers. Employment opportunities: The legislation eases pressures resulting from dumping of foreign sugar which has forced the closing of some sugar industry facilities. and so preserves valuable employment opportunities within the industry. Balance of payments: Because U.S. farmers currently produce only about 55 percent of the total U.S. consumption of sugar each year. imports account for the remainder and contribute significantly to the U.S. trade inbalance. Passage of the Stabilization Act offers a degree of assurance that our important production base of 55 percent will not be eroded. On behalf of the Nations sugar producers and the Nations sugar consumers. I respectfully request that you indicate your awareness of the magnitude of the problem before us. and your foresightedness in correcting the problem. by voting in favor of the Sugar Stabilization Act as reported by the House Agriculture Committee.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. I urge the House to favorably consider this bill. The present law passed the House in 1964. At that time I voted against the bill and I said. in part. that that formula was an upside down formula that works the wrong way for both consumers and producers. The formula in that bill provided that when domestic Droduction increases and imports would be less needed by consumers and do more harm to producers. the supply of imports could increase. When the domestic supply reduces and imports could increase. the supply that could be imported is reduced. It was upside down. as I have said. I was the only Member from the Iowa delegation to vote against it. The Cattlemens Association even campaigned against me in my district. I explained then that the formula was upside down. and I am even more convinced now. That bill was only designed to regulate the flow of lean imported meat to the amount of excess fat meat that was available. When there are excess supplies in the United States. farmers tend to feed cattle longer while waiting for a better market and thus the amount of excess fat is increased. Whenever the farmers feed more to the cattle or have excess fat on their cattle that increases the weight available and therefore there is demand for 3 pounds of lean meat for each 4 pounds of excess fat as far as the processors and packers are concerned. At last the consumers and the producers can both see that this was an upside down formula. At least now we can have a formula that turns it around. and this is one bill that both consumers and producers ought to support.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 11545amendments to the Meat Import Act of 1964which I consider most important to the maintenance of a sound cattle industry in this country as well as reasonable and stable meat prices for consumers. I am particularly pleased to support this bill because it is nearly identical to one I introduced last March. This legislation is vital to the cattle industry for a number of reasons. Mr. Chairman. Although the 1964 meat import law which it amends has been helpful in keeping the United States from becoming a dumping ground for foreign beef surpluses. it badly needs revision. The problem isit limits the amounts of fresh. chilled. and frozen beef and veal which can be imported to 7 percent of U.S. commercial production. Therefore. as U.S. production increases. so do importsand as U.S. production drops. imports drop. These fluctuations aggrevate the problems of domestic overproduction of beef and veal as well as domestic shortages. H.R. 11545 will establish a countercyclical method of determining meat import levels. increasing them when domestic production is low and restricting them when it is high. This will help to stabilize U.S. beef and veal production and prices at levels adequate to insure a fair return to producers. At the same time. it will keep prices from dropping unreasonably low during liquidation periods and enable cattlemen to stay in business and keep up with rising inflation. Most importantly. this legislation will tighten the flexibility the President now has to suspend meat import quotas and permit massive importation of foreign beef and veal. as he did last Junean action which was harmful to both cattle producers and consumers. Mr. Chairman. I urge the House to act favorably on H.R. 11545.",

I rise in support of this legislation which provides us with the somewhat unique opportunity to provide economic stability in a domestic industry and to bring order in consumer prices. and to do so at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. The adoption of the countercyclical formula .i a 3cnsible qfep which deserves our support. Even the administration has illdic_ .::-. i5 U! kiu ior tnis fo~rmula change since over the course of the cattle cycle it is no less restrictive on imports than current law. There are two provisions in this legislation which need to be changed if we are to achieve the bills objectives. The first is the 1.2 billion pound floor on annual meat import quotas. The countercyclical formula itself provides for an automatic floor and there is not need to establish this minimum. The bill contains no ceilings on imports and. indeed. provides for their increase over the formula amount under certain unique conditions. We should let the formula work and not dictate minimums. The other provision which I find. unacceptable is the 10year life of this legislation. As a supporter and cosponsor of Sunset legislation. I want to explain my opposition to a termination date in this particular instance. The cattle cycle itself is a 10year period. thus. this provision undermines the basic purpose of the bill which is to establish longterm policy which will guarantee stable prices and ample supplies. I do believe that the best interest of the domestic producer and the consumer is better served by eliminating this termination date. With these amendments I believe this bill achieves its objectives. After many lean years our cattle industry recently began to revive. However. we all know what happened. Imports were allowed to increase and cattle prices declined significantly. Such reactions on the part of the Government only works to our overall detriment. Cattlemen become discouraged. if not bankrupt. I urge that we act now. before it is too late. to save our cattle industry. This measure provides thc help that is necded and I hope it will be overwhelmingly approved.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of this bill. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Meat Import Act. Last May. several South Dakotans came to Washington to testify before CXXIV- 2146Part 25 the House Ways and Means Committee in order to get a bill like the one before us today on the House floor for a vote. While I am not satisfied with this measure. I do believe it will do a great deal to bring stability to our domestic beef industry. The Meat Import Act of 1964 has not provided the protection our domestic beef industry needs. and this lack of protection has hurt not only our family farmers and ranchers who raise cattle. but consumers as well. Many of our cattle producers are just beginning to recover the market they lost in 1973 when consumers boycotted beef due to high prices. The countercyclical formula contained in this bill will tie any increased imports to actual cowcalf production. This will insure that there is stability in our domestic industry. and that consumers will have an adequate supply of beef at reasonably stable prices. It is my hope the countercyclical formula will eliminate the fluctuations that have occurred in the industry and in the prices consumers pay for beef. While I would have liked the bill to be more comprehensive. I believe it is a step in the right direction. Ideally. many of my constituents would have liked labeling provisions included in the bill so our consumers would know when they are purchasing foreignproduced beef. South Dakota producers and consumers agree that foreign beef should be labeled. and meet the same quality standards we require for U.S.-produced beef. The legislation before us is not just a measure to aid U.S. cattle producers. It is a bill that will assist producers and consumers. I sincerely hope the House and Senate will act quickly to get the Meat Import Act to the Presidents desk before the end of the session.",

I have generally and strongly sunported the idea of congressional review of rulemaking. but the form of the gentlemans amendment gives us some difficulty because he is very specific about what happens in the instance of a rule promulgated after the beginning of a regular session of Congress and while Congress is in session. but it leaves us with a real question of what happens to a rule that is promulgated when we are not in session. Moreover. the time limitation that is involved here creates a situation where the rule might be promulgated and no real opportunity for its examination is afforded by the schedules of the Congress. the time In which it comes to us. and in fact we are unable to act. We then find ourselves In the position of. by not acting. being subject to the Interpretation by the American public that we have approved the rule. The way the gentlempn has structured the amendment. he exooses us to that. If there were any Inclination on the part of a person writing rules to escane the intent of the gentlemans amendment. it would In effect not only nrevent the Congress from acting but create at the same time the imresio\" that our failure to act was tacit approval of the Oroposed rule. For that reason I suvpAst that It just is not going to work for the type of rules that we are talking about.

Of course. we could even save more time if we would prohibit review altogether. Further. I imagine that if we had the kind of captive audience that some are looking forward to. some people might like to do that except that they might be going so far that they could not even get their side of the aisle to adopt that kind of provision. Mr. Chairman. I hope that this provision. which is so obviously -unfair. will not be supported on this side of the aisle either.",

In the interim. his \"moral equivalent of war\" has deteriorated into an endless war of words. The conferees have dug in behind ideological Maginot lines.

When one adds the intense political pressures reflecting the diversity of interests affected. this legislation is not surprisingly. moving quite slowly to final passage. In fact. today. 1 year after introduction. we find ourselves still at an impasse on the question of natural gas pricing and the crude oil equalization tax. Added to this is the frightening occurrence that despite public awareness of the need to conserve and the emphasis placed upon the energy issue. our domestic consumption of energy continues to climb at an alarming rate. I know you do not need to be reminded of the importance of reducing oil imports. but our current balanceoftrade deficit is $26 billion. We are importing $45 billion worth of petroleum products a year. A national energy program is desperately needed. The elements of the plan must include an increase in the price of the basic fuel commoditiesespecially crude oil and natural gas so that consumption is not maintained at a high level by artificially low prices. Also. effective steps to promote conservation and new production. and an emphasis on developing new technology to provide tomorrows fuel sources is badly needed. It all sounds deceptively simplebut we all know that it is not. We can deliberate indefinitely on this issue. but the facts speak for themselves. we no longer have the luxury of putting off hard decisions on energy. Time has become as precious a resource as energy. itself. The excuses that energy is a tough subject is no longer in order. Oratory about complexity of the issue will not reduce our imports or strengthen our currency. The Nation expects us to respond. sheer economic logic requires us to respondI call upon Members of both Houses of Congress to resolve their differences on this crucial issue and pass a comprehensive national energy measure.",

The Secretary predicted the supplies of oil would in todays dollars go to a price of over $30 a barrel. and that would have disastrous economic consequencesconsequences that would be graver than those of the depression of The only way we are going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is by increasing production of coal. I come from a rich coalproducing area in Pennsylvania. In that coalproducing section the industry says that unless we have an energy package bill passed by Congress. it cannot move forward with coal production. The coal industry believes at this time that it could go to the production of 850 million tons of coal under present conditions. As everyone knows. last year nationally we produced about 670 million tons of coal. Mr. Speaker. it is essential that the conferees come forward with an entire package on energy. not parts of a package. so that this country can reduce its dependence on foreign oil and increase production of coal in this country.",

Agriculture and industry alike cannot make business decisions. They cannot properly plan for the future because the energy bill languishes in the conference. They do not know what the supply of energy will be. they do not know what the cost of energy will be. Utilities that generate electricity do not know whether they must convert to coal. and. indeed. if they ultimately must do so. they cannot plan for tax considerations relative to the conversion of coal. Furthermore. the annual purchase of $45 billion a year in foreign oil has helped put our dollar in the red. When we buy more foreign products than we sell. the dollar buys less at the supermarket.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 1 week ago. the House voted. 371 to 6. that the rules of the House pertaining to open conferences shall be honored by the conferees on energy. In the week that has elapsed. there has been not a single indication that the conferees are paying attention to that action by this House. In fact. we have had a continuation of secret meetings. behind closed doors. a clear example of public business not being conducted in public. Not only has the public been excluded. but furthermore. conferees themselves have not been permitted to be present. Mr. Speaker. we are asking the House again now to make sure that we do not continue to do the business of this House in a regular daytoday fashion until House rules are complied with by the energy conference committee. This House is not in order until its rules and resolutions are honored. Business should not proceed until the House and its conference committees are acting in conformity with the rules. Second. Mr. Speaker. we are asking that the agreed upon portions of the energy bill be acted on positively by this House. Those completed sections deal with coal conversion. utility rate reform. and conservation. They constitute important elements of a national energy policy. We believe Members should have an opportunity to exercise their rights under the House rules to move for a vote on provisions of the energy package already approved by the conferees. Conferees were told weeks ago that the conference would entertain such a motion. but that commitment. too. has been ignored. Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the Presidents energy speech of April 20. 1977. That anniversary should be marked not by further deadlock and inaction. but by a signal that the vast majority of House Members of both parties favor the prompt consideration of an energy bill in an open atmosphere.",

    "speech": "When the United States acquired control of the Canal Zone. there were individuals owning property within the zone. including the defunct French Canal Company. The United States purchased their property. But the essential point that the Senator from Massachusetts makes is valid. The treaty of 1903 concerns much more than title to property. While it conferred upon the United States all the attributes that normally accompany sovereignty. the treaty makes clear that the United States did not claim sovereignty. In fact. the United States has never claimed sovereignty over the Canal Zone at any time since. Nevertheless. it is very misleading to describe the American position in the Canal Zone as one of being simply a property owner in fee simple. Property owners are normally subject to the jurisdiction of the government of the country in which the property is located. In the case of the Canal Zone. the United States exercises jurisdiction. American law applies. American forces occupy the zone and enforce extraterritorial rights against any Panamanian who enters the zone. So all the attributes of a colony exist in the Canal Zone. I have heard some Senators in this debate make an astonishing statementthat the United States has never had a colony. Well. that assertion must rest on a very confining definition of a colony. If you look at the Canal Zone. all the attributes that normally apply to colonial control are there. If something waddles like a duck. quacks like a duck. and flies like a duck. it is not an unreasonable conclusion that it is a duck. In the Canal Zone. as a matter of actual fact. the United States may not have de jure sovereign control. but it has a de facto control that contains all the elements of colonial rule. I think the Senator makes a very valid point. which really cannot be refuted.",

The Court rejected that argument. holding It is clear that the proposition cannot be sustained as the treaty differs widely in many respects from the provisions of that Act of Congress.\" This analysis then goes through the rest of the assertions contained in the Merin memorandum which the distinguished Senator from Arizona had printed in the RECORD. to show that. in fact. property was transferred pursuant to treaty. without the requirement of legislation. I think that is clearly a constitutional authority. I want to underscore the fact that does not mean that the President alone can transfer the property. The property can be transferred by treaty. But for a treaty to be binding. it must have the advice and consent of twothirdstwothirdsof the Members of the U.S. Senate. So it is not the President that can do that. It can be done by treaty.

It points out that the transfers were made by selfexecuting treaty. and goes on to note that this is evident from the Presidents message of transmittal to the Senate and the report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both the transmittal message and the report contained the statements that article VI of that treaty transfers to the Government of Japan certain properties of the United States. I think a careful analysis of the treaties that were listed as exemplifying the principle that treaties can transfer property. a careful analysis of those treaties will bear out that position. That is a position that the vast preponderance of constitutional authorities support.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most common complaints against our Federal Government is the unnecessary amount of paperwork required of our citizens to comply with Federal laws and regulations. H.R. 7012 attempts to ease this situation at least for the farmers by mandating the reduction by 40 percent of the number of questions to be asked on the agricultural census form. The most recent census of agriculture required American farmers to fill out long. complex and sometimes irrelevant questionnaires. on which the number of questions had grown from 480 in 1964 to 911 in 1974. While we realize that it is important that reliable agricultural information be collected and published regularly. it is neither necessary nor desirable for farmers to be forced to fill out incredibly detailed forms. It is estimated that at least 1.4 million hours of time required to fill out the agricultural census forms would be saved if this bill becomes a law. In order to reduce the paperwork so dramatically the Bureau of Census would be required to cut the size of its questionnaires and to make greater use of sampling techniques. H.R. 7012 would also require the Bureau to collect certain limited information on very small farmsnot as detailed as collected on larger unitsbut some information on small farming enterprises is necessary to develop a comprehensive rural policy for this Nation. The bill redefines a farm. for census purposes. as having a minimum sales of $600 a year. subject to changes equal to changes in the Consumer Price Index. It is felt that if the Bureau of Census stops counting very small establishments such as farms. the executive branch may decide that small farms are no longer viable in America. Proof of this is shown in the most recent Bureau of Census statistics showing a precipitous decline in the number of farms in the United States which was caused. in effect. by redefining a farm as having a minumum of sales of $1.000 annually. Mr. Speaker. this is a good bill. and worthy of the support of my colleagues. and I urge its passage.",

This is a bill that provides for a 40percent reduction of the burden on respondents in the censuses of agriculture. drainage. and irrigation taken in 1979 and thereafter. The Commission on Federal Paperwork. of which I am privileged to be chairman. at its meeting in June 1976. outlined the problems associated with the past agricultural censuses and recommended to the Bureau of the Census that they adopt procedures very similar to those ordered by H.R. 7012. Those procedures will reduce the amount of detailed information requested and require greater use of modern sampling techniques in the 1979 census. It is my understanding that plans to implement our recommendation are well underway by the Bureau of Census. Accurate and timely information regarding agricultural statistics is vital to the wellbeing of America. This information is possible by the adoption of this legislation. The Commission on Federal Paperwork is happy to have been in the forefront with this effort. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a sponsor of legislation similar to H.R. 7012. I rise in support of this bill to reform the method used for collecting agricultural census data and to block any future efforts of the Bureau of the Census and the Department of Agriculture to redefine \"farm.\" The need for this reform was made clear by the argricultural communitys reaction to the unnecessarily complex and detailed census questionnaire used by the Bureau of the Census in collecting information for the 1974 census. The need to prevent the Bureau and USDA from summarily wiping out thousands of small farms through word manipulation exercised in redefining \"farm\" was also made clear by the results of the 1974 census. Such a surge of farmer resistance resulted from the timeconsuming complexity of the agrecultural census formbetween 1964 and 1974. the number of questions on the census grew from 480 to 911and from the coercive methods used by the Bureau of the Census datagatherers resulting in serious distortions in the data. Further distortion came out of the redefinition of the term \"farm.\" Hundreds of thousands of small farms and millions of cattle were not counted in the census. Goodfaith use of the inaccurate data has been blamed in part for spurring unwise production decisions in the cattle industry which helped to set off a longrunning. oversupplyinduced price depression in the cattle market. I mention this because it is just one example of the kind of problems inaccurate agricultural census information can help to generate. It is pointless for us to spend the dollars of American taxpayers to collect data if that information cannot be relied on as accurate and cannot be put to practical use for our people. It is estimated that this legislation will eliminate at least 1.4 million hours or 40 percent of the time required for the filling out of forms associated with the 1974 agricultural census. In order to reduce this paperwork burden. the Bureau of the Census will necessarily have to cut down the size of its questionnaires and use timetested sampling techniquessomething the Bureau should have been doing all along. This bill will effectively allow us to strike a blow for reduction in Federal paperwork in general without adversely impacting informational needs. I urge its adoption.",

I can attest personally to the care which the gentleman from Wisconsin and his subcommittee have taken in examining the issues presented by this legislation. Among the many people who support the legislation are individuals like former Senator Tydings. who appeared before the American Bar Association. and he was one of the original drafters of the 1968 magistrate legislation. Senator Tydings observed: Personally. I have a deep and sincere conviction with regard to the merits of this bill. I take pride in. and have received great gratification from. the fact that I helped draft the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 and personally chaired the extensive hearings on the legislation while a U.S. Senator. This bill is a logical extension of the principle. and in keeping with the purpose and intent of. that Act when originally enacted In 1968. Mr. Chairman. my good friend and our colleague from Massachusetts mentioned at least two reasons why he will feel constrained to oppose the legislation. One is that he feels that there is no longer the need for this legislation given the imminent enactment of the omnibus judgeship bill. I would suggest to the gentleman that this might be true. and there might be some underutilized magistrates and some instances where there is clear misuse of talent. But at leastusing the State of Kentucky as an examplemy judges at home tell me that in short order there will be need for even more Federal judges even with the enactment of the omnibus judgeship bill. Which in the State of Kentucky would provide two permanent and one temporary Federal judge. even that will not be sufficient. But. the gentleman also cites constitutional arguments against the enactment of this legislation. I would directnot that he needs his attention called to itbut I would direct the attention of the Chamber to pages 10 and 11 of the committee report. which deal with the constitutional argument. The committee did make a very serious study of that. referring back to hearings in earlier Congresses. referring to studies done by the Department of Justice and by a Judicial Conference Committee on the Administration of the Federal Magistrates System. all of which concludedthese jurists and academiciansthat this is constitutional.",

I am distressed to see the inclusion of funds to begin stage I of the socalled Hudson River skimming project. This proposal has been the object of a great deal of opposition in New York State. and for good reason. Not only is it unsound from the environmental and economic points of view. it also could pose a serious threat to public health. The Hudson River project. proposed by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. calls for water to be taken from the Hudson River near Poughkeepsie. treated. and then piped into the New York metropolitan area. It is claimed that the project. which would eventually cost $4.6 billion. is necessary to eliminate a projected shortage of water in the year 2000. However. the TriState Regional Planning Commission and other groups have shown that the shortage will not be nearly as severe as claimed. Inaccurate population projections and questionable per capita rates of water consumption have contributed to a greatly overstated estimate of shortage. Presently. New York City water is among the purest in the country. because its source is uncontaminated upstate rainwater. The waterskimming proposal would add to this Hudson River water. shown to be contaminated by a wide variety of toxic and cancercausing chemicals discharged into the river as industrial waste water. Chemical pollution of the river has become so serious that commercial fishing in the Hudson has been banned by the State. It is very difficult and expensive to test for and treat harmful substances and even treated water may contain dangerous levels of toxic chemicals. To subject New Yorkers to such potential hazards is unnecessary and risky. In conclusion. there are far less risky alternatives worth investigating to meet New York Citys water needs. A program of water conservation alone could save over 400 million gallons of water each day. These savings. combined with better use of existing reservoirs. would make it unnecessary to adopt this proposal.*",

We have a great deal of corn on hand right now. and Members should be advised that keeping a viable corn sweetener industry going means the use of about 300 million bushels of corn per year.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I urge adoption of the Sugar Stabilization Act of 1978 as reported by the Committee on Agriculture. This important piece of legislation is needed to preserve and protect the domestic sugar industry. In large measure the problems faced by our sugar industry stem from foreign imports. Heavily subsidized foreign sugar is flooding into our Nation. Following a series of record crops worldwide. other countries are taking their excess stocks and exporting them to the United States. Serving as a dumping ground for foreign sugar is injuring our own domestic producers. Prices are being depressed to the point where producers are losing money on their crops. Unless we act now. the domestic sugar industry could be irreparably shattered. To help reverse this trend the bill establishes a price objective of 16 cents per pound. That figure would be adjusted semiannually based on the parity index and the wholesale price index. A system of mandatory import fees and quotas would be utilized to achieve the price objective. I think it is also important to note what the bill does not do. Most significantly. the legislation is not an income support program with taxpayerfinanced payments to producers. There are no Government payments to producers. In addition. I would point out that this is not just a bill for producers. Consumers also benefit from having a strong domestic sugar industry. Dependence on foreign sugar would leave us at the mercy of other countries when it comes to price. You can be sure that if our sugar industry collapses the price will skyrocket. The bill approved by the Committee on Agriculture is a major step toward assuring a strong domestic sugar industry. It will aid producer and consumer alike by promoting price stability and assuring that we do not become increasingly dependent on foreign supplies. I urge its adoption.",

I would even go so far as to say the public is being ripped off. I do not think it is being ripped off by the sugar producers. I wish someone could explain to meand perhaps there are some answers availablewhy. when the sugar price went so high. all the soft drink manufacturers and all the big candy companies doubled the price of their product and cut in half the size of their product. and why today. when the price of sugar has gone down to about 10 cents a pound. the size of the soft drink and the price of the soft drink is still out of sight and the size of the candy bar is still just half of what it used to be. If there is a ripoff going on. I think perhaps we ought to consider looking at some of these industries when there is talk about fortunes being made. Did anyone ever look into the fact that when the price of sugar goes down. none of the prices of any of these corresponding products also go down? That is where we use sugar. We do not use it in raw form. We use it in consumer soft drinks and candy bars. et cetera. That is where the real ripoff is taking place.",

The amendment requires procedures which are comparable to those of Executive Order 11902. February 2. 1976. Additionally. the amendment establishes a specific procedure for the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the timing of his decisions and preparation of a nuclear proliferation assessment statement. These procedures will insure that the statutory authority granted to the Director cannot be used in a way to delay or stop a pending subsequent arrangement. The amendment does provide a waiver of the 30day time requirement in the event that the President grants such a waiver. The intended result of these various requirements will be to insure that subsequent arrangements are handled in an expeditious and procedurally predictable fashion. Since section 303 in effect delineates the interagency coordination and approval requirements for U.S. Government actions with foreign governments and commercial entities. it is desirable that these coordination procedures provide for timely consideration of the approvals. The executive branch had two comments on this amendment in its January 26. 1978. letter of the State Department to Senator SPARKMAN. One dealt with reference to the executive order as we have discussed on the last two amend.ments. The same agreed upon formulation for incorporation in the prior amendments will be used in this amendment.

In this latter context the amendment is absolutely necessary. and the Senator from Illinois is totally correct that we must have predictability. that we must have workable timeframes. we must have schedules that can and will be met.

I think. substantially helps the bill in that suppliers and buyers will know exactly what they are up against with regard to time. They can set specific time limits then for their negotiations and be assured that the United States will not only be a guaranteed nuclear supplier. but do it on a timely basis.

We have indicated throughout that we are working closely with the Senator from Idaho on these matters. who is also concerned. I have noticed an increasing degree of understanding now.

I am encouraged by the fact that they felt. either by necessity or by desire. that they had the wisdom to make this statement publicly. so that the worlds public can see what the concerns are and what the limitations are. We. of course. also on the part of our Government have launched the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation. which will be ongoing for .the next several months and probably we will not see a report on that until in 1979. But that report is an important part of the ongoing international inquiry as to what can be done to reduce the dangers to which we all address ourselves and about which we are all concerned. Without belaboring the point on this amendment. though. let me say to my friend from Ohio. that basic simple security arrangements can also become highly technical closely held internal security matters. Imagine a foreign government being required to come before our Nuclear Regulatory Commission to give details of the security arrangements around their nuclear weapons factory or installation for the security of nuclear weapons that may be stored. Even our own Government will not do that. We cannot require other governments to do what we in our wisdom in our own country will not do. and that is the reason why basic simple security becomes a basic complex security question.

I hope they will establish internally the limitations on both the obtaining of that information. of what kind of information they will get. by their own action because I think it would be an error if. as a matter of fact. there were no limitations placed upon NRC by their own restraint or by their own guidelines. It may be one or the other. and the guidelines themselves could restrain. because once that material is obtained it is unclear to this Senator what the Freedom of Information Act. the Administrative Procedure Act. may do with respect to sensitive information obtained from foreign governments by way of the State Department. which could then be under this provision re-. quested by NRC.

So why should this proposed boycott of chromium apply only to Rhodesia? In 1975 we imported 49 percent of our chromium from the Soviet Union. If we are going to base our chrome import policy on whether or not exporting countries deny their citizens basic human rights. then at least. let us be consistent. If denial of human rights is the driving factor in these importexport decisions. then this embargo of chrome absolutely must extend to the Soviet Union. How can any Member of this Congress vote to embargo chrome from Rhodesia but not the Soviet Union? How can any Member of this Congress not admit that the Soviet Union is a far more oppressive regime than the one in Rhodesia? Mere consistency and intellectual honesty requires that the Soviet Union be included in the provisions in this bill.

The means of accomplishing this suppression has ranged from simple incarceration in a psychiatric hospital. to long years and repeated sentences in forced labor camps and including execution. Mass resettlement has been used. quotas on admission to higher educational institutions has also been utilized. Whole areas of the U.S.S.R. have been depopulated in order to stifle resistance or nationalist tendencies on the part of minorities in the Soviet Union. Now some Members may say that if we reimpose the ban today. and we also ban imports from the Soviet Union. then we have only South Africa left as a major importer and that is true. But these Members should also recall that the Soviet Union cut off imports of their chrome during the Berlin Blockade of 194849 as well as during the Korean war. so if we cut off Rhodesian chrome today. we are essentially down to one supplier anyway. except for minuscule quantities available from places such as Turkey. the Philippines. and Brazil. We have testimony from Soviet refugees that chrome ore in the U.S.S.R. is mined by slave labor. Rejection of this amendment is total hypocrisy. I move for the adoption of this amendment.",

In this letter Chairman ZABLOCKI notes that paragraph 2 of H.R. 1746. the bill under consideration. establishes procedures for the Department of the Treasury with respect to certificates of origin as the means to determine that steel mill product shipments do not contain Southern Rhodesian chromium. Further the chairman concedes that such matters are technically within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means and. therefore. H.R. 1746 is subject to sequential referral to the Committee on Ways and Means. Although we on the Committee on Ways and Means did not request sequential referral.

Therefore. the importer must accept at face value the exporters certificate of origin regarding chromium content.

We have gone through this issue with five bills in three successive Congresses. only to see four of those bills. all very similar to H.R. 2 defeated on a rule or vetoed. Now is the time. under the strong leadership of Chairman UDALL and the support of the President finally to pass a strip mining bill. I need not go into the details of why this legislation is necessary. The issue Is a very basic onewill we make use of the technology we now have available to us to restore and preserve the beauty of thousands of acres of land in this Nation? I believe we must. In fact. I would go so far as to say that there is no great debate about whether in fact we need a strip mining bill. but rather about what kind of bill we need. H.R. 2 was reported by the Interior Committeea committee with a rather independentminded and freewheeling membershipby a vote of 39 to 3. Certainly. such support for the bill as it stands attests to the fact that the bill represents a fair and equitable compromise on the many complex details involved in regulating stripmining. I would also suggest that there is another hidden benefit in H.R. 2. beyond the simple preservation of our lands. The mining industry has been working for several years with a veritable sword of Damocles over their headswhen would there be a strip mining bill and what would be its provisions? Such doubts were an impediment to the fullsteamahead kind of production of coal that we must have. Passage of H.R. 2 would put an end to those doubts and allow the mining industry to continue to make its vital and valuable contribution to our energy system. On that note of conciliation. Mr. Chairman. I conclude by urging the support of every Member of this body for H.R. 2. as reported by the committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 2. In the past 5 years. Congress has engaged in a prolonged legislative effort to produce an acceptable strip mining law. Accordingly. H.R. 2 is better balanced and drafted than its predecessors. permitting orderly implementation and mitigating production and employment losses. Although the major coal producing States have legislation to regulate surface mining. these laws vary greatly in procedure and enforcement. Federal legislation will alleviate these discrepancies. removing unfair competitive advantage of States with less stringent regulations. Based on President Carters energy address to the Congress. coal will play an increasingly important role in our total energy picture. As this shift to coal occurs. it is clear to me that we will have to have some form of uniform and minimum standards for the reclamation and rehabilitation of the lands which are mined. This legislation. H.R. 2. in my opinion. will apply these standards in a fair and equitable manner for all engaged in surface mining activities. Considering the arid climate and lack of water in that region. land reclamation may be impossible following some surface mining operations. Under such circumstances. I believe it should be national policy that mining not be allowed. In other words: If reclamation is not possible. coal surface mining should not be permitted. I continue to oppose section 510(b) (6) \"consent of private surface owners to mine private coal.\" The committees amendment to this section appears to confer new property rights on some surface owners in all States and to impose a new concept of Federal property law in an area traditionally reserved for the States. I believe this provision should be closely scrutinized and deleted. With this reservation. I submit H.R. 2 to my colleagues for their approval.",

So we have tough. rigid. mean kind of standards. We say to the operator: \"Dont go in and take out the coal unless you can show us you can put the land back.\" I visited one slope in Pennsylvania where there is a small operator who has less than 25 employees and very few pieces of equipment but who is one of the best in the business. He was operating on a 300 slope and. when finished. there were grass. trees. and good soil. So. if they can put it back. then they can go in and get the coal out.

If it had not been for the tenacity. for the fairness. and for the constant attempts to achieve a reasonable balance in this legislation by the distinguished chairman of this committee. generations to follow would have asked with much justification how we could have permitted a situation to exist for so long that this legislation finally will cure. We are. indeed. on the dawn of a new era. No longer will we be able to waste our limited energy resources as we have been accustomed to in the past. I think the timing of this legislation is. indeed. perfect. It comes on the heels of the Presidents address only about 8 days ago when he beseeched this Congress and. indeed. the Nation to start on the new era. to which I have alluded. I think this legislation represents a first step in this new approach to our energy problems. I think we would be deluding ourselves if we assume for only 1 minute that the conversion to coal from the other energy sources that we have been accustomed to is going to be easy. There are still some very serious environmental impacts that will result from the utilization of coal even with the adoption of this legislation. but I appreciate the work of our chairman and the work of those who have made this legislation possible.

Earlier in the debate mention was made of support of this legislation by Mr. Schlesinger. our energy Secretary. I would like to quote one paragraph from his letter: Years of controversy over this legislation have increased the uncertainties facing the coal industry and the prospects for relying on more coal in this country.

The report. which was approved unanimously by the Democratic members of the committee. is filed with minority and additional views. Mr. Speaker. this report generally commends the Carter administration for addressing \"in a responsible manner\" most of the problems the Nation faces on its road to recovery from the economic recession that started in 1975. Nevertheless. we conclude that with proper policies economic performance can be better than the administration has forecast. A major thrust of the report is on monetary policy. It notes that fiscal policy has borne the brunt of the recovery in the last 3 years while monetary policy has remained preoccupied with the problems of slowing inflation and more recently with the international condition of the dollar. One of the consequences of this onesided monetaryfiscal policy mix has been that consumption and Government spending have expanded while growth of investment and net exports have been retarded. This report states clearly that economic stimulus. in addition to that proposed in the budget. is needed in 1978 and 1979. This stimulus should be implemented through an expansionary monetary policy. To achieve this stimulus. the growth of the money supply should be such that the rise in shortterm interest rates is reversed. Policy in 1978 should tend to move shortterm rates toward their 1977 levels. Interest rates should be maintained at these lower levels in The report contains many additional recommendations. It calls for a complete review of the social security financing system. It recommends a coordinated approach to fiscal and monetary policy formation. And it discusses many policies to address our serious structural problems of inflation and unemployment. Rather than go into further detail. Mr. Speaker. I commend this report to your attention.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the last few weeks intense controversy has surrounded the portion of H.R. 11315 that reduced the amounts that political party committees could contribute to or spend on behalf of their congressional candidates. Arguments over this single issue have been so heated as to obscure the strong case that exists for taking favorable actions on many of the important features of the bill as well as the FoleyConable amendment to establish a system of partial public financing of House general elections. This situation has been changed. however. by the fact that yesterday House Administration Committee chairman. FRANK THOMPSON. placed in the RECORD an amendment he intends to offer in order to restore the political party giving and spending levels to those contained in the current Federal campaign laws. To deal with another point of contention. I placed in the RECORD an amendment that I plan to offer to strike the provision in H.R. 11315 that would prevent national and State political party committees from transferring funds among themselves for the purpose of making candidate contributions or expenditures. These two amendments make it clear that the political party issues that have led to such a high level of partisan polarizations and controversy can be resolved. As a result. the stage is now set for the House to consider the other important issues in the committee bill and the FoleyConable amendment. There is no longer any room to argue that the legislation is designed to discriminate in an unfair or partisan manner. All Representatives who find it unacceptable to continue the current system of campaign financing should join together in helping to enact this legislation. For these reasons. I strongly urge my colleagues to lend their support to the rule. to the amendments Chairman THOMPSON and I will be offering. and most important. to the FoleyConable amendment.",

Now. by kidnaping the countrys former Premier. the terrorists have shown that the very foundations of Italian Government and society may be endangered if such actions continue with impunity.

This forthcoming election will be no different. I have been able to raise that money. as has my opponent. without resort to the partial public financing. But the hardest question I have to explain to my constituents is: Why should it cost that much to run for public office? Why should it be that expensive? I go through all of the rationale about how it is a closely divided district and the people are articulate and sensitive. and therefore you have to reach out and approach them. But it is wrong. It is wrong and impossible to explain. One of the reasons. and the main reason. I am for partial public financing. as suggested by my colleague from Illinois. is that that is the only constitutional way that we can impose any limitations on the amount that is being spent. The cynicism that the American people have about this body and about many of the other institutions is. in large part. brought about by our incapacity to understand the dynamics of running for public office. If we do not put some kind of check on how much we spend and. as far as I know. this is the only means for imposing that check. we are never going to restore the confidence that the American people must have if our institutions are to work. It is that simple. There has been a lot of talk about how this helps incumbents and how it does not help incumbents. Most of us are going to be able to get elected or not elected without regard to whether this bill passes.

I urge a vote against the previous question because I support public financing and I shall limit my remarks to that. Having said that. I would like to address first the issue of expense. There is. as of February 1978. $67.8 million in the presidential election campaign fund. It is estimated that the funds balance by the 1980 elections. when this bill would take effect. were public financing to be voted. would be $182 million. The estimated cost of the presidential election campaign would be $90 million. That would leave $92 million to cover the House general elections. and it is estimated that the actual cost would be $25 million. That is. I agree. not a piddling sum but it is a small price to pay if it makes a contribution to the integrity of our electoral process. I acknowledge that the average taxpayer is slightly tipped in balance against the public financing of elections. I do not know how the questions have been asked. but I suspect they think the money is simply going to be taken out of the till and split up among the candidates. That is not the case. and. quite frankly. public opinion may be changed once it is explained to the people that it will be available only for matching contributions up to the $100 level. This is the way in which the influence of the small contributor can be magnified. which is something that the average American would like to see. There is a malaise out there among the people about what is happening in our electoral process. as the base of financial support remains very narrow and the amount of money to be spent on election campaigns goes up and up.",

Inevitable disclosures will follow the next election. with widespread public interest in who contributes the large sums of money to incumbents and to successful challengers. This bill will not aid the incumbent but the challenger who has to rely on the small contributions. We all know that incumbents are frequently supported by interests who view their contributions to them as access moneyand they are willing to pay heavily for access. The power of incumbency is something that does attract special interest contributions. while the small contributors represent the base on which the challenger rests his campaign. Quite frankly. I would much prefer to see our electoral process based on as broad a base of contributions as possible. I would like to see some effort made to control the expenditures that are made. in our election campaigns. I am not smug about our electoral process as it presently exists.

All we are asking this afternoon is a chance to vote on a simple proposition that would permit us to extend that same mechanism. that same principle. to the financing of congressional campaigns. Does anyone in this Chamber really want to regress and go back to another era when we financed Presidential campaigns in the manner that became so scandalous in 1972 and even in prior years? I think not. We know. inevitably. and the figures have been cited here this afternoon. that the special interest money is going to be squeezed into those congressional campaigns. as it is forced out of the Presidential campaign. because of the financing we have enacted for the Presidency. Now. the real message of proposition 13. and we have heard many references to the fact that the taxpayers are in revolt. the real message of proposition 13 is that people are resisting bad programs. inefficient and ineffective government. that all too often has come about because we have listened to the voices of the special pleaders. who by virtue of their special interest contributions have gotten the ears of Members of Congress and the committee chairmen. and as a result we have passed poorly designed legislation. I think that is the message of proposition 13. If we would be responsive to the people of this country. I agree with the gentlewoman from New Jersey. the best bargain that we could give them for their money is the $25 million which it is estimated public financing of congressional campaigns would cost in 1980. We are not dipping into the taxpayers pocket. There is now $67.8 million in that fund. The amount available for public financing from the voluntary checkoffthe voluntary checkoffwould be $92 million in 1980. Mr. Speaker.

We cannot. of course. have every campaign report carefully audited. That would be too expensive. it would be too time consuming. and the paperwork would in most cases.

I had contemplated wearing my \"WIN\" button in anticipation of speaking. because what we are talking about in this amendment is whipping inflation. Mr. Chairman. I would like to point out a couple of things. First. that the figures in this budget resolution covering the debt. the deficit. the total revenues. the total outlays and the total budget authority and the functional amounts are purely advisory and therefore can be moved around by this body. I think we should keep that in mind that in voting for this substitute we are really talking about totals. the deficit. revenues. outlays and budget authority. There are only two fundamental issues. A vote yes on this substitute amendment is a vote against runaway inflation and it is a vote for confidence in the economy of this Nation. If this body tonight were to adopt this amendment in the nature of a substitute there would be a ripple of confidence running through our economy in business decisions tomorrow that would do a great deal to bring about the kind of continued economic growth that would provide permanent jobs and would provide the taxes to support the local and State governments in doing the kind of things that all of us feel are so important to the quality of life in this country. Lastly. I would point out that a vote for the resolution as it is before us with the large deficits. with the large debt limits. with the large outlays. is a vote basically to increase the taxes on the American people. the hidden taxes of inflation. as they are pushed into higher and higher brackets and their purchasing power shrinks. In effect we are voting a tax increase if we support the budget resolution without the Latta amendment.",

Not only does this resolution substantially reduce the projected budget deficit for fiscal year 1978 but more importantly proposes a 10percent reduction in all individual income tax rates to help inflationproof the incomes of the American people. The budget for fiscal year 1978 has undergone considerable revision since it was first proposed. First it was revised by President Carter. whose latest revision increases outlays to $462.6 billion. This represents an increase of more than $22 billion above the Ford budget. The majority members of the House Budget Committee. however. have increased this figure still further. to $467 billion. This would result in a projected deficit of $69 billion in fiscal year 1978. I believe the way to get this economy going again. create jobs. reduce inflation and help the average American. is to lower their taxes.

It will say to Russia and the world that America is or is not prepared to stand strongto hang toughin the face of an obvious push for Communist supremacy worldwide. This vote can reveal Americas reaction to the collapse of the efforts to revitalize the SALT :I talks between Russia and the United States. a collapse due to Russian arrogance gained through growing military strength. It is obvious that there must now be greater stress on more adequate military preparedness for America. This does not mean an arms race. It means the Russians are close to superiority and that they will take advantage of this situation. The steady gains by the Russians have left them in position to deal more aggressively in conferences and throughout the world. Only a strengthening of American military posture will change this situation. The Russians apparently feel that this is the time to flex their muscles and they are pressing for advantages worldwide. The Burlison amendment is only a small beginning but it can be a very significant one. This is not a time to cut Americas defense. Even a modest reversal of the downward trend in Americas defense posture will produce a significant reaction abroad and a reawakening of confidence at home. One more backward step will produce just the opposite. The free world wants America to lead. We can lead only if we are strong.",

I offer a Budget Committee amendment to the first budget resolution for fiscal year 1978 to cover reestimates of commodity program expenditures in the agriculture functional category. The amendment increases outlays for the agriculture function and the budget resolution total by $1.515 million. This change is necessary to accommodate recent administrative actions and changes in the economy which will require payments to be made under current law. The committee was aware during its markup that some adjustment would have to be made for this program. but deferred action until events settled down and a reliable estimate could be developed. Among other things. during committee markup. the administration was in the process of presenting its farm policy recommendations to the Congress. I have discussed this matter several times with the gentleman from Washington. the distinguished chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. and his staff. and I have also talked about it to Director Lance of the Office of Management and Budget. The administration has now submitted a revised estimate for this program. which has been reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office and the committee staff. This increase assumes that administrative actions to extend wheat loansthe reseal programto expand storage facility loans. and to increase price support levels for wheat. feedgrains. and dairy will require additional expenditures. Further. it is assumed that deteriorating economic circumstances for commodities. such as wheat. will require larger loans and payments. I wish to emphasize that the amendment addresses only payments expected to be made under current law. It assumes no legislative changes for 1977 crops. Payments made for this program under current law are mandatory. There is no choice. It was just a matter of developing a reliable estimate. which I believe we now have. The Budget Committee. in my opinion. has addressed only one part of the congressional budget equationthat is. the Presidents recommendation. The President revised his Agriculture Ludget after the Budget Committee reported House Concurrent Resolution 195. and the first amendment taken up on the floor responded to that increase of President Carters. What about the Agriculture Committee proposals? The Agriculture Committee forwarded to the Budget Committee the following recommendation regarding target prices. loan levels. and related programs on March 15. 1977:",

I am submitting an amendment which will protect the honor and sanctity of the remains of Americans buried in the Panama Canal Zone. There are two cemeteries in the Canal Zone containing the remains of American citizens. Mount Hope Cemetery on the Atlantic side of the canal contains the remains of 1.332 Americans. of whom 175 are veterans. The graves of 3.395 Americans. including 741 veterans. are located in the Corozal Cemetery on the Pacific side of the canal. Immediately upon ratification of the treaties now before the Senate. Mount Hope Cemetery will pass to Panamanian control. The Corozal Cemetery. however. will remain under U.S. control until the canal is completely turned over to Panama. Mr. President. the sanctity of the American gravesites in the Canal Zone must be protected. The problem of what should be done to protect the honor of the American dead buried in the Canal Zone has been thoroughly aired in the House Veterans Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of the Honorable RAY ROBERTS of Texas. Congressman ROBERTS is to be commended for his foresight In bringing this issue of importance and interest to veterans and. indeed. all Americans to public light. On January 23. 1978. Congressman ROBERTS raised the issue in the House of Representatives as to what disposition should be made of the graves of the American dead in Panama. Mr. President. I request unanimous consent that the remarks of Congressman ROBERTS on this issue be inserted in the RECORD at this point.",

The article. entitled \"Why We Must Keep the Canal.\" goes to the heart of the issues involved in this debate in the Senate and throughout the country. The author stresses that the American people are concerned by the general retreat by the United States throughout the world and they see the canal giveaway as symbolic of that retreat. The American people are worried about our lack of concern over what is happening in Africa. our willingness to enter into unfavorable SALT treaties with the Soviets and the general willingness to accept a weak or marginal defense posture.

The proposed legislation would authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1979 of $16.395.000 (plus such additional amounts as may be necessary for increases in salary. pay. retirement. other employee benefits authorized by law and other nondiscretionary costs). The funds to be authorized by this legislation will be devoted primarily to the anticipated third phase of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks with the Soviets. negotiations for the development of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. work on techniques and agreements to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons material through the nuclear fuel cycle. exploration of new possibilities in the limitation of conventional weapons. and work on other negotiations as may arise from the study groups agreed to with the Soviet Union in Moscow last spring. In addition. support for other arms control activities. including those at the United Nations. the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. and other multilateral fora. as well as supporting research for all of these activities. will also be funded under this authorization. The early enactment of this legislation is essential to permit Congressional consideration of the Agencys 1979 budget. Sincerely.",

One of the significant tasks that the Committee on Environment and Public Works must undertake this spring is the development of new water research and saline water legislation. This is an important program. This administrations proposal will be most helpful to that process. While I am in general support of this approach. I feel compelled to point out that there is one significant omission in this legislation. My concerns are focused on the fact that this bill would repeal the Water Research and Conversion Act of 1977 (Public Law 9584). Section 2 of that law directed the Secretary of the Interior \"to study. design. construct. operate. and maintain desalting plants demonstrating the engineering and economic viability of membrane and phasechange desalting processes at not more than four locations in the United States . . . provided. that at least two such plants shall demonstrate desalting of brackish ground water.\" A total of $40.000.000 was authorized for the section 2 program. beginning in fiscal year 1978. with additional sums to be available \"as are necessary to defray operations. maintenance. and energy costs for demonstrating plants during the periods of Federal responsibility for such activities.\" This important 1977 initiative must not be put aside. As I understand it. the bill being introduced today includes the following sums related to saline water research: $1.700.000 for membrane research. $300.000 for freezing research. $400.000 for new concepts research. $3.000.000 for membrane development. $700.000 for freezing development. $2.150.000 for water reuse development. $400.000 for test facilities. and $150.000 for demonstration studies. It does not. however. contain any 1979 authorization to undertake the demonstrations envisioned by the 1977 act. It would be my hope that section 205 of the new bill can be augmented to strengthen the saline water program to assure effective demonstrations. and that section 402 (a) is expanded to assure that money is available for demonstrations. I shall do what I can to sustain last years initiative. Mr. President. I hope that my colleagues will study this bill and my proposal. which I will submit later as an amendment.

Our public schools throughout the country have been built from public funds to serve their communities. The prime service offered by our schools is obviously the education of the children of the community. It is my belief. however. that the schools can play a vital role in providing educational. recreation. and social services to the community at large. and that public school facilities can serve as a focal point for the integration and coordination of many community services. At the present time many schoolbuildings are totally or partially unused due to declining enrollments. In addition. schoolbuildings that are used often stand empty for 16 hours of every 24 hour day. I believe it is in the interest of efficient government to make full use of public facilities. The concept of community education which oeeks to use the schools are a source of services to the community as a whole is rot new. It has been effectively demonstrated in a number of localities. I believe it is now time to assist State and local education agencies in their efforts to integrate services provided by the schools such as education. recreation. nutrition and meal service. transportation. and so forth. with services of this nature which serve the community at large or specific pepulations within the community such as the handicapped. senior citizens. and parents.

They received. at best. mixed support from the American people during their service overseas. and little honor or even notice when they returned home.

Of those who served. over 50.000 did not return at all. They made the supreme sacrifice for their country. yet few. if any. monuments have been erected in their memory. This pardon is an insult to the sacrifices made by those who served. and will do nothing to ease the pain suffered by the families of men who were killed. wounded. or lost during the conflict. Additionally. this pardon will serve as a dangerous precedent for our country in case of future emergencies. by making our manpower requirements more difficult to achieve. Our Nation would have been better served if we had continued a compassionate. reasoned. and casebycase review program for those who wish to return to this country or clear their record.

I asked her why her government put people in jail for what they said or printed. She replied that this was only done when what they said was \"subversive.\" I then asked her what they considered too subversive. She responded. and I am now quoting. \"It is subversive because it is contrary to our policy and our line.\" Mr. Chairman. we should have learned by now from our experiences with Battista of Cuba. Thieu of South Vietnam. to mention a few. that alining ourselves. because we have military bases in their countries. with corrupt dictatorial regimes is selfdefeating? Napoleon. the greatest military genius in history. said: In war. the moral is to the material as three Is to one. If we continue to ally ourselves with corrupt. tyrannical governments. we are going to end up losing the contest because their own people are going to say. \"Well. how are you any different than the people you are opposing?\" So I suggest that the gentleman from Iowa is absolutely right. If we really want to help the Philippine people and help the Government in becoming a sound. wellbased Government. then we will send them a message by approving this amendment.",

Of course. it was about that time that Sukarno told us what we could do with our foreign aid and what the United States could do right down the line.

The only thing that toppled Sukarno was the fact that they had those young officers who came over here to our War College and were trained by Americans.

That is. I think. the question we have to put to those who have formed an opinion in opposition to it. What do we do if we fail to ratify in an acceptable amended form? What consequences will follow? I merely should like to report that. as I go back now. having taken a position in favor of the amendments that will be offered by this joint leadership and more than 70 Senators. I see the thinking changing in my State of Illinois. People are beginning now to say. \"What would we do if we do not support the revised treaties?\" Time after time. I have seen hostile. emotional opposition melt in the face of hard facts. I do not want to interrupt the distinguished majority leader any longer to give some of those facts. I will have an opportunity later in the debate. However. the most dramatic illustration I had was just the other day. when 150 elected officials representing postal workers from throughout the State of Illinois came down to talk about postal matters. We talked also about the Panama Canal. and at the end of the discussion. I asked for a vote by a show of hands. if they supported the position taken by the Foreign Relations Committee. The vote was 147 to 3 in favor of that position. That vote result never would have occurred a month ago. So this debate is absolutely essential to have this matter much better understood. I think that by the time we come to the final vote. it will be better understood not only by the Senate but also by the country as a whole.",

By the overwhelming margin of 68 to 1. this body made clear its intention to proceed with a system which would significantly strengthen NATOs military capability and offer a more credible battlefield alternative to the present generation of tactical nuclear weapons. The bill in question calls for the immediate production and stockpiling of neutron elements in anticipation of a presidential decision to deploy neutron warheads on the Lance surfacetosurface missile and as artillery shells for 8inch and 155mm howitzers. Unfortunately. the debate surrounding the neutron weapon last spring. culminating in President Carters decision to defer production of the system. was often characterized by an emotionalism and lack of diplomatic finesse which impeded a thorough review and analysis of the situation. The Presidents decision was premised largely on the hope of a reciprocal gestureso far not forthcomingby the Soviet Union in restraining its own weapons deployment in Central Europe. Given the Warsaw Pacts pronounced advantages in main battle tanks and armored vehicles. I believe it is necessary to reassess the political and military value of neutron weapon deployment. particularly as it would affect the credibility of our tactical nuclear deterrent posture and contribute to the stability of the European military balance.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I greet the administrations ERISA reorganization plan with mixed emotons. On the one hand. the plan may reduce though not end the overlapping jurisdiction of the Labor and Treasury Departments and should hopefully improve the administration of the law. On the other hand. the plan permits the continuance of certain elements of dual jurisdiction which could make ERISA enforcement less effective than it should be. On the whole. I view the administrations proposal as a small. first step toward better administration of ERISA. As the plan sponsors admit. the reorganization plan is only an interim measure which is to be followed by legislative recommendations for a longterm administrative structure. The administration has unequivocally committed itself to submitting its longterm recommendations to the Congress on or before January 31. 1980. This is desirable. and I hope that concern for the good of retirees will override all other concerns in the longterm plan. I believe the best longterm solution to dual jurisdiction is the establishment of a single agency to administer ERISA. Such an agency. which Senator WILLIAMS and I have proposed in S. 3017. would result in better policy development which will transcend the limited institutional interests of the existing administering agencies. In addition. plan participants and sponsors would incur less difficulties and costs with onestop administration. But there is an even more important reason for the establishment of a single pension agency. Starting in about the year 2000. this country will probably be facing an unprecedented demand for retirement income. Based upon present demographic trends. there will be early in the next century a much larger number of older people and comparatively fewer younger workers. If we do not make sure that adequate resources are built up now to provide retirement income in the future. we may not be able to provide adequately for all of our older citizens. A single pension agency will be the essential tool for developing a national retirement income policy which will deal with this slowly ticking retirement income time bomb. The President has realized the magnitude of this problem and has established a Presidential Commission on Pension Policy. I hope that this Commission will document the seriousness of the developing situation and accelerate the acceptance of the conclusion that a single pension agency is absolutely necessary as the administering arm of a retirement policy.@",

Chief U.S. Negotiator at the SALT II talks and Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. will be returning to private life later this month. This announcement comes on the threshold of the expected completion of the SALT II negotiations. I became concerned during the confirmation hearings of Mr. Paul Warnke as our SALT negotiator. that he represented an approach of complete unconcern toward the consequences of the Soviet strategic buildup. I voted against Mr. Warnke because I had high hopes that through a SALT agreement we could obtain a limitation to the Soviet arms race. but felt that Mr. Warnkes inclination toward unilateral U.S. reductions would make an equitable agreement unlikely. His resignation now. coinciding with the virtual conclusion of a SALT II agreement confirms that those concerns were justified. After the promising beginning made by President Carter in his March 1977 proposals in seeking to stabilize the Soviet strategic buildup. the negotiations have failed to achieve an acceptable agreement. The current draft agreements would put no serious restraint on the Soviet MIRVed ICBM force (allowing 820 MIRVed ICBMs with as many as 10 warheads each). thus insuring the vulnerability of our landbased deterrent. The agreements would seriously limit or prohibit our ability to assure the survivability of our ICBM force through mobilebasing options. The agreements would give up the valuable options of groundlaunched and sealaunched intermediate range cruise missiles. The agreements would leave the Soviet Backfire intermediate/strategic bomber free of any meaningful restraints. The agreements would accept a standard of verification that would require an unacceptable amount of trust in Soviet compliance. I believe the SALT II accords should be judged on their merits. rather than on personalities involved. It is the specific provisions of those accords that give many of us cause for concern. and which will be thoroughly scrutinized in the weeks ahead.O",

I would like to suggest to the Members that those who are going to have to vote on this might perhaps like to read the gentlemans proposal and my proposal. The gentlemans amendment takes just twice as much legislative language to explain as does ours. All we have to do is take the deductions away from the capital gain. then we split it to ascertain what is to be excluded. The ultimate objective is to see that there is some reasonable amount of minimum tax that is paid. It is true that our amendment exempts charitable giving because we do not consider that sheltering. I point out that the committee amendment does consider charitable giving as sheltering. and so the 5 percent will apply to that. There is nothing too complicated at all about how you arrive at what your minimum tax is. And the folks who are so concerned about how they get that list. they know how they get the list because they put it down to escape the tax on the ordinary income. We are talking about 160.000 taxpayers who are the wealthiest in this Nation. Anybody who pays ordinary capital gains tax is not affected at all by either of these amendments. It takes twice as much legislative language to spell out the committees approach. I think the reason that some taxpayers scream complexity is that they realize they are going to have to pay some realistic amount of tax. The truth of the matter is they will always have to pay ordinary income tax on at least onefourth of their capital gains. and that is not very complicated.",

So. we add $2 billion to the deficit and we make people feel E little better by sprinkling it around all through all the brackets. That makes the amendment attractive. The second part that they do is to take an idea that we tried out here in 1969 and finally discarded when the tax technicians in the Treasury and everyplace else said. \"You know. it is unadministratable. We cant make it work. Dont let it happen.\" Fortunately before it ever became law it got killed. Let us not resurrect that old ghost again. It does not do that much good. It is really not that bad. but it really does not help. There is not a lot of difference between CormanFisher now that they have modified it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there is the big vote. The Corman amendment will decide whether we will really choose those new directions toward acrosstheboard tax cuts and toward capital investment. If we can defeat it we will establish the new directions. The Corman amendment redistributes income. The committee bill cuts taxes evenly. Corman amendment gives a $100 tax credit per person. but the committee bill gives a $1.000 personal exemption. More importantly. the committee spreads the brackets forever. Corman is a one shot deal. In the second year the committee bill gives far larger cuts. The Corman amendments reverses the thrust of the Steiger amendment by increasing the minimum tax. I believe most Members of this body prefer cutting capital gains even farther like the original Steiger amendment. Those who are for the Steiger amendment. for capital investment. and for simolification will want to vote against the amendment. The amendment also would seem to penalize farm families. because they do occasionally suffer losses and. sell inflated land. If they do they will pay more taxes under Corman. It is much safer to vote down the Corman amendment and stay with the committee bill. Its fairer. makes more economic sense. and does not have the questions or the \"loser image\" associated with it that Corman does. Also it is more generous because its bracket spreading is permanent.

If we wanted to spread around more of a tax decrease. we could. of course. increase the revenue loss by not $2 billion. but we could increase it $4 billion. $6 billion. or whatever. That is not a very difficult thing to do. however. it is not the most responsible thing to do either. One thing in this argument that has somewhat disturbed me has been that we are going to make it up to those people who have been hurt by social security taxes. and especially those people in the $10.000 and the $15.000 brackets. Well. the facts simply do not bear that out. The fact is that social security taxes have gone up from 5.85 to 6.05. and they have gone up from the figure in the old law to 6.13 under existing law. That means for a $10.000ayear employee the social security tax for 1979 has increased by $28 a year. Under the CormanFisher amendment. what we are doing for the $10.000ayear man is giving him a. $232 decrease. That is well and good. but we should not use the argument that we are making up for what we imposed on the $10.000ayear employee in additional social security taxes. This is a completely fallacious argument. The same thing is true with the $15.000ayear employee. That is not the true facts. The facts are that his social security taxes went up $42. but under the CormanFisher amendment he would get a $187ayear decrease. So we are not simply substituting for the increase in social security taxes. The fact is that this amendment is an attempt to do away with the capital gains treatment that is included in the committee bill. Mr. Chairman. the committee has worked long and hard on this bill. The Members will see tables and charts of every kind that do not necessarily reflect the true facts. and I urge them to examine these tables carefully. Anyone can prepare some chart or table to support his position. Mr. Chairman. I want to support the largest possible tax cut that will not lead to additional inflation. and.

If the Members wish to vote for tax relief for middleincome taxpayersand there is no one who can dispute itthe CormanFisher amendment gives greater relief for the $30.000. the $40.000. the $50.000 a year taxpayer than the committee bill. These facts are uncontrovertible. They cannot be challenged. I have heard a number of examples from my colleague. the gentleman from Wisconsin. and my colleague. the gentleman from Louisiana. Let me give the Members this fact: If you are a middleincome taxpayer. you sell an asset for $200.000. and you have to turn around and pay a $200.000 extraordinary medical expense. do you know what happens under the committee bill? You pay a $9.000 tax. Under CormanFisher there would be no tax. CormanFisher gives better treatment for the middle class with an extraordinary medical expense. If one has a casualty loss. an investor who has realized capital gains of $400.000. but in that same year fire destroys his house which is uninsured. and he loses $500.000. the committee bill will tax that individual $19.000. CormanFisher would have no tax for that individual. Take a cattle raiser in my neck of the woods. down in Arkansas. who sells his cattle for $40.000. A tornado knocks down his $20.000 house and his $20.000 uninsured barn. Under the committee bill he would pay $1.000 in taxes. but under CormanFisher he would pay no tax. That is why CormanFisher is a better bill for middleincome taxpayers. a better bill for lowincome taxpayers. and a better bill to take care of individual circumstances.

Most of the old folks in this country live in rented homes. I understand. Most of the poor people live in rented homes. Most of the rented homes do not have meters. The tenants are charged through a master meter for the whole apartment house. So those who are poorest do not get any help. Why is that? Should we say that is what we want the Federal Government to dictate to the States? We freeze the rates at todays levels. so that if this bill stays in effect for another 30 years. they still will be getting todays rates. not affected by inflation. If the rates 10 years from now should be the same as they are today. why not lower them today and let them gradually creep up? In effect. they are frozen today. and they will go down from here on. because inflation goes up. What effect will this have on minimum rates? The eligible customers can be charged no more than the minimum rate charged to the lowest industrial customer. That is going to be different from State to State and from utility to utility. If we know so much. why not fix a minimum rate? Or. if we do not know how to do it. why do we not let HEW do it? The point is. Mr. President. that we really do not know what we are doing in this matter other than we are helping some people who need some help. I believe the best way to help them is to let the States do it until we at least have time to have hearings. and that will give us some information on this matter. What is the cost?

If Senators are going to base their votes solely on the cost of administering the program. let us make it easy. Let us just raise social security benefits by $6 each. Who is going to pay for it?

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment is also sponsored by Senator THURMOND. Senator CRANSTON. and Senator BIDEN. I am offering an amendment to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 which was enacted earlier this year. The amendment is very straightforward and would provide for five additional coal research laboratories. Under the strip mining bill in section 801(b) of title VIII. the administrator of ERDA was authorized to designate 10 institutions of higher education as coal research laboratories. However. section 801(b) (1) of the act requires that the designated institutions be located in a State with abundant coal reserves. This requirement. together with one in 801(c). precluded institutions in States with moderate or negligible coal reserves from competing for the ERDA research grants. Many of the States. like Delaware. have institutions with ongoing coal research programs which would be ineligible for the special designation under the Strip Mining Act. Mr. President. I have been consulting with a number of people. including the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. the Senator from California. and a number of others. including Senator FORD. and it seems to me it is very important that we utilize the other institutions. the other universities. that already have ongoing studies and research programs in the area of coal. but which are not located in coal rich States. As I say. my amendment would provide for 15 institutions instead of 10. but the additional 5 would not be initiated until fiscal year 1980. which is 1 year later than the first 10 are started. At that time 5 new schools would become eligible for the same kind of financial support that the original 10 now on the books are eligible for.",

    "speech": "I might say that I think this is an important amendment for a number of reasons. As a member of the Finance Committee trying to arrive at a program that will enable this country to become at least semiindependent of foreign oil. I think all of us have to recognize that the one practically unlimited resource we have is coal. It offers the greatest hope to this country of obtaining a relatively independent position in the not too distant future. I think it is perfectly obvious that the more coal we use the less oil we are going to have to Import from abroad. There is no question. however. that many problems remain in the utilization of this vast resource. For example. coal gasification offers great hope and great promise. but much remains to be done before it becomes a reality. So it seems to me of extreme importance that we put more effort in our research and development in these areas and that we utilize those higher institutions that are already making major efforts in this area. but that could do a great deal more if they were given assistance from the Federal Government. So that is what I am proposing by this amendment. I point out to Senators that under the present law it would appear that roughly only 10 States would be eligible for such a coal institution. They include. Colorado. Illinois. Indiana. Kentucky. Montana. North Dakota. Ohio. Pennsylvania. West Virginia. and Wyoming. What I am trying to do by my amendment is to give the opportunity to the other 40 States to participate in this program and to provide some muchneeded research and development. I think one of the advantages is institutions like my own University of Delaware are already involved in this kind of work. and I think it would be a terrible mistake for this country not to take advantage of this valuable resource. At this stage I am happy to yield to the Senator from South Carolina.",

So we created first. the Department of Energy Research and Development. and then the Department of Energy. in order that we might have some coordination of all of the energy efforts in this country. Now. the Energy Research and Development Administration. which has a centralized administration for energy research and development. has been generously funded. and they have been particularly generously funded in the area of fossil fuel. This year. Mr. President. the Energy Research and Development Administration is spending $700 million on fossil fuel. About twothirds of that goes to coal. That is almost half a billion dollars we are spending on coal research in this country right now. Let me say that again: Half a billion dollars being spent in this country right now by ERDA for coal research. ERDA can subcontract that out to universities or any other private groups that they want to. They set the priorities. and determine whether they will do it inhouse or contract it out.",

I am reintroducing a measure that I proposed in the last Congress to liberalize the conditions governing eligibility of blind persons for receiving disability insurance benefits. My bill would allow a person who is blind to qualify for disability insurance payments after working six quarters under social security covered work and would allow them to continue to draw disability benefits so long as they are blind. regardless of any additional earnings they might be able to make. The blind are considered handicapped. but many are able an want to be involved in some type of work. They. like any other person. want to feel productive and contribute what they can to the community. However. the current social security discourages them from working since they cannot draw disability benefits if they have any outside earnings. Yet. they generally cannot find adequate employment to allow them to live solely on the income from this employment. Thus. the blind are forced to remain outside the mainstream of society even though many are anxious to work in some capacity and can if only given the chance.

In \"Open Spaces: The Life of American Cities.\" Heckscher contends that the quality of urban life is. to a large extent. determined by what happens in a citys open spacesin parks. squares. plazas. and greens. This is idea is hardly revolutionary. In the colonial period city foundersand plannerslike William Penn made sure that valuable urban space was devoted to parks. Franklin and Jeffersonand of course Frederick Law Olmstedimpressed their countrymen with the importance of urban open space. Heckscher. however. gives his reader a new perspective on just how important these spaces are. It goes without saying that New York would not be New York without Central Park but Heckscher does not stop at New York or with major parks. He takes his reader to virtually every large American city and shows how wise planning and concern for the human environment has made a city livable and enjoyableoften through the intelligent use of small pockets of green. He also shows how lack of planning or poor planning have often squandered what could have been great opportunities. The best thing about Heckschers book is that it opens a readers eyes. After reading Heckscher no intelligent person will be able to walk through an urban setting without noticing just what isor is not-. going on in the citys open spaces. After reading this book one would think twice about the value of building a superhighway along a river front or cutting a parks budget to put the money into \"more critical\" areas. August Heckscher is well qualified to write this book. His years as parks commissioner were the \"golden years\" of the department. All over New York City there are islands of unique pleasantness that are only there because August Heckscher was there. Once again the Twentieth Century Fund has commissioned a fine and unique work. which I recommend to everyone interested in our citieswhat they are and what they can be.

Mr. Chairman. that when we authorized the Russian grain deal. we not only sold the grain to the Russians. which was beneficial. but we obtained the right to have a third of that grain carried in American bottoms. Shipment of that grain costs $30 per ton. The Russians pay $16 and the U.S. taxpayer is paying $14 through operating subsidy to keep that grain going to the Russians in in American bottoms. It is true if we did not pay that subsidy. some ships would carry the grain. and they would be Russian or thirdcountry ships. they would not be U.S. ships. What is the purpose of the basic U.S. maritime subsidy? It is to have a merchant marine capable of an auxiliary status to the United States in time of war. The ships that are carrying that grain to Russia today will be scrapped when this subsidy ends. I have a personal friend who owns CXXI --1426--Part 18 three ships which have carried grain to Russia. One of them has now been scrapped. The other two will possibly be scrapped when this subsidy ends. What benefit to this Nation is there in paying $19 million next year to subsidize the shipping of grain to Soviet Russia? I ask my colleagues. what does the American taxpayer want to do in this instance? Does he want to keep eight rust buckets in existence and pay nearly half the cost of shipping that grain to Soviet Russia? I cannot conceive of this. On this amendment I would like to ask the chairman this. Is it not true. Mr. Chairman. that there is not a nickels worth of defense ability in any of those ships that are carrying grain to Russia today and they will be scrapped when this subsidy is ended? We are not keeping in existence something that is ultimately going to be a part of our national defense fleet or our national reserve fleet or helpful to the Nation in time of national emergency.

If we take the $19 million out of subsidizing Russian grain we can spend that $19 million in subsidizing new fast ships that will be helpful to the Nation. Let me speak briefly in the time I have on the third amendment. I have suggested that the operating subsidy program we authorize today be limited to 1year renewal contracts rather than 20year contracts for this reason. The $372 million operating subsidy covers 177 ships in the U.S. foreign trade. Next year. 81. almost half of those ships. come up for renewal. The Maritime Administration proposes to renew those operating subsidy contracts at about $2 million a ship for 20 years. We have under review. and the chairman will agree that maritime policy badly needs review. what the new maritime policy of this Nation will be. We hope before this Congress ends that under the distinguished chairmans leadership we will have a new Maritime law of 1977 or 1978 which will cure many of the problems we have seen develop in our merchant marine. It is useless. however. to adopt new maritime policy if we are stuck with 20 years of continuing subsidies for a total of $3.2 billion. The Ford administration. before it went out of office. recommended a suspension. a complete suspension of these operating subsidies pending overall review of our maritime policy and the adoption of a new policy. All I suggest in this amendment is that we limit renewal of the operating subsidies to 1year terms so that if we do adopt a new maritime policy we will not have the old policy hanging around our necks for 19 more years. In the revision of our policy we may go to other options. We may go to closed conferences with the extension of antitrust immunity to shippers conferences. There are a number of other options the chairman and the staff are considering. We should not tie ourselves down to operating subsidies for the next 20 years under these circumstances.",

In my own district of California I have witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of a dust storm in December and a torrential downpour less than a month later. The compounding of these natural disasters has dealt a serious blow to farmers. businessmen. and homeowners alike. and now communities across the district and State axe attempting to pick up the pieces in the storms aftermath. Through the Federal assistance we are appropriating here today. this House is taking an essential step to help them recover from these serious losses. I would like to voice my concern. however. over the Presidents refusal to declare a Federal disaster for Kern County immediately following the dust storm. In many instances the dust storm had a more crippling effect on my constituents than the floods. Although many victims of both disasters have been helped through the declared disaster assistance for the floods. many others continue to suffer as a direct result of the dust storm alone. The Arvin Union School District. for example. desperately needs an appropriation of over $119.000 to recover from the dust storms damage. It certainly is difficult to rationalize and explain how one school district with minor disrepairs can qualify for Federal assistance while another with major damages in the same area cannot. Despite my frustration over this situation. I do want to applaud the action taken in this Chamber today. and I would urge the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration to fully implement the specific recommendations offered by the committee for implementation in the future.*",

H.R. 9518. a bill. that would amend the Shipping Act. 1916. to strengthen the provisions prohibiting rebating practices in the U.S. foreign trades. Under present law. common carriers by water in the foreign commerce of the United States are prohibited from charging any rates lower than those in their published tariffs. With extensive overtonnaging in our trades. many carriers have been offering secret kickbacks. commonly called rebates. to attract more cargo for their ships. The purpose of this legislation is to strengthen the provisions of the Shipping Act. 1916 and. thus. the powers of the Federal Maritime Commission relating to the prohibitions and sanctions for rebating in our foreign trades. Rebating threatens the stability and unimpeded flow of our ocean commerce. and the inability of the FMC to enforce our laws against rebating in a nondiscriminatory manner threatens the preservation of a strong and competitive U.S. merchant marine. This landmark legislation would permit the FMC to carry out its regulatory function to deter rebates. in a swift. effective. and evenhanded fashion. And. for the first time. foreignflag ocean carriers would be required to comply with FMC subpenas and discovery orders or face exclusion from our ocean trades.

Mr. Chairman. the legislation we have before us is the outcome of a year of work by the dedicated chairman of our committee. Mr. MURPHY. the principal sponsor of this legislation. After months of hearings the committee has fashioned a bill to clear our foreign trades of malpractices and insure fair competition for U.S. liner fleets with their foreignflag competitors. For the first time the bill would enable the Federal Maritime Commission to invoke far more severe monetary penalties for rebating than now possible under the Shipping Act. The relatively light penalties that are now prescribed in section 16 and 18 of the act-$5.000 and $1.000 respectivelyhave not been sufficient to deter a carrier from illegally rebating to attract cargo or to deter shippers from soliciting or accepting such rebates. In other words. the economic benefits of rebating can often be greater than the penalties which are now prescribed for that illegal activity. The bill would increase the penalties to $25.000 per violation for all types of rebating prescribed by the act. In addition. the FMC. upon finding of a rebating violation. could suspend any or all of that carriers tariffs or right to utilize conference tariffs for up to 12 months. Such suspension would effectively exclude that carrier from our foreign trade. Any carriage of cargo during such suspension period would subject the offender to a civil penalty of not more than $50.000 per shipment. These powerful penalties coupled with FMC power to assess them directly. will provide swift. evenhanded deterrence against rebating and insure that our foreign trades will offer fair competition to U.S.-flag operators.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 9518. One of the basic problems with enforcing our laws against rebating has historically been the difficulty of proving violations against corporations whose records are maintained in foreign countries. As a practical matter. only U.S. carriers and shippers now face a substantial risk of penalties for rebating. The problem is not only the mechanical one of service of process abroad. but stems also from \"blocking\" statutes that have been enacted by at least 13 foreign nations which may prohibit their citizens from turning over business records to an agency of another government. such as our FMC. To overcome this problem. H.R. 9518 provides for three mechanisms: First. every carrier will be required to certify periodically. through its chief executive officer. that. among other things the carrier will cooperate with the FMC in any investigation of illegal rebating. Shippers and forwarders can also be required to file such certifications. Second. the Secretary of State is directed to establish a regime of cooperation with other maritime nations to insure access to information necessary for FMC regulation. Third. if a carrier refuses to comply with an FMC subpena or discovery order. the Commission may suspend that carriers tariff until it has complied. Since this subject is one which contains foreign policy ramifications. the President is given the authority to overrule the FMC on matters involving this suspension power. Through these measures. H.R. 9518 will for the first time. permit nondiscriminatory enforcement of our antirebating statutes. This will permit U.S.-flag liner fleets to operate on a competitive basis to the benefit of the American consumer. I would like to commend the gentleman from New York for providing extensive hearings into all aspects of the bill which in turn has produced legislation that addresses the rebating problem.

Such transfers of ownership as well as gifts of stock within a family would not require the supervisory agencies to apply the various criteria that relates to the means of financing and the methods by which the bank was acquired. We would. of course. leave the regulators with the power to check into the qualifications and to make certain that the new owners were able to operate the bank in a proper and legitimate manner.

Titles VIII and IX represent basically sound approach to coping with insider dealings. They provide a means for a banks board of directors and the supervisory agencies to see clearly what is going on and provide them with the information to take corrective actions as needed. However. we must recognize that most credit transactions between bank officers. directors. and stockholders are perfectly legitimate business dealings. The chairman of the subcommittee may argue against the need for such an amendment as this on the basis that title IX only requires the filing of aggregated information. but I must disagree. We have heard of some unusual institutions with such a proliferation of dealings that aggregation might have provided some privacy for their officers. Fortunately we know their institutions are atypical and recognize that even aggregated information will be an unwarranted invasion of privacy in many instances. I have reviewed the debate on this question during the full committee markup. I am justified. I believe. in my judgment that we were led to the conclusion that this amendment to title VIII would not result in the kind of invasion of privacy that we now see is possible. We have had a chance to look at it and there is a tiein with title IX. We still support the reports required by the amendmentthey are good and necessarybut they should be kept confidential as we were told they would be. So I urge adoption of this amendment.",

Mr. Chairman. during the Banking Committee markup of H.R. 13471 I became very involved in this title and its potential impact on the individuals right to financial privacy. I know that a number of my colleagues had carried the fight on the subcommittee level and had exacted major concessions from Federal agencies and departments. They deserve our congratulations for their efforts. Politics is the art of compromise and as a practioner of this art I am supporting the language of this amendment to section 1112 as an improvement over the language in the committee bill. Section 1112 of H.R. 13471 as reported was added by me to temporarily derail a freight train being driven over the average Americans rights by a group of faceless. nameless bureaucrats. That language was not perfect. but it did help me get the attention of those people downtown. Through negotiation and compromises on both sides we have arrived at language which I think comes much closer to protecting the rights of the individual in maintaining some control over who has access to his or her financial records. There are still differences of opinion. but this new language known as the GoldwaterMcKinney amendment is a major breakthrough in protecting the American citizen from intrusion by the Federal Government. Although the Justice Department feels this amendment may create additional administrative burdens for Government agencies. it believes that \"the new procedures are manageable and offer substantial new privacy protections to bank customers.\" I include a letter from the Justice Department expressing that opinion as part of my remarks. In my personal conversations with representatives of the affected agencies I have put them on notice that this amendment is only the first step in an effort to provide the strongest safeguards for individual Americans against unwarranted invasion of their privacy by the bureaucracy. I may be an idealist but I still like to think that \"Big Brother\" could be our friend rather than our adversary. The letter is as follows:",

Also. it is necessary to exempt all procedures carried out under the Internal Revenue Code which has its own privacy protection provisions. The amendment also contains a clarification of the court in which a motion to quash a subpena is to be filed. so that the procedures will be absolutely clear to those wishing to intervene. Finally. an exception is created to allow the General Accounting Office to carry out its audit responsibilities under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act passed earlier this year.

Under the bill. the customer can challenge a request by a governmental agency to look at financial records by stating his or her reasons for believing that the records are not relevant to the law enforcement inquiry. I believe that this standard can be met if the customer can truthfully reply that he or she has no knowledge of the inquiry or investigation. or that he or she has not violated any laws. This sworn statement would then be filed in a district court and the matter would be settled before a magistrate with both sides being given an opportunity to present their reasons in greater detail. My amendment would make clear that the customer could challenge a request by a governmental agency for other reasons. as well. The motion would be sufficient to initiate a judicial proceeding if it only cited legal grounds to object to the summons. Some of these grounds involve claims that the summons is too broad. the request exceeds the authority of the governmental agency. or that the Government is harassing the customer. In this way. we can insure that the rights of the customer are protected and that in most cases a court will resolve the issue. I am concerned that we strike that very delicate balance between the needs of law enforcement agencies and the rights of the individual. I feel that my amendment maintains that balance while strengthening the protections for the individual.

An investigation conducted sulely for purposes of political harassment or intimidation or otherwise in bad faith is not legitimate. While title XI allows an inquiry into the legitimacy of a law enforcement investigation. it does not authorize a court to conduct a qualitative analysis of the basis for the Governments initiating a case. We cannot have courts running investigations. That is the job of the executive branch. We do not want judges standing over prosecutors telling them when they have enough evidence to begin an investigation.

It is my understanding that the President intends to use that authority for that very purpose. However. I should point out to the Senator that it is not possible to obtain adequate information about the extent of oil and natural gas resources in the country because the exploratory work has not been done. It is probable that. to whatever extent there are onshore natural gas resources. they are at very deep levels. maybe 20.000 feet. Most of the production at the shallow levels has been exhausted. A well at 20.000 feet costs perhaps $3 million or $4 million. Until the production of natural gas becomes profitable. with the production of oil and other sources of fuel. the exploratory wells will not be drilled. Until they are drilled offshore and onshore. there just will not be adequate resource data. Another problem is related to the figures of the Government. and especially in the public domain. As the Senator from Illinois has proposed. the Government could conduct exploratory operations. Also. the FPC ratemaking procedures have provided the producers a great incentive to understate their reserves. As the Senator mentioned. such reserve data as is available is unreliable. That is partly because producers can get a higher rate from the FPC if they understate their reserves. I believe many have done this.",

Ever since President Trumans brave and just declaration of U.S. support and Israel have developed a special relationship--one committed to similar ideals and goals. The Jewish nation. born out of the courage and determination of Jewish refugees after World War II. gave Jews a homeland free from the unimaginable hardships they suffered for over 3.000 years. When a permanent. independent State of Israel was established on May 15. 1948. Jews all over the world rejoiced. For the past three decades. Israel has advanced at an astonishing rate. Its agricultural and industrial expansion has been accompanied by numerous cultural and educational achievements. Israeli citizens include internationally respected artists. scientists. educators. and several Nobel Prize winning authors. Despite its relatively young life as a nation. Israel has cultivated not only largescale economic growth. but a broad base of culture and learning that makes it the envy of many nations across the globe. Israel has accomplished all this while forming a government founded on strong democratic institutions. The Israeli Parliament. the Knesset. is a tribute to Israels respect for democracy where all citizens are represented in government. Mr. Speaker. the United States friendship with Israel is a most valuable one. because as we are committed to democratic government.

On that day. the islands manual switchboardthe last in the Bell Telephone Systemwill be replaced by a modern automatic device. And June 3 will also mark another milestonethe retirement of the manager of operating services. Mrs. Jean F. Windle. Avalon is a closeknit community. and Jean is certainly known and loved by many islanders. For many years. she has given the kind of personal service to the community that cannot go unnoticed. She is not leaving the town she loves so well. but her retirement will mark a major change in Avalon. and will be the occasion for a commemorative banquet in her honor. Jean came to the island in 1943. when she was employed as an operator on the old switchboard on April 7 of that year. Born in Sargent. Nebr.. in October 1913. she moved to southern California from her native State in February of 1943. at the height of the Second World War. Due to the war. the Avalon switchboard was a busy place indeedshe worked a 6day week for 3 years. When Jean Windle arrived in Avalon. the switchboard had been in operation for almost 20 years. Telephone service to the island resort began on July 16. 1920. when a radio telephone system. the first in the United States. was installed in the Atwater Hotel. On July 1. 1923. the Southern California Telephone Co. opened its central island office at its present site in Avalon. and installed a special No. 9 switchboard with 11 positions. Service to the mainlane was provided by cable. and a month later the old radio circuits were disconnected.",

I join with many of my colleagues today in voting for Congressman WEIss amendment to the Department of Energys national security authorization which would prohibit the use of any funds to produce or deploy neutron weapons. Last year. when the neutron bomb issue was debated on the House floor. I made a statement then opposing the funds to be used for this destructive weapon. I want to take this opportunity to reiterate some of the points that I made then. The discussion of the neutron bomb has become exceedingly abstract and does not convey much of a picture of the effects that it has on people. Terms such as \"clean bomb\" and \"tactical limitations\" have been used to refer to this weapon. What we have to remember is the devastating effect that it has on its victims. If you are irradiated by a neutron bomb. it will kill you in any of three ways. If you are very close. you are lucky because you will die by quick kill. Otherwise. when the bomb explodes it blows so many holes in your nerve cells that your brain ceases to function. If it does not. you will collapse and you will lose control of your body functions. you may get violent. You will die within minutes or perhaps hours. and while you are lying there waiting for death to call. you lie in your own waste. in your own feces. with rapid convulsions and shaking. just waiting for death. This is just one of the types of death blows that the neutron bomb deals to its victims. We must not forget the dehumanizing effect that this weapon has when we consider its funding. We must not allow our country to produce such an inhumane weaponwe must act to eliminate all funds for neutron weapons.O",

He imbued in his students an awareness of the joy and satisfaction of learning while at the same time set an example of personal integrity through his dedication and sincerity. He will be honored at a dinner given by the faculty of Eagle Rock High School on Tuesday May 30. After 32 years of distinguished service. Ben Friedman is retiring from the Los Angeles City Schools. An excellent and dynamic mathematics teacher. Ben Friedman always stimulated his pupils to think. But more than that. he has left his mark of genleness on thousands of individuals. Now. many of his pupils are leaders in legal. business. academic and political affairs. Ben Friedman entered the Los Angeles City Unified School District in 1946 at Polytechnic High School. a multiracial high school located near downtown Los Angeles. Beyond teaching mathematics. he involved himself directly with the students of Poly. he was chosen to sponsor several senior classes and even coached the cross country team to a league championship. In 1954. he transferred to Eagle Rock High School. For 24years there Ben Friedman taught all mathematics courses from basic math to 7th graders to calculus for 12th graders. He counseled students. directed the college scholarship office and served as chairman of the mathematics department since 1963. Ben Friedmans teaching skills and leadership have been recognized throughout the Los Angeles schools. He has served on countless citywide mathematics councils and committees and has presented several local television programs on basic mathematis. Ben Friedman is a special person. His qualities of intelligence. compassion. hard work and kindness have inspired two generations of students. I ask the Members to join with me. his wife Frances and son Terry in paying tribute to Ben Friedman. a great teacher. citizen and human being.@",

When the President a year ago declared the energy crisis to be the moral equivalent of war. he was right then. His assertion is even more right today. We are going to go broke. We simply cannot afford to spend $45 billion per year for importing oil. It is estimated that this will increase threefold by the year 1985 if we do not take significant action. In addition. we are now importing more than half of our requirements of energy. That represents a severe and intolerable threat to our national security. I have asked the President. joining with Senator HART of Colorado. to take immediate action to impose import quotas or import duties on oil. and to take action to spread the burdens of those actions equitably. until such time as the Congress can act. I think we do have a national emergency. and urgent action is needed. The very least we can do is to pass the conservation measures already agreed to by both Houses of Congress and the conference.

The President said it will undermine our competitive position in world agricultural markets. Is that in the farmers interest. if true? If the President and his experts believe it to be true. if CEO believes it to be true. is that a warning that ought to be ignored not only by the rest of us but by American farmers? Finally. Mr. President. the farmers will get no help from a bill that the President vetoes. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Presidents letter be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

Moreover. this program would have made our Nation vulnerable to future crop failures. So contradictory were the various provisions of that measure that CBO was unable to come up with a cost estimate for the entire bill. and we have never -been able to get that cost estimate for the entire bill from the CBO because of the contradictory provisions. So this is one proposal to which I have no answer. to which the CBO has no answer. and under which we have no way to estimate the budgetary costs. I suspect that many of my colleagues voted for this bill because of assurances they received from the chairman of the Agriculture Committee that the conference would produce a more responsible piece of legislation. I regret that the majority of Senators voted for this measure. which they knew to be unsound economic and agricultural policy. The conferees have succeeded in adding insult to injury by compounding the inflationary and illconceived economic policies contained in this bill. Mr. President. let us take a look at what the conferees have brought back to this body for our consideration and approval.

The amendment provides that the Federal Power Commission shall exempt small hydroelectric projects constructed on conduits from the provisions of the Federal Power Act. including the licensing provisions. The amendment is limited to projects which are located on nonFederal lands and which have an installed capacityof 15 megawatts or less. Mr. President. there is a potential of nearly 700 megawatts of hydroelectric power in existing conduits throughout the United States. I am particularly interested in this matter as there is a potential of approximately 200 megawatts in my State alone. However. this small hydroelectric projects potential has not been fully developed because of the large costs involved in complying with the Federal Power Commission licensing requirements. I understand. for example. that the city of Portland recently spent $500.000 on its application for two small hydroelectric projects totaling 36 megawatts. In addition. the application processing time is quite lengthy. sometimes taking as much as 6 years. and this discourages applicants for small projects. By waiving the licensing requirement. this amendment should encourage the development of the small hydroelectric power potential. Mr. President. the amendment does not exempt these small projects from environmental or any other State or Federal law. It does subject the projects to the provisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State agency responsible for fish and wildlife resources. The amendment requires that the projects be modified if so recommended by these agencies. Mr. President. it has been erroneously stated that this amendment would be dispositive of the current case before the FPC involving the Escondido Mutual Water Co. et al. I would like to make clear that this is not the case as the amendment pertains only to nonFederal lands and the Escondido case involves Indian trust and Federal lands. It certainly is not the intention of the amendment to interfere with the important test case of the FPC licensing procedures when Indian lands are involved.

The Senate. on June 22. adopted my proposal to include in H.R. 5885 a small hydropower section which directed the Army Corps of Engineers to make a careful. national survey of former industrial sites and other old hydropower sites for reuse as new publicly owned powersites. then to offer the local agency the technical advice necessary to rehabilitate the site. This means that the corps will do the plans and design for the new project. then turn it over to local officials to implement. This section directs the Chief of Engineers. acting with the Secretary. to develop the potential for new hydropower projects by rehabilitating former industrial sites. where such potential exists at places such as millraces. gristmills. waterwheels. and dams. This section does not authorize the corps to build any such power facilities. but to provide engineering and design services to local public agencies so that such agencies can go forward on their own to provide such power. This section is intended to serve rural and small communities. because that is where I believe the potential is most likely to exist. But it does not preclude its application elsewhere. As one example. there are estimated to be 3.000 old damsites in New England. of which up to 30 percent have been estimated by the Corps of Engineers as possibly adaptable for new hydropower use today. In New England. 60 percent of the electric power is produced by imported oil. New England industry pays an average of 67 percent more for power than industry elsewhere in the Nation. Even if only a fraction of those sites proved economical. I believe that the use of several hundred such projects. built by local interests and providing clean power locally and economically. must offer a real benefit to the economy of the region. It should be noted that this approach should have a valuable historical as well 3.2400 as environmental benefit.

There is one popular conceptionperhaps popular only here in Congress. but nonetheless It may have some attention in the country as wellwhich I think we have to deal with immediately. and that is the question of whether or not the rate cut which we proposed was a rate cut simply proposed as an alternative to the Presidents rebate. or whether it has a substantive standing of Its own and is required by the existing and prospective economic situation. It is our case. and I think it is a critically important element of our case. that it has an independent standing of its own. and is not only dictated but demanded by the present situation. and that. indeed. the promise which we have of further and more taxationas. for example. in the Presidents energy package. and in the continuation of an accepted. no matter how we slice it. deficit of the order of magnitude of $50 billiondictates a reduction of this character.

I opposed this embargo in 1974 because I did not believe that was the way to handle the matter. In retrospect. it was emotion. rather than logic. that brought us to the predicament we face today. The embargo has not served our best national interest because it has weakened considerably the strong military and political ties we had with Turkey prior to that embargo. Even though. in the interim. a portion of the embargo has been repealed. that is not adequate and it is important that conditions return as they were preembargo. We must recognize the significant contribution Turkey plays in the southern flank of NATO. Gen. Alexander Haig. in his appearance before the Armed Services Committee. said the present situation places our ability to defend the southern region of NATO in direst jeopardy. He made it clear that any NATO defensive success or failure is inexorably linked with our own vital national security interests. Mr. President. aside from the basic military hardware requirements that have not been filled. it is also very important that we reestablish good governmenttogovernment relations with Turkey. The Turks have found it difficult to understand our policy in this matter. since they had always been one of our staunchest allies. My colleagues may recall how responsive the Turkish Government was in contributing their forces to our United Nations effort in Korea in 1950. and the reliable ally they have been to the NATO alliance over all these years. We must also examine this problem in the overall ongoing struggle between the superpowers and the fact that this struggle requires. if we are to be successful. the establishment and maintenance of strong alliances with as many other nations as possible. We cannot survive in this struggle alone. and we cannot afford to allow schisms to develop that weaken the binding of our various alliances and relationships with other nations. That is the real issue. Mr. President. and that is why this embargo should be repealed. It is time we ended this folly of trying to insure the arrival at a solution of the Cyprus problem by an embargo that has not worked. that has been counterproductive. and that now should be removed.",

Although the Greek Cypriot proposal is different in certain respects from that of the Turkish Cypriots. it is apparent that there is now a solid basis for discussions between the parties of the important humanitarian problem relating to Varosha. and thereafter for resuming the Cyprus intercommunal talks under UN auspicies. He concludes with this statement: In the period ahead. it is important that the United States be in a position to play an impartial and constructive role. The lifting of the Turkish embargo is an essential step in this process. To do so will. we believe. help accelerate the search for peace In Cyprus. It is signed by Warren Christopher. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "I think it is a very important point. As the Senator from Missouri. Senator EAGLETON pointed out earlier today in the debate. careful consideration of those proposals that were brought forth by the Turkish Cypriots last week showed clearly that they are nothing beyond a proposal to talk. The fact of the matter is. as a consequence of the aggression committed in the summer of 1974. Turkish forces occupied 40 percent of the island. They are in a position to take concrete action to prove their good faith to return territory. to allow people who have become refugees to actually return to their homes. They have not been prepared to do this. The New York Times in its editorial on Saturday. arguing that the Senate should maintain the limited embargo which now exists on arms sales to Turkey. went on to say that: The vague proposal put forward by the Turkish Cypriots on Thursday for resettling some Greek refugees is welcome but scarcely sufficient. The Turkish concessions need to be territorial. How long are we going to go on allowing the aggressors to completely realize all the fruits of their aggression and come to this body and argue that the embargo which was applied as a matter of American law should be lifted in the absence of any significant and substantial concrete action to remedy the aggression which was committed? The most clear and dramatic example of that would be a significant return cf territory which would allow refugees to go back to their homes and be resettled and quit living as displaced persons in their own country.",

    "speech": "I thank my good friend from New Jersey. I shall probably not even speak the 2 minutes. I want just to make a couple of points. Almost 3 years ago to the month. the U.S. Senate passed S. 846. the MansfieldScott bill. that allowed a temporary continuation of military aid to Turkey. I. along with 40 of my colleagues. voted for S. 846. because we hoped Turkey would negotiate in good faith. and work toward an immediate resolution of the Cyprus problem. This temporary continuation of aid was based on the premise that the United States. for both national and international security reasons. would exercise every possible effort to maintain both Greeces and Turkeys participation as cooperative members of the NATO alliance. In retrospect. we initially cut off aid to Turkey to exert influence on her Cyprus negotiations. When we agreed to S. 846 in May of 1975. we were authorizing the President to report every 30 days to Congress on the progress of negotiations between Greece and Turkey. In response to our initiative. we assumed Turkey would comply with our mutual goal. It is obvious that neither of the above actions have been fruitfulthere is still no settlement in sight. My recollection is that that was a very close vote. In fact. I think it was decided by one vote that we would partially lift the embargo and permit the President to report to us every 30 days on the progress that was so optimistically predicted in terms of the relationship between the Turks. who had occupied Cyprus. and the Cypriots. The whole reason for that seems to me to be the same reason proposed today by those who want to totally lift the embargo: namely. that Turkey. for some reason of their own internally. would not negotiate so long as there was an embargo. Now. it seems to me that. we need not go through the litany of what has occurred in those 3 years other than to say that it is obvious that the 30day reports by our Presidents from that point in time have indicated little or no progress. In the meantime. although Turkey has not received every kind of military assistance that she wants. she has received substantial millionsin fa:t. in the hundreds of millions of dollarsin military assistance.",

I do not know what will be asked of us next in an effort to resolve this dispute. I think there are far too many negatives in terms of precedent. in terms of the law. that might have longrange implications for us to risk the lifting now when the partial lifting had little or no effect.

First of all. with regard to the technical language that concerns the Senator from Wyoming. we have taken the opportunity to examine those reservations and concerns in much greater detail. and it seems to me that any fair and reasonable reading of the language of the amendment is completely consistent with the representations of the \"Dear Colleague\" letter. If there are particular matters for clarification in terms of legislative history. I will be glad to make those clear. Let us examine the merits of the arguments of the Senator from Wyoming. As I gather the thrust of at least one of his arguments. it is that unless a particular company. is able to acquire a coal company. or uranium company. or others. it will not be able to mix fuels and will not be able to respond to the challenge of American energy policy. I believe that is an unrealistic statement. The American automobile industry could not produce automobiles without steel. but that does not necessarily mean that the automobile companies own all the steel companies. As a matter of fact. they do not. It does not mean that some of our most successful chemical producing companies. such as du Pont. which depend upon hydrocarbons. coal. and oil. have to own their own coal mines or their own oil wells. They do not. They purchase these products. and they are extraordinarily successful. The argument that we are not going to be able to develop mixed fuels. referred to by the Senator from Wyoming. without permitting oil operations and coal operations to be owned by a single huge company does not make any sense. based upon an examination of American history over the last 200 years. The Senator also makes a point about the comparisons with respect to the way land is treated by some oil companies. some coal companies.

This amendment does nothing in terms of making decisions about divesting existing coal and uranium resources of any oil company.

I point out to my friend from Wyoming that. when a representative of Exxon testified before the Antitrust Subcommittee in connection with other legislation. he presented us with an exhibit 1 having to do with oil firm coal production. and that exhibit was based upon the Keystone Coal Industry Manual published by McGrawHill for various years and. it included only those companies with more than 1 million tons of coal production in 1976. Senator HANSEN will recollect that he stated that coal production had declined in this period. Reading from those figures in 1934. 487 million tons. in 1965. 512 million tons. 533 million tons for each of the succeeding years. 552 million tons. 545 million tons. 560 million tons. 602 million tons. 552 million tons. 595 million tons. 591 million tons. 601 million tons. 648 million tons. and 665 million tons. So during the period from 1964 to 1976. production actually increased from 487 million tons to 665 million tons. and yet the facts are that when one looks at the individual coal companies that were acquired by oil companies. when one looks at Consolidation which was acquired by Continental. one finds that falloff after the 5year lag period subsequent to the date of acquisition which according to the petroleum company representatives themselves is the time that it takes in order to increase production. therefore. the petroleum companies cannot be given credit for that increase. But thereafter with no exception except Arch Mineral. which was acquired by Ashland. in every other instance the coal production has declined after the petroleum company acquired the coal company. Whatever the source has been with reference to the question of the industry as a whole declining during this period and that being the reason for the petroleum companies coal companies declining.

So there have been companies into the coal mining business which were not in the business before. which accounts. among other things. for the overall increase in coal production. and that is a fact. My point was that when you look at individual companies. what I thought the Senator from Ohio was trying to say was that almost invariably when a coal company was purchased by an oil company. the production went down. My point is that while that is true. it went down with nonoilcompanyowned coal companies as well. and I pointed out that we have had floods. we have had wildcat labor stoppages. we have had environmental protection laws. and we have had coal mine safety laws. all of which have made it more difficult for every coal company in the United States to operate.",

I believe. have a serious counterproductive impact on the development of necessary energy resources for this Nation. Let me point out that the coal industry is and will continue to be a highly competitive industry. No one firm or small group of firms now have. or are likely to gain monopolistic control of the coal industry. In fact. ownership of coal reserves is widely distributed. The Federal Government owns about 70 percent of the vast coal lands of the West. and the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975 requires review by the Justice Department for any possible antitrust violations prior to coal land leasing. None of us wants to see a monopolistic trend develop in the crucial coal and uranium markets.

If Senator BARTLETTS amendment passes. there will not be excess gas burned under electric boilers. The Administrator is authorized to allow the signing of new gas contracts only to the extent that they are necessary to insure reliability of service under an approved plan. This provides protection both for the gas consumers in States that face shortage as well as for the consumers of electric power. It was agreed by all sides. including the administration. that the utilities in the four States affected by the gas ban are in a unique position. They depend on gas for the generation of most. if not all. of their electricity. If we cut them off prematurely. it is the small homeowners and small businesses that will be affectedthe same people we are trying to help by imposing the gas burning ban in the first place. The utilities affected by this bill are moving as rapidly as possible to convert to other sources of fuel. Conversion to oil. which is what will necessarily happen unless Senator BARTLETTS amendment is adopted. will cause a loss of from 75 to 50 percent of the systems capacity. It will also cause an increase in oil imports. Oklahoma consumers will face a doubling of their electric bills. Administration spokesmen have assured us that they favor this amendment. indeed. they assisted in drafting it. With the safeguards inserted in the amendment. no one need suffer.",

This does not happen automatically. too often we have attended hearings and found that overlapping programs in diverse Federal agencies have led to unnecessary duplication of efforts. simply because the principals of such programs were not aware of what had already been done elsewhere in the Government. The problem is even more acute among governments of different States. where there is no statutory commitment to exchange information. The art of applying a scientific innovation from one specialized area to another is known as technology transfer. In years past all Americans have benefitted by spinoffs from large programs at NASA or the Department of Defense. the fact that most commercial airplanes originated as military transport planes is well known. Yet. in addition to these highly visible spinoffs. there have been thousands of quieter. less noticeable transfers of technology taking place at the same time. These occur most often because individual scientists and engineers take an interest in a field which at first seems to bear no relation to their specialty. but in fact contains very similar challenges to those they have already faced. One way in which Congress has aided technology transfer in the past is through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA). by which Federal agencies exchange workers with State and local governments or universities. Further evidence for the value of this program recently came to me in a letter from Gov. Robert W. Straub of Oregon. in which the Governor clearly illustrates the need to continue and expand such programs in technology transfer. Mr. President.

The victory enabled the Wildcats to finish the season with a 302 recorda feat made even more remarkable by the fact that they were ranked at the top of all the polls for the seasons duration. The championship is particularly rewarding to the four seniors on the squad: Jack Givens. Rick Robey. Mike Phillips. and James Lee. These young men have given 4 years of basketball that will long be remembered as one of the truly great eras of Kentucky basketball history. As freshmen. they were on a team that finished second to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA final. As sophomores. they led UK to the National Invitational Tournament championship at Madison Square Garden. Last year. they were a finalist in the eastern region. That is why it was so satisfying to see this group of seniors complete their careers with this crowning achievement. It should also be noted that during the past four seasons. Kentucky won the Southeastern Conference championship three times. Without a doubt. the man most responsible for this impressive record is Coach Joe B. Hall. who took over as the schools head basketball coach 4 years ago. Not only has he brought the NCAA championship back to Lexington for the first time since 1958. but he remains strongly committed to teaching and motivating young men to succeed in the classroom as well as the basketball floor. He has notlet me repeat notlost sight of the fact that education is the number one priority for our institutions of higher learning. Kentucky is fortunate to have an individual of Joe Halls ability and integrity in this position. and the future for UKs basketball program is indeed bright and promising. Recognition and messages of congratulation to Coach Hall and his team have come from all over the world. My colleague. Senator HUDDLESTON and I think the Senate. too. should be on record in saluting this impressive accomplishment and we ask unanimous consent that this resolution commending the University of Kentucky basketball team be adopted.

I listened to the Senator from Louisiana talk about how small businesses are supporting this proposal. and I wonder what question was asked. Was it on the House proposal or on the Bentsen proposal?",

I feel that the equity issue is really the heart of this proposal. The arguments in the merits of the job credit and the investment credit are really smokescreens with regard to the central issue we are talking aboutis it fair to take the rebate away from the consumer. but to leave the tax relief for business intact? Taking away the $50 rebate from individuals. $50 from the American taxpayer. seems to have been an easy step. It was accomplished easily and conveniently this afternoon by unanimous consent. Now we are debating the proposal that will benefit the business community by about $2.4 billion a year I think is a question of equity. and I strongly support. and look forward to further debate on this issue.",

Homebuilding has moved up. and it is encouraging to all of us. and I am as delighted as the Senator is. But that is not the real problem we are talking about. We are talking about those kinds of pressures leading to more inflation. which is the point I made earlier. that when you go to the supermarket and you see somebody going down one of those aisles and stamping prices on cans where do you go? Do you get behind that person or get in front of that person? You get in front of him because you know the price he is putting on is going to be a higher price than they had on that can before. That is my concern. But what you are seeing in an increase in the investment tax credit and adoption of an employment tax credit is not something that contributes to inflation. It is something to try to bring about more productivity. to try to bring about more efficiency. that is to try to make us more competitive in world trade. that is to try to make the dollar sounder. That is a better solution. really. than a public service job. I would rather see a fellow paid for working than for not working. but too often public service jobs are deadend jobs and not productive jobs. But these jobs that we get people into in the service industry are productive jobs and most of those will be by small business. And that is why small business has fought so hard for this concept.",

I might add. But let me ask the Senator this: How would he answer the same kind of question from 87 million taxpayers and 200 million Americans who were going to get $50 each when they write to him and say: You were so happy to cut my rebate of $50 and yet I see you are more than happy to give big business $2.4 billion in the same breath even over the objection of the President?",

I wonder why we always fight the battles of inflation on the backs of the consumer. on the backs of the 87 million taxpayers. and never in terms of the business community? Let me ask the Senator from Arkansas a question on the jobs credit. As I understand it. the average cost of a new employee is $10.000. Under the House formula. a business would receive $1.680. Under the Senate formula. it would receive only $600. I can imagine that any business. if it is going to invest $10.000 for a new worker. would rather have $600 than nothing. I am wondering. as an experienced businessman himself. whether the Senator feels that the $600 is really going to mean very much in a firms decision to hire a new worker? They know that they will be spending $10.000 a year for the worker. How significant is the fact that the worker comes $600 cheaper. when they know the worker will still cost them $9.400? Is not the jobs credit just a windfall for firms that would be hiring workers in any event? Would even the $1.680 in the House bill make much difference?",

General Motors in any given month or 2 or 3 months of the year stands to reap a pretty good harvest if it hires people because of a surge in business that it was going to hire anyway without this credit.

In 1974. Congress significantly expanded the scope of this law by directing the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to develop similar FederalState cooperative arrangements for conservation plans on lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. and the Department of Energy. This expanded coverage included specific requirements for improvement of wildlife habitat. range rehabilitation. and protection of endangered species. The act is significant because it. for the first time. gave the States an equal partnership with the Federal Government in developing recreational and conservation programs on Federal lands. In addition. it encouraged the comprehensive management of these resources on an ecosystem rather than a speciesbyspecies basis. Some progress has been made in the implementation of this important program. For instance. approximately 237 agreements covering 19 million acres of military lands have been concluded between the Defense Department. the Fish and Wildlife Service. and those States in which these lands are located.

There are about 2.400 who are unaccounted for. with over 30 coming from my home State of Maryland. It is an unfair toll that is being exacted from those families who still are not certain of the fate of their loved ones who served our Nation in Southeast Asia. On May 8. the House of Representatives passed House Concurrent Resolution 583. which concerns those who remain abong the unaccounted. The resolution was passed overwhelminglyby a vote of 369 to 0. It expresses the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the Secretary of State to request the Secretary General of the United Nations to work through UN agencies to secure a full accounting of Americans missing in Southeast Asia. Present efforts to secure an accounting are not productive. I can only be hopeful that President Carter will work diligently to resolve this heartwrenching problem.

Although Federal and State regulatory agencies have required additional safety equipment and precautions to prevent accidents by workers involved in hazardous occupations. the lumber industry in particular continues to face spiralling costs due to high insurance rates. high workers compensation costs. and expensive safety equipment requirements. That is why organizations such as the Michigan Association of Timbermen were establishedto protect member workers from occupational accidents while attempting to control the rising costs of meeting safety requirements. Similar organizations have been formed is 12 other States. indicating the magnitude of this problem. The very least Congress should do in order to prevent costly safety requirements from forcing small businessmen out of business is to reduce unnecessary tariffs on imported safety equipment not produced in the United States.

I have always supported the concept of balanced congressional hearings on Ireland. On this point Mr. Lynch and I agree. To be most effective. all persons and organizations who are parties to the dispute and. therefore. to the solution should use a congressional hearing as a forum by which to present their positions. A hearing should not result in Congress even taking a position on one solution over another or supporting one group over another. Rather the hearing should provide the means and information to help the Irish people make their own determinations on a solution. It is their nation. it is their future. While it is unusual procedure for the House International Relations Committee to elicit testimony from foreign elected or appointed officials. for a hearing on Ireland such testimony might be necessary to achieve balance. All legally sanctioned political parties as well as key elected officials from the Dublin government and representatives from the British Government should be invited to testify.

Under existing law. residents of the U.S. Territory of Guam are unable to invest their private retirement funds in taxfree shelters in the mainland. As a consequence. pension programs in Guam are deprived of this added source of revenue which is heavily used by other Americans in their pension plans. The impact of Guams deletion from this key section of the IRS Code is of enormous import to island residents. They. like each of us. look forward to the day when their retirement will be a happy period. financially secure with their hardearned pensions. Yet. because private citizens on Guam are denied the use of taxfree sheltered funds. these individuals will be extremely hard pressed to offset the ravages of inflation. The need for this legislation is supported by the ruling received from Mr. William B. Posner. Acting Chief. Employee Plans. Technical Branch. Internal Revenue Service.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill which will amend the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to provide for the regulation of foreign fish processing vessels within the 200mile fisheries conservation zone. As you are aware. a number of foreign nations have suggested joint fishing ventures with U.S. fishermen in order to acquire some of the fish which were formerly harvested by foreigners and are now being harvested by Americans. Two applications for such ventures are already being considered by the Department of Commerceone in Washington. involving Soviet vessels. and one in Alaska utilizing Korean vessels. The Department has stated that it lacks sufficiently clear legal direction to regulate these vessels. I hope to provide that direction with this bill. This legislation will meet the needs of both processors and fishermen. by allowing U.S. processors a priority in the purchase of fish without precluding the sale of fish to foreign processors if no domestic market exists. Simply stated. U.S. fish processors must show a clear intent to purchase fish from U.S. fishermen. Lacking that intent. U.S. fishermen are perfectly free to sell their fish to foreign processors. The bill also provides a mechanism whereby the Department of Commerce. in cooperation with other Departments and the Regional Councils. can permit foreign processing vessels to buy U.S.-caught fish within the 200mile zone. Thus. both fishermen and processors are protected from economic dislocation and the continued development of fisheries resources can take place within the zone.*",

I would like to express my support for amendments to the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Act of 1978 that I have cosponsored with Mr. JEPFORDS and several of my colleagues in the House Education and Labor Committee. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act clearly mandates that all barriers to the handicapped be removed. However. most of our efforts in this area have focused on eliminating architectural barriers. It is time that we consider the very real communications barriers that exist. and must be removed to provide an equal chance. for the deaf. The first stepshould be to provide more interpreters for the deaf throughout the country. The amendment I have cosponsored with Mr. JEFFORDS today will establish 12 regional program centers to train interpreters for the deaf. One of these centers already exists. I am pleased to note. at the St. Paul Technical Vocational Institute in St. Paul. Minn. Mr. John Hudson of the South Dakota School for the Deaf in Sioux Falls has praised the fine work of the St. Paul TVI in the area of postsecondary education for the deaf and in training interpreters. I am enthused about the prospect of establishing a network of training centers like the St. Paul TVI in every part of the United States. The second part of our amendment to the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Act will help individual States set up information and referral systems so they can better serve the deaf. The Department of Vocational Rehabilitation in South Dakota has voiced their support for Federal assistance to enable them to increase their efforts in this areaand I believe our amendment will provide a real boost in the availability of services for our deaf citizens. I look forward to our continuing work on the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Act of 1978 with its renewed emphasis on eliminating communications barriers to the deaf. I urge my colleagues on the House Education and Labor Committee. and in the House of Representatives to join me in promoting this important legislation.O",

Although the tuna industry traces the early days of its founding to southern California. today all major tuna packers operate in Puerto Rico. including the National Packing Co.. Star Kist Caribe.

Today. 25 years later and after considerable effort by various Government agencies. especially the Economic Development Administration. to promote the industrys expansion in Puerto Rico. the tuna cannery workers number nearly 7.000 with an annual payroll of about $35 million. Another 12.000 workers. plus 833 crewmembers and shore personnel are employed indirectly to support the operation of some 50 tuna vessels. Five companies now operate seven individual tuna canning plants. Employment within the industry has grown at an annual rate of 20.5 percent per year with a concomitant payroll increase of 28.6 annually. providing a steadily Increasing flow of funds for local business and commerce within the Ponce and Mayaguez areas.

The loss of these experienced soldiers. especially from the enlisted and noncommissioned officer ranks. is extremely serious. There are many reasons why this exodus is occurring. but I feel a driving force behind a persons decision to leave the service is low morale.

Young Macfarlane was having problems with his pineapple plantings and was ready to try some other crop when he read. in a 1916 canning industry journal. about packing tuna in Southern California.

Over 30 million veterans rely upon health care services provided by the VA hospitals. and much valuable medical research is conducted by the medical profession In conjunction with the Veterans hospitals throughout this country. Severe cutbacks in the budget for the VA hospital system were proposed by the Budget Committee. If the cutbacks had been approved. doubts would have been raised about the depth and strength of the Federal commitment to the Nations veterans and their health care needs. The scheduled cutbacks would have caused a loss of 21 beds at the VA facility in Louisville. This hospital serves Louisville and many surrounding areas including our neighbors from across the Ohio River in Indiana. Any cutbacks would have been very difficult for the hospital to absorb. I am glad my colleagues last week saw fit to adopt the Roberts amendment to the fiscal year 1979 budget resolution.

Congress will soon be voting on President Carters plan to end the U.S. arms embargo that we imposed on Turkey in 1975. and I want to make known my staunch opposition to such a proposal. Over the years. the United States has played a major role in trying to preserve the security of the NATO alliance. in which both Greece and Turkey play a vital role. As a result. we have contributed greatly to the military postures of both countries. However. it is quite clear that these weapons are intended to be deployed strictly for defensive purposes. When Turkey invaded and occupied the island of Cyprus. over 90 percent of the military equipment it used had been supplied by the United States. The legal implications of such an action are clear: Turkey violated the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. which explicitly prohibits Americansupplied arms from being used in any fashion except for defense. So much for the legal aspects of the invasion. More importantly. Turkeys aggression violated the integrity of this independent state and shattered its flourishing economy. In human terms. it brought personal tragedy and hardship to thousands of families. forcing much of the population to become refugees whose problems have yet to be resolved. While it is true that the arms embargo has yet to have had little effect on the Turkish Governments willingness to negotiate a just settlement to the Cyprus question. it is still our major \"bargaining chip\" in our attempts to bring peace to that area. Congress has already modified the embargo by granting Turkey the weapons guarantees necessary for its NATO responsibilities. yet no meaningful progress toward a negotiated settlement has occurred. Any relaxation of the current embargo would be interpreted as the United States Governments implied consent to the continued Turkish occupation of Cyprus. Greece has long been an important ally to the United States and it is our responsibility to continue to exert pressure on the Turkish Government to negotiate a just and lasting peace. We must also insist on a settlement that directs itself toward resolving the territorial problem. striking a proper balance between the two populations on Cyprus both politically and economically. For these reasons. I must oppose the administrations proposal to lift our arms embargo against Turkey.0",

Most of the deaths were caused by toxic gases given off by burming fabrics. and most. if not all. of those lives could have been saved had the Congress passed into law legislation requiring that all places of public assembly must use flameretardant fabrics. I have such a bill pending in the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. It was submitted after the tragedy of the Beverly Hills nightclub fire in Kentucky. Following the June 26th fire in the Maury County jail in Columbia. Tenn.. where 42 persons died from toxic fumes. citycounty coordinator Dennis Johnson wrote me that if my bill would have been in effect at the time the fire started. the holocaust might well have been averted. Just last week. five inmates at the Danbury Federal prison died and 69 persons suffered injury when someone evidently set fire to a pile of prison clothing. I claim no special expertise on this subject. It just seems sensible to me that in buildings where many people are crowded together. every precaution ought to be taken to avert the possibility of a fatal fire. Any place that uses tablecloths. linen. mattresses. and other types of fabric ought to be required to use only those that will resist burning. I am sure that if the members of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee can put their experience to this issue. they might well improve the language of my proposal.

Mr. Speaker. the American Battle Monuments Commission is charged with the responsibility of maintaining American military cemeteries overseas. These cemeteries are the result of major battles during World War I and II. The relationship between these cemeteries and the military is obvious. This special relationship was recognized 54 years ago when the Congress first established the Commission. In that original legislation. it was mandated that the Secretary of the Commission be a military officer. At the present time. there are eight military personnel assigned to the ABMC. All but two are retired officers who were voluntarily recalled to active duty to serve on the Commission. Earlier this year. the Secretary of Defense announced that these six officers were being withdrawn. effective. August 1. Should the ABMC lose these six officers. five new civil service positions will have to be formed to fill their vacancies. The military personnel affected will probably retire for a second time and fill the civil service jobs created. The result would be an additional cost to the Federal Government of $350.000 per yearmoney that would be needlessly spent. The measure before us now. H.R. 7678. has two purposes. The first is to continue the militarys support efforts of the Commission. The second is to save the Government money.

Earlier this year. the Department of Defense. informed the ABMC that the military support personnel assigned to the Commission were going to be withdrawn effective August 1. 1977.

First. it should be noted that a veteran who cannot use one entire side of his body has severe locomotion problems. and needs special adaptive equipment to move about his own home. Second. this bill goes only to serviceconnected injuries. In other words. we are saying that the individual suffered a severe disability because of service to our Government. and it is the duty of this Government to minimize the difficulties he now experiences as a result of his service. It is entirely appropriate that we allow the veteran to make his own home as safe and comfortable as possible. Mr. Speaker. this benefit is deserved. The requirements of specific disability narrow the possible recipients to approximately 2.000. Additionally. the individual himself must absorb half the cost. This is not a free ride. and it is. emphatically. our obligation. Therefore. I support the bill. and urge my colleagues to do likewise.",

H.R. 7658 is supported by the major veterans organizations. and has been for some 15 years. Yet. Congress has never seen fit to recognize the simple facts of life surrounding these disabled veterans.

H.R. 7658 will entitle them to a $25.000 grant to equip their homes with the special facilities necessary If they are to lead a comfortable life while at home. There is no reason to oppose this measure. It should pass without a single no vote. We must recognize the sacrifices these disabled veterans made. and we must do it today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 7658. which extends to certain categories of disabled veterans. financial help in purchasing housing with special facilities designed to accommodate their handicaps. Under current legislation these benefits are limited to veterans entitled to compensation for permanent and total disability due to spinal cord disease or injury resulting in paralysis of the legs or lower body. However. there are other disabled veterans who face comparable disadvantages due to the loss of the use of one upper and one lower extremity. We cannot neglect the veteran who has lost the use of two limbs and cannot move without braces. crutches. canes or a wheelchair. H.R. 7658 would add this group of veterans to the specially adapted housing program. making them eligible to receive 50 percent of the total cost of housing adapted so as to compensate for their disabilities. The Veterans Administration estimates that over a 5year period. approximately 2.227 disabled veterans would be eligible for this benefit. should the reported bill be enacted. These veterans. would otherwise be forced to exist in homes where they are unable to pass through hallways. open doors or perform other. normally simple tasks without assistance. This legislation restores a small measure of the human dignity to which the disabled veteran is entitled. For this reason I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 7658.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 7658. The specially adapted housing program was first established in June 1948 by Public Law 702 of the 80th Congress. Eligibility at that time was limited to those veterans entitled to compensation for permanent and total disability due to spinal cord disease or injury with paralysis of the legs and lower part of the body. These were veterans with the most readily apparent need for specially adapted homes. being paralyzed from the waist down and severely handicapped in their movements and the use of ordinary facilities. Their condition was generally such as to require the use of a wheelchair. Other adaptations included ramps. special bathroom equipment. extra large rooms. exercising facilities and other devices essential for many of them to live comfortably outside of the hospital. Mr. Speaker. since that time the program has been liberalized to various degrees. Veterans are now eligible for specially adapted housing if they have a permanent and total serviceconnected disability due to loss or loss of use of both lower extremities. or which involves blindness in both eyes having only light perception plus loss or loss of use of one lower extremity. or due to loss or loss of use on one lower extremity together with residuals of organic disease or injury which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion without resort to a wheelchair. Mr. Speaker. I concur with statements already made by the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee in support of the legislation. Little more need to be said about these veterans. The benefit consists of payment of 50 percent of the total cost to the eligible veteran of a house having special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the veterans disability. The maximum grant may not exceed $25.000. Most of the veterans organizations testified in support of the legislation and the Disabled American Veterans. who represent more than a half a million serviceconnected disabled veterans. strongly endorse the legislation. I hope it receives the unanimous support of the House.",

I strongly support the reported bill and commend the distintinguished gentleman from Mississippi. the very able chairman of our Subcommittee on Compensation. Pension. and Insurance for the timely action he and his subcommittee have taken to bring this legislation before the House. Should the bill be enacted it will provide about $190 million in additional benefits to approximately 2.8 million veterans and their survivors. effective January 1. 1978. The nonserviceconnected pension program was first created in 1933. It provides financial assistance based upon need to veterans who have had at least 90 days of honorable service during time of war and who become totally and permanently disabled for employment purposes as a result of disability not necessarily related to their military service. A veteran 65 years or over is considered to meet the disability requirements for the payment of pension. Benefits are also payable to widows of war veterans who die as a result of nonserviceconnected disabilities. The widow must meet income requirements similar to those for veterans. however. there are no disability requirements for a widow to receive nonserviceconnected death pension. The reported bill has two major provisions. First. it would provide a 7percent rate increase in benefits for all veterans and elegible survivors effective January 1. 1978. According to the Congressional Budget Office the costofliving increase during this calendar year will be about 6.7 percent. Second. the bill would also provide that upon reaching the age of 78 years. eligible widows of nonserviceconnecteddisabled veterans would be entitled to an additional 25 percent in their benefits. As the subcommittee chairman has explained. this addon is designed to give additional aid to the widows of World War I veterans. Coupled with an identical addon for veterans at age 78 provided by Public Law 94432. elderly veterans and their widows will be receiving more than $100 million per year in additional benefits beginning January 1. Mr. Speaker. this very worthy bill deserves the unanimous support of the House. Mr. Speaker.

The arguments have been madeand there are \"Dear Colleague\" letters from a number of Senators and Senators CHURCH and CASE. who have indicated their opposition to this particular bill. an opposition which. by the way. has been traditional. and is based upon the fact. first. that OPIC does not represent an economic benefit to the United States. and second. that it helps essentially big companies. Aside from the fact that we are very carefully orienting OPIC to small and medium business in this particular extension to the board is already resolved to concentrating on small business. which. I think. will go a long way toward helping in that regard. The fact is that we are continuing the guarantees of investment because we want the end product. to wit. development in the developing countries. In response to the argument that. \"Well. you are making guarantees for big companies.\" I say if those big companies are actually engaged in the desirable development process. in the interests of the United States. then we ought to be glad they are around to do it. and we should not be parochial and say. \"Well. we do not want to help in that process because it is being done by a major American company.\" As I emphasized. Mr. President. this operation is not only selfsustaining. but makes a profit. May I point out. too. that there is a lot of competition. The United Kingdom. Germany.

At that time. I think. I may have been the sole member of our committee to oppose the creation of OPIC. The midwife. or the granddaddy. whatever you want to call it. the Senator from New York. obviously had greater persuasive power and carried with him the rest of the committee. Senator CHURCH had some doubts about it. but he was persuaded to buy the proposition by an inclusion of provisions encouraging OPIC to go into partnership with private industry in insuring these risks. so far as possible. The Senator from New Jersey at that time expressed the view that the prospect of private insurance entering this field in any substantial way was very small. In that he was joined. and the Senator must correct himself for his earlier statement that he had no comnany at that time. The Senator from Missouri. I believe. Senator SYMINGTON. was one of those who expressed not only doubt but conviction that private comnanies should not get into this kind of risky business. He stated in substance. and I concurred and still concur. that any private insurance company that would go into the business of insuring this kind of risk was one that he did not want to have anything to do with as far as either investment or carrying his own insurance was concerned. In any event. OPIC itself has come to believe that private insurance does not have any business in this field. In the extension which is contemplated by the pending bill. OPIC will no longer solicit a partnership with private insurance and agrees that it has no place in the insurance of the kinds of risk that OPIC is scheduled to take. Senator CHURCH has now joined the ranks. still very small. of those on the committee who oppose this proposition. but he is now a true convert and. as such. even more fervent. perhaps. than some of the older members of the small group.

It includes also $45 million for the first time for loans to the States and their political subdivisions in order to relieve social or economic impacts occasioned by the development of minerals leased in such States. The total amounts authorized by the bill would increase each year. rising to a level of $586 million for fiscal year 1982. Upon investigation. these amounts may prove to be inadequate to provide an optimum level of protection and development of the national resource lands. This past year. both the authorizing and appropriations committees in the House and the Senate have expressed strong concern that the executive branch has consistently failed to request sufficient manpower and funding to make the investments in our public lands that are necessary to provide adequate protection and development of their resources. In many situations it is apparent that investments now will more than pay for themselves in increasing the sustained yield of these lands. Artificial. arbitrary personnel ceilings imposed by the executive branch and a growing practice of utilizing \"temporary\" positions are undermining the effort to recruit and maintain a competent work force necessary for sound management of the Nations resources.

Administrator Trains. other problems ranged from directing a multiagency effort to explore the environmental problems attending existing and new energy technologies to making sure that an $18 billion waste treatment construction grant program was run efficiently and effectively. Last week the New York Times carried an editorial praising Russell Train for his exemplary service. As the editorial points out. EPA. \"under Mr. Train. has gone far to arrest a serious decline in the countrys - physical environment.\" Russell Train performed this remarkable task in the face of formidable obstacles. He can truly be called an environmentalist for all seasons. It will be a tough act to follow. I ask unanimous consent that the Times article be printed in the RECORD.",

In this recognition he goes back to the basic cause of the great depression of the late 1920\"s which was the collapse of the Kreditanstadt Bank in Austria. Austria had been engaged in .exactly the kind of practices that the United States is pursuing. in spite of the warnings by other countries to cease deficit spending. When this banking institution failed the Austrian mark. then an important figure in world currency. collapsed and the world depression started. There is no question that the nations of this world are again in serious. financial trouble.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senate will begin shortly to consider a major reorganization of the Senate committee system. I am looking forward to supporting a majority of the reforms recom.mended by the Temporary Select Committee on Committees. At the same time. I also support the modifications in the Jdiudry 26. 197.7 \"tO select committee recommendations made by the Senate Rules Committee. Iam particularly pleased to support the Rules Committee decision to retain the Select Committee on Small Business. The Select Committee on Small Business has served its constituency well over the last 27 years. -I was deeply concerned that the effectiveness of this select committee would have been deeply impaired if it had been merged with the Senate Agriculture Committee. It would have been impossible for a subcommittee of 5 members to carry on the workload that has been shared by the 15 to 25 Senators who have been members of the Select Committee during past Congresses. Additionally. it is clear that no one standing committee exclusively represents small business interests. Historically. Congress has always been sympathetic to the needs of Americas small businessmen. The antitrust statutes. promulgated in the late 1800s served to protect the small businessman from predatory practices of giant corporations. During the Great Depression. the Reconstruction Finance Corporation served the small business community which needed business loans. In the early 1950s Congress created the Small Business Administration to address the needs of small businessmen. Since the 1950s interestsof the small business community were represented in the Congress by a Select Committee on Small Business. Only 8 months ago. this committee for the first time in its history. received legislative jurisdiction. The Rules Committee action retaining the Select Committee on Small Business confirms the Congress commitment to address the needs of the small businessman. The importance of the American small businessman cannot be overstated. Of Americas 12 million businesses. 96.7 percent are small businesses. Small businesses account for 43 percent of our gross national product and provide 55 percent of the total U.S. work force. Directly or indirectly. small business provides livelihoods for 100 million Americans. It is for this reason that I applaud the Rules Committee action- to retain the Select Committee on Small Business. CRIME",

Barkan. director of the AFLCIO Committee on Political Education and one of the leading advocates in the Nation of reform in our outdated and archaic voter registration laws. As Mr. Barkan states. the time has come for a universal voter registration law: Any eligible citizen should be entitled to enter the voting booth on Election Day. his or her registration having been duly handled. without aggravation or inconvenience. by the government. The conventional wisdom often blames low voter turnout on voter apathy. But Mr. Barkan effectively refutes the myth of voter apathy by citing the reality of the obstacles to registration and their effect in denying citizens the right to vote. I share Mr. Barkans concern that it is time for a quantum jump to an effective universal voter registration system in America. I hope that this reform will be a top priority in the present Congress. so that the next time America goes to the polls. every citizen will be able to exercise his right to vote in fact as well as theory.

Mr. Trautman makes a number of pungent observations that we could well take to heart: That during the 94th Congress our national debt increased at the rate of $1 billion a week. that our regulatory agencies have become a fourth branch of Government accountable to no one. with power both to interpret and to administer their own pronouncements. that businessmen have too long been intimidated into being ashamed of profit. and that Government. while it can enact programs to stimulate demand and help the disadvantaged. cannot create the resources that are essential for these purposes. I was especially glad to see Mr. Trautmans description of our regulatory agencies as a runaway fourth branch of Government. For almost 2 years now I have advocated legislation to restore our governmental balance by bringing these agencies under control. This proposal. which is now pending before the 95th Congress as S. 86. would reverse the traditional rule of law that regulations of Federal agencies are presumed to be valid. Instead. when a citizen challenges a regulation in court as going beyond the intent of. Congress. the burden would be on the agency to establish the validity of its own action. To be sure. Government can accomplish much. and has done so in the past. It would be unwise to return to a strict laissezfaire system of economics. Modern conditions. including the complexity of economic relationships and the tremendous growth of population. necessarily require a Government of much larger size than formerly. This does not mean. however. that the growth of Government should be unchecked. or that our efforts to make it efficient should cease.

The first article by Anthony Lewis appeared under the title \"Morality In Foreign Policy\" in the New York Times. October 21. 1976. and wisely concludes that: Americans cannot stop all the brutalitie3 in the world. cannot impose our ideals of free speech and respect for law on India or the Philippines or East Germany.... But we can be ourselves. That means making clear what our beliefs are. and at a minimum not actively betraying them when we do use our power abroad. The other two articles. one by our distinguished new colleague. Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. the other by John Marks. appeared together under the title. \"On U.S. Support for the WorldBank Loan to Chile\" in the New York Times. January 4. 1977. Both rightly criticize Ford administration support for a $60 million World Bank loan to Chile. and emphasize the importance of recognizing human rights factors in the determination of our foreign policy. In the past 3 years. Congress has reduced or terminated assistance to Chile. South Korea. and Uruguay in response to repeated acts of internal repression. This ought to be the year when the United States applies these sanctions consistently to other regimes practicing torture against political prisoners and other violations of basic human rights. PAT MOYNIHAN is correct: the decision to give aid is a decision to support the government in power. Let our decisions in 1977 signal to the world that the United States does care about the kind of government to which it offers military and economic assistance. Throughout the world people once viewed our country as the beacon of hope for those struggling for human rights. Fortunately.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am joining my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Oklahoma in introducing a bill to modify the existing peanut program.. The purpose of this bill is to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce peanut acreage to match supply with demand. Our peanut program has provided consumers and farmers with stable. reasonable peanut prices. However. because peanut yields have increased faster than demand. peanuts have been in surplus. Due to the oversupply. the peanut program costs have been higher than we would like. Accordingly. the legislation we are introducing today would significantly reduce the cost of the peanut program. I am convinced that an acreage reduction of 10 percent in 1978 and additional annual acreage reductions of not more than 5 percent. if necessary. will match peanut supply with demand. Our solution to the problem is simply to reduce the peanut acreage to match supply with demand and maintain the price support for peanuts at 70 percent net of parity for the 1978 crop year and adjusted annually to reflect any changes in the index of prices paid by farmers for production items. interest. taxes. and wages for the next 3 crop years. The administration has proposed a complicated twoprice system to reduce the cost of the peanut program. This proliosal is totally unacceptable to peanut growers in North Carolina. The North Carolina Peanut Growers Association unanimously support the bill that Senator BELLmON and I are introducing today. This bill will be offered as an amendment to the 1977 farm bill which is being marked up in the Senate Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry.

This proposal is offered with the unanimous support of the National Peanut Growers Group. It represents a sensible. honest approach to solve the present problems being encountered in the administration of the peanut program. This bill will lessen the budgetary problems of this program and will not totally disrupt the productive capabilities of farmers. Mr. President. this proposal acts to decrease the acres eligible for price support. However. it does not yield to a \"kneejerk\" reaction based on current conditions. The reduction in acreage is gradual and is keyed by demand. This presents the most optimum method of deleting the burdens of the peanut program without creating short supplies in the future by providing disincentives. for growers. The 70percentofparity concept is retained and will be adjusted based on the index of prices paid by farmers. Mr. President. the peanut program is not a fat program. Peanuts are very difficult to grow and to store. We must have our supplies renewed each year as the peanut will not store effectively over 8 months. If we do not provide a program which encourages farmers to face this labor intensive production effort we will face shortages in later years. Administration of the current program has been its greatest adversary. Some people in Government have evidently felt that a program which adequately protects all producers is ineffective. This attitude. if continued into new proposals. will have a very detrimental effect on the peanut producers. Growing peanuts is such an arduous task that growers will not continue to grow peanuts at breakeven or less prices as some proposals have suggested. Therefore. Mr. President. I believe it will be in the best interest of consumers and producers to simply lessen the exposure to the Government due to the peanut program by a simple acreage reduction. By Mr. BARTLETT:",

The Constitution of the United States establisied a representative democracy so that the will of the people can best be served. As elected representatives we hold our positions so that the needs and desires of the American people may be fulfilled through the legislative process. As this remains the very foundation of our democratic form of government. the system requires open and constant communication between the people of this Nation and their elected officials. The bill I am introducing today will facilitate this necessary communication by allowing mail to be sent free of charge to Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives and to the President of the United States. Recognition of the necessity for communication between the people and their elected officials caused us to adopt the franking system. The franking privilege allows communication to be mailed free of charge whefi sent by officials to their constituents. We have failed. however. to provide for such free communications when our constituents seek to inform us of their views and their needs. And in terms of the successful operation of the democratic system. it may be far more important for the people to have freer access to their elected representatives.

Recent events in history have shaken the confidence of the American people in their institutions and their representatives.

It has long been my belief that we have written all of our current disaster assistance legislation far too rigidly. Only certain kinds of natural disasters qualify individuals and businesses for the special and instantaneous assistance which is so often needed in an emergency situation. Many cataclysmic events such as. oil spill damage like that which threatened the shores of Massachusetts. this winter and devastated parts of the Delaware River shores. extreme weather conditions. like the ice that locked New England fishermen into their harbors all winter. or the drought that affected winter resort business in the West and vast numbers of agricultural concerns. or finally. even social and political events like the Indian land claims suits in UMashpee.

We are trying to make the jobs tax section of the business stimulus title of H.R. 3477 more effective. We are raising the credit to 33 percent from 25 percent which is in the Finance Committee version. We are in. creasing the credit for hiring new employees from $1.050 in the committee bill to $1.386. We raise the revenue for this increase by placing a cap of $100.000 per company. per annum. A cap of $100.000 will allow a company to hire 72 new workers. Now Mr. President there are very few companies in this country who are capable of hiring more than 72 employees above last years base.. Most. which can. will be opting for the 2percent investment tax credit which we leave intact with our amendment. Put another way. a company with 3.500 workers could expand its employment by 5 percent and still take full advantage of our increased credit. We want to stimulate employment. We also want to stimulate the small and medium sized sector of the business community. We have the very strong support of the national and regional small business organizations behind our amendment. I hope that our colleagues will realize that it is better to give this employment credit a real chance to work by putting some real incentive into it than to try to spread it too thinly as the Finance Committee version does.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 13311. an amendment to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act which will provide for ar overall reduction of the risk associated with the marine transport of oil. Chairman BIAGGI has been diligent in putting together a package of legislation which meets our Nations need to provide greater protection for the marine environment. In the Puget Sound area many of the citizens are reluctant to see any increase in the level of oil transport because of such incidents as the Argo Merchant and the Torrey Canyon disasters. In Puget Sound. being a deepwater estuary. a large oil spill could have drastic impacts on marine life. Therefore. it is essential that we enact this legislation which will provide clear guidelines for safe tanker operations. This legislation would provide for an improved vessel traffic safety system. by applying available technology. This legislation includes standards for new and existing vessels with respect to segregated ballasts. crude oil washing systems. inert gas systems. steering gear systems. and navigation equipment. It also provides for improved personnel qualifications and manning standards for all oil tankers using U.S. ports. This legislation is important in that it encourages the application of existing and new technologies to the marine transport of oil. There are many available technologies which could significantly reduce the risk of oilspills in the marine environment. Given the importance which fishermen. recreationists. and others attach to an unspoiled marine environment. I think it essential that we begin to invest in reducing the risk of oilspills. I feel that this bill is a major move in this direction and I strongly support it.",

H.R. 13311 is part of a concerted effort by the United States to join with other nations of the world in an effort to prevent pollution of the marine environment. This muchneeded legislation will help provide for the safety of U.S. ports and waterways. the safety of tank vessels. and the protection of the marine environment. In recognition of the fact that marine pollution resulting from oilspflls is a global problem. section 9 of this bill encourages the President to enter into negotiations with neighboring states and within international bodies to establish appropriate international standards to prevent and control pollution. In this regard. some concern was expressed by the executive branch about the implications of this legislation since some provisions contained in it exceed international standards agreed upon by the United Nations Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO). I share these concerns as they relate to our efforts to gain international cooperation. but I feel that the overall positive effect of this legislation requires our support. Marine pollution knows no boundaries. To be effective. we must approach the problem in a global fashion. The legislation before us. H.R. 13311. provides the tools to coordinate U.S. efforts in the international arena. As our distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Relations",

Mr. Speaker. in the absence of the gentleman from Colorado who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that considered this legislation. I rise in support of H.R. 12026 which. as has been pointed out. designates a 70.000acre wilderness in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. It also establishes an adjoining national recreation area of about 36.000 acres. By designating both the wilderness area and a recreation area. this bill recognizes the competing interests for which this land may be used. For the residents of Denver. the Indian Peaks wilderness will provide an opportunity for a primitive experience less than 2 hours from the heart of the city. At the same time. the Arapaho Recreation Area will provide opportunities for other recreational uses and development which are incompatible with wilderness. but just as much in the public interest. This bill has the strong support of both the gentleman from Colorado . ranking member of the Subcommittee on Public Lands. and the gentleman from Colorado . the two Members whose districts would be affected. It has been the result of considerable study and input on both the national and local levels. I would like to note that included in these studies were findings by the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Mines that no substantial mineral. oil. or gas potential exists. In addition. the area is not suitable for commercial timber use. There is some concern when we talk about wilderness area about private inholdings and. as the report points out. the Wilderness Act itself provides such rights as may be necessary to assure adequate access to Stateowned and privateowned land. so the people in the area will continue to have access to them. In addition. the Wilderness Act prohibits the Secretary from acquiring such publicly owned lands. unless the owner concurs in such acquisition. Mr. Speaker.

This land. some of the most spectacular in the Rockies. straddles the Continental Divide and offers abundant opportunities for camping. hiking. and other outdoor activities.

The sponsors represent very different parts of the State. but they worked together to insure that the areas will remain for the benefit of all Colorado residents. as well as visitors nationwide. The bill provides for a 1year study by the Interior and Agriculture Departments to determine whether the wilderness portion of Indian Peaks should be added to Rocky Mountain National Park. I hope the Departments opt for full wilderness protection. There are no resource conflicts within the wilderness itself. and the recreation area provides opportunities for development that can boost the local economy while providing visitors with additional options for enjoying the land.*",

I join my colleague in supporting passage of H.R. 12165. a bill to continue through June 30. 1981. the existing suspension of duty on the importation of certain metal waste and scrap. The bill merely continues for another 3year period the tariff status that has applied to metal waste and scrap. unwrought metal. and other articles of metal almost continuously since the duty on these items was first lifted in 1942. The duty suspension applies to both column 1 and column 2 rates. except in the case of copper where imports from Communist countries. or column 2 entries. will continue to have the duty levied. Public hearings held in May of this year affirmed the fact that conditions which warranted suspension of the duties over these many years still exist. Domestic smelters continue to depend on imported metal scrap in the same way as domestic producers of primary metals depend on imported metal ores. Metal scrap is an important raw material for which there is a longstanding shortage in this country. If the duty suspension is not continued. steel producers will have to turn solely to higher priced ores which also have to be imported. In addition. when H.R. 12165 was considered by the Trade Subcommittee. the duty suspension was expanded somewhat. Now included on the free list would be metal articles to be remanufactured by methods other than melting. to which the original suspension applied exclusively. Thus. the duty suspension would apply to metal waste and scrap imported for remanufacture by methods other than melting if entered in such a state that \"renders them fit only for the recovery of the metal content.\" Mr. Speaker. the Ways and Means Committee unanimously agreed that H.R. 12165 is justified at this time.

It does address itself to some serious problems: What does the language of the resolution. as presented to us. do to the previous action of the Congress of the United Sta+_. with respect to the development of the cruise missile? What does it do or say with respect to the limited funds voted for the B1 bomber? What does it do or say to the previous expressions of this Congress with respect to Diego Garcia? It may turn out that it does not affect any of those. but in my judgment. it can be construed to say that each of those previous actions and others taken by Congress have been wiped away by the language of this resolution. I hope that the Committee on Foreign Relations will consider that at the time that they have this before them for reconsideration.",

I suggest that the language is not susceptible to any interpretation that the United States. acting through the Secretary of State. has done anything other than declare its intention not to take an action inconsistent with the provisions of the interim agreement. There is no use raising all kinds of extraneous arguments relating to the military budget or to other legislation within the competence of Congress. All this resolution says is that. when the Secretary of State declares that we have no intention of violating the interim agreement which expires today. providing the Russians do not violate it. this body concurs with that decision. Now. the Congress can go one of two ways. It can say that we think the United States should immediately begin to take actions inconsistent with the interim agreement. Or it can say we concur in the Presidents declaration that we should abide by the interim agreement as long as the Russians do likewise. pending the completion of negotiations on SALT II.

No other agency of Government performs the functions of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. Its reviews and reports represent a key tool in educating the public and the administration on the causes of rising prices. This information enables the various sectors of our economy to deal voluntarily with the causes of inflation. Mr. Chairman. the House Banking Committee reported H.R. 6951 by a vote of 36 to 2.

While the Councils powers have been limited to \"jawboning.\" it is a watchdog agency which alerts the country through published reports and public filings on situations which it has closely reviewed. Its task is to educate the participants in the economy as to the causes of increasing prices and to get the public involved in the process of voluntary restraints on factors which feed inflation. I think the amendments which the House Committee on Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs and the Senate have adopted. will give the Council a new important dimension in that the new provisions would include full emnloyment as one objective of the antiinflation program. They would emphasize the control of inflation and would direct the Council to review data about and analyze the effects on the U.S. economy and its role in the world economy. I am sure I do not have to remind my colleagues of the impact of the world petroleum situation or the coffee shortages on the American household budgets. Our newspapers and the electronic media are filled with reports of international commodity supplies and prices and the effects of the exportation of American capital. Rising interest rates and their influence on capital investment are no longer just the arcane concerns of pinstripe financiers. but of all of us who need housing. automobiles. or any bigsaletag items. The Council for the first time will be directed to examine these economic matters from a perspective that will highlight the inflationary effects. The Senate. with the approval of the administration. has also added provisions to the House version of the bill which protect the confidentiality of proprietary and other private information. I am sure no one has serious objection to the addition. I believe H.R. 6951 will make it possible to get imoortant economic information with which we will be better able to shape policies to combat inflation and its causes in the crucial days ahead.

The reason steel prices were rolled back was because it had the backing of the President. not because this Council did anything.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to call to my colleagues attention a very important editorial in the Washington Post this morning. This editorial brings into sharp focus the disturbing decision of a Federal judge to delay Federal coal leasing at least 18 more months. Frankly. I would not be surprised to see a 3year delay unless something is done. Mr. Speaker. this decision could have severe impact right in my congressional district as it will on many. many Americans. If one assumes that the coal conversion tax as passed by the House survives the Senate. then the consumers in my district would pay about $35 to $50 million dollars more for electricity unless we can lease some Federal lignite. Mr. Speaker surely the American people are going to wonder what is going on when the Government makes them pay a steep tax for not burning coal while another branch of the Government does not let them get the coal or lignite to avoid the tax. The Washington Post editorial is not strident in tone. it does not demagog. it recognizes legitimate concerns on the part of all parties. But the Post does say to the Congressour national energy policy cannot be decided in courts where narrow issues are the focus. Congress has to take the necessary steps to insure coal is available without having court delays. In the meantime. I would like the courts to recognize that the ivory judges chambers are not the place to say lightly that plenty of private coal is available when the ability to mine much of this coal is not feasible and getting it to the right places is impractical. Besides the Federal coal is the peoples coal. and it would seem we could agree that the people get to use that coal to avoid stiff Federal taxes. - I ask that the Washington Post edi - torial be placed in the CONGRESSIONAl I RECORD. as follows:",

Representative DRINAN. in a project he inaugurated entitled \"Helsinkis Unfulfilled Promise.\" The 35 nations which signed the Helsinki Final Act. in August 1975. pledged to facilitate the reunification of families separated by political boundaries. It would appear. however. that the Soviet Unions promise is virtually meaningless as evidenced by the number of families who have been divided because of the Soviets harsh and discriminatory emigration policies. For the second consecutive session. Members of Congress are conducting a vigil on behalf of the families which remain separated to show that the free world does sympathize with the plight of these people and will forge ahead in a positive direction to insure human rights for all. Mr. Speaker. I would like to call your attention to the tragic story of two brothersAlexander and Arkady Yampolskywho have spent 4 years in limbo. alternating between hope and frustration in their efforts to obtain permission to emigrate to Israel. The Yampolsky brothers have repeatedly applied for visas since 1973. and they have repeatedly been refused even though they have never been given a valid reason for the refusals. Arkady who is an economist by trade is unemployed now because he found it impossible to work at his job after applying for permission to emigrate. This oppression is obviously retaliation by the Russian authorities as a result of the Yampolskys request to emigrate. My colleagues and I want to make known to the Soviet Union and to the rest of the world that we strongly oppose oppression of this nature. As Representatives in a nation which is dedicated to the principle of freedom to pursue life. liberty. and happiness. we hope that our opposition will be noted and will lend impetus to a change of philosophy on the part of the Soviets toward those wishing to begin life anew in another land. I encourage every Member of Congress to express his concern by participating in this vigil.",

I have nothing but admiration for the Senator from Alaska for pursuing this with vigor. My point Is simply this: We have just entered into a treaty with the Republic of Panama. Obviously. the message from the President of the United States relative to that indicates that a joint study is what we may do some day. and that both parties commit themselves to this joint study. It just seems to me that that is exactly what we ought to do. I mean the countries are going to be negotiating over the existing treaty. and the Congress of the United States ought to at some point in time and if the Senator from Alaska is right that it is urgent. then obviously what I am suggesting is going to happen quickly. and that is that the two countries come together with reference to this study and how it would be run and by whom and who would share in its cost. and the like. In one sense we could be delaying things. I do not want to make a big issue out of it. There are some Panamanians supposed to be on this commission the way it is set up. But it is not an official bilateral one. meaning the two countries getting together and saying \"the time has come to study this. let us do it together. Let us agree on the kind of experts.\" It just seems to me that is the way we ought to go. and not merely say. \"We should decide that here at this point in time.\" when it is so obvious that the ultimate success. conclusion. what facts we derive from the studies. how believable they are. are going to depend totally on the good spirit existing between the two countries ab initio. from the very beginning of the evaluation to carry out the purposes of decisionmaking provided for on page 20. article XII. as I heretofore read.

I understand just as well as the Senator that utility rates are too high and that the homeowner has been burdened with them.

The people in the intrastate market have not been regulated. They responded to the demand and met the needs. The people in the intrastate markets in the gas producing States are paying more for gas now than in the nonproducing States because they are willing to pay to get the supply. But my question is. we deregulated the market last winter to meet the emergency. what did it cost us to get it? Less than 10 percent of the price to get the added gas. California gave it up. Texas gave it up. Louisiana gave it up. Oklahoma gave it up. All gas producing States gave it up to meet the need and they paid less than the intrastate market has been paying.",

Yesterday. we were advised. some of us. that there need be no problem. that PearsonBentsen was not going to pass. or one report was that there were four votes that had changed for the compromise. and then there was another report that three votes had changed for the compromise. The facts. indeed. are that the opinion is that there will be no votes that will have changed with respect to PearsonBentsen. Now. we received some criticism for keepihg the Senate in session to talk about a large number of amendments. some of which were called dilatory. but we did so for the purpose of letting the world and the country know what the economic impact of this legislation is and will be. It will be the most significant piece of economic legislation considered by the Senate this session and maybe for many sessions to come. It will add 180.000 to 360.000 unemployed persons to the unemployment rolls of this country. It will add $10 billion to the costs of the consumers which will go directly into the pockets of the oil and gas companies of this country. It will mean the average residential homeowner will probably pay something about 50 percent more than he is presently paying. and the present burden is an intolerable one.",

Our whole debate right now. if Members can look at appendix B5 in the report on this bill. is whether or not the defense expenditure will be 23.7 percent of our overall expenditures. or the Carter number of 24.4 percent.

They cut that R. & D. item $750 million. and I think that was about 7 or 8 percent of the overall R. & D. amount. The gentleman made some very substantial impressions there. and that was his general imprint. He will go to conference. and that number will probably be massaged. I recognize that he did recognize that he wanted to spend some more money in procurement. but believe me. when we were deliberating in the R. & D. Committeeand I am the ranking memberthe gentleman will recall that we did not balance the research numbers with the increased procurement numbers. We were looking at research as a microcosm. and it just so happened that in our overall number in the committee. we decided to put some more money into procurement. I would say this: If we choose to accept the recommendations of all of the committees instead of the Committee on the Budget. we will have a deficit of $82 billion or $85 billion. The committee budget number. which is in large part a reestimate of where President Carter was. is $66 billion. I think we have to show some fiscal responsibility. I think that this budget program is. in fact. a new process. but believe me. we can kill it. We can kill it by too much effort made on the target resolution. I believe that many of us here who are supporting the targets in this current budget resolution also supported the House Armed Services Committee bill when it came on the floor here a few weeks ago. If one looks at some of the numbers that are reduced in other functions. and the statement has been made that perhaps we have not decreased other functions as much as national defense. on page 14 of our report we show $3 billion reduced in budget authority for national defense. But. $750 million is reduced out of international affairs.

As a result. the numbers in defense are not totally out of proportion with reductions effected in other areas. If the Members look at our report. also. they will find that in the area that the House Armed Services Committee is concerned with. in the original number that we submitted. we increased the budget authority by $500 million. In personnel and compensation. we reduced the number by $750 million. in large part because normally 15 percent of our increase in wages is usually absorbed by the Department. particularly in national defense. And in the reestimate submitted by the Department of Defense. last week they have indicated that there is a reduced need in both salaries and retirement of some $500 million. So we are tracking fairly closely up to that point. In inflation. we note that a $500 million inflation. onehalf million dollars in the operation of maintenance accounts. was perhaps enough. We want to hold the Defense nose to the millstone and not have them dump logistics supplies overboard that are coming back into port merely to keep an overall budget number. There is one more item. In the level of purchases. we reduced that item by $1 billion. and that was the item which was objected to by the House Armed Services Committee when we were here before. But when the committee went back into session and reviewed this item. we put back that $1 billion. So. in fact. in the area where the House Armed Services Committee is concerned. we not only put back the $1 billion in purchases that we took out. but we have added $500 million for additional budget authority. for additional purchases above and beyond the budget that was submitted to the committee. In financial adjustments. we took out $1 billion. namely. because we have this $72 billion backlog in unexpended and unobligated balance. We think that is a reasonable amount. As a result. the item we have on the $200 million reduction in strategic supplies. the gentleman from Missouri well knows that that $200 million reduction will not occur unless the Armed Services Committee makes a recommendation to make that sale of strategic stockpile.

I did it on the basis that during the earlier part of last years election I had some small part in raising funds for a candidate of my choice. In doing so. I. quite frankly. got on the telephone and called many of my friends across the State and said. \"Look. how about coming to a little $1.000 dinner were having?\" The $1.000 dinner. at $1.000 for a dinner. is pretty shocking to anybody. Then I said. \"Really its a contribution to our candidate and youre going to be able to give just as much as anyone else. therefore. youre contribution will be as meaningful.\" We know in the years past. in a Presidential campaign. a $1.000 contribution would not have been very meaningful in light of some of the very large contributions that have been made. So I think my argument prevailed pretty well. We had a very successful dinner. So I was boosting. in fact. that the campaign finance law was working. more people were contributing to the Presidential campaign. But the thing that is causing me to reflect on my judgment is that after that. after the conventions. I think both parties were just beginning to pass the word that we do not give to the candidate any more. just to the national committee. Then the big givers began the $5.000. $10.000. $15.000. $20.000. to the national committee. I wonder if the Senator agrees that. basically. when we are giving to a national committee in a Presidential year. we are basically giving to the Presidential candidate. does the Senator agree with me?",

There are some rules of attribution so far as spending by the national committees is concerned. You cannot give $20.000 to the national committee and the national committee cannot then go out and spend directly $20.000 on the Presidential campaign. That. in theoryI say in theoryis a violation of the law. What did happen was that under the case of Buckley and McCarthy against Valeo. the Court very clearly said that money cannot be spent independently outside of public funds. You cannot stop an individual or an organization from spending money independently. So. in the last election. in addition to the roughly $22 million that each candidatePresident Ford and President Carterreceived in public funds. organized labor was able to spend between $11.5 and $12 million that was accounted for. It does not count a fair amount of \"in kind\" contributions that were not accounted for. They were able to spend between $11.5 million and $12 million independently. almost all of it on the Democratic ticket. I am not saying that this happened simply because they were supporting the Democrats. It is just that labor has a better experience and a longer understanding with respect to independent expenditures. I will tell the Senator what is going to happen in public financing. Labor. the National Rifle Association. the Right to Life Association. the American Automobile Association. any group with great numbers of members. is going to learn that their interests would be well protected. and they will simply spend their money \"independently.\" Trying to prove coordination or conspiracy between an independent group and a candidate would be very difficult. So the big money is not stopped by public financing of commissions. It is transferred to other groups of which the candidate may not have control. but it can be spent on that candidates behalf.",

They will say that the bill does nothing to cut special interest money. and then will offer a substitute bill. as I understand it. to provide tax credits. which does nothing to cut special interest money.

The CBO figures say there is going to be 90 percent participation by farmers setting aside 50 percent of their wheat production. I do not accept that. But you have to use that low figure to make the costs so bad. The costs. based on CBO estimates. is about $6 billion. You passed that out to the public and the press. who wrote editorials about it. The USDA has now released some new figures on the cost production for selected crops. The range for production cost on wheat is $3.66 to $3.92 a bushel. The range on cotton is up to 66 cents a pound.

I SUpported flexible parity because I wanted to give the conferees wide latitude in their efforts to make a workable emergency farm bill. I am deeply worried about this bills implications for feed supplies and for our export markets. In my home State of North Carolina. we have strong poultry. pork. and dairy industries. These farmers must have adequate supplies of feed. On the other hand. we have price depressing surpluses. Flexible parity gives the individual farmer the opportunity to decide how much land to setaside in return for a payment level that is sufficient for his operation. I believe that flexible parity will help reduce supplies. I can only hope that this will happen without damage to our feed supplies or to our export markets. There is little question that our Nations farmers are in serious financial straights and that something must be done to reverse this situation. If not. agriculture will suffer. And since agriculture is the backbone of this great Nation. our Nation will suffer. While I am troubled in the conference report. I must have confidence in the judgment and experience of the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry. Senator TALMADGE. Mr. President. we must also remember one other point of deepest concern. the rising age of American farmers. As we know. the average farmer today in this great country is 53 years old. We must do something to attract the young and able to enter farming and take on the risks of weather and pests. Clearly. our current farm programs do not provide adequate inducement for the young to take up this risky enterprise. We have heard. that the President will veto this measure. This troubles me greatly. but Isee no program that offers the necessary movement forward. If the President vetoes this bill. I hope that he is ready to bring up a program in its place.",

When I came here I was appalled at the very wasteful methods the Senate used in spending taxpayers dollars. I had come from being Governor of a State where we had a requirement that we have a balanced budget. It was hard to believe how careless we were here in the way we spent the billions of dollars at our disposal. Since I have been here we have added another $350 or $400 billion to the national deficit and. partially due to the action of this body. we have seen inflation rise to the doubledigit level. and this kind of activity hurts everyone in the country. farmers as well as consumers. country people as well as city people The one hopeful sign that has developed during these years has been the development of the budget process. It is the only effective means. as has been brought out. that might some day bring our Federal spending processes into line and cause us to be more responsible in the way we spend our taxpayers money. The process has worked fairly well. whether it has been dealing with welfare. defense. housing. or any other function. But this is the first time it has been frontally attacked and threatened by a motion to suspend the budget process and. in effect. put the law into abeyance. I would strongly oppose this new development. It will refuse the opportunity for us to give careful consideration to the full impact of this bill. and it will cause. I think. a return to the old free spending days of the past. As many in the Chamber know. the authorizing committees have made recommendations this year that would result in a budget deficit not of $60.6 billion. as the President recommends. but more like $80 billion or $90 billion. If we allow the authorizing committees to bring this legislation without budget consideration. it is going to get us into an even worse inflation and worse budget position than we have been in.

Jim Range of Senator BAKERS staff. and Bill Stringer and Bob Boyd of the Budget Committee staff be granted privileges of the floor during the consideration of this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I intend to vote against the conference report on H.R. 6782. which I regard as an inflationary. expensive and possibly even unnecessary measure. I do so with mixed feelings. for I have listened to the farmers who have visited here since the start of this year and I can sympathize with their frustration and concern for the future. Although New Hampshire is not now a primarily agricultural State. farming and agriculture run deep in the roots of the history of my State and of the heritage of its residents. Nevertheless. I cannot in good conscience vote for a measure as irresponsible and potentially dangerous as this one. This bill. if enacted into law. could add nearly $6 billion to the Federal budget. not to speak of its impact on the food budgets of working people. It would further accelerate food price inflation. which is already moving ahead at twice the rate of the rest of the economy. to doubledigit levels. With the planting season almost upon us. this bill also opens the door to considerable confusion among farmers trying to decide what and how much to plant this year. Significantly reduced production this year could also lead the way to food shortages and severe price inflation in future years in the event of a drought or bad weather of the sort that we have experienced more and more often in recent years. Finally. recent agricultural data supports the administrations contention that last years farm bill is working. Farm income is up and has increased during each of the past 6 months. Let us give these programs time to work instead of rushing in to spend billions of dollars which may not be needed. This is a wellintentioned bill but. nevertheless. a bad one. I am going to vote against it and. if it is approved by both chambers of Congress. I will urge President Carter to veto it.@",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senate should approve the conference report for the following reasons: First. economic: Farmers need a shot in the arm. Despite the fact that prices have gone up a little in the last few months. farm income is down a third since 1973. No other segment of the economy has had to undergo such duress. When income to farmers is increased. the multiplier effect is felt throughout the country like no other economic stimulus. In Montana there are about 25.000 farms. Assuming four people per farm. there are 100.000 people who make their living directly from farms. In Montana. at a rough estimate. another three to four jobs depend directly on the farmer. That is another 75.000 to 100.000 jobs. and at four people per family. another 300.000 to 400.000 people dependent on farm income. In the United States there are some 2.75 million farms. If the same statistics hold true for the rest of the country. there are some 40plus million people who depend directly or indirectly on farms in this country. That is a lot of people who would get a big boost in income from a relatively small investment. Second. equity: In 1973 farmers received a record $30 billion for their products. This year it will be in the neighborhood of $20 billion. In 1973. for the first time in many years. farmers began to get their heads above water and were able to start reinvesting in equipment and land. No longer are these opportunities available. People in rural areas deserve a reasonable standard of living. too. This is a 1year program. It is not perfect. It can be amended next year. But it is needed now. for this year. if it is to do any good.0",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senate has the opportunity today to offer needed incentives for our agricultural sector. When we considered the 1977 farm legislation. I felt that we did not provide ample stimuli for that sector of our economy which feeds and clothes the people of this Nation and much of the world. In my view. this is one of the many reasons why we are considering emergency legislation at this time. During both Senate and House consideration of Public Law 95113. there were pressures from all sides and at many levels being applied to thwart the desire of the Congress to provide financial stability for our producers of agricultural commodities. As we consider the conference report on H.R. 6782. once again we are plagued by these same pressures. I commend my colleagues in the Senate for their tenacity in designing comprehensive emergency legislation which will furnish farmers throughout this country with the means to continue meeting the needs of our people. The flexible parity concept embodied in this legislation represents an embarkation on a new course for agricultural policy. one which may result in forming the foundation for agricultural legislation in the future. Mr. President. in my view. we have admirably responded to the needs of our Nations most basic industry. We are on the brink of providing management tools for agricultural producers which they have heretofore not had. but which they have sorely needed. It is my hope that this legislation will not only yield assistance during this year. but that it will strengthen the agricultural sector. and in turn. all other segments of our economy. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to the legislation which is now under consideration. It is also my hope that serious consideration will be given to designing a longrange agricultural policy which will eliminate the need for emergency legislation on this sort in the future. Agriculture has a tremendous influence on the economic. social. and political affluence of America and the world. The fate of this legislation will be significant in determining whether we have an adequate supply of food and fiber. and whether adequate resources will be available to produce these needs in the years ahead. Whether or not agricultural producers achieve progress and prosperity with efficiency and equity depends on decisions we make today.@",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. there are some necessary questions that we have to ask on this measure. I wish to emphasize that I am disturbed over what I consider the pattern of unilateral concessions to Communist governments by the Carter administration. The Members will remember that the administration handed over the Crown of St. Stephen to the Hungarian Communist Government. This was a great public relations victory for the Red regime. I have yet to be advised of what the U.S. Government obtained in return from the Hungarians. Their voting record at the U.N. and other international meetings is always with the Communist bloc. and they show no streak of the foreign policy independence that occasionally is exhibited by Yugoslavia and Romania. In this case we are giving them mostfavorednation trade status. I am bothered by this development. I predict that the administration will soon move to provide mostfavorednation status to all Communist governments. making that designation useless as applied to Communist dictatorships. Presumably this move will facilitate trade between our two countries. Basically. this means Hungarian products will be able to penetrate the American market. but will American products have equal access to the Hungarian market? Or are the Hungarians just interested in American capital and technology since under a Communist economic structure. consumer goods are at the bottom of the list of priorities. They will be interested in equipment for staterun purposes. not consumer products that will help lift the standard of living of their people. Therefore. reflecting all these doubts and reaffirming my strong belief that the unilateral return of the Crown of St. Stephen was a blundering diplomatic act on the part of the administration. I will oppose this resolution this afternoon. Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the intricacies of foreign trade. In this particular case I do not believe the Committee on Ways and Means has exercised the most prudent approach. I repeat. that one of the reasons for justifying mostfavorednation status to Romania and Yugoslavia is that those countries have shown a degree of independence in international bodies. The same cannot be said to be true of Hungary. I question what I consider to be a unilateral consession to the Hungarian Government. Therefore. I rise in opposition to the resolution.",

I did feel some question as to my own position when the Cardinal of Hungary received it with such pleasure and when. indeed. the entire church hierarchy approved its transfer. Therefore. it is not that I am committed unalterably to whatever a Communist regime might want. but I think we have to recognize that one of the best features of the Helsinki Accord. the Fnal Act. was that it draws together all the nations of Europe. It does. to some extent. by its very nature. detach those eastern European satellites from the Soviet Union. Mr. Chairman. I think the Poviet Union itself recognizes that that is a great danger. Every single one of those satellite states is evolving differently. one is reasserting its independence in its foreign policy. but is extremely strong in its centralized control of people at home.

Korean influence peddling. and behindthescenes wheeling and dealing. Respect for and trust in government have dropped to a record low level. I am pleased to take this giant step toward restoration of that trustand I call on my colleagues to continue this reform momentum and join me in closing all loopholes in our ethics rules and opening all doors to government.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. thank you for the opportunity to address this body on the question of the ethics code which we are considering today. I have always believed that public officials should be open to absolute scrutiny. That is why I voluntarily made a financial disclosure statement last year and cosponsored H.R. 1. the Financial Disclosure Act. this year. In order to avoid conflicts of interest or even the suspicion of impropriety. public confidence in legislative institutions dictates the necessity for full financial disclosure. I believe the disclosure requirements in the ethics resolution today are fair and just and I urge my fellow Members to support this provision. The limit of 15 percent of a Members salary on outside earned income is another measure which I support. Being a Member of Congress is a fulltime job and while I had urged in testimony before the Obey Commission that all outside earned income be eliminated. the 15percent limit is a reasonable and fair compromise. Even if there is no misconduct. such sources of income can give the appearance of impropriety and thus further undermine public trust and confidence in the Government. . The elimination of lame duck travel for defeated and retiring Members is long overdue and I support it wholeheartedly. In addition. I would urge that Members should be required to submit detailed reports on all official travel. The limitation of gifts. aggregating $100 or more in any calendar year. is another provision which receives my unqualified support. Conflicts of interest can arise from the acceptance of. gifts and this $100 limitation would reduce the potential for such conflicts. In my own case. I have made it an office policy not to accept anything over $5 in value. Mr. Chairman. we still have a long. way to go in restoring public trust in this institution. By adopting this ethics legislation though. we are taking an important step in the right direction. and I earnestly hope that the House approves this measure.",

As with other reforming legislation to come out of Congress since the socalled Hays scandal. this resolution. in great part. was formulated on insufficient and nconclusive information. and at substantial expense to the taxnayer. The Commission on Administrative Review. established last year. has conducted a series of inquiries into the administrative operation of the House of Renresentatives. In its review of the financial ethics of the House. the Commission recommended proposals dealings with financial disclosure. outside income. gifts. unofficial office accounts. franking privileges. and -travel. These proposals are enbodied in House Resolution 287. While I support the objectives of House Resolution 287. dealing with financial disclosure. gifts. and travel. I question the fairness of limiting outside earned income when no limits are proposed on investment income. I am unalterably opposed to increasing the official expense allowance in apparent return for encouraging certain Members to vote to abolish socalled unofficial office accounts.",

This should be ample to meet the legitimate needs for which the account was intended The unique parliamentary situation prevents voting against the $5.000 increase without also voting against provisions which would abolish socalled office slush funds and which would prevent the conversion of campaign funds to personal use. Although I am totally opposed to the office slush funds and the conversion of campaign funds to personal use. I will vote to strike title III because I strongly oppose the $5.000 increase.

I have been somewhat amazed by some of the comments I have heard. To hear some of the Members speak. you would think the Commission has called for Members of Congress to take vows of poverty. I would point out to my colleagues that with the pay increase granted last monthgranted. incidentally. over the objection of myself and numerous other MembersMembers of Congress now are in the top half of the top 1 percent of all income earners in this country. Imagine that: The pay of Representatives is higher than that made by over 99 percent of the people of this country! And when I speak of the pay of Members of Congress placing them in this income bracket. I am referring only to the pay given to us from the U.S. Treasurynot any of the other income Members earn from other businesses. Thus I cannot view the Obey Commission proposal of limiting outside income to 15 percent of our salary as being a drastic or uncalledfor measure. In fact. I regret that the Commission did not go further and imoose a limit on income from investments also. I do. however. intend to vote for the Commission recommendations. because I view them as an important first step in establishing an ethical code for the House that will help begin to restore public trust in this body. Particularly with the pay increase granted last month. and the tactics used to put it into effect without a vote of this body. action to establish an ethical code now is essential. Thus I support the Obey Commission reforms. I look forward to action in the future to broaden and strengthen them. and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for them.",

I rise in support of House Resolution 287 to greatly strengthen the code of ethics of the House of Representatives. and I urge all my colleagues to join me in passing this most important reform measure. With adoption of the reforms contained in this resolution. I believe we will be taking a major step forward in a highly desirable. but muchneglected. direction. The proposals contained in House Resolution 287 are long overdue. and they must be approved if Congress is to demonstrate to the American people that it is truly serious about ethics reform and making the House even more accountable to the citizens of this country. Only this demonstration will begin the process of restoring Congress credibility in the eyes of the people. Mr. Chairman. This faith in the institutions of American democracy must be reestablished for our Nation and its system of government to remain strong and viable. The public trust granted to every Member of Congress requires adherence to the highest standards of official conduct. and the proposals contained in this measure before us will help set those necessary standards. I strongly support the major proposals in House Resolution 287 which would severely limit outside income which could be earned by any Member of Congress and which would require extensive public disclosure of any Members financial holdings and interests. These provisions would minimize the potential for any conflicts of interest on the part of any Member between his public responsibilities and his private concerns. They also would serve to underscore the basic principle that. in this day and age. representing the people is a fulltime job. Congresspersons should devote their full efforts to this and not divert their attention to private financial interests. They also should deliberate the issues and decide how to vote on the measures before Congress free from any conscious or unconscious thoughts of personal gain. I also might add. that in light of the recent pay raise to Members of Congress. there is even less reason than before for any of our colleagues to seek an outside source of income. Mr. Chairman. the resolution before us resulted from more than 7 months of hard work bv a panel of seven of our colleagues and seven distinguihed private citizens.

Mr. Chairman. the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee that deals with considering research and development in the Committee on Science and Technology is absolutely correct. that there should be some additional money for various research problems that had not been fully anticipated at an earlier date. Of course. this bill waives points of order in order that the gentlemans committee may complete their authorization bill. Mr. Chairman. there is one matter that was not considered prior to the establishment of this figure. This matter came before us in connection with the Clean Air Act amendments. At that time. as you may recall. some of my colleagues were pointing out the difficulty in the Houston area. which is not unique amongst coastal areas of a situation that exists where chemical manufacturing occurs on the seacoast. That is the question of oxidants. Some of my colleagues wanted to strike or to exempt from the bill the requirement that certain oxidant levels be met at a given period of time. We compromised that by somewhat relaxing the period of time in which oxidant levels could be met. but we do not know much about oxidants. We do know that certain substances entering the air. like aerosols and fine particulate matter. react with certain natural releases into the air and with moisture to cause a certain type of pollution called oxidants. Now. we very much need a study in the gulf coast area of this difficult question. Senator BENTSEN -offered an amendment which was accepted by the committee and the Senate to increase the appropriation by $5 million in order to meet that question. The expenditure that the gentleman from California is calling for will ultimately be a saving. because it will permit us to know with greater exactitude what the levels of various pollutants may reasonably be in areas like my district. Now. this is not a very large increase in the appropriation. I think one must recognize that Mr. BROWNs subcommittee is doing careful and diligent work in this field. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I believe that this amendment can be referred to as the \"stable family amendment.\" This amendment addresses a situation created by the promulgation of regulations by HUD which sought to define eligible family groups for assisted housing. The amendment would nullify the Department of Housing and Urban Developments attempt to establish a Federal definition of the conditions under which two or more persons shall be eligible for admission to public housing as a family. In 1959 Congress committed determination of the eligibility of two or more persons for admission to public housing units operated by local housing authorities to the discretion of local housing authorities. As I understand it. the Department wished to make accommodations for unmarried couples who. in the determination of the local housing authorities. evidenced a socalled stable family relationship. HUD has found that many such couples. who might not necessarily be considered commonlaw man and wife for a number of reasons. can create a family situation for children. It would be wrong to deny public housing to such couples. Unfortunately. since promulgation. these regulations have given rise to other interpretations of \"stable family relationships.\" namely homosexual couples. This development was not contemplated by the Department and poses an issue whichit is unprepared to deal with at this time. It is my understanding that the Department would like to reconsider these regulations for that reason. The committee can accept this approach. The issues of homosexual marriage and rights are issues just too emotional and sensitive to be thrust upon local public housing authorities without proper consideration by HUD. I believe the Department ought to have an opportunity to reconSider those regulations and I urge passage of the amendment. In effect. the amendment would restore the situation with respect to the conditions under which two or more persons shall be eligible for admission to public housing to the situation which prevailed immediately before the effective date of the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development published on May 9. 1977. So. Mr. Chairman. I urge support of the amendment.",

Conservatives in government are subjected to minute scrutiny on every detail of their lives. public or private. Favorable comment on any contribution to government is usually ruled out. Any action or incident which may be twisted to provide an adverse reaction is capitalized. A different standard is applied to liberals in government. The Bert Lance affair is just another example. Bert Lance is one of the ablest of the Carter appointments. He is obviously highly qualified for the important position of Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He was a successful businessman. He followed business practices which did not originate with him nor did they apply only to him. No one established that he broke any laws. His banking practices were not commendable. On those practices. a carefully manipulated case against him was built. Mr. Lance is a conservative. Government is now predominately liberal and there is a need for conservative voices. A conservative influence is particularly needed in budget affairs. For the sin of being conservative as much as for loose banking practices. Mr. Lance was forced to go. Had he been an avid liberal. the chances are there would have been no further inquiries into his affairs after he was approved by the Senate. There is another aspect. Disclosure and all the rest have as one effect to drive successful businessmen out of office. They simply will not put up with the harassment of having to explain every business transaction they or their families engage in. When the advocates of free enterprise are no longer willing to make the sacrifices so often required during public service. free enterprise in the American system will definitely be on skids. if indeed it is not already on skids.",

Paul VI took his message to such diverse points as Latin America. the Philippines. the Holy Land. India. Portugal. Turkey. Columbia. Switzerland. Uganda. the Far East. and the United States. His commitment to humanity was worldwide. and nothing better demonstrated this commitment than his desire to bring his message personally to so many millions of people. Pope Paul also did much to promote interreligious cooperation and harmony. He met with leaders of Protestant and Orthodox faiths. and generally tried to further the spirit of ecumenical cooperation. The world now awaits the election of a new Pope. But whomever it is. the new Pope will benefit greatly from the work of Paul VI. Pope Paul presided over a difficult period in the history of the church and of the world. It is a tribute to his work that he accomplished so much during so turbulent a time. People everywhere shall miss his kind and gentle work on behalf of all mankind.*",

As a result of the discussion. it has been made amply clear that human rights is indeed \"old hat\" for captive nations ideology. Not only this. in advancing the ideology. there is a wholesome pressure on the advocates of human rights to expand their advocacy to the third and broadest sphere of human rights. namely national rights.

This is a reform that is long overdue. Further. this legislation would extend the life of the Appalachian and Title V Commissions through 1985. and reestablish the Title V Commissions as independent of the Department of Commerce. In 1965 Congress demonstrated its support of regional commissions by enacting the Appalachian Regional Development Act. Subsequently. Congress also enacted title V within the Public Works and Economic Development Act which created other regional commissions outside of the Appalachian Regional Commission. These acts have highlighted the Federal Governments increased recognition that Federal programs affecting State and local areas must display greater sensitivity to regional. State and local needs. The Title V Commissions and their counterpart. the Appalachian Regional Commission. were established through the voluntary support of the participating States. The Commissions. such as the Upper Great Lakes Regional Commission. are planning commissions that provide technical and supplemental grant assistance for regional development and represent State and local concerns at the Federal level. The Upper Great Lakes Regional Commission. for example. has been a particularly effective agency to my constituents in Northern Michigan. To date. nine commissions have been established. including the Appalachian Regional Commission under a separate act. Because of the success of these ex-",

On August 31 Judge Lucero will be honored at a dinner by the womans alliance. This multiethnic organization was created to help lowincome minority women. especially those victims of domestic violence. They believe. as I do. that Judge Lucero brought to the superior court bench a fresh sensitivity to the problems women have. especially in the area of family law. Judge Lucero began his career in the Santa Clara County Public Defenders Office. During his 13 years in that organization he held many of the top positions. He was the supervising attorney. juvenile court division and later the senior felony trial attorney. He was eventually made assistant public defender in 1972. In November 1976. Judge Lucero was appointed to the superior court bench in Santa Clara County. Since his appointment. Judge Lucero has served as the supervising judge in family court. In this capacity he has worked with the bar association. other members of the bench and various community groups to improve the administration of justice in the critical field of family law. He is now also a member of the executive committee of the superior court. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and my colleagues to join with me and many of the fellow Santa Clara County residents in thanking Judge Lucero for the great contribution he has made to the administration of justice.

I urge my colleagues to obtain a copy of the report and read the account of how European nations are accelerating their nuclear power development while the United States pauses to question commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing. Of particular interest to me is Mr. WYDLERS recommendation dealing with the Barnwell nuclear fuel plant in my district in South Carolina. He recommends: The United States should reinstate the plan to reprocess light water reactor fuel at the Barnwell Nuclear Fuel Plant under modern safeguards. This country should develop a comprehensive plan for nuclear waste management. civilian and military. which recognizes that fact that nuclear reprocessing cannot be indefinitely deferred. In the reports summary of findings is the statement: Our present policy on the breeder and reprocessing ignores the advances which have been made in safeguards technology as well as the chief mechanism for implementing these safeguards. namely. the International Atomic Energy Agency. Finally. Mr. WYDLERs report on his discussions with officials of the IAEA should cause us all to be concerned about the administrations nuclear policy when he notes \"* * * the world is developing a mistrust of American reliability because of our shifts in Atomic policy. Ironically. this policy causes more countries to get into the reprocessing an enrichment field. leading to more. not less nuclear proliferation.\"",

I first introduced this bill on February 2. 1978. in response to a great concern voiced by one of my constituents. Basically. the Good Samaritan Act encourages onthescene emergency medical care aboard aircraft by relieving physicians. registered nurses. and aircraft employees from civil liability for damages resulting from any act or omission in rendering such care. This bill will provide the necessary legal protection for the aforementioned people. so that they will be encouraged to assist airline passengers who exrerience medical problems during a flight. The inspiration for this legislation is Dr. Melvin Reinhart of Ann Arbor. Mich. Several years ago. Dr. Reinhart was on an airline flight on which another passenger suffered a heart attack. He was very disturbed that basic medical equipment was not available to him and the other doctors on board. to assist the stewardess in caring for the heart patient. The doctor promptly began efforts to require airlines to carry basic medical supplies on their planes. Through contacts with the Federal Aviation Administration. it was learned that such equipment was not available on the airlines because their stewardesses and pilots. and doctors and nurses who were on board. could be held personally and legally liable in suits growing out of the emergency care. Thus. we now have the vehicle to protect these people in this legislation. The Air Line Pilots Association and the Flight Attendants Associationthose people who will be affected by this legislationhave strongly endorsed the bill. and are actively working for its passage. I urge all of my colleagues to look favorably on this legislation as I intend to keep up my efforts to enact this bill.*",

I do not consider myself a movie critic. but the only thing this movie accomplishes is insulting ones intelligence.

That was our experience some 4. 5. and 6 years ago. causing the Congress in the main to institute forward funding in order to remove public broadcasting from the annual yeartoyear type of political pressures and influence. Let me point out another mechanical aspect of the Federal funding. Public broadcasting is required to raise. under present lawwe have a change in the law in our Senate bill to $2.25-$2.50 for every $1 of Federal funds. A public broadcasting stationwondering. how much it must raise to matchhas a pretty good idea what its budget is going to be by the endeavor it puts out to solicit and bring in private contributions. The fiscal year 1981 appropriation will be contained in the fiscal year 1979 LaborHEW appropriation bill. which we have yet to pass. So the public broadcasters do not know to this minute what is going to be in that target here. That will have to be done this year. 1978. This amount will only be for matching activity. the Treasury obviously will not disburse the funds until the beginning of Let me emphasize that we are at this minute under 2year authorizations.

In fiscal year 1980 the CPB will audit the reports. and certify that aggregate amount to the Treasury. Then at the beginning of 1981. the proper level of Federal funds is disbursed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

This bill would now authorize 3 years. and we think this is orderly procedure. There are many reasons. We did not choose the 3year period arbitrarily. There are several factors that led the committee to determine that the 3year authorization was the most desirable length of time. Under the reform concept involved in S. 2883. 3 years are needed for us to obtain the information on which to act and guide us in our congressional oversight. and not hurt it. Any shorter period would mean we would be acting without the information sought to be provided by S. 2883. The major objective of multiyear authorizations is always that of insulating public broadcasting against political influence. and giving it as much autonomy as possible. Since we have been talking with the distinguished leaders of the nations of Egypt and Israel about the difference between sovereignty and autonomy all day. we can borrow that word. We have afforded discussion within the committee in our hearings. and I want to note also that on the House side. they also agreed to the additional 3year authorization. As the Senator indicates. you can argue. you can talk about the oversight and elaborate more on the politics. but this 3 years is the general consensus and recommendation. It is not necessarily wholly in harmony with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting itself. because they would like to have a 5year authorization. but being on the Budget Committee. I try to cut back on the multiyear bills because there are too many uncontrollables now. I think the 3year authorization is a proper compromise authorization.

I suspect they have been counterproductive. by creating a chilling effect on broadcasting and even preventing local broadcasters from exploring controversial issues. But public noncommercial radio and TV is not the same as private commercial broadcasting. Since taxes are being used to support the public telecommunications system in our Nation. the public broadcast licensees have a duty to see that the programing they offer--especially the presentation of controversial public issuesis nonpartisan. balanced. and fair. Many local public broadcasters share my views on this matter. Recently I received a letter from the general manager of a public radio and TV facility in Idaho critical of the House bill. He said in part. and I quote: I do not feel it is appropriate for these stations to provide editorial comment. Our station has a policy that on controversial issues. we seek both sides of the issue and provide adequate time for the issue to be presented. Comment by responsible people representing the various viewpoints are welcome. However. the station does not take an official position on either side. For these reasons. Mr. President. I believe that any relaxation of the section 399 prohibition against editorializing by noncommercial public broadcasters must be resisted. I. for one. would oppose any future Federal funding for a public telecommunications system which could be exposed to the vagaries of politics and the pressures of partisanship. I strongly urge the Senate conferees. particularly the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Communications Subcommittee. to insist that the language of the House bill be stricken on this point and that the section 399 prohibition remain as provided in the Senate bill.

CLIFF and I began our Senate careers at about the same time. and we have often viewed issues from about the same angle. We share a special feeling of closeness. and that is true also of the relationship between his wonderful wife Martha. and my wife. Marge. Among many achievements In the Senate. CLIFF HANSEN has been particularly effective in the areas of energy and natural resources. He combined the realistic assessment that natural resources must be developed with a deep respect for the environment. Many Americans now can reap the benefits of his work. enjoying the national parks that his legislation created. while not feeling the sting of energy shortages. which he tried hard to prevent. Indeed. he was concerned about energy and the environment before they became popular issues. CLIFF HANsENs honesty and moral sense made him an effective voice in the Senate. Wellversed in the workings of our Government. his opinions have been highly valued by his colleagues here in the Senate. I have stood together wtih CLIFF HANsEN on many issues. and I have nothing but respect and admiration for this man. He is much more than a senatorial colleague to me. I will miss him very much in the years ahead. Mr. President. I am especially saddened that CLIFF HAiSEN is leaving the Senate. His service here has certainly made this country a better place. Marge and I wish CLIFF and Martha the very best in their new livesand the best is what they both deserve.0",

The people of Virginia. expressing these same concerns. elected BILL SCOTT in 1972 to be the first Republican sent to the U.S. Senate from Virginia. During his 6 years among us. BLLSCOTTS voice was often one of dissent. From his position on the Judiciary Committee. he fought difficult battles over matters of constitutional significance. While his viewpoint often did not prevail. his challenges forced careful examination of important issues and thus contributed to the development of prudent legislation. The presence of BILL SCOTT commanded that a responsible tack be taken. and this carried over into his work on the Armed Services Committee. where he was the concerned citizen on the committee. willing to challenge accepted standards and demand more efficiency from our defense dollars.

He has been a source of strength to meexemplifying how a minority Senator can effectively relate his viewpoint. Senator CURTIS consistently has fought for a smaller. more manageable and efficient Government. Every year since he was first elected in 1938. he has offered legislation calling for a balanced budget. As a ranking member on the Finance Committee. he became an expert on tax matters and he helped to save the taxpayers millions of dollars by his opposition to unsound programs. His work on the social security system and on the Individual Retirement Act. both regarded as the most significant legislation this body has provided concerning senior citizens. long will be remembered. It has been his great objectivity that brought CARL CURTIS back to Congress for more years than any other Nebraskan. And. during these years. he has been able to integrate the various aspects of major issues to come up with proposals that will best serve the people.

CARL CURTIS has given almost a half a century of his life in service to the people of Nebraska and the Nation. He served in the House of Representatives from 1938 to 1954. when he was then elected to the U.S. Senate. He has served continuously since that time as Nebraskas senior Senator. His long and distinguished career has centered upon his position as the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. Along with Chairman RUSSELL LONG. Senator CURTIS has played a major role in restructuring this Nations complex tax code. This past session the Finance Committee. under the cooperative leadership of Senator LoNo and CURTIS. completed action on two very important pieces of tax legislation. the energy tax bill and the tax cut bill. both of which are now public law. Senator CARL CURTIS has worked tirelessly to help all American taxpayers achieve equity under our tax system. Perhaps the most important finance bill to be enacted in over two decades. the Tax Reform Act of 1976 required over half a year to complete final action. Throughout its long legislative process. from committee hearings to floor debate to conference action. Senator CURTIS worked with untiring commitment and dedication. It came as no surprise then that CARL CURTIS Republican colleagues would recognize his outstanding capabilities and elect him as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. In my capacity as assistant minority leader. I have had the pleasure to work closely with my good friend on Republican leadership issues. He has served us all well and I thank him sincerely for his many contributions. Finally let me commend Mildred Curtis whose encouragement and support for her husband largely contributed to his political success. During many late evening sessions Mildred could be found watching her husband at work from her seat in the family gallery. Ann and I will miss CARL and Mildred dearly.

As a member of the Committee on Armed Services. he has been untiring in his efforts to do his part In providing this Nation with a firstrate military force. It Is appropriate that he should serve on these committees. because it is his firm conviction that two prerequisites of this Nations ability to preserve its freedom are a sound judiciary and a military force second to none.

Two years before I joined this honorable body. he firmly supported a major piece of legislation. providing a national clearing house to aid States and communities in planning. funding. and managing comprehensive drug programs. Drug abuse is one of the major scourges of our Nation. and Senator ABouREzKs untiring efforts to find a solution were extremely important. No discussion of Senator ASOUEZKS Senate activity. however. would be complete without noting his tireless commitment to the native American. As Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. his deep personal commitment to Indian problems and his understanding of the Indian people has contributed to his many successful efforts at producing legislation beneficial to the needs of our native American.

Senator CAsE set a pattern for himself in 1947 when he introduced NAACP antilynching legislation which became part of President Trumans program a year later. More recently. Senator CAs has emphasized that Congress must assert Its constitutional responsibility for participating in the development of national security policy. As the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator CAsE has worked diligently to restore the constitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches in the area of foreign policy. particularly in the matter of restraining United States transfer of arms to developing countries.

Among such contributions are his work in the areas of foreign affairs and the national economy. and he has also placed emphasis on education and on the need for more and better jobs for Americans. Senator BARTLETT most recently served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. the Select Committee on Indian Affairs. and the Select Committee on Small Business. I have personally worked with Senator BARTLETT on the Armed Services Committee and have admired his efforts and contributions on national defense issues. Senator BARTLETT recently authored a perceptive analysis of the Carter administrations attempt to negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty. He has also spent time in research and development in the areas of NATO and SALT. Prior to his being elected to the U.S. Senate. Senator BARTLETT was a partner in the Keener Oil Co. of Tulsa. That. coupled with the fact that he graduated in the field of geological engineering from the Princeton University. gave him a particular interest in legislation dealing with energy and natural resources and the energy crisis. Senator BARTLETT has also introduced legislation on prayer in schools. forced busing. and a bill to limit congressional spending. Senator BARTLETT has committed himself to paying attention to his task in the Senate instead of his own personal ambition. demonstrating remarkable dedication to his Senate duties.

I think only one Member of this body missed more meetings than I did. and he became a President. I just missed that myself. I can understand the concern of the majority leader when he looks around on Friday afternoon. and the check shows there are not many people here. and he assumes they are out making speeches. I can assure the leader that is not universally so. But I am very much concerned about the assumption this body has taken that somehow we can correct our moral image by limiting the income that may come to us from what I will say is an unlimited source of funds. from schools. conventions. and so forth around this country. that I think actually benefit by hearing from the conservative. the liberal. the Republican. the Democrat. and so forth and so on. But I get back to my original question. and I will not take any more time: When you can speak in the U.S. News & World Report to the end that probably every thinking or influential mind in the United States reads what you have to say. I think that is probably worth more money than any other medium you or I might use to get an idea across. and yet we get nothing for it. I am not complaining about that. The same goes on the Sunday talk shows that we have all been on. with exposure to from 3 to 7 million people that we could not get otherwise. This. in my opinion. constitutes a conflict of interest. and yet there is no stoping of that. The Senator was discussing an interesting point a moment ago: artists. I see in the Chamber my good friend HOWARD BAKER. He and I happen to be photographers. I make quite a bit of money every year selling my pictures. But I work on it Saturday and Sunday. I would hate to think that poor little darkroom of mine was suddenly filled with conflicts of interest.

One century ago today. the freedomloving people of Romania cast off the last vestiges of Ottoman Turk subjugation and declared their homeland a free and sovereign state. For the next six decades the Romanian people enjoyed a prosperous period of economic growth along with civil liberties and political selfdetermination. During this era they saw their country develop some of its great domestic wealth. such as oil. wheat. and timber. while simultaneously playing an important role in the international politics of Europe. Tragically. however. with the end of World War II came the dawn of a new dark age of terror and oppression for the people of Romania. Ironically. as czarist Russia had been instrumental in helping them achieve freedom 70 years earlier. It was now Communist Russia which fastened the new yoke upon Romania. and it was the cruelest one by farCommunist totalitarianism. The scenario was all too familiar to the countries of Eastern Europe at that time. First the Soviets demanded the formation of a new \"representative\" government including Communists at high levels. despite the virtual nonexistence of a Communist Party in Romania at the time. Next came the forced resignation of the king. and finally the complete domination of the government by the Communist Party. All accomplished under threat of military action by the Soviets. All facetiously perpetrated in the name of establishing a new peoples \"republic.\" Despite their tragic betrayal. the Romanian people today remain strong willed and determined to be free. Very slowly they are making headway against the flood of Communist control which has Inundated their native land. Increased control of the government by Romanians rather than the Soviets. insistence on more recognition of various aspects of their colorful culture. and increasing political. economic. and cultural contact with the West helps make the hope of true freedom in the future more a goal than a dream. Thus. on the 100th anniversary of their independence day. we extend to all Romanians and Americanborn Romanians our best wishes. and salute their valiant spirit.",

We opened our letter by sayingBecause the honor of the House is involved. we would like to have 100% cosponsorship of our resolution. As past House chairmen for the CFC drives in 1975 and 1976 respectively. Congressman FISHER and I have become painfully aware that. as we put it in our letterHouse participation and giving levels in CFC in past years have been abysmal if not scandalous. I recently asked the CFC to prepare for me a detailed comparative analysis of how congressional giving to CFC has stacked up against that of the Federal Government employees overall. and each branch individually. These statistics bear out our assessment of the disgraceful charitable giving performance of House and Senate employees. In 1975. only 9 percent of the House employees gave anything to the CFC drive while the overall participation rate for Federal employees in the Capital area was 77 percent. And while the average House contribution was $24.53. the average gift of all Federal employees was $35.96. In 1976. our performance was even poorer. mainly because the drive took place in the middle of the fall campaign. Only 5 percent of House employees gave in that year with an average gift of $23.76. The participation rate for all Federal Government employees was 75 percent In 1976. and the average gift was $37.93. We have no illusions that permitting employees to have their contributions deducted from their monthly paychecks will automatically boost House participation and giving levels. But at the same time. the evidence does seem clear that this system. in effect since 1961 in the executive branch. has been a factor In the vastly better performance of that branch which registered an 80 percent participation level last year and an average gift of $37.50. The CFC notes that while the average gift by cash or check was $18 in 1976. the average contribution through payroll deductions was $60. Mr. Speaker. I think these facts do",

These sections of the Immigration Act permit an illegitimate child to be brought into the United States by its mother or even by an unrelated stepmother with special preference immigration status. The child cannot. however. be brought in by its natural father. even when its mother has died or abandoned it. Similarly. an illegitimate child who is a U.S. citizen may bring its mother or stepmother into the United States. but not its father.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing today the MedicareMedicaid Administrative and Reimbursement Reform Act of 1977. Members will recognize this legislation as a bill developed and originally introduced by Senator TALMADGE of the Senate Finance Committee. The bill that has come to be so closely identified with him surely must be considered as one of the major proposals in the field of hospital reimbursement reform. As such. it was my feeling that this legislation should be available to Members of the House as we undertake our own deliberations on appropriate ways to deal with the alarming problem of increases in hospital costs and other health expenditures. Members are aware that this week the Health Subcommittees of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee are holding joint hearings on H.R. 6575. the administrations proposal for an approach to provide a transitional solution to this problem while more permanent reforms are under consideration. Clearly the Talmadge approach deservesand will receive--careful consideration as well. both as an alternative shortterm approach and as a model for a longer term solution. The MedicareMedicaid Administrative and Reimbursement Reform Act contains a number of other provisions beyond those relating to reform of medicare and medicaid hospital reimbursement practices. including an experimental program to payfor the closing and conversion of underutilized facilities. establishment of a closer tie between the payments of the financing programs and decisions by health service agencies. proposals to increase the assignment rate among physicians participating in medicare. provision of authority to the Federal Government to certify longterm care facilities participating in medicaid. and establishment of specific performance criteria for State medicaid agencies. among others. I am attaching a summary of the bill explaining these and other provisions in greater detail. Introduction of this measure. of course. does not represent endorsement of each and every provision contained in the bill. However. it clearly contains much of significance. The Talmadge bill can claim recognition as one of the major proposals to change our current health care financing programs introduced to date in the Congress. I am pleased to cosponsor its introduction In the House.",

Calif.. and director of the National Institute of Law and Economics. to comment on the proposed U.K. Tax Treaty and in particular on article 9(4). Professor Zeifman served as chief of staff and general counsel of the House Judiciary Committee. and as chief counsel of the Subcommittee on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce. He has also been a consultant to the State of Alaska on the taxation of multinational petroleum companies and conducted an investigation for that State of the application of the corporate income tax. He specifically notes that article 9(4) of the U.K. Treaty \"embodies a tax policy which is inconsistent with the unanimous findings and recommendations of the House Judiciary Committee.\" Further. he states that the support material prepared by both the Treasury and Department of Commerce \"totally ignores the fact that the House Judiciary Committee recommended that a separate accounting system of taxation based on an armslength standard be entirely prohibited for State tax purposes. This recommendation by the House Judiciary Committee was based on a unanimous finding that separate accounting was an arbitrary and unworkable method and was beyond the capacity of the States to enforce.\" Professor Zeifman points out that article 9(4) should have no effect in encouraging U.K. investment in the United States because under the laws of the United Kingdom. British corporations operating enterprises in the States of the United States are permitted a full credit against the U.K. tax for income taxes paid to the States as well as income taxes to the U.S. Government. I ask that Professor Zeifmans letter to me. an interview with Professor Zeifman in the publication TaxBACKTalk. and an analysis he prepared entitled \"The Taxation by California of the Income of MultiNational Corporations.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. both the proponents and opponents of the Church reservation have forcefully presented their views. At first I was inclined to vote against the Church reservation. but after deeper consideration of all the implications of article 9(4). I am convinced that the Church reservation deserves the support of every Member of the legislative branch of our great Federal system. It is true that the tax convention with the United Kingdom provides large British concessions for U.S.-owned firms who are heavily taxed in Britain. Obviously. article 9(4) banning the unitary method of taxation is a quid pro quo for the British concessions. It has been contended that the British may not be as generous if article 9(4) is deleted. Nonetheless. I believe they will make some concession to end what is universally recognized as a discriminatory tax treatment of American companies in the United Kingdom. Article 9(4). in my considered opinion. invokes an unwarranted intrusion on Federal and State taxing authority. The Constitution vests the power to tax in the two Houses of Congress. Also. the power of States to levy taxes is uncontestable. Only recently. the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Iowa corporate tax apportionment formula on the ground that the Federal Constitution requires such formula be reasonable in approximating income derived from the State and does not invalidate any formula which taxes income from outside the State. Now that the State authority has been confirmed by judicial opinion. this treaty seeks to curb that power by treaty negotiationnot by constitutional amendment and not by an act of Congress. I cannot support such unwarranted extension of the Executives power. and must vote for the Church reservation on article 9 (4).",

Press reports indicate that the American diplomat. Donald McHenry. will discuss methods for reducing border conflicts between Angola and neighboring Zaire. and also methods of transfer to majority rule in nearby Namibia. Direct communication of this type between the U.S. Government and the Marxist Government in Angola. which came to power following considerable civil strife in 1975. is unprecedented. It raises many questions about our overall policy strategy toward Angola. and toward all of Southern Africa. Unfortunately. this latest diplomatic move seems yet another isolated policy effort that bears no direct relationship to any clear administration strategy in the area. During the past several weeks. the United States has been engaged in transporting peacekeeping troops into neighboring Zaire. where Angolanbased Katangese rebels have incited death and destruction. Only 7 weeks ago. the Central Intelligence Agency. acting on instructions from a committee of the National Security Council. was quietly making inquiries on Capitol Hill about a plan to aid Angolan rebels still fighting against the Marxist regime governing the country. Is there a consistent. coherent strategy for Southern Africa into which all of these diverse policy plans fit? Or is it all part of a \"hitormiss\" approach that develops on a daytoday basis. in reaction to events in Africa?

    "speech": "Mr. President. the American Hispanic community faces a crushing array of problems. One of the most important of these is employment discrimination. President Carter has the opportunity to take a concrete step toward resolving his problema step which is important not only to the 11 million Hispanics in the United States but to all of us who are committed to equal opportunity. For many months there have been two vacancies on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I strongly urge the President to fill these positions without delay. and to nominate an Hispanic to one of these posts. The EEOC is crucial to the enforcement of civil rights laws respecting employment. Although serious administrative problems had nearly crippled the Commission. Chairwoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has instituted new procedures which are already bringing the EEOC back on track. In addition. reorganization plan No. 1 of 1978 will consolidate in the Commission several aspects of EEO enforcement for Federal employees. If the EEOC is to be truly effective. however. it must begin with equal opportunity in its own ranks. During recent hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committe. it came to my attention that the EEOC had given inadequate emphasis to the needs of the Hispanic community. Since that time. I know that Chairwoman Norton has made a conscientious effort to resolve this problem. In a recent speech before the national Hispanic organization IMAGE. Chairwoman Norton outlined the positive steps which are now underway at the EEOC. including a nationwide recruitment drive. She also announced that she would hold regular meetings with the national Hispanic leadership. These steps are very encouraging. and Chairwoman Norton should be commended for her efforts. But the best way to insure that the needs of the Hispanic community receive high priority on a continuing basis is to insure direct Hispanic representation at the highest policy levels within the EEOC. As Chairwoman Norton noted. the United States has grown accustomed to seeing problems in black and white. and it has been too easy to ignore the grinding problems of Spanishspeaking people. There has not been a Hispanic commissioner at the EEOC for nearly 3 years. With the result that the second largest minority group in the country has been denied the representation which it needs and deserves. The time for action is now. and I urge President Carter to nominate a Hispanic to the EEOC without delay.",

Since that time. there has been a major interagency study completed that confirmed my initial suspicions: paraquatcontaminated marihuana is coming into this country in alarmingly high volume. creating a serious risk of irreparable lung damage to regular users. Since Secretary Califanos appropriate warning in March of this year concerning the serious health risk of smoking paraquattainted marihuana. laboratories that test for contamination have sprung up all over the country and are inundated with marihuana samples from concerned and frightened users. Students are protesting U.S. involvement in the spraying operations. An alarming percentage of U.S. Armed Force personnel who use marihuana have cause for concern. Editorials urging a halt to the program have appeared in major newspapers across the country. The Michigan Legislature overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the U.S. support of the paraquat program. And numerous youths. whose usage habits vary. report shortness of breath. raw throats. and the coughing up of blood. Yet the U.S.-assisted spraying program for Mexican marihuana continues in full force virtually unaffected by the turmoil and concern evidenced here at home. Even though possession of marihuana is illegal. the facts of life are that an estimated 13 to 15 million Americans use it regularly. according to Government estimates. A recent University of Michigan study indicates that 1 out of every 11 high school seniors smokes marihuana daily. In view of the degree of risk involved. I firmly believe that the U.S. Government has not fulfilled its responsibility to stop the poisoning of our own citizens. especially young people.

    "speech": "Mr. President. several days ago I wrote to Mr. Gilbert Gude. director of the Congressional Research Service. requesting that CRS examine the international appropriate technology (AT) programs in the Federal Government. The purpose of this request is to determine the effectiveness of our present international AT programs. if they can be strengthened and their coordination improved. and in what ways domestic programs can be utilized in our international AT efforts. Historically. developed nations have sought to help developing ones by the direct transfer of highly sophisticated. capital intensive technology. For a number of reasons. however. this process is not always successful. Developed in response to other cultures needs and resources. these technologies often fail to address the most fundamental and pressing problems faced by the Third Worldsevere food shortages. contaminated water supplies. and lack of adequate housing. These problems are acute in urban and rural areas alike throughout the developing %orld. Appropriate technologies. defined as technologies developed. adapted or chosen to meet indigenous resources. technical skills and needs. can provide a solution to these problems. Nor are Third World nations unaware of the benefits of appropriate technology. Over the past two decades. many of these nations have established indigenous voluntary development programs. known as domestic development services. These programs mobilize students. technicians. and community members. to work in villages and urban slums to help people meet their most rudimentary needs. Fundamental to these selfhelp initiatives is the utilization of appropriate technology. In order to strengthen these selfhelp programs. I offered an amendment to the Peace Corps authorization for fiscal year 1979 which allows the Peace Corps to use its funds and expertise to assist these programs. With the support of my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. this amendment was incorporated into the Senate Peace Corps authorization for fiscal year 1979. Mr. President. appropriate technology will not solve all the problems or meet all the needs of developing countries. Largescale. capital intensive technologies are still indispensable to build sound and enduring economic infrastructures in Third World countries. However. appropriate technology can do much to help solve the problems of abject poverty. starvation and deprivation which plague many less developed countries. Mr. President.

In conference it was pointed out that under the law the training center is obligated to contract with any agency that wants to use its facilities and in order to do that the school has to meet certain financial obligations. This is a matter of permitting the school to carry out its requirements under the law. The decision as to whether or not the Immigration and Naturalization training personnel will be taken from existing schools and sent to this Federal school is not a matter that is under the jurisdiction of our subcommittee. but we did feel since the decision was being made for the INS to exercise its right to use this school. that it would be incumbent upon us to provide the school with the funds it has to have to comply with the law. We were told in passing that the place to be vacated by the students in the gentlemans district is being retained and will be used by INS for other purposes and that the economic report of this change will be minimal. I am sure the gentleman knows more about that than I do. But the decision to make this change rests with the INS and that jurisdiction is in another subcommittee.

Unfortunatey. we lost again on the floor of the House. We would remind everyone that we did not have 1 day of hearings on the justification for any appropriation and under what kind of rules and regulations we would have to administer such a program. Then. during the amendment process in the House nobody could determine Just who would be eligible and who would not. Conceivably. under one stretch of the imagination. 38 million people in this country currently would qualify for subsidization of their most recent winter fuel bills to some extent. But. be that as it may. one other area troubles me. There are two amendments in the LaborHEW chapter being reported in technical disagreement because the appropriations action contravenes the language of the authorizing legislation. The first has to do with the alcoholism formula grants to the States. where the formula is in effect being altered to insure that no State receives less than the amount they received last year. The second waives the requirement of the emergency school aid law that not more than 5 percent of the total appropriation be allocated for special projects. I point this out because of the flack that has been raised on previous occasions when we have sought to overcome authorizing language in order to reduce funds. When there is increased spending. little is said. but when spending reductions are proposed. all sorts of pious protestations are made about the integrity of the authorizing language. I think the record ought to show that this action today represents an additional precedent which we ought to be able to rely upon for any future action we may wish to pursue. I would further suggest that the absence of opposition to these two amendments by the authorizing committees involved represents acceptance on their part of the action being undertaken.",

The language that he quotes is different from the language in the joint resolution. The second thing that must be pointed out is that the power he was talking about is not the right to write the statute on behalf of the people. but the right of Congress to enforce the provisions. There is a vast difference between enforcing the provisions and actually doing it for them on their behalf. If. as a matter of fact. it had been simply the desire of the framers of the resolution to enforce the provisions. they would have said so. But. curiously. they did not do that. and I have to assume that that difference was not casual or inadvertent if. as a matter of fact. it is being argued now that my amendment is inappropriate. Because there seems to be a conscious desire to withhold from the people of the District the right to vote the way they want to vote. or the right to set the lines the way they want to set them. It seems to me that was not the intention of the people in the House of Representatives. who went to very great pains in committee to write in their report precisely the opposite. As a matter of fact. then. there is a difference between the language in the joint resolution as before the Senate and the language of other ratifications of other amendments. that contain the enforcement provision which this one does not contain. but this one contains. rather curiously. the lack of either that language. and apparently the intention on the part of some. though certainly not this Senator and I think not the House of Representatives. to imply that Congress has the right to retain to itself the power to tell the people of the District of Columbia how it will come out. and the power in the Congress of the United States to vote on behalf of the District of Columbia on constitutional amendments.

It should be interpreted in the same way. It retains authority in Congress to insure that the rights conferred by the amendment are actually implemented in the way they should be. By contrast. the Senators amendment would turn over all such power to the District. Congress could act by statute to carry out the Senators amendment.

That concern puts the District of Columbia in a no mans land. Would that mean that Annapolis would establish the criteria for the voters in the District? What about where a candidate should come from? Would it be possible for someone who lived in the District of Columbia to serve in the House of Representatives? Suppose Annapolis said you had to live in Maryland. as a right to qualify voters? I say this because it seems to me that we are establishing a rule here in which we would put into the Constitution something that would create a very confusing situation. In addition. I think a good case could be made relative to article 4. section 3. and the only precedent we have is retrocession to Virginia. when it was ruled at that time that the State had to determine. under the Constitution. whether or not they could accept that property. I say to my colleagues that I look at it a little differently from the way the Senator from Idaho looks at it. I think he is giving away part of my property in Indiana. In Indiana we have 5.5 million people who feel that the District of Columbia is part of their Capital. and they want us to find a way in which the people who live here can vote without. in essence. giving away the city.

As it states on pages 99 and 100 of the joint statement of managers: The conference agreement provides that the price paid by industrial users for No. 2 fuel oil is the alternative fuel cost unless the Commission determines otherwise. The Commission can determine that. in certain cases. the price paid by industrial users for fuel oil costing as low as No. 6 fuel oil is the appropriate fuel cost to use as the alternative fuel cost. The Commission may make this determination either by rule or by order. on a casebycase basis. or regionally by category of user on a pipelinebypipeline basis.... The conferees urge the Commission to take whatever action it deems appropriate or necessary (including expeditious consideration of these proceedings and consolidation of these cases) to avoid any delays in reducing the substitute fuel level so as to avoid the llelihood of conversions from natural gas by industrial users if these conversions would result in increases in natural gas rates for any residential. small commercial. and other high priority customers. The conferees intend that in determining the likelihood of these conversions occurring. the Commission move rapidly in the administrative hearings so as to avoid the irreparable damage which the conferees believe will occur to high priority users if these other industrial users. faced with uncertain natural gas rates. begn taking steps to secure alternate fuel supplies. The nonfer.ice agreement reauires the Commission to make the determination of the cost of alternative fuel following the opportunity for written and oral presentation of views. data. and arguments.

The cumbersome and unnecessary regulatory requirements of the Natural Gas Act that are now applied to all sales in interstate commerce will be terminated for all onshore and offshore new gas and for gas from onshore production wells. even from acreage that is now dedicated to interstate commerce. The producer who sells such gas to an interstate pipeline will not be required to obtain a certificate from FERC. to make regulatory rate Increase filings. to obtain abandonment authorization from FERC when the contract expires or the well is depleted. or wait for 2 or 3 years to learn what price can be charged for the gas.

In the Atlantic States. for example. manufacturing jobs have declined almost 14 percent in the last 15 years while they have increased by almost 70 percent in the Sunbelt. Clearly. there are many reasons for the economic ills of the Northeast. but one factor which cannot be ignored is the high price this region has had to pay for industrial- energy. It cannot be disputed that the price of energy in the Northeast is sharply higher than in other regions. and this in part explains the reasons for differing growth rates. One of the most important goals for the Northeast. then. is to achieve parity with the rest of the Nation visavis energy prices. The Presidents energy proposal. and the crude oil equalization tax would provide a measure of parity so desperately needed. A recent article by Michael McManus. published in Newsday explores this issue in some depth. and presents a compelling argument for the Presidents plan. I commend it to the attention of the energy conferees and to my colleagues in the House of Representatives. The article follows:",

During his press conference a few weeks ago. he was confronted with a question which. though doubtless wellintentioned. was at least melodramatic and perhaps out of place. Nonetheless. Mr. Carter fielded it well. It concerned allegationswhich were unfortunately treated as fact by the pressthat a Texan woman had died as a result of a Mexican abortion. to which she had resorted because medicaid would not cover the costs of an abortion in this country. To his credit. President Carter did not flinch or budge an inch from his previous position When he was confronted with this highly suspect incident. Now additional information has come to light concerning it which. I believe. vindicates the Presidents position on this issue. According to information reported in todays Washington Post. the incident may have been manufactured by overly zealous Federal officials at HEWs Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. the same Federal agency which. a year or so ago. was referring to unwanted pregnancy as a venereal disease! Because this is such a serious matter. I have asked Secretary Califano to take steps to investigate the role the Center for Disease Control has played with regard to this controversial issue. It would be most unfortunate if a Federal agency were proven to have been less than candid with the public and the Congress on so critical an issue. In the hope that this incident will serve to impress upon us all the seriousness of the abortion issue and will heighten our sensitivity to the fragile human lives which it touches.

My support for the financial disclosure concept extends back through all the years that I have served in government. at both the Federal and local level. During the period I was supervisor of a Long Island town. that municipality became the first in the State of New York to require all elected officials. all department heads and members of numerous boards and agencies to publicly file these documents. While I am pleased that we have made progress in duplicating that requirement in Congress. I am not completely satisfied with the type of statements now required of all my colleagues and. indeed. voted against the rule which limited amendments to the financial ethics reform package we approved earlier this year. I supported final passage of that legislation. as most of my colleagues are aware. but would have preferred to amend the package to include a bottom line net worth figure in those financial disclosure statements. Without such a requirement. in my judgment. it is extremely difficult. if not impossible. to determine the net increase. or decrease for that matter. in an elected officials total worth. For example. if an elected officials net worth should increase $60.000 or $75.000 in a single year. it seems to me that his constituents might want to know how he or she achieved that very impressive financial gain in so short a period of time. I do not think such a change could always be spotted in the financial statements that will be required beginning next year. Nevertheless. we now have a financial disclosure requirement for the first time and I am confident that in the future we can amend the administrative rules of the House to perfect those statements. Toward that end. I am once again releasing the type of financial disclosure statement I have used in recent years. It is a more comprehensive document than the one approved by the House this year and in my opinion contains many categories and features which should be required of all House Members:",

They speak eloquently as a plea for understanding the plight of 2.5 million textile and apparel workers in this country whose jobs are fast disappearing because of the heavy penetration of imports from many places around the world. The advertisements seek to answer the socalled free traders who insist on branding American trade unions as \"protectionists\" when what the unions are seeking is equitable treatment for lowwage workers in the most concentrated industry in this country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing a bill today to reaffirm the intent of the Congress with respect to the structure of the common carrier telecommunications industry entering interstate and foreign commerce. This is the same bill I introduced in the 94th Congress. The reason for my sponsorship of this bill is that I am concerned that lowcost telephone service remain available to consumers with limited incomes. I know that many people have termed this legislation A.T. & T.s attempt to maintain its traditional monopoly in the fast growing telecommunications field As a strong believer in free enterprise and small business I can see some of the arguments for permitting competitors to enter into new data communications systems and into furnishing telephone equipment to customers. Frankly. I have no love for monopolies. but A.T. & T. has had this monopoly in our country since the early part of the century and today we have the finest telephone system in the world and almost all of our citizens have easy. cheap. access to telecommunications. A.T. & T. warns that if competition in other areas Is not stopped. its local phone rates will have to go up since the losses incurred In providing service to other areas are made up in profits by sales in new data communications systems and telephone equipment. The FCC decisions last year allowing other electronics firms to manufacture telephone equipment and data communications equipment to interface with the Bell System seem on the surface to be the right way to go in this area. It has been my experience. however. that solutions create problems. A problem that may be created by the intrusion of electronics equipment manufacturers into territory heretofore the exclusive turf of A.T. & T. might be increased consumer costs. In any event. I want to urge the appropriate committees in both the House and the Senate to look into this matter thoroughly and try to determine the probable impact. The Congress is not here to serve either A.T. & T. or IBM or any of the many other firms involved in this controversy. It is here to serve the public gqod and since this problem will not go away by itself I think Congress is a proper forum to hold hearings and investigations to find out who is being helped and who is being hurt by the FCC rulings.",

This merely provides that SPA* can carry out its contractual obligations to furnish power to the municipalities and farmers organizations in the sixState area. I want to thank members of the Appropriations Committee and the Carter administration for the fast action on this supplemental appropriation. The Southwestern Power Administration faces a serious problem in furnishing the necessary power to its customers. Last month and early this month. SPA faced two critical periods in which it appeared that electrical power would have to be cut off or substantially reduced to its customers. In each instance. emergency reprograming through the Office of Management and Budget was provided to meet the critical problem. This supplemental appropriation of $6.4 million will enable the Southwestern Power Administration to purchase power on the open market in order to furnish it to its customers. The problem is that SPA relies upon rainfall to fill the Corps of Engineers lakes and ultimately to generate the power needed for its customers. There has been severe drought conditions in the Oklahoma area and the lakes from which SPA draws its power have been dropping considerably. The lakes are down from their previous 70 percent level to 44 percent of its power pool. If the drought conditions continue. there will be no alternative but for SPA to purchase its power elsewhere. In order to do that. this supplemental appropriation is necessary. Ultimately. an amendment to theauthorizing legislation will be necessary so that such supplementals will not have to come before the Congress. However. this will be taken up in the normal course of events and I will be talking to the administration and the appropriate committees about such amendments.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when Congress enacted the Fair Credit Billing Act 2 years ago a provision was placed in the legislation that would make it easier for merchants to offer discounts for customers who chose to pay for their purchases with cash instead of using a credit card. The theory behind the move was that since the merchant has to pay a discount fee to the credit card company for each transaction. the merchant should be willing to give a cash customer a discount equal to the amount of discount that the businessman would have to pay to the credit card company. Mr. Speaker. since the cash discount prcvision went into effect I have consistently urged consumer groups and business groups to push for cash discounts. Several groups around the country have begun organized campaigns to encourage businesses to offer cash discounts. It was my feeling that if one or two businesses in each community began offering these discounts. then .other businesses would start offering the discounts in order to keep up with the competition. While there has not been a widespread use of cash discounts throughout the country. there is an interesting experiment being conducted by the Exxon Co. that may well bring cash discounts to more and more businesses. On September 15 of last year Exxon announced a service station test program of cash discounts in two cities. Charleston. S.C. and Abilene. Tex. Although the test program is only a little over half way completed. the staff of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee visited Charleston recently to observe the effects of the program. In the near future we hope to also view the program in operation in Abilene. Tex. As with any new program. there is a great deal of skepticism on the part of businesses and consumers. While this was true with the Exxon experiment. that apprehension quickly disappeared as service station operators and their customers quickly realized that cash discounts had benefits for both of them. The Charleston experiment is being carried out at more than 30 Exxon stations in a market that consists of some 144.000 registered motor vehicles and a population of 300.000 people. Exxon inaugurated the program with a massive advertising campaign which included both television and newspaper ads as well as direct mail advertising sent to all area Exxon credit card holders.",

I will introduce another bill to amend in the future the process whereby we get these raises. I would require a vote specifically approving these increases rather than simply letting them go through unless opposed. The real issue here is not the Idea of pay raises for Members of Congress. although at this time I do not favor that. The real issue had to do with the way we now go about implementing these raises. I am greatly concerned about the low esteem in which the people of the United States holds this Congress. I fear that the way we are going about trying to sneak these pay increases through only lowers that esteem further. I believe that we have to earn back the confidence of our people. Sneaking through a pay raise is certainly not the way to do that. The congressional sex scandals. charges of bribes and payoffs. and other incidents have created an image that we must work hard to overcome. Let us take a step toward restoring faith in this great body. Let us work toward a strong. enforceable code of ethics before we even consider a raise in pay. Let us open up the process of voting on these raises so that they have to be specifically approved. Of course. In the long run we cannot escape a vote on this issue. There will be a vote on this raise when the appropriation bills are voted. Some of my colleagues proclaim that once the raise is in place. it will no longer be an issue to the voters and we can vote contrary to their wishes without serious political consequences. I submit that the public will not consider this any less of an issue at appropriations time and that by trying to trick them now we do individual Congressmen no favor. On the contrary. we do this institution a great disservice. I urge the Congress to have the courage to halt any increases until we have earned them and to have the courage to bring this matter to a vote in the House now. so that we can show the people that we care about this institution and have the courage to vote on the difficult issues as we were elected to do.",

The terms of this issue have been framed by Lt. Gen. James Hollingsworth. retired. and by. my colleagues from the other side of the Hill. Senators SAM NUNN of Georgia and DEWEY BARTLETT of Oklahoma. They have outlined what they see as three problems which require immediate attention. First. they say the Warsaw Pact is structured to pour a horde of troops into Europe and overwhelm NATO in a short. intense war which our forces are inadequate to halt. Second. they say NATO will have only a short warning of any such attack since the pact countries are prepared to strike like a bolt out of the blue and therefore NATO will lack the time needed for a buildup. Third. they say the NATO nations are short of the will needed to respond early and decisively when the Warsaw Pact giant bestirs itself for war. The three problems they envisionare a short war following a short warning aggravated by a shortness of will. Some will argue that the absense of war in Europe these last three decades proves that NATO is an adequate deterrent. But times change. Yesterdays adequacy may be todays deficiency.

One of his greatest contributions. indeed legacy. to the committee and the Congress was the role he played. even before becoming chief counsel. in helping to establish the annual authorization process for Defense Department spending bills. an accomplishment that has markedly improved congressional oversight and review of the Pentagons activities.

That this Act may be cited as the \"DNA Research Act of 1977.\" FINDINGS SEC. 2. The Congress finds that(1) research related to recombinant DNA is of exceptional importance. with many potential benefits. but also with major uncertainties regarding its possible effects on human beings and other organisms. (2) research involving recombinant DNA may involve a high risk not only to those pursuing such research but to the population in general. (3) it is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of the nation be protected by requiring that all research conducted with regard to recombinant DNA comply with strict standards of performance and safety. and (4) all research with regard to recombinant DNA is either in interstate commerce or substantially affects such commerce and regulations by the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare as contemplated by this Act are necessary and proper to prevent and eliminate burdens on interstate commerce. to regulate such commerce effectively. and to protect the health and welfare of the nation.",

I presented testimony before the Commission on Administrative Review. urging the adoption of a ban on slush funds and a limit on a Members expenditures to those funds which Congress appropriates for a Member to fulfill his or her activities as a Federal officeholder.

To that end. I have Introduced an amendment to the House rules which will limit the funds a Member may expend to fulfill his activities as a Federal officeholder to the funds Congress has appropriated for that purpose. This resolution would. in effect. prevent Members from using funds donated. excess campaign funds. honorariums. proceeds from testimonials. or other fundraising events. and personal funds for expenses incurred as Federal officeholders.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. H.R. 8422 is. in a sense. landmark legislation. It would for the first time make possible medicaremedicaid reimbursement to rural clinics for health services without a requirement for direct supervision by a physician. This means that the services provided by nurse practitioners and physicians assistants can be reimbursed whether or not there is an onsite physician. It should help greatly to insure the availability of care for segments of our population that too often lack adequate health services. However. I would like to comment on one aspect of this bill that I think requires clarification. This relates to the matter of registered nurse supervision by a physician. While the bill does not require onsite M.D. supervision. it provides for general supervision by an M.D. This should not be construed to imply that such supervision extends to ordinary nursing services. but only to the medically oriented services covered by this bill. The services referred to in this legislation are medical services as covered under medicare and medicaid and services \"furnished as incident to a physicians professional service.\" The registered nurse is licensed under State law as an independent health professional. It is not clear to me that the term \"supervisory physician\" as it applies to the services of nurses needs to be used as it is in this legislation. The American Nurses Association has serious concerns about this. but is supporting this bill because of its importance to the continuation of rural clinics. I would note that the provision for M.D. supervision of certain services rendered by nurses. as provided for in this bill. should not be construed as setting a precedent for future legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the bill now before us. which would allow medicare to reimburse physician assistants and nurse practitioners for care administered when a bona fide physician cannot be present. In Nevada. towns are often hundreds of miles apart. and doctors are not always readily available. Moreover. we have many elderly people who have no means of traveling such great distances just to visit a physician. Thus. the physician assistant. with proper reimbursements from medicare. can play a useful role in supplying daytoday medical services to our rural areas. The present law. however. prohibits medicare reimbursements for physician assistants unless a licensed physician is present when the care is administered. This runs entirely contrary to the \"physician extender\" concept which our isolated. lesspopulated areas so desperately need. and which our House Commerce Committee was so quick to approve last month. Not only would the bill provide for broader physician assistant services. but it would also insure that many rural and inner city clinics will have the necessary funds to remain open during the coming year. Traditionally. these clinics have been funded through various agencies at all levels of government and through the communities in which the clinics are located. But. funds are rapidly running out. and when they do many clinics will be forced to close their doors. Mr. Speaker. my dear colleagues. I ask you to give this bill your support so thousands of people in cities big and small can have easy access to qualified medical care. Thank you.",

I am sorry that the gentleman opposes the bill. knowing that the bill is absolutely essential in order to facilitate the operation of provisions of the 1976 act. and that many thousands of people are left high and dry. not knowing what the law is because of these technical difficulties. There are certain companies that were caught with changes in the law in the middle of their operations. and we have tried to give them equity. We have tried to make an interpretation of the law that we think is equitable as applied to that type of situation. Because of that. the gentleman opposes the bill. The gentleman would. I am sure. agree that we held public hearings and we had extensive discussions in the consideration of these matters. In the one instance dealing with losses from Puerto Rico. the Treasury Department recommended an amendment that was in effect a tightening amendment over what we agreed to in the conference last year. The committee adopted that tightening amendment. We are dealing with a case in which the law. as it was. gave them certain privileges and afforded certain treatment. We changed that privileged treatment through loss recapture. and this company. having based its operation on existing tax law. was caught in a situation that was totally beyond its control. The conferees last year agreed to delay the impact of these changes in this case. but the language was not included in the bill as enacted. All we are talking about is how we apply the law for a transitional period. and in this bill we have included the agreement of the confereesas modified by Treasurythat would. we think. allow the company to survive. yet. over a period of a few years. under this bill. we believe we would get the company exactly where we want it to be under the new rules.

This legislation would exempt disaster payments made in connection with the 1977 crops of wheat. feed grains. upland cotton. and rice from the payment limitations contained in the Agricultural Act of 1949. The reason given for this proposed exemption from the payment limitation is the fact that. largely through inadvertence. disaster payments were not excluded from the payment limitation as was done in the new act for the 1978 and later crops. Moreover. the committee report on this bill states that exempting disaster payments from the payment limitation will improve the economic situation for thousands of farmers across the United States in this year of severely depressed farm income. According to a letter in the committee report from Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland. the Department supports this legislation. It was reported from the House Agriculture Committee by a vote of 36 to 8. The report does contain the opposing views of Representatives HARKIN.

To call this bill a ripoff or a fat cat farmer relief act is simply false. I want to remind the Members that all of you who voted for the conference report on the farm billand most Members didvoted for a provision which exempts disaster payments from payment limitations for the crop year 1978 and 1979 as part of the new farm program. and in addition to that. substantially raised the payment limitation to $40.000 next year and $45.000 in 1979. All this bill does. while keeping the $20.000 payment limitation. is exempt the disaster payments for this year. making it perfectly consistent with what we are going to do for the next 2 years and putting farmers under the tighter restraints of the $20.000 payment limitation which exists under present law. The problem we have is that there have been major agricultural disasters in the United States and farmers who have suffered that kind of disaster have to get their disaster relief out of the same $20.000 payment limitation which was designed to provide the income support of deficiency payments. So what happens is that the farmer who has a disaster may have all that $20.000 taken up in disaster payments and will not be treated equally with a farmer on the other side of the country who does not have the disaster and can benefit from * the program supports the Congress has given him.

Simultaneously many South Africans supporting majority rule were arrested. Such action. claimed to be in retaliation for an ongoing campaign among blacks to engender hate for whites. is viewed by many as an attempt to stifle the freedom of expression by spokesmen for both blacks and human rights is unforgivable. To date. the Government has arrested over 50 persons continuing its crusade of crushing political dissent. As Members of Congress we cannot stand by and silently allow this offense to human dignity to continue. The apartheid South African Government has gone too far.

To me.

It is clear to all of us that the number of Indochinese refugees continues to grow. and that the world community has failed to respond. In August. the House Judiciary Subcommittee which I chair held a hearing on the administrations proposal to grant parole to an additional 15.000 Indochinese refugees. Within 24 hours of that hearing. we informed the Attorney General that we had no objection to the granting of the parole.

The Observer Newspapers were founded in Sacramento. Calif.. in November 1962. by its present publisher. William H. Lee and two other community leaders. John W. Cole and Eugene (Geno) Gladden. The original Sacramento paper was published every other week and contained four pages. It started with 200 very loyal subscribers. Later. the untimely death of one of the founders. Gladden. occurred. Cole then sold his interest in the paper to Lee. who was faced with the enormous decision of trying to keep the debtridden community paper alive. or let it die. Thanks to the encouragement of many Sacramento friends and citizens. he and his wife. Kathryn. decided to stick with it. They created Lee Publishing Co.. Inc.. and Lee sold his real estate business to become a fulltime publisher. Early objectives of the Lees were meager. He and his wife said if they could publish a 16page paper for the black community of Sacramento every week. they would have been pleased. They did better than that. During Lees first year as a fulltime publisher. the Observer averaged 32 pages every week. They continued to build the paper to its state today 15 years later. to have become truly one of the outstanding black newspapers in America. In fact. in June of this year (1977). the Lees received the John R.

Rather. the amendment requires HEW to prepare the report detailing how this program might be phased in and established. Then. the policymakers for the people of this country. the Senate and the House. could decide whether or not they want to proceed with the formula grant approach for bilingual education. I understand that the first of these amendments. which is cosponsored by a number of distinguished Senators. is acceptable to the managers of the bill.",

Mr. Merriman had been chairman of the Genesee County Economic Development Commission. and he had served on its board since 1971.

In addition to his many official duties. his sense of civic responsibility often led him to strong and effective involvement in other worthy causes and projects. It was largely due to his individual determination. for example. that the city of Flint recently received a Federal grant of $600.000 to build the bikepaths that follow the Flint River.

Unlike the House version. the Senate bill does not include the provision requiring a ban on mandatory retirement for Federal workers. It is my feeling that the omission of this essential provision defeats the whole purpose of the antimandatory retirement bill. As things stand now the House bill is only an interim step toward the abolition of all agebased discrimination. The choice of age 70 for nonFederal workers was a compromise to meet the concerns of the business and labor communities. However. we must not lose sight of the fact that this interim step is vital.

This year. we will provide some $17 billion for that purpose. At the same time. we find ourselves in the midst of one of the Nations worst droughts that has affected some 35 States.

Bankruptcy is provided for in the U.S. Constitution and should be considered a totally legitimate alternative to any person whose financial circumstances warrants it. The student loan program in recent years has suffered substantial losses accounting for millions of dollars. and my colleagues are justified in their concern over these losses. However. they have yet to justify their contention that bankruptcies are responsible for more than a small percentage of the losses incurred or that vast numbers of students are \"taking the easy way out\" by discharging their loans through bankruptcy. In fact. the greatest part of the losses is due to simple default. nonpayment. and not bankruptcy. Everyone by now has read published horror stories relating how persons who. having benefitted from large student loans. took the ontion of entering the bankruptcy courts rather than assume their rightful obligation of repaving the loans.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the House should pass H.R. 10. the Hatch Act amendments. As you know. the Hatch Act currently prohibits 2.8 million Federal civil service and postal employees from actively participating in political campaigns. soliciting campaign funds from fellow workers. or running for office on a partisan ticket. As it is presently drafted. H.R. 10 would amend the Hatch Act to permit Federal civilian and postal employees to participate voluntarily and as private citizens in the political process of the Nation. It sets sensible guidelines to protect these employees from improper influences and solicitations. and coercion or the misuse of official authority. I endorse H.R. 10 in the belief that a democratic society cannot function as an effective unit when a major portion of its population is denied complete participation in its political affairs. When the Hatch Act was passed years ago. it was out of fear that Federal employees would be forced to donate to Federal elections or be required to campaign for member of certain parties or face loss of theii jobs. This may have been the situation 50 years ago. but much has changed since then. The Civil Service Commission has established sound guidelines to protect Federal employees from such abuse. and H.R. 10 carries additional protection Speaking on behalf of the approxi. mately 4.000 Federal workers on Guam I believe what an employee does in his el her spare time is not the concern of thE Government as long as it does not im. pair job efficiency. The Hatch Acts current excessive lir. itations on political activity discriminatf against Federal employees by denying them the opportunity to participate ol an equal basis with their fellow Ameri. cans in the political process of thei: country. To my way of thinking. H.R. 1 corrects a long overdue inequity in th. law and restores the precious right o political participation on a broad level o. voluntary activity to Federal civil service and postal employees on Guam and elsewhere in the nation. I am proud to join many of my colleagues in support of this legislation and wish to note that I was an early cosponsor of such legislation in the 94th Congress. It deserves passage and I urge my colleagues to do so.",

I rise in full support of H.R. 10. which modifies the Hatch Act to permit Federal civilian and postal employees to participate voluntarily In the political life of the Nation. I joined in cosponsorship of this legislation. Mr. Chairman. because I felt there was something inherently wrong in having on the statute books a law like the Hatch Act. which effectively denied to 2.8 million citizens of this Nation all of the rights and privileges associated with their franchise. except the right to vote itself. The Hatch Act became law in a different era. when we were trying to end the spoils system in this country and when we wanted to insulateand rightly socivil service employees from improper political pressures from elected and appointed officers of the executive branch of the Government. The goal was worthy: as is far too often the cae. the \"cure\" of this law was worse than the \"disease.\" The Hatch Act so insulated the career civil servant that he was effectively foreclosed from participation in the political processes of our country. Today we have an opportunity to rectify this situation. The amendments on which we will vote give back to the civilian and postal employees of the Federal Government that precious right to participate in politicswhile still shielding them from reprisals in the event that they choose to work within the framework of a political party which may be different from that of the party in power at any given time. I shall vote for this legislation with great enthusiasm. and with the conviction that. in so doing. I will be advancing the cause of individual political rights in * America. I hope my colleagues share that conviction. and that they will be able to cast their votes for this bill with equal enthusiasm.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 10. which will substantially revise the Hatch Act. This is not a partisan political issue. It transcends party and philosophical lines. The bills importance. however. is measured by its ultimate effect on employees. the Government. and the general public. Also. of equal importance is how the public perceives the Nations business being handled. For the past 38 years. the Hatch Act has served our country well. The original purpose and intent of this act is no less diminished today by the fact our Government employs over 3 times the number of employees it did in 19392.8 millionor that it Ijas a budget that is more than 40 times what it was in 1939-$408 billion. Mr. John R. Bolton. author of \"The Hatch Act. A Civil Libertarian Defense.\" said in defense of the Hatch ActGovernment workers have a right to be free from political coercionparticularly from any systematic solicitation by either their superiors or their coworkers. Since the power to coerce derives in substantial amount from power vested in the government. the Hatch Act Is. in effect. a case of the government restraining itself. I agree. Therefore. with more and more of our daily lives influenced by Federal decisionmaking. it is alarming to conclude. as H.R. 10 does. that we need a relaxation of these protections of employees and the public. I think the reverse is evident. The Nations business is too large. too expensive. and too important for its administration to be constantly suspect of partisan political motives. However. I am afraid that is exactly what might happen if we approve H.R. 10. A politically tainted bureaucracy will not promote confidence and trust in our Government. It will. instead. adversely change the character of our civil service merit system. This would be a tragic mistake. Mr. Chairman. the Hatch Act is not perfect. It needs revision. but not as drastically proposed in H.R. 10. I urge rejection of this proposal with the hope a more careful review be undertaken.",

H.R. 10 will prove to be a great step toward allowing full democratic participation in the political system by all Americans. The Hatch Act has systematically denied meaningful political involvement to approximately 2.8 million Federal executive branch civilians and postal employees. This is not in keeping with our democratic form of government. This bill includes sufficient safeguards against abusive political activity. Since last year. it has been carefully and skillfully improved by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the problem areas have been eliminated. Therefore. support for H.R. 10 is more warranted than ever before. Although H.R. 10 encourages Federal employees to exercise their right of voluntary political participation. it has been wisely written to maintain the prohibitions of existing law for certain \"restricted\" employees in sensitive managerial. law enforcement and national security positions. Additionally. I strongly favor the provision which requires the Civil Service Commission to inform employees of their rights under this act and to establish an office to advise and counsel them. The Congressional Commission on Political Activity of Governmental Personnel called the Hatch Act \"confusing. ambiguous. restrictive. negative in character. and possibly unconstitutional.\" With a report card as bad as that. I can see no reason for continued adherence to the 1939 Hatch Act when this bill. H.R. 10. has exactly the kind of remedial help it needs. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this measure.",

Since 1939. when in a burst of overzealousness over revelations of corruption of Federal employees by campaigning candidates. the Congress passed the Hatch Act. the largest single employer in the United States. the Government itself has been guilty of breaching the civil rights of its employees. It is not the Governments role to intervene in the life of its employees once they leave their workplace. It is not the role of the Government to say that. although all people are entitled to participate in the election of those who will serve them. only some citizens have that right. It is a sacrifice that too many people have made. An! it is a sacrifice. too. that some have nof. made. for in their desire to shape the sys-. tem under which they work. they have worked in campaigns illegally. It seerms to me almost ludicrous that someone should be doing something illegal when they only seek to do what we in this body do every other year in order to work here. Yes. there is the possibility of abuse. But that possibility has been taken into account. And the safeguards that this bill provides. coupled with the professionalism and commitment of most Government workers. will assure the accountability and adherence to the law that the Hatch Act was designed to enforce. The bill also strengthens existing protections for employees against possible coercion by the superiors. and so there is recourse for the honest employee when that happens. It is simple justice. that after 38 years. to end this gross discrimination against a large sector of the American labor force. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 10.",

H.R. 10. the bill before us. provides that a court may award attorneys fees to an employee who has been cleared of a Hatch Act violation if the case goes to court. Mr. Chairman. the Gilman amendment goes one step further and authorizes attorneys fees also for employees cleared of Hatch Act charges before the Civil Service Commission. This is a major departure. and it is an Inconsistency. I think it will set a precedent for a wave of such amendments to any bill affecting civil service employees.

With respect to the Territories. the House provision adds American Samoa and Guam to the list of Territories which can participatethis seems acceptable to me. I would now like to return to the nondiscrimination provisions to clarify what is intended here. The House change was made by Congresswoman BARBARA JORDAN. as I understand it. She and I worked out an agreement on the general revenuesharing rules last year. At that time. the point of difference between the Senate and House was whether or not to apply the rules to programs or activities that were directly funded by revenue sharing. or directly and indirectly funded by revenue sharing. She and I both agreed that applying these ruleswhich involve the automatic cutoff of funds after a set period of timeto all programs or activities. that is the entire budget. would be overkill.

It would impose the same kinds of procedural due process requirements on these actions that are imposed in every other action brought to enforce the provisions of regulatory statutes within the Department. and in other agencies. It would require that the Secretary exercise the executive functions of investigating and prosecuting administrative violations. but that the Board exercise the quasijudicial function of determing whether in fact the violation has occurred. Under the current procedure. because of the emergency nature of some of the underlying statutesEconomic Stabilization Act and Emergency Petroleum Allocation Actboth of these functions are undertaken by the same executive officials.

More than onethird of all cropland is suffering soil losses too great to be sustained without an ultimately disastrous decline in productivity. I have asked the Office of Technology Assessment to make a thorough study of our current soil losses and the technologies available to arrest current trends. I have asked OTAs board chairman. our colleague Senator KENNEDY. to act as quickly as possible on this issue. Luther J. Carter has written a perceptive article. \"Soil Erosion: The Problem Persists Despite the Billions Spent on It.\" in a recent issue of Science magazine. In this article Mr. Carter cites a number of reasons for the persistence of the soil erosion problem. Most disturbing. he reports a recent General Accounting Office report indicating that soil erosion losses on farms participating In USDA conservation programs have been as large as those losses on nonparticipating farms. Losses from both groups of farms were above a tolerable level if current productivity is to be maintained. Mr. President.

September 19. 1977. the House of Representatives took the necessary steps in not only repairing a bureaucratic blunder. but also in recognizing and dealing with a dreaded disease. pneumoconiosis. commonly referred to as black lung. Ever since the first black lung legislation was passed in 1965 and administered by the Department of HEW. the amount of redtape that had to be dealt with was overwhelming. indeed. too much so for some applicants. The situation deteriorated even more following the transferring of the program to the Department of Labor. Most recent counts estimate that of the 104.000 claims filed with the Department of Labor. 50.000 have been denied. 50.000 are backlogged and only 4.000 applicants are receiving their rightful benefits. But. through this correcting piece of legislation. H.R. 4544. much of the redtape will be cut away to get the benefits to those people who need them. and need them now. not in 2 or 3 years. This bill is a good bill. and is one that is equitable to all parties concerned. I believe the objective of the bill. that being the transfer of liability for benefit payments to the coal industry from the general taxpayer. can and will be achieved. While obtaining black lung benefits may not be a cure for this awful disease. that eventually makes life not worth living. they certainly help to pay the way for the affected individuals who cannot work any longer because they cannot breath well enough.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on June 30. 1977. Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams issued DOT Standard 208. occupant crash protection. The regulation would require that by 1984 all automobile manufacturers must provide front seat occupants with passive restraint devices effective in 30mileperhour frontal collisions. As my colleagues are aware. frontal collisions are responsible for over 70 percent of all automobile fatalities. The passive restraint ruling is a performance standard which allows automobile manufacturers maximum engineering flexibility in incorporating passive crash protection in their products. Two passive restraint systems. the airbag and automatic seat belt. currently comply with the DOT standard and have been subjected to strenuous laboratory and on the road testing. This extensive test experience has demonstrated their value in saving lives and preventing serious injuries in automobile accidents. The current debate over the passive restraint standard has focused attention on the airbag. While the airbag is. of course. an inexpensive and highly successful automobile safety device. many of my colleagues have expressed their interest in knowing more about the test experience and success of the automatic seat belt. Recently I requested the Department of Transportation to prepare a summary of the test experience and safety record of the automatic seat belt. The DOT informed me that in the United States alone. over 79.000 Volkswagen \"Rabbits\" have been sold which utilize automatic seat belt systems. To date. United States on the road experience with these vehicles totals over 1.2 billion vehicle miles. Accident data collected by the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documents the increased passenger safety of automobiles equipped with automatic seat belts. The fatality rate for \"Rabbits\" equipped with automatic seat belt systems was less than onethird that of \"Rabbits\" equipped with conventional active seat belt systems. The accident fatality data highlights the success of the automatic seat belt in reducing automobile fatalities as well a. the overall reasonableness of Secretary Adams decision. Like the airbag. automatic seat belts are a proven lifesaving device. I strongly urge my colleagues to support Secretary Adams passive restraint decision and ask that the DOT.s letter documenting the success of the automatic seat belt system be printed in the RECORD at this point.

Congressman MURPHY hints at one other thing which has never bothered me. though I know there are many who strongly oppose it: Some type of national identification card.

Thus it was with surprise and delight that I came upon Jack Kilpatricks September 17 column in the Washington Star on the subject of big oil and competition. Kilpatricks discussion of the question of horizontal divestiture by big oil is right on target. This issue of concentration of economic power in the hands of a few giant conglomerates is not one that ought to divide liberals and conservatives. All of us should be alarmed at the erosion of competition in the basic industries in this Nation. In addition to big oil. we have big automobiles. big chemistry. big steel. and big media. Some of our other basic institutions may be too concentrated as well and we ought to be looking at their impact on our society and our way of life. I have long been especially concerned about the growing power of oil companies over competing fuel resources. While horizontal divestiture is probably the best solution. there are other ways to address the problem. The Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs is currently considering one of those alternative paths to restoration of competition in the energy marketplace: imposition of restrictions on the leasing of Federal energy resources. Most of the remaining reserves of coal and uranium. for example. are on Federal lands. We say to the energy giants in this proposal that itf you want to exploit these resources. you cannot be horizontally integrated.

The importance of this bill cannot be overstated. with respect to our energy situation and. in the case of coastal States. to our economic health. The OCS Act of 1953 has not proved to be the vehicle for offshore development that its drafters had hoped it would be. Numerous obstacles and diversions have hindered any work to the point where. 24 years later. little. if any. progress has been made. I am sure that my colleagues agree with me that H.R. 1614 should not present further obstacles to offshore resources development. The Ad Hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf has done an admirable job in dealing with the many complexities and intricacies of this problem. From oil spill liability to State and local involvement. the legislation demonstrates a high level of thought and care. However. there are some points that may require reconsideration. particularly where a certain provision will again delay any actual development.

Costly. often unnecessary institutionalization is the only alternative for the elderly functionally dependent individual who could receive appropriate and less costly care in a home setting. We cannot fail to recognize the fact that patients who require intensive care can benefit from the services offered in institutions. However. institutionalization should be considered the final alternative. not the rule. American families are providing more than half of the basic longterm care services to the countrys functionally disabled elderly population. Meager and often costly community services have imposed on some families the responsibility for the basic longterm care of the functionally dependent person. The development of a social support system for these families would provide an incentive and relieve the strain on family providers of services to their elderly family members. Legislation has been proposed which addresses the needs for a national policy that will increase and upgrade the health care delivery system for the elderly of today and tomorrow. A major concern in considering legislation to increase services frequently raises the question of increased costs. A General Accounting Office report. prepared at the request of the chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging. CLAUDE PEPPER. shows conclusively that institutional care is costlier than home care for all but the greatly or extremely impaired. who make up only 17 percent of the 65andover population and some onethird of whom reside in institutions.

Despite his modesty. his presence was electrifying when he appeared on the balcony of St. Peters in Rome. and his words gave us all a great deal of hope that the Church was blessed with a leader whose holiness and insight would make him a worthy steward to guide the church toward the 21st century. Pope John Paul held out a special meaning for all the people of the worldthat is. a better understanding of the common human values which bind us together and a continuing search for truth. Mr. Speaker. I am saddened by the death of this holy man. Yet. I believe hiq short time as Pope John Paul I has left the world with a spark of hope for all mankind.@",

Regrettably. too few of our analysts and opinionmakers are familiar with the contents of Public Law 8690. As more do become acquainted with it. perhaps on the anniversary of Captive Nations Week in 1979. the principles and substance of the law will be more significantly grasped. I wish to insert several examples of this reflection of our American heritage as seen in some events here and in the country of one of our firmest allies: (1) a resolution of the San Diego City Council. (2) an article by our distinguished colleague. PHIL CRANE. \"Soviet Trials Are a Travesty of Justice.\" which appeared in the Murray (Ky.) Ledger & Times. (3) an editorial. \"Captive Nations\" in the Phoenix Gazette. and (4) a commentary \"Captive Nations Week\" in the August 1978 Asian Bulletin:",

Historically. the railroads have been the backbone of transportation in this country. and. indeed. in the last century their progress was an accurate measure of the progress of civilization across the North American Continent Today. the railroads remain the principle means of shipping agricultural and industrial goods throughout this country. In recent years. the railroads for a variety of reasons have been performing under extremely arduous conditions. One of those conditions has been an acute shortage of freight cars which are essential for transportation purposes. Therefore. I believe that it is fitting that the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade held a hearing today concerning a number of proposals to remedy this situation by suspending the import duty on freight cars. In order to further acquaint all of my colleagues with this important problem. I would like to share my testimony before the subcommittee with them. The testimony follows:",

Marylands artistic community is one of the best in the entire country. Throughout history. Maryland has added many names to the list of great American artists. Among the most notable are Rembrandt Peale and Charles W. Peale. They were two of Americas first great portrait artists. and each day as I go to work in Washington I am inspired by portraits they have done which are hanging in the Capitol Building. The Peales are but two of Marylands many famous artists. Im glad for the recognition of my States artists. but I feel all artists deserve recognition. Artists add color and excitement to our daily lives. They provide pleasure for our citizens. and make our surroundings more beautiful. I hope recognition of Marylands artists will go beyond the month of October and become a year round preoccupation. Maryland has not only produced many great artists of past and present generations. but Im sure my State will continue to produce many more artists in the future.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. next week. the House will reconsider H.R. 12370. the Health Services Amendments of 1978. This bill incorporates the very important Genetic Diseases Act. I would like to take this opportunity to share the views of the president of the National FoundationMarch of Dimes. Charles L. Massey. on the importance of passing H.R. 12370. I am honored to represent the district in which the National Foundation has its national headquarters and I applaud their efforts to identify and diagnose inheritable birth defects: DEAR CONGRESSMAN OTTINGER: We strongly urge support of H.R. 12370 the Health Services Amendments of 1978. As you know. this legislation incorporates the National Genetic Diseases Act of 1976 and provides for genetic service and education and for the establishment of vitally needed laboratory facilities. The March of Dimes role in supporting genetic services has been one of innovation and leadership. In 1977. our grants for genetic services represented nearly half of our total medical services expenditure. or $2.5 million out of $6 million. We are still funding this service but the need is much greater than we can or should continue to meet alone. With the help of others. our financial support and what it already has accomplished can be multiplied many times over. Third party payers do not cover these services. Meeting the total need. therefore. will require the support of government on all levels together with all available resources. About 30 per cent of childhood hospital admissions and 10 per cent of adult admissions in this country result from genetic disorders. An estimated 12 million Americans suffer from some genetic disorder. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences reports that birth defects with genetic origins may claim many more American life years than do heart disease. cancer or stroke. The financial cost of treating and institutionalizing our severely affected survivors is staggering. we cannot begin to measure the cost to the survivors themselves and their families. Passage of this act can reduce the incidence of all genetic diseases. such as sickle cell anemia. Cooley anemia. TaySachs disease. Down syndrome. muscular dystrophy and some types of diabetes.

    "speech": "Mr. President. let us consider one of the arguments raised in opposition to the Genocide Convention. It runs as follows: The treaty perverts the true meaning of the term genocide. Genocide. they assert. is the complete annihilation of a specific group. Mr. President. must we wait until every member of a designated group is murdered before such mass homocide can then be called genocide? Must we wait until the group is extinct? By such a definition. Mr. President. what in history could rightly be called genocide? Not Hitlers mass murder of Jews. because some were lucky enough to survive. The convention defines genocide as \"any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy. in whole or in part. a national. ethnical. racial. or religious group. as such: First. killing members of the group. second. causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. third. deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. fourth. imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. fifth. forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\" Mr. President. is that not a more humane and functional definition for a convention that aims to prevent and punish the crime of genocide? To further clarify the phrase \"in whole or in part.\" the Foreign Relations Committee has even added an understanding stating that acts must \"affect a substantial part of the group concerned.\" Mr. President. let me take a moment to elaborate on this definition. The intentand this is the key wordthe intent must be to destroy at least a substantial part of the group. One person does not fit this definition. although it would clearly be a violation of existing criminal law. In the 1950 hearings on this treaty. the point was stressed by Senator McMahon and Deputy Under Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Mr. President. this same argument has been raised every time the treaty is debated. It was shown to be patently false in 1950 and is still false today. The definition was clear in 1950 and is still clear today. The need was obvious then and a survey of world events today shows it is needed today.

I believe this body. together with the House. has shown the sort of wisdom of what the Senator from Ohio now says. in resisting those arguments that were kind of compelling for a while after the race to the Moon was over. after the United States had won that race. I refer to the \"either/or\" arguments we hear: How can we spend $3 billion or $4 billion for a space program. when we have people who do not have enough food to eat? In considering that \"either/or\" argument. we must recognize that this country has many priorities. and part of those priorities always has been in trying to be on the outer edge. as the Senator says. to try to make new discoveries and new breakthroughs. That is what has always made this country great. I thank goodness that the Senate and the House resisted those arguments. which were kind of compelling at the time. and that the American people resisted those arguments. and they kept going with the space program. We now see. as the shuttle comes in. that no longer is it going to be just an exotic searchalthough we are going to have that. alsobut we are also getting practicality into it. as to just what we will be able to do with the shuttles and with stations which we can go up and repair.

Now we are going to have a very practical application of the shuttle.

My proposal would assure that owners of cooperative housing have the same tax treatment as condominium owners. The present tax law requires that 80 percent of the income of cooperative housing corporations be from tenant stockholders and that only individuals may be tenant stockholders. This has made it difficult for tenant stockholders to obtain financing. because the deductibility of the interest and real estate taxes is not assured. This situation arises because foreclosures and vacanies jeopardize the 80percent tax. In 1976. an amendment was adopted allowing banks to be treated as tenant stockholders for a period of 3 years. which covered the instances in which foreclosures occurred. My amendment would extend the same rules to sponsors of the project as well. This is important to new units under construction. A similar measure has been introduced in the House. and Treasury has testified in favor of its enactment.",

I am introducing this bill to exercise section 3 of Public Law 9546 and expedite approval of the three contracts so that they may be exiecuted prior to January 1. 1979. The Secretary of Interior believes that these contracts are in the best interests of the Federal Government and consistent with the provisions of Federal reclamation law. I concur. The contracts provide for the delivery of 1.1 million acrefeet of water for agricultural purposes from the San Luis Canal at $13.50 per acrefoot. the delivery of 50.000 acrefeet of water for agricultural purposes from the Delta Mendota Canal at $10 per acrefoot. and the delivery of 6.000 acrefeet of water for municipal and industrial purposes from the San Luis Canal at $30.85 per acrefoot. The temporary contracts will allow continuation of water service to the Westlands Water District pending reauthorization of the San Luis unit and renegotiation of the current water service contract originally executed in 1963. I hope that the Congress will move quickly to pass this bill or adopt it as an amendment to an appropriate legislative vehicle so that there will be no interruption in the delivery of water service for the Westlands Water District. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a global problem which faces us is a serious misallocation of the worlds resources. This is especially true in regard to our allocation of mans most basic resourcefood. One stark example of this is distribution of dairy stocks. In this country we are storing millions of tons of nonfat dried milk. butter. and cheese. These surpluses depress dairy prices in this country. while dairy products are scarce in other parts of the globe. All over the world and in the United States itself. people suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This glaring paradox is disturbing. and a method of equitable allocation must be found. I would like to bring to Congress attention one innovative proposal relating to the distribution of dairy products. The proposal is the creation of an International Dairy Cooperative. a concept developed by Patrick H. Healy. Secretary of the National Milk Producers Federation. The International Dairy Cooperative is not another foodaid program. Its basic principles rest upon sound economic policies. The IDC would be an international administrative process by which surplus stocks of dairy product. for instance nonfat dry milk powder. would be handled by a group of international experts in commodity placement. Absolutely no existing markets would be disturbed by the IDC. The IDCs first responsibility. after assuming possession of stocks of dairy products produced in surplus to domestic needs. would be to develop new markets. This development would rely on a sliding economic scale. Those nations which could not afford to pay for the nutritious supplies of milk powder would be eligible to receive the needed food through an aid and development program. This plan will serve to strengthen the international market for dairy products and will help to alleviate the unnecessary undercutting market which now hampers strong dairy industries at home and abroad. I bring this concept to your attention so that the potential advantages of this innovative proposal may be explored and discussed. Mr. President. I submit for the RECORD an outline of the proposal. The outline follows:",

It should be clear to Members of the House that the third budget resolution presented the Congress with a highly unusual situation. It was made necessary by the needrecognized by allto provide stimulus to the economy. The Budget Committee began with the Presidents stimulus proposals. However. nearly every witness appearing before our committee stated that the Presidents proposals could not achieve his goal of reducing unemployment to about 6.8 percent by the end of 1977. Consequently. both the House and Senate added certain stimulus proposals to assure that the Presidents economic goals were met. These additional proposals were approved by substantial margins in the third budget resolution. The amendments to be offered today make our appropriations actions consistent with the overall level of economic stimulus called for in the third budget resolution. I urge their adoption. and once again commend the Appropriations Committee for its responsiveness to the needs of the economy as expressed through our budget process.",

Surely the hopes of the proponents will be dashed when they behold the effects of what they have done. The Appropriations Committee. which has sent this monster to the House floor. even admits that this additional deficit spending is \"likely to have some inflationary impact over the life of the funds.\" How. then can the Congress proceed to behave in such a manner? I would remind the House that this legislation will cost $5 billion more than the sum recommended by President Carter. I once believed that this kind of legislation was devised to force Republican Presidents into veto situations. but now I am not sure. It seems that this Congress intends also to impose its extravagant spending schemes on the new Democratic President. It is the same old porkbarrel game. and the message Congress is sending President Carter is that he should accept all the pork the Congress creates. Mr. Chairman. reputable economists appearing before the House Budget Committee have told us that the weakest phase of our economy is capital investment. We are not achieving the investment we need for expanding production and creating productive jobs. Investors and potential investors are worried about inflation. energy shortages and the growing costs of Government regulation. Investment requires confidence in the future. In this legislation. the Congress responds with a $22 billion dose of inflationary deficit spending that is certain to increase the alarm of investors and potential investors. Instead of relieving the concerns of the business community. the Congress seems determined to make them worse. Have you forgotten that recession follows inflation as surely as night follows day? Have you forgotten that the deep recession of 1975 was caused by the wild inflation of 1974? Apparently the Congress has forgotten those lessons of recent times. but I have not forgotten them.",

    "speech": "and the Appropriations Committee for their prompt action in authorizing funds for employment and training programs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act in the economic stimulus appropriations bill. The committee recommends $1.140 billion for public service employment under title II which would provide advance funding of the program through fiscal year 1978. This amount would expand the program to 125.000 jobs during fiscal 1978. The bill includes $1 billion to establish a new youth employment and training program. $250 million for a new skill training improvement program. $120 million to establish a program to provide jobs for young veterans. $68 million to expand the Job Corps from its current level of 22.700 slots to 30.000 slots by the end of fiscal 1977. For title VI of CETA. the temporary employment assistance program. the committee recommends a total of $6.847 billion to provide advance funding of the program through fiscal year 1978. This amount would expand the program to 600.000 jobs through September 30. 1978. While I believe it would be possible to expand these programs at a faster rate than is proposed. I believe that such additional expansion might be appropriately considered under the fiscal 1978 appropriations bill. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities. which has jurisdiction over the authorizing legislation. I wish to declare my intention to move this legislation as quickly as possible. The Subcommittee has held 5 days of hearings to date on the extension of CETA and other employment proposalH. We plan to hear this week from the Department of Labor on the administrations proposals in this regard. I hope that it will be possible to report out a bill extending CETA for 1 year within a few days.

What I am trying to do is to square what this bill does with the third budget resolution. I have been trying to discover most of the day whether or not the appropriation bill is above the budget resolution or below the budget resolution and in just what areas it seems to be below. In this particular piece of work it seems to be that in the items entitled \"Accelerated public works.\" the item entitled \"CETA title II and VI\" and the item entitled \"CETA title I. III. and IV.\" the committee has stricken rather substantial amounts which would be made available in fiscal year 1977. but I am persuaded that is not really the case because what this bill apparently does is to appropriate the funds on a noyear basis or a multiyear basis that would be asked for the \"Accelerated public works\" and the two CETAs. And the line entitled \"Outlays\" under House Appropriation Committee action. although it is lower than the comparable sums under the Outlays title for the third budget resolution is simply an estimate of what will be actually spent in fiscal year 1977. As I understand it. it is not a limitation on what can be spent. It is merely an estimate. Now. is that the situation as the Chairman understands it?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today my colleague from Ohio and I will introduce a package of five bills targeted at seven meanstested Federal programs which normally allow individuals who also receive social security to be adversely affected. by automatic costofliving increases in the social security program. Currently. increases in social security benefits are counted as income for the purpose of participation in other Federal aid programs. When the income of a recipient of a meanstested program increases. that benefit does not necessarily go to the individual. Instead. it may be withdrawn in effect by increased rents in public housing. by increased charges for food stamps. by loss of eligibility for programs such as supplemental security incomewhich also affects eligibility for medical care under medicaid. by decreased veterans benefits or similar actions. The purpose of todays legislation is to insure that intended increases in social security income are indeed passed through to the individual. Approximately 40 Members are joining us today in the initial introduction of this legislation. During the 94th Congress. 144 Members endorsed resolutions expressing the sense of the Congress that automatic costofliving increases in social security should not trigger cut backs in Federal or federally assisted programs. In May of 1976. our colleague from New Jersey succeeded in attaching an important amendment to the Housing bill which would have prevented social security recipients from receiving automatic rent hikes at public housing projects as a result of the July increase in their social security checks. This amendment carried in the House by 260 to 99. but was dropped by the Senate. For too long we have given with one hand and taken away with the other. This cruel hoax is worked against those who have been hardest hit by our continuing inflation. the elderly and the poor. The five bills we are introducing at this time. if enacted. would prevent this recurring injustice in the following areas: Veterans pensions for nonservice connected disability and some veterans compensation. certain Federal housing programs. aid for families with dependent children. supplemental security income in some States. medicaid. the food stamp program and distribution of surplus commodities.",

The people of this small Baltic nation. bordering on the Gulf of Finland to the north. have sought throughout the centuries to preserve their cultural heritage and to maintain their political freedom alongside their larger and more powerful neighbors. The Roman historian Tacitus notes that by the first century A.D.. Estonia was already established as a \"national area.\" Throughout the Middle Ages Estonia was forced to continuously defend itself against foreign invaders. succumbing first to the Danish kings. and later. in the 18th century. to Russia. from which she won her independence in 1918. The Estonians cal be particularly proud of many aspects of their national culture. Their University of Tartu. which was founded in 1632. is 4 years older than our own Harvard University. A hardworking and tenacious people. the Estonians living in their homeland today enjoy one of the highest literacy rates99.6 percentof any people under Soviet domination. And their folklore. among the richest in the world. has won praise for its originality and artistic value. In every field of. endeavor. from literature to.the arts. from entertainment to sports.- Estonians have excelled. During the Estonian period of independence from 1918 to 1940. Estonian athletes figured prominently in many of the Olympic games. setting records and winning medals in marksmanship. wrestling. and track and field events. Mr. Speaker. Americans of Estonian ancestry have a heritage of which they can be proud. and I for one am proud that our Nation has never recognized the incorporation .of Estonia into the Soviet Union. On behalf of the people of my congressional district and the State of New Jersey. I join in the observance of Estonian Independence Day. confident in the belief that the United States will continue to champion the right of. selfdetermination for the Estonian people. and for all nations of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce legislation. cosponsored by my colleague. the Honorable B. F. SisK. which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to engage in studies which should ultimately result in the generation of muchneeded additional power in the West. Specifically. the bill authorizes the Interior Departments Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a powerplant feasibility investigation of the Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River in central California. This dam is a vital link in the water resources structure in the southern part of the Central Valley. A Federal energy expansion study evaluation team has recommended that a high priority energy study be conducted in fiscal year 1978 regarding the feasibility of powerplants on the Friant Dam. The evaluation team came to this conclusion after surveying potential power projects in the 17 Western States last summer. The average annual runoff of the San Joaquin -iver at the dam site is significant--1.800.000 acrefeet of water. The hydroelectric energy which could be generated from this runoff would be considerable too. An appraisalgrade. analysis of potential hydropower at Friant Dam shows a total capacity of 22.700 kilowatts. with a generation potential of 130.800.000 kilowatt hours per year. . The negative environmental effects of the construction of power facilities are considered to be minor and we have been told that there should be no adverse effects on the dam itself nor on the canal areas. In fact. any environmental effects would be positive. in view of the fact that hydroelectric energy is pollution free. It has been estimated that Friant Dam powerplants would conserve over 200.000 barrels of oil per year by means of the energy generated. Thus. air pollution would be significantly reduced. while clean energy now being wasted would be effectively utilized. We are pleased to submit this bill.",

This winters freezing temperatures paralyzed river transportation from the Hudson to the Mississippi and stalled barges carrying precious supplies of fuel to beleagured schools. factories. homes and office buildings. Fuel shortages closed schools. silenced factories and laid off more than 2 million workers. President Carter declared nine StatesNew York. Pennsylvania. Ohio. Indiana. Michigan. New Jersey. Maryland. Virginia. and Floridadisaster areas qualifying for emergency assistance. Western New York State. particularly the Buffalo area. already blanketed by more than 14 feet of snow since the fall. reeled under the harsh winter as more than 300.000 residents in that part of the State joined the unemployment lines. thereby contributing to an estimated economic loss of more than $225 million in two of the nine Presidentially declared disaster counties. Mr. Speaker. this Nation has become dependent upon oil. gas and electricity for its energy sources and upon foreign nations to bridge the widening gap between what this Nation demands to feed its insatiable energy appetite and what the Nation produces. We have recently experienced an oil embargo and a gas shortage. and as more homes. schools. factories and office buildings turn to electricity for heating and air conditioning. we have experienced increased massive power failures from overloaded electrical circuits. These energy crises and the dependency upon foreign nations to replenish our dwindling energy supplies can no longer be tolerated. We must conserve our energy. We must recognize that we do not have unlimited energy resources. and we must learn to accept the economic fact that this Nations energy demands have exceeded its productive capabilities.

I am today introducing a bill to authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to find a solution to the siltation problems at Februdry 24. 1977 Quincy Bay and in the area of Broad and Triangle Lakes on the Mississippi River adjacent to Quincy. Ill. Congress failed to act on an identical bill I introduced during the last session. The committee to which the bill was assigned asked the Department of the Army and the Office of Management and Budget for reports on July 14 of last year. No reports were received. however. before the session ended. which explains the lack of further legislative action.

I urge the Congress and appropriate agencies to act speedily. and I will do all that I can do to encourage prompt response. The Quincy Bay. Broad and Triangle Lakes and Willow Slough areas in the Mississippi River have provided unparallelled recreational opportunities for people in west central Illinois for over 100 years. Unfortunately. these areas have been damaged gradually over the years by siltation. filling in slowly at first but more rapidly in recent years to the point where waters previously used for water sport are so shallow that they cannot be traversed even by shallowdraft watercraft. Gravel and rock washed down from hilly regions above and silt from the river forms mudbars and have already deposited 3 to 4 million cubic yards of material. The lower Broad Lake area that was dredged some years ago for fill for a new railroad bridge was originally 25 to 30 feet deep but is now less than 15 feet deep in most parts. The dredging of the Quincy Bay area coupled with other conservation and hydraulic engineering changes. should preserve Quincy Bay and the surrounding area for the recreational use of generations to come.",

Thirtyone different public interest. health care. labor. and business onganizations have gathered together and. in a single voice. have urged enactment of hospital cost containment legislation this year as a \"critical antiinflation measure.\" Mr. President. we have proposed a hospital cost containment measure that will save the American economy more than $30 billion in the course of the next 5 years. $11 to $12 billion of that would be saved by the Federal Government. Another $1.5 to $2 billion would be saved by the States. and the rest in the private sector.

One way in which this Is occurring is through the increasing level of Government regulations. Even more insidious. however. is the control of our economy caused by the expansion of Government. This year total U.S. Federal outlays will be greater than the gross national product of every single country of the world except the Soviet Uniongreater than the whole economy of every other nation. Further. Federal outlays will account for 23.2 percent of the U.S. GNP this year. That is. more than $1 out of every $5 spent in this country in 1978 will be spent by the Federal Government. Thus. not only is the economy placed under Government regulation. but for $1 out of every $5 spent the Federal Government is the economy. Mr. President. this is not productive employment. It saps the strength of our economy. If we are to restore health to our economy. as S. 50 purports to do. then including a goal for the reduction of Federal outlays is not only complementary to the other goals of the bill. but important for their achievement. A good step in this direction is found in the Banking Committee version of the bill. which calls for a slight reduction in the percentage of GNP accounted for by Federal outlays. It is a good step. but it is not sufficient. The provision presently in the bill establishes an interim goal of 21 percent of GNP and a longerterm goal of 20 percent of GNP within 5 years. During the 1950s and the 1960s. however. the situation was even better than the level called for by these goals: Federal outlays accounted for approximately 19 percent of GNP. Mr. President. my amendment would lower the percentage goals in the bill by a mere 1 percent to 20 percent and 19 percent. respectively. In so doing. however. we would be bringing the percentage of Government in our economy closer to its historic level. before the budget bulge of the late 1960s and the 1970s.0",

The concern is expressed that pursuit of lower inflation will result in greater unemployment. The other side of this theory. which is mentioned less often. is that greater employment will necessarily result in higher levels of inflation. If this argument is correct. then it raises a serious concern that the lowering of unemployment cannot be achieved. for it is clear that the American people will not stand for any higher levels of our already too high inflation. That message is clear. Ask anyone in the street. and they will tell you that inflation is the biggest problem facing the Nation. You can even ask George Meany. Mr. President. I reject the theory that there is a necessary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. I think that history shows that the reverse is true. that periods of high inflation have often led to recession and high unemployment. This is particularly true at the present time. when the causes of both our unemployment and inflation are largely structural. Attention directed toward these structural problems need not result in the tradeoff. which sometimes occurs when macroeconomic policies alone are implemented. My amendment recognizes this. It recognizes the need for coordinatingI stress coordinatingour policies for the achievement of both goals of reducing unemployment and inflation. It is a minor amendment. It clarifies wording. making clearer that there is need for achieving both reduced inflation and lower unemployment for either to be meaningful.*",

These corporations were to be the vehicles through which lands and moneys would be channeled in settlement of the aboriginal rights of the Alaska Natives. All of the Alaska Natives within the regional boundaries of these corporations were to become stockholders in their respective regional corporation. In furtherance of this act 12 regional corporations were established and the Alaska Natives are now stockholders in these corporations. The Native corporations were allowed to select some 44 million acres of Alaska lands in settlement of their claims. In addition the corporations were to receive payment of some $950 million in cash. To date approximately 5.3 million acres of land have been conveyed and less than $400 million has been paid. In the process of setting themselves up in business these Native corporations have been faced with severe potential tax liabilities which threaten their very existence. Through the Internal Revenue laws we are threatening to undue the work we undertook in the 1971 legislation. My amendment is intended to resolve these issues in a manner which does minimal violence to principles of sound tax policy. The amendments which I propose here have been reviewed by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and approved for inclusion in their Alaska lands bill. Because of objections to other provisions of that bill it appears likely that it will not receive floor action this year. The tax problems of the native corporations are pressing and therefore it appears appropriate to include these changes in this tax legislation.",

Take a look at some of the subjects for which these awards were presented. and try to calculate their value to the public. It is impossible to measure the injuries. and even deaths. that might have been prevented by consumeroriented stories about a defective or dangerous product. It is impossible to measure in dollars and cents the benefits consumers realized after being alerted through the media of the costbenefit analysis of various products. You cannot put a price tag on the service the media is doing in the area of consumer reporting. but it is an indisputable fact that their efforts offer the only opportunity for many people to receive muchneeded consumer information.

The prospect for peace in the Middle East. once merely a mirage. now appears to have form and substance. Negotiations are opening between Egypt and Israel. In reflecting on Camp David and the future security of Israel. it is necessary to keep in mind the very closeness of war and the impact of this reality on Israels people. The fear of nightly terror and attack and the fragile ceasefire on Israels borders are fiction but a tragic way of life for most Israeli citizens. Last spring. my friend and colleague. rerator BoB PACKWOOD of Oregon. returned from a visit to Israel and to the UN buffer zone in southern Lebanonthe first Member of Congress to observe the peacekeeping efforts in this area since the Israeli move into Lebanon. His diary of this trip was published recently by the Federation News of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater Washington.

    "speech": "TO LEBANON (By U.S. Senator ROBERT PACKWOOD) This story should probably start with a confession. When Georgie and I visited Israel this spring. we were both excited to again see this beautiful country. We had not been back for a number of years. The situation in March of 1978. with the recent occupation of Southern Lebanon. was especially tense. I knew that no member of the American Congress had been into the Israelioccupied area of Southern Lebanon. In the back of my mind I hoped I could see it firsthand. I also knew that any official request on my behalf could prove embarrassing to the Israeli government and that was the last thing I wanted. So. as we made the long journey by plane. I decided to \"play it by ear.\" After all. who knew where our journeys would take us? On Tuesday. March 28. we were at the Golan Heights. I wrote in my diary. \"We crossed the River Jordan at the Sea of Galilee and after a brief stop for lunch went up to an Israeli bunker on the Golan Heights. The dedication of the troops occupying the bunker was obvious. This was a bunker that looked eastward across the long sloping plain toward Damascus. It gave Israel a very commanding position. I can understand why Israel is reluctant to give up the Golan Heights. To give Syria back those dominating heights from which she could shell Israels agricultural developments would be worse than foolIsh. It would be folly. \"We turned down the hill a bit and came to the UN buffer zone. We viewed it from an Israeli outpost flying an Israeli flag. A hundred yards further flew the flag of the United Nations. No more than a hundred yards beyond that. the Syrian flag. I began to realize how closely these people have lived together for almost 4.000 years. \"At this stage. Georgie and I split from the group we are traveling with and went to Safed. We had been there on our trip in 1971. It is a picturesque artists village. and we had bought a painting there which now hangs in our home. We looked forward to returning to this beautiful spot on the evening of March 28. Safed is as enchanting as we remembered it.",

The American specialty steel industry has now discovered and perfected a method by which it can use the lower grade nonRhodesian ores. Thus. I have no further argument on the economics of this matter. The only thing that has to be done by this country is to assure that the other nonRhodesian sources are made available to us. I have talked to the chairman of this committee. Mr. FRASER. and he understands the economic situation. I have also talked to the White House and they understand the economic and supply situation. Both Mr. FRASER and the President agree that we cannot be put in a position where we are subject to economic blackmail by the Soviet Union. Those steel producing countries that are competing with us are still buying their ore directly and indirectly from Rhodesia.

Since 1971. we have been importing chrome from Rhodesia as a result of passage of the Byrd amendment. The language of the amendment states that any strategic material imported from a Communist country cannot be banned from imnortation from a nonCommunist country. One of the major reasons advanced for passage of the Byrd amendment was that chrome was a critical strategic material and the only alternative source of chrome other than Rhodesia was the Soviet Union. We have been hearing that technological innovations have rendered this argument invalid. Due to a technique known as argonoxygen decarbonization. the U.S. steel industry can get along with lower grade chrome from other suppliers. particularly South Africa. but also countries such as India. Brazil. Turkey. and the Philippines. The Soviet Union has in the past provided a major source of chrome for U.S. markets and no doubt will continue to do so. The issue which we are debating today revolves around bringing the United States into compliance with U.N. imposed economic sanctions against Rhodesia. because of that countrys attitudes and practices against its black citizens. Yet passage of H.R. 1746 would embody the most blatant sort of hypocrisy. We assail Rhodesia for its record on human rights and use this as a rationale for curtailing all trade with that country. However. what about the nations which would fill in the trade gaps left by withdrawal of Rhodesian chrome? Would anyone care to comment on the Soviet Unions record on human rights? or Indias? If H.R. 1746 were passed. then the United States would be one of very few U.N. members which actually honor the economic embargo against Rhodesia. It is interesting to note that the Soviet Union and many of her Eastern European allies covertly carry on trade with Rhodesia. under cover of Swiss companies acting as middlemen. The United States at least has never tried to hide her actions in this regard. H.R. 1746 is bad legislation. because it takes a moralistic aproach to foreign affairs. but on a highly selective and discriminatory basis and consequently. I shall vote against it.",

This important legislation is a significant step toward the objective of providLng safe drinking water to the American public. It has opened the way for an allout effort by towns and municipalities all over the Nation to insure that its residents have the safest and cleanest water possible. I would like to commend the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment for their fine work in this legislation. My esteemed colleague from Florida has provided outstanding leadership in guiding this bill through his subcommittee. The subcommittee has worked tirelessly in seeking to resolve the problems of equitably providing clean drinking water for the American public. At this time. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an issue which I presented to the subcommittee in April. I have introduced legislation. H.R. 2317. which would authorize grants under the Safe Drinking Water Act to communities to clean and update their water lines for the purpose of meeting the requirements under this act. The uniform minimum standards for drinking water quality that must be met under the act constitute a significant financial burden to many of those municipalities and townships which must comply with the regulations. H.R. 2317 is designed to alleviate the financial hardships placed on many towns by the regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The need for assistance to municipalities that are attempting to carry out the law and the beneficial effects to be derived by millions of Americans from such assistance cannot be dismissed. It is contrary to the public interest to have any public drinking water which poses threats to human health. and thus appropriate for the Federal Government to share the burden of this cost. Mr. Speaker. I direct my colleagues attention to this deficiency in the Safe Drinking Water Act. and urge subsequent legislation providing a grant program to communities in order that we might effectively and efficiently insure clean drinking water for all Americans.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 6827. Safe Drinking Water Amendments of 1977. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 was passed in response to a number of outbreaks of disease that were clearly attributable to contaminated drinking water. The act established a joint FederalState regulatory system in which the Federal Environmental Protection Agency was charged with setting national drinking water standards and the States were given primary responsibility for enforcing these standards. It also provided a 3year authorization for the Federal Government to provide technical assistance. information. training. and grants to the States for the purpose of improving their implementation of safe drinking water programs. These authorizations are due to expire at the end of fiscal year 1977. The legislation before us allows these essential programs to continue by authorizing appropriations of $71 million for fiscal year 1977 and of $81 million for fiscal year 1978. In addition. the bill would establish an emergency assistance program for those localities requiring emergency intervention in cases where acutely hazardous conditions appear to endanger public health. In addition to the acute problems that brought this issue to the attention of the Congress a few years ago. the public has become increasingly aware of and concerned about chronic exposure to lowlevel contaminants. including. in some cases. cancercausing agents. in the water supply. To deal with this problem. the proposed legislation directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to undertake a study of the interaction of such chemicals as chlorine. humic acids. and polychlorinated biphenyls and of their potential effects on the toxicity of drinking water. It seems ironic to me that a country with the technological capabilities of our own should allow its citizens to be subJected to substandard conditions of basic hygiene. I am concerned about reports that in some middleclass communities. residents have taken to drinking bottled water. out of concern over the safety of their tap water. Not everyone. and certainly not the residents of my district. can afford this luxury. Let us not neglect this basic responsibility to all of our citizens.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the Committee on Public Works and Transportation today commends to the House the bill H.R. 7462. to provide an obligation limitation of $7.445 billion for fiscal year 1978. on all Federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs. except for the raection 125 emergency relief program. and to prescribe procedures for administering the obligation limitation. This bill is a safeguard to assure that the administration of the Federalaid highway program will conform to congressional intent within a ceiling on obligations during fiscal year 1978. It would achieve this by providing program direction to the Department of Transportation. preventing undue control of the program through administrative discretion with respect to rate of obligations. priority among programs and projects and otherwise. Thus. it would assure that the program function and projects be approved in accordance with law. provided only that the obligation ceiling not be exceeded. H.R. 7462 is fully consistent with the ceiling contained in the transportation appropriations conference report for fiscal year 1978. The conference report contains a $7.445 billion ceiling and exempts from the ceiling the obligations for emergency relief under section 125 of title 23. United States Code. Emergency relief obligations during fiscal year 1978 should be approximately $100 million. The conference report further provides that the limitation shall not take effect if separate legislation containing an obligation limitation on the highway program is enacted by September 30. 1977. H.R. 7462 is such legislation. Mr. Speaker. and I know of no Member of this body who opposes what we are attempting to do. The bill gives statutory expression to congressional intent that imposition of an obligation ceiling not lead to such administrative manipulation as disrupted the program during the practice of impoundment. Because of the time constraint in the conference report of enacting this legislation by September 30. 1977. floor action on this bill must necessarily be fast. It is for this reason that this bill is being brought to the floor under suspension of the rules. Mr. Speaker. we believe the bill strikes a proper balance between budgetary requirements and program needs. It is similar to one which passed the House last year under suspension of the rules. We commend it to the House and urge its adoption.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. I wish to associate myself completely with the remarks of the distinguished chairman of our subcommittee. who stated the overwhelming case for adoption of this bill. The issue at stake here is not a partisan one. Indeed. H.R. 7462 was cosponsored by the subcommittee chairman and myself and .upported by the majority and minority of our public works and transportation committee without dissent. Thus. this measure addresses the amount of money that should be made available for obligation under the Federalaid highway program. and not where it should be spent. The bill is a simple one. Mr. Speaker. It sets an obligational ceiling of $7.445 billion on highway trust fund programs for fiscal year 1978. which is identical to the present ceiling of $7.2 billion when you addin two presently exempted programs. It is totally consistent with congressional budget limitations and with the ceiling contained in the fiscal year 1978 DOT Appropriations Act. H.R. 7462 goes beyond the simple imposition of an obligational ceiling. however. by giving statutory assurance that the ceiling may not be used as a tool to manipulate the program. This is a serious concern to our committee and should be to all members when you consider the fact the $7.445 billion ceiling would be imposed at a time when unobligated apportionments could total $11.6 billion. This bill makes clear that no single category or group of categories or projects should be favored in the release of funds. so that ideally the highway program can proceed uninterrupted. For example. it is the intent of the legislation that funds should be obligated to the States on a firstcome. first served basis. up to the limit of their apportionments until the national ceiling is reached. This is a very important point which is only addressed in this bill. H.R. 7462 also requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress on the rate at which funds are being obligated in the various programs. so that if States are able to proceed faster than anticipated. consideration can be given to adjusting the program modestly if hardships are imposed on individual States. Mr. Speaker. this is a simple. straightforward. but extremely important bill. and I urge its adoption.",

I fully support this measure and commend the chairman and members of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation for bringing it to the floor. As my colleagues know. last year we imposed a ceiling on obligations from the highway trust fund in the transportation appropriations bill. over the strong objections of the members of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. I am pleased that this year we have reached an accommodation on this matter. so that the appropriations bill and this measure include the same dollar level ceiling for fiscal year 1978. This measure also includes appropriate safeguards to insure that the limitation on obligations will not permit the Department of Transportation to manipulate the priorities inherent in the highway funding process. The ceiling of $7.445 billion will not unduly curb progress in the construction of our highways. but will provide for orderly and responsible progress towards the completion of the interstate highway system.

I rise in support of H.R. 7738. a bill which deals with the powers of the President in time of war or national emergency. Let me briefly outline. the reasons why I urge its adoption under suspension of the rules. First. this is essentially a bill establishing procedures. and not a bill that sets out or judges specific policies. It reorganizes relevant pieces of legislation. creating a new act in the process. and provides a more consistent and appropriate framework for Presidential authorities. Second. the committee in its deliberations has attempted to respond to the administrations concerns in this area. The committee particularly sought to minimize executive branch policy problems during the transition period to a new legislative framework and even after that point. Specifically. we have stipulated Presidential discretion to continue any controls currently in effect. Third. the committee has tried to create a necessary analog to the war powers legislation passed by this committee and the Congress in 1973. Congress is as much at fault as any administration if it allows a President to carry out policies. wise or unwise. under blanket authority granted by defective legislative statute. This bill will. I hope and expect. in conjunction with the War Powers Act. call the President to task before the Congress and produce the policy justifications Congress has the right to expect. This will restore an organic relationship between the two branches. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which has. in my opinion. been drafted free of any controversial policy overtones.",

I think Mr. Warnke agrees. most of the Senators agree. So there are a wide range of reasons for not. voting for Mr. Warnke. I have complete confidence in him. I might say there is one more very significant guard against any error that I and Mr. Warnke and the Secretary of State and others might make.

What a negotiator has to consider is not only what our own technological capacity is or may be in the future. but what is likely to happen in the Soviet Union. A man that makes such grievous errors of judgment in terms of our own technological capability in an open society like ours is likely to make even greater and more serious miscalculations in terms of technological trends in a closed society like the Soviet Union. That is my concern. It is not just that we get the Soviets to reduce their nuclear capability and that we reduce our nuclear capability. but that they be reduced commensurately to the extent there is at least a rough equivalency. None in anybodys arsenal would be ideal. But we better beef up our conventional forces or we face other hazards. The theory is that if we are in a stalemate. we are more likely to fight a conventional war. But the point I would like to make is the reductions have to be. if not symmetrical. asymmetrical to the extent the advantages do not lie to the other side. If it lies to our side. splendid. but I do not think it is going to. But if we cut our nuclear arsenal down substantially and they cut theirs. but still the margin between the two is sufficiently high in their favor. they might be tempted if not to launch an initial strike. at least to engage in political adventures in which they would know we could do nothing about it: that is to say. they could use the threat without firing a shot and achieve some political objectives we do not want them to achieve.",

The thrust of my remarks was not that Mr. Warnke had been against any one particular weapon. but the fact that he had been against all of the major improvements as outlined by Senator JACKSON in his questioning on page 17 of the Armed Services Committee hearings. It is not any one. It is the combination. all of them put together. because reasonable people can disagree. as the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and I might well disagree on a particular weapon. I did have a little concern when I heard the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire say that the accuracy of these intercontinental ballistic missiles frightened him. I hope he was speaking of the accuracy of the Russians or any potential enemy. rather than the accuracy of the weapons that our own country has. When he referred to me. and if I understand him correctly. that I would favor our having 4 million men under arms because the Soviet Union has 4 million men under arms. of course. that is not correct. But I do not see that we can compete with the Soviet Union or with Red China. their combined total is over 7 million under arms. but I feel that when we cannot compete with them manpowerwise. then we must be superior in weaponry and equipment in order to obtain an equal balance.

They discuss Mr. Warnkes personal qualities. and his past career. They emphasize that he is a gentleman. which he surely is. and that he is a distinguished public servant. They infer that his integrity is being impugned. and that it is somehow impolite to question his judgment. But I have yet to hear any of his advocates address themselves in any objective way to this Nations duty and. consequently. the duty of the representatives who will be dealing with the Soviet Union in arms control negotiations and in form formulating U.S. arms control policy. If the Senate will bear with me. the Senator from North Carolina would like to take a few minutes of the time allotted to him to examine the kind of problems that must be solved by Mr. Warnke if he is confirmed for the two posts to which he is nominated. Last week. I was privileged to be selected as ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Arms Control of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is from this perspective that I will discuss Mr. Warnkes nomination. What we have to do in the Senate. Mr. President. is to decide whether Mr. Warnkes views and past decisions qualify him to deal realistically with the problems at hand. Much has been said questioning his views. and attempting to ascertain just what they are at the present time. Sometimes the focus has been very intense on this statement or that statement. and the media have often interpreted this intensity as an attempt to dispute Mr. Warnkes veracity and integrity. For my part. I do not question Mr. Warnkes integrity. The real question is whether this man can deal with the Soviets in a fashion to protect the security of the American peopleindeed. the free world. It is a question of whether he understands what the Soviets always seek to achieve whenever and wherever they sit down to negotiate.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am cosponsoring legislation to remove the ceiling on outside earnings of social security recipients because I find the Federal Government laws are discriminatory and must be abolished. At present the law restricts outside earnings for social security recipients to $3.000. Every dollar earned above this limit is taxed at the confiscatory rate of 50 percent. In other words. for every dollar earned over $3.000. a recipient forfeits 50 cents in social security income. The law discriminates against the elderly by discouraging social security recipients. most of whom are over 60. from working. And it discriminates against the poor. who might otherwise try to boost their earnings after retirement. since retirees with substantial earnings or sizable investments do not lose their social security benefits. By placing a limit on the amount of money a recipient can earn. we are defeating the original intent of our social security system. to- supplement a retirees income. And finally. with our high rate of inflation. it is impractical and unfair to maintain any kind of limit on the earnings of social security recipients. Mr. Speaker.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics. over 600.000 babies were born to teenage girls in 1973. One of every five births that year was to a teenager.

But for the life of me there is one disagreement reported in the press that makes no sense. That is. does full employment pay? We hear it reported in the Washington Post that reaching 4 percent unemployment. as called for in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. would entail large expenditures with reference to benefits. But I suggest the converse is. without question. true. Full employment pays and always has. It is sustained. hardcore unemployment that really costs. The expenditures in programs to get people working and give them the skills to keep working are the same as investments by businessmen. A tractor \"costs\" a farmer thousands of dollars. but he buys it. because of what it pays in return. the logic of full employment advocates is that simple. As with the farmer. the expenditures for employment gains must be in advance of the benefits. And what is the evidence? I cite an excellent new study by Associate Professor of Economics Steven Sheffrin of the University of California at Davis. Published by the Exploratory Project for Economic Alternatives. the brightest new thinktank on the Washington scene. the study chronicles the value of production this country has permanently foregone in the past due to great unemploymentand relates a specter of future loss. still avoidable. if our resolve to lessen unemployment is not established now. and firmly pursued. Professor Sheffrin questions why the United States cannot sustain an unemployment rate comparable to that prevalent in Europe. usually 2 to 3 percent. But because many doubt the achievability of such a rate in the United States. he also examines what would have happened had we maintained a simple 4percent growth in GNP over the past 20 years. sufficient to keep unemployment at the average 4.1 percent it was in 1956a year. incidentally. without war. and before the great productivity increase in the population embodied in the postSputnik education surge.

    "speech": "Mr. President. what these tables show. for example. is that in 1976 alone. we washed away forever $290 billion worth of products and services by following outmoded economic theories. Professor Sheffrins further research also shows how much tax revenue has been lost. In 1976. for example. the Treasury would have had $98 billion more for the services necessary in a decent and civilized 20th century society. JThis is. as this Chamber has been repeatedly reminded. due to increased colqection from a larger earnings base in tke population. Mr. President. I do not blame the econ\\omistsat least not all of them. Professor Sheifrin. for example. is a credit to. the emerging schools within that old profession. As with Socrates. it can be saint. he makes us think. Will thinking make us act? The door is open to passage of the revised Humphrey/Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act which places the most powerful Government ever on the face of the Earth on record for compassion and commonsense. Professor Sheffrins projections show that by the year 2000. reaching the European range 2 percentwhich I believe can be done if our sons and daughters are wiser than we have beenwould mean $500 billion greater GNP in 1976 dollars than sustaining only a 6.5percent rate. I respectfully ask all of my colleagues to think of this carefully and in human terms. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles on the new study be printed in the RECORD.",

ERISA. Several letters to my office have suggested that reporting requirements for small businesses are costly and have resulted in many such businesses terminating retirement plans that they once created for the benefit of their employees. ERISA requires employers to publish a summary plan description (SPD) which fully describes retirement plans that apply to employees. Lincoln National Life. a Fort Wayne. Ind.. insurance company has published a 17page booklet which provides guidelines for the preparation of SPDs by its customers. but even with such guidelines. legal assistance is often required to comply with the law. In rural States like Wyoming. that assistance is just not available. and even where it is available. it is extremely expensive. In a thoughtful letter. a constituent of mine has suggested one way of relieving much of the paperwork that ERISA SPD requirements generate: Provide an exemption from the requirement to complete SPDs for employers with fewer than 100 employees. I fully endorse this suggestion and urge that as the Labor Subcommittee looks into ERISA reform. it consider a rules change such as this one which could relieve small businesses from needless burdens.

This was just 2 years ago. Yet. in 2 years time. under Brads aggressive management style. UNDP has made a dramatic recovery. As reporter Pranay Gupte noted in the November 6 New York Times: Last year alone he (Morse) raised more than $26 million to help end the programs deficit. and this week he scored yet another achievementat an annual pledging conference here the agency was able to raise $570 million in voluntary contributions for next years budget. a record.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as my distinguished colleague from Louisiana knows. I am greatly concerned about a section of the public utilities portion of H.R. 8444. which deals with ratesetting by State utility agencies. This section. section 515. states thatThe rates of any electric utility which is a state agency shall be. consistent with section 511(a). based on the total costs of all electric energy generated by all facilities of the entire system of such utility. and all electric energy purchased by such utility which is sold by such utility. This section defines \"State utility agency\" as \"an agency of a State (not including any political subdivision or agency thereof) which is an electric utility.\" The reason for my concern stems from the fact that my State buys a substantial amount of hydroelectric power from the Power Authority of the State of New York (PASNY) which is a State utility agency as defined under this Section. Section 515 would force PASNY to substantially alter the manner in which the authority sets its rates. Electricity produced by PASNY is generated from a number of sources. Hydroelectric power represents just one of these sources. and it is the cheapest and most environmentally acceptable source. Currently. PASNYs customers pay for the electricity they buy only according to the cost of the source which generates that electricity. Thus a customer who buys electricity generated by hydroelectric power. which is relatively inexpensive to produce. pays low rates. Another customer who buys electricity generated with oil. which is more expensive to produce. will pay higher rates. Under section 515. PASNY would be required to charge all of its customers one uniform \"postage stamp\" rate. regardless of what kind of power they actually buy. and regardless of how much that power cost to produce. Thus a customer who bought only electricity that was generated with inexpensive hydrolectric power would be forced to pay for the cost of producing more expensive oil- or nuclearbased electricity in another part of the PASNY system. Is this my distinguished colleagues understanding of this provision?",

It goes without saying that this is extremely significant legislation. especially for those of us in the Metropolitan Boston area where such a high volume of liquifled natural gas finds its way through our city streets and highways on a daily basis. I would like to take this opportunity to register my support of the DingelMarkey bill governing the transportation of LNG and LPG through densely populated urban areas such as Boston. National media attention has been focused on the city of Boston in recent weeks. as officials from almost every level of the city and State government registered their strong opposition to the continued transportation of LNG through the heart of the city. Some of the statistics cited on national television are overwhelming. Experts have agreed that if the LNG commonly carried in one tanker. approximately 125.000 cubic meters. were to accidently escape for any variety of reasons. it could expand to cause a lowlying vapor cloud that would drift with the prevailing winds and cover an area of many square miles. If 40 cubic meters of LNG in one truck. perhaps half a load. were to spill and vaporize. it could mix with air and produce enough flammable gas to fill more than 110 miles of sewer lines or 15 miles of subway lines. These are especially significant and awesome statistics for my constituents in the city of Boston because most of New Englands LNG supply is shipped through the city of Boston on the southeast expressway. I do not doubt the necessity of insuring a continued supply of LNG to New England. Obviously. LNG is a very necessary element in the Northeastern areas energy picture.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to announce that the city of Philadelphia will construct a new sludge recycling center as part of its program to promote cleaner streams and phase out the dumping of sludge in the ocean. According to an announcement by Mayor Frank L. Rizzo. the $11 million center will be located next to the new Southwest Water Pollution Control Plant. at 80th Street and Penrose Ferry Road. It will provide for the dewatering. drying. composting. cleansing. storage. bagging. and distribution of digested sludge and sludgebased products. This project will promote cleaner water throughout the entire Philadelphia area. and will make use of waste product for enriching the soil. The center will occupy 38 acres of vacant land. Water Commissioner Carmen F. Guarino says the center will supply rich and usable soil conditioners to what will be a growing market in future years. The sludge. Mr. Speaker. will be given away and sold to homeowners. farmers. gardeners. horticultural firms. wholesalers. and other outlets. Eventually the center will be able to fill up to 1 million 40lb. bags a year. besides distributing thousands of tons in dry bulk or liquid form by truck. The new center will be built in three phases between 1979 and 1981. The first phase will provide for processing 60 dry tons of sludge a day. and the second phase an additional 150 tons. Thus by 1982. the center will have the capacity to convert over 76.000 dry tons of digested sludge (equal to all of Philadelphias current annual output) into soil conditioner each year. Guarino said that the plan calls for the pumping of digested sludge from the southeast and southwest sewage treatment plants to the recycle center. There. part of the sludge will be naturally dried in a dozen openair drying beds. and then composted to increase the drying process. Special treatment will be given to another part of the sludge. intended for sale. This will be mixed with wood chips and then force dried through perforated air pipes laid under the sludge in another area. This process will take 21 days. The resulting product will then be cured. screened for removal of wood chips. and shredded. Phase 1 construction in 1979 will include: Air drying beds. forced aeration beds. and a curing. shredding. screening area. A storage area for dewatered sludge ready for composting. and for large",

My resolution would put into effect the 8.4 percent pay adjustment which the Presidents pay advisers have recommended to achieve comparability between current public employeemilitary pay levels and private industry pay raises since There has been much talk from the administration about the need for the Government to \"set an example\" for private industry in the fight against inflation. This is a commendable goal. but in singling out one sector of the eonomy for wage controls. the President has chosen an unfair and ineffective vehicle for providing an example to business. I have stated repeatedly. the Comparability Pay Act does not authorize costofliving increases. rather it directs that regular pay adjustments be made to bring military and Federal pay up to levels of comparable private industry salary increases. A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office found pay caps in the past to have been an ineffective means of setting an example for private industry (see \"Capping Federal Pay: Alternative Pay Adjustments for 1979.\" Congressional Budget Office report. August 1978). This new report shows that \"in the 6 months following the 1975 (Federal pay) cap. major wage settlements in the private sector averagesfor the first year10.4 percent as compared with 9.4 percent for the preceding 6 months.\" Todays issue of Business Week contains an excellent article which further illustrates the ineffectiveness of pay caps in setting an example for private industry. My colleagues will recall that in the spring of this year. President Carter announced his intention to freeze Federal and military pay as such an example. well in advance of any reliable data on what private industry increases would be. or what size of pay adjustment would be necessary to bring about comparability under the law. This artile \"A Boom in WhiteCollar Salaries\" (Business Week. September 11. page 50) makes it clear that private whitecollar salaries have risen far faster than the level which the President seeks to impose on employees under his control.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. mandatory retirement practices in Federal and private sector employment represent one of the last vestiges of legally condoned employment discrimination. The forced retirement of older Americans at the arbitrary age of 63 i.3 an unconscionable waste of the talent. expertise. and perspective that these workers can bring to the Nations labor force. Therefore. I am glad to have the opportunity to support legislation designed to reduce the incidence of mandatory retirement. H.R. 5383. a bill developed as a result of the efforts of my able colleagues Congressmen CLAUDE PEPPER. PAUL FINDLEY. TED WEIss. and HENRY WAXMAN would amend the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act which currently governs much of the mandatory retirement policies in the Federal and private sectors. In passing the 1967 legislation. the Congress was acknowledging the need to respond to the employment problems faced by older American workers. The 1967 law protected older workers between the ages of 40 and 65 from arbitrary forced retirement. It is ironic that by establishing age 65 as the limit for protection under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. the law served to institutionalize the age of 65 as a signal to the end of an employees usefulness. To combat the continuance of these irrationally arbitrary policies. H.R. 5383 makes several changes in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. all of which have my support. First. it increases the laws protections in the private sector to include those workers between ages 65 and 70. Additionally. it would clarify section 4(f) (2) of the ADEA to help eliminate the use of pension plans or seniority systems as a mechanism to force early retirement. Third. the legislation calls for a study to evaluate the impact of forced retirement systems. with a particular emphasis on the feasibility of ending mandatory retirement in the private sector all together. But the most important feature of the legislation is the provision placing the Federal Government in the forefront of the battle against age discrimination by eliminating forced retirement in most Federal employment systems. I believe that elimination of mandatory retirement systems is necessary if we are to be able to have a work force that Is free of arbitrary discrimination based senselessly on an individuals race. sex. creed. handicap. or age. and instead permits those with ability and talent to remain productive and have a chance to contribute to the economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. those of us serving rural areas find worries of continued delivery of adequate health care prevalent among our mail and our visits with constituents. Urban America may well have enough doctors. but rural areas like South Dakota do not. Not only do we have many counties with no resident physicians. but our overall doctorpatient ratio is one of the highest in the Nationand these doctors are not getting any younger. I commend to the attention of my colleagues this thoughtful editorial on the subject from the Bennett County Booster II. published by Wendell Long at Martin. S. Dak. People who live in rural areas will find this hard to believe. but federal health policy makers are now becoming concerned that they may soon have too many doctors. Although estimates vary. the United States faces an increase of 28 percent to 40 percent or more in the supply of physicians. Since economists calculate that each physician generates $250.000 or more in salary. fees and other charges. such a growth in the number of doctors is alarming to policymakers trying to find ways of bringing the rising cost of medical care under control. Between 1963 and 1973 the federal government. trying to relieve a perceived shortage of doctors and nurses. spent about $3.5 billion to develop medical personnel. In 1971. acting to meet estimated shortage of 50.000 physicians. Congress increased medical school openings from 9.000 to an estimated 16.000 by 1979. By 1976. the pendulum had begun swinging the other way. The Carnegie Council on Higher Education warned that \"we are in serious danger of developing too many medical schools.\" In that same year. Congress enacted legislation aimed at easing geographic and specialty shortages by providing incentives to medical students to enter these specialties and to practice in areas where shortages exist. The law also moved to restrict the entry of foreign medical graduates. who. since the early 1950s. have been filling an increasingly large number of positions in the United States. No consensus exists on the ideal ratio of population per physician. The United States now has about 175 physicians per 100.000 population. placing it behind Israel. the Soviet Union. Italy and West Germany. By 1990. according to the current estimates. the United States will have anywhere from 225 to 240 or more physicians per 100.000.",

Incredibly enough. proponents of Clinch River are still claiming the opposite. For example. in the latest \"bunny\" breeder briefs. dated September 16. Mr. MCCORMACK and Mr. GOLDWATER state: In the nuclear fuel cycle. plutonium would never be produced by itself and would never exist in any form where it could be used in a nuclear weapon. While this statement is true for the current generation of light water reactors. it is not true with plutonium breeder reactors as they are presently planned. U.S. weapons experts have long maintained that plutonium from civilian reactors. if separated. could be used for nuclear weapons. The plutonium fuel cycle. which the Clinch River type of reactor uses. includes this important reprocessing. or separation step.

He questioned the primacy of deterrence policy as a posture suitable for the United States in an increasingly dangerous international environment and has represented the voice of conscience in a strategic debate whose numbers generally make short shrift of moral consideration. He represents. in short. a powerful and persuasive dissent from official orthodoxy. a voice which will be sorely missed at a time when we need it more than ever.

But key nations where the warhead would be deployedWest Germany. Britain and Italyseemed far away from any yesorno decision on the matter. The United States told the allies that the neutron warhead is only for European use and it wont be produced until there is a decision on its deployment by European allies. \"Its not our purpose to jam anything down anyones throat.\" said a U.S. source. after a meeting yesterday between Defense Secretary Harold Brown and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations Nuclear Planning Group. \"If its not desired. it wont be produced. Outside the alliance. it has no utility.\" In effect Brown placed the onus of responsibility for the socalled \"enhanced radiation weapon.\" on European nations. whose military generally favor development and deployment of the weapon. but whose political leaders are reluctant to publicly support it because of uncertain reaction. Brown told allied defense ministers that the small neutron warhead would \"kill fewer people to accomplish the same military effect.\" Within its impact area. it would kill humans while doing only limited damage to objects. but civilian population in adjacent. areas would be spared along with objects. The nuclear planning group includes the United States. West Germany. Britain and Canada as permanent members. There also are three rotating memberships. presently held by Belgium. Denmark and Greece. After another delay no decision seemed likely for some months. but it may figure during Carters Brussels stopover on his fourcontinent swing next month.",

As many of you are aware. hundreds of high school student leaders from across the United States participate annually in this 1week seminar. studying the human and practical elements of our National Government. The purpose of the Washington Workshops is twofold: To offer indepth study and onthescene involvement in the American legislative and political process and. at the same time. to communicate this voice of American youth to our governmental leaders. On numerous occasions I have had the opportunity to address these student groups and I am always impressed with the incisive questions asked by these concerned young leaders. A nonpartisan foundation. the Washington Workshops annually offers a 3week. high school. academic internship program as a followup seminar to the 1week dialog experience. Several of these young Americans have worked on my staff over the past 9 years. Their dedication and willingness to do whatever is required has been most gratifying. They are concerned and involved individuals. determined to find solutions to the problems which frustrate all of us today. May I offer my support and continued best wishes for the success of the Washington Workshops Foundation in the decades ahead as they now celebrate their 10th anniversary.",

A city of about 45.000 people occupying only about 1 square mile across the Hudson River from New York City. Hoboken in recent years has undertaken a massive. and truly effective. community development effort that has resulted in the rehabilitation of more than 20 percent of its housing stock. Mayor Capiello calls Hoboken \"Americas Comeback Town.\" and he points to a privatepublic partnership as the significant force behind the citys progress. Characteristically. Mayor Capiello has neglected to mention that the kind of innovative. peopleoriented leadership which he has brought to the mayors office has played an equally important role in Hobokens successes. Mayor Capiellos story of Hobokens revival is particularly timely in light of the new Housing and Community Development Act of 1977. which is designed to focus new attention on our older communities. both large and small. Hoboken has demonstrated a fine ability to combine Federal resources. such as the kind provided under the community development block grant program. with local initiative and commitment to become a better place to live and work. Hoboken is an example of some of the good things that are going on in a number of our older cities. and I believe that my colleagues will find Mayor Capiellos article especially enlightening. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article. \"PublicPrivate Partnershipthe Key to InnerCity Revival.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week the Senate passed the \"socalled\" Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1977. In fact. this bill includes very little policy and almost no regulatory guidance. This Public Utilities Act does not resemble the Presidents proposal and is so markedly different from the Housepassed version that it may be impossible to reconcile the differences between the versions passed by the two Houses. I voted for final passage of this measure but my vote only represents an affirmation of my support for Senator HARTS senior citizens lifeline amendment and not for the shell of the Presidents proposal passed by the Senate. Many States could have benefited from the work Senator BROOKE was asking the Department of Energy to undertake in setting up examples of innovative rate schedules. The kind of rate reform envisioned by the Presidents proposal could be difficult for States with small regulatory staffs. Many States have failed to adopt conservation oriented rate designs since to do so would have placed bulk purchasers in their States at an economic disadvantage to neighboring States where bulk users benefit from lower rates for increased use. As a strong supporter of Senator HARTS efforts to provide interim relief from escalating utility costs for senior citizens living on fixed incomes and for Senator BROOKEs work in trying to reinstate some voluntary guidelines for conservation oriented rate designs. I want my vote for final passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1977 not to be misconstrued as endorsement of the Senatepassed version of part E of the Presidents energy plan.",

The debate has taken place in congressional hearings. panel discussions involving industry representatives and administration spokespersons. and in the public forum. The Aviation Subcommittee held weeks of hearings in March fand April of this year and the full Commerce Committee has met in executive session throughout June and July to work out the details of a comprehensive reform package. During those months. some of my distinguished colleagues have inserted newspaper editorials into the RECORD describing the pernicious and detrimental effects this legislation will wreck upon the industry. the labor force. and the public. From these articles. it would appear that the legislation enjoys little support and the backing it does have is from those who believe they can capitalize in the wake of havoc that reform will bring about. In truth. support for this legislation is both widespread and divergent. here are just a few of those who endorse reform: President Carter. former President Ford. Secretary of Transportation Adams. and former Secretary Coleman. CAB Chairman Kahn. and former Chairman Robson. the American Conservative Union. the American Association of Retired Persons. the Aviation Consumer Action Project.

Are these isolated foreign policy blunders. or is there some common denominator that underlies them. and others as well?

Panama and Israel can be added to the list of areas where we may have chosen to compromise our national interests for the sake of an elusive goal which seems more and more to preoccupy the efforts of the President: A recycled version of \"detente\" with the Soviet Union and smaller leftistoriented governments. I was particularly impressed with the comments in last Fridays Washington Star by syndicated columnist John P. Roche-\"Sacrificing Israel To U.S.Soviet Relations.\" October 7who suggested that Israel may becom e \"our next sacrificial offering to improved SovietAmerican relations.\" Mr. Roche points out that we apparently learned little from our past experience with the Republic of South Vietnam which. ushered to the negotiating table by the United States in 1973. died a violent death when the \"peace treaty\" was scrapped 2 years later. With this tragic experience still fresh in our minds. why are we today so willing to jeopardize national interest and security on feeble accords with the Soviet Union and other nations of a similar persuasion?",

The question was only how are we going to comply with the order of school desegregation. There were a number of plans being discussed. They followed basically two patterns. One was the plan or plans for massive busing across town. The second group of plans was for alternate plans. plans that would provide for magnet schools or other measures. I testified that I thought busing would be counterproductive. I did not support the plan or plans which favored the massive busing. which favored disbanding the neighborhood school concept.

A question has been raised about whether Mr. Flaherty advocated defiance of an order of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission requiring desegregation of the Pittsburgh school system. Mr. Flaherty emphatically denied that he ever advocated defiance of an order but just urged that busing not be included in any plan developed by the Pittsburgh school board.

In short there is no clear record that Mr. Flaherty ever advocated defiance of the order of the State human relations commission.

My office has been in contact with Mr. Flaherty and in addition to denying that he ever advocated defiance of any desegregation order he made several other statements relating to his conduct if confirmed as Deputy Attorney General. First. in response to questions. Mr. Flaherty stated that in cases where the Justice Department intervened as amicus curiae in school desegregation suits which called for busing as a remedy for unconstitutional segregation. he would abide by the decision made by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights as to the Departments position and would not attempt to use his office to press his individual views on busing.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I shall shortly move to table the motion to recommit. I do that for at least three reasons. One. the problems that the system faces today have already been analyzed by the board of trustees of the social security trust fund in its 1977 report to Congress. The board has informed us that the disability insurance trust fund vill be exhausted in 1979 and the old age nd survivors trust fund will be deileted in 1983. I believe that our proper course now s to act and to act now to protect the fInancial soundness of the social security system. The alternate course. which is one of procrastination and delay. can only contribute to a loss of faith by the American people in Congress. The second reason why I make this motion and urge Senators to support the motion to table is the fact that the President when he considers whatever tax initiatives he wishes to present to Congress next year needs before him the impact of the social security financing measure and the impact of the energy tax bill. which has been passed by the Senate and which is in conference with the House of Representatives. Before the President can make a reasonable judgment as to what proposals to send to Congress with reference to taxes next year. he needs both of these matters before him. He needs to know what the impact upon the economy will be. Until he has both of these measures before him. he will not be in a good position to formulate whatever decisions he feels he has to make in regard to the proposals that he will submit. In that regard. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter which I have received from the President of the United States. dated November 3.",

The social security tax. like the sales tax. falls hardest on those less able to pay. I recognize that the Social Security System must remain solvent. But I had hoped that it would be possible to fashion a bill that would not only meet the fiscal needs of social security. but also accomplish other objectives as well. For example. this country needs a muchimproved comprehensive medical program for the elderly. the handicapped. and the poor. We need a program that eliminates the gaps that now exist between coverage under medicare and medicaid. I feel that medicare should be. removed from the social security trust fund and financed. instead. through general revenues. Medicaid is already financed this way. and the two should be blended into a uniform system. General revenues come mainly from the income tax. so that the financing would be made progressive in nature. rather than regressive. If we were to remove medicare from social security as part of a general overhaul. it would lift a big burden from the social security trust fund. That. in turn. would make it possible for us to lower substantially the rate increase contemplated by this bill. Accordingly. I will cast my vote to commit this bill. and if the motion carries. I will introduce legislation designed to accomplish these objectives soon after Congress reconvenes next year.",

Many of those plans are shelved when interest rates get up to an unconscionable level where they cannot justify that kind of an expenditure. Unreasonably high interest rates discourage capital investment in this country. Our rate of capital investment is already very low compared to other industrialized nations making us less competitive in the world. adding to our unemployment rate and increasing the deficit in our balance of trade.

John Dooling. at 1:30 p.m. today. Earlier. Judge Dooling denied several applications for an extension of the injunction. The Hyde amendment is. for all practical effect. the subject of the Senators motion. In ruling that the Hyde amendment was lawful. Dooling rejected the contention of some abortionists during the hearing that a doctor would be unable to determine when the mothers life was \"endangered\" because of pregnancy as would be required under present law. Mr. President. Judge Dooling stated that the matter of Government financing of elective. convenience abortions had been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in its recent decisions regarding similar limitations by three States. and that in light of those decisions the Hyde amendment should go into effect. Todays Federal district court decision maintains that the Hyde amendment language which was again adopted Tuesday night by the House in an effort to reach a compromise with the Senate is both constitutional and its language regarding \"endangerment\" sets a medically proper standard. Mr. President. I see no purpose in further delaying the Senate on this matter. As the Senator from Pennsylvania has indicated. recent polls indicate the preponderance of the American people favor the position of the Hyde amendment which was adopted again by the House of Representatives on Tuesday night.

I do not think there is any question about that. I am a little surprised that the other side argues that there is any question about it. Here is a story in the Washington Post dated July 8. entitled \"Senate Measure Found To Permit Most Abortions.\" It is written by a very distinguished writer who is now sitting in the Senate gallery. It says: A leading population expert. Louis Hellman. of the respected Population Reference Bureau. estimated yesterday that under a Senatepassed restriction on the Federal financing of abortionsAnd. of course. that is the medical necessity we are talking about here today90 percent of those now performed could still be done. That is because of a number of exceptions written into the Senate legislation and especially a very broad exception permitting any abortion medically necessary. Hellman told a reporter. Who is Louis Hellman? He is the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of HEW for Population Affairs. He is a prochoice person. and he is saying that with the words \"medically necessary.\" 90 percent of the abortions can be performed. Let us not deceive ourselves about what this means. If someone on the other side of the issue. not on our side. who headed the Department of HEWs efforts in population affairs. and who is an advocate of the prochoice viewpoint says that 90 percent of the abortions shall continue. there is no doubt in my mind that he means it and that he is right. and that it is very clear this is a barn door loophole and a very clever one.",

H.R. 13149 extends the final reporting date for the workfare pilot projects until October 2. 1980. and requires an interim report on the progress of the pilot projects before October 2. 1979. The Food Stamp Act of 1977 (Public Law 95113) provided for the implementation by the Department of Agriculture of 14 pilot projects (2 each in the 7 administrative regions of the Food and Nutrition Service) involving the performance of work by food stamp recipients in exchange for their food stamp benefits. The recipients would be employed in a public service capacity for a State or local unit of government already sponsoring public service employment for a period of hours equal each month to the value of the households food stamp allotment. The law contemplated progress reports on those projects no later than 6 months (March 29. 1978) and 12 months (September 29. 1978) following enactment. as well as a final report on March 29. 1979. Implementation of the program has been delayed pending preparation of regulations to administer the 1977 act. Accordingly. H.R. 13149 would extend the period of authorization for the pilot project workfare provisions until October 1. 1980. and further. would give discretionary authority for the Sscretary to extend the projects until the termination of the acts authorization. which is September 30. 1981.

I am delighted by the numerous indications that the Department of Agriculture is prepared to move promptly and vigorously to implement the workfare pilot projects once this bill is enacted into law. Last year. when we sought to include workforce as part of the revised food stamp program. there was some concern that the Department found workfare so distasteful that it would drag its feet rather than put it into effect. But now the Department is exhibiting appropriate flexibility in abiding by the will of Congress and is. indeed. acting in very good faith to initiate this demonstration perhaps by as early as January 1. 1979. I understand that the Department is willing to provide the States in which the 14 projects are located with 100 percent of the costs associated with the recordkeeping and data collection aspects of the demonstration which may be substantial. even though the Department believes it is bound by the legislative history of the 1977 law not to furnish any costsharing for the administration or operational expenses involved in testing welfare. including. for example. the cost of providing the workers with supplies and of supervising them. States may. of course. employ revenuesharing funds to support project operations. I further understand that the Department is planning to conduct an outreach campaign with the governors of the States to attempt to secure 14 sponsors so that the test may proceed at full strength. This bill is necessary to permit the demonstration to proceed without interruption so that we may obtain sufficient information by 1980 to enable the Congress to decide in 1981 whether the success or failure of workfare warrants its expansion. continuation. or termination.O",

This bill is a tribute to those. in and out of Congress. who worked so hard for its passage. I would especially like to note the efforts of Mr. POAGE. the author of the original Act and longtime supporter of humane legislation. In passing this legislation. Congress does not create a new maze of regulation but simply adds a new category. a new box to be checked on existing inspection forms. Cost of compliance is slight and the number of firms that are effected is only 176 out of 3.900 plants. the rest having previously complied with the 1958 act. The bill also extends the humane slaughter requirement to all meat imports. again effecting very few operations. in this case only about 1 percent of the plants that export meat to the United States. The passage of this legislation takes us one step closer to complete assurance that the meat that we consume is not the result of some animals pain and suffering. With such technoogical resources as we posses. there is no reason for us to allow unnecessary cruelty to our livestock. And humane slaughter methods also reduce bruising of the meat estimated to run almost $50 worth of damaged meat for every 100 animals slaughtered. The American Meat Institute members agree that humane slaughter methods are efficient methods and testified in support of this bill. In addition to Mr. Poages efforts and the efforts of numerous humane organizations and individuals. I would like to again acknowledge the work of the late Dr. Frederick Thomsen. formerly president of the Humane Information Services. Dr. Thomsen worked for years for the passage of this legisation and for the improvement of animal protection in general.

I would say this in tribute to him. that every one of those 6.000 votes has been a reflection of his own intellectual ability. his commitment to the public interest. and his own conscience. I cannot remember a Senator who has been more conscientious not only to meeting the schedule of the Senate but also to the issues which confront him.

We in Congress. certainly those in the Budget Committee. do have a responsibility shared with the President in this area of setting goals. We try to do that. The argument I was making was that when we are talking about something far into the future which does not relate directly to the budget resolution. which does not relate directly to the numbers which make up the resolution. to me. it would be an almost irresistible political temptation to vote for the most promising of the various proposals before us. Not many of us are going to want to go home and say that we are not optimistic about the future. that we are going to have a difficult time getting to the level of unemployment that has been set in the act within the shortest time possible. Maybe I am not as politically stalwart as others. but I would think when we are talking about something as nebulous as this kind of propcsition. you may as well go head and vote for the most promising. the most optimistic proposition. Then if it turned out better. or turned out that you were not right by the time they finally arrived. not too many would remember. To me. this whole thing is intended. the purpose of the bill is to give us some guidelines. Those guidelines are not going to be binding anyway. so we may just as well go ahead and use the word \"may\" instead of \"shall\". On the last vote. the vote of government spending as a percentage of GNP. it was won by those who favored flexibility rather than those who wanted a fixed number. The Senator from Michigan was one of those who voted for flexibility. Here we are trying to keep this same policy by giving us flexibility by changing the word \"shall\" to \"may.\" I really feel this is an important change In the bill and will not do violence to the objective of those who authorized this legislation.",

As to the worry about someone who is going to set this number doing it in a political fashion and for political reasons. I think that may actually apply more to people in the White House than people here. especially since we are talking about a 1983 goal. There is going to be a 1984 Presidential election. and I would rather have the collective judgment of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate. on the Budget Committee. looking at something as important as changing that unemployment goal. which is the whole purpose of this bill. than I would in setting up a situation in which. in effect. we can sidestep that responsibility and hand it over to whoever is President. I would like us to lock it in. I have much more confidence in the Budget Committees ability to do that job. if it understands that that is part of its job. and I think it should be. Quite frankly. I think we violate the partnership Idea if we do not see that that is done. If we allow a President to shift that goal and we make it elective as to whether or not the Budget Committee participates. I think we are walking away from the most important part of our responsibility. to see that these goals are met. So. frankly. I think it Is a contradiction. because everything I have seen on the floor of the Senate in the last few days has been for the Budget Committee to reach for and accept responsibility. and this is the first occasion I have seen in which he Budget Committee has had an opportunity to have an important responsibility that it seems to be walking away from.

Considerable changes are to be effected in the CETA program as a result of the conference agreement. In general. eligibility for participation in CETA programsboth job and training positionswill be limited to those who are economically disadvantaged and who are the long term unemployed. In both titles II and VI. special consideration will be afforded for those who are on public assistance. Most importantly. the conferees have agreed to establish in title II. part D. a new targeted employment program. called \"Transitional Employment Opportunities for the Economically Disadvantaged.\" This new program will be targeted on the hardest to employ and upon those areas of our country which suffer most severely from the problem of endemic structural unemployment. $3 billion is the authorized level in fiscal year 1979 for the new part D program which will. for the first time. couple training and employability development with public job positions. This is why the emphasis is placed upon transitional employment opportunities. The intent is that the structurally unemployed are to be moved from unemployment to unsubsidized employment as a result of their participation in this title IID program.",

I have been convinced for sometime that we must redirect CETA away from socalled countercyclical jobs to services for those most in need of employment and training assistance. and I congratulate the conferees on the success they have had in moving in that direction. As overall unemployment declines. CETA should increasingly serve the structurally unemployedthe hard core. minority youth. and welfare recipients. The bill before us. Mr. President. will largely accomplish that redirection. When the Senate passed S. 2570. I offered an amendment to tighten eligibility in the CETA program. The tighter eligibility rules the Senate adoptedwhen my amendment was acceptedare preserved virtually intact in this conference agreement. The conference report also preserves the hard work of the Human Resources Committeeand the Senate as a wholein dealing with the issue of fraud and abuse in the CETA program. This bill will require tighter management controls. and impose stiff penalties on those who would operate outside the law andthe regulations. As a result of this bill and the appropriations decisions we are making this week. the CETA program will be more effective than in the past. even though the overall level of CETA public service jobs will be smaller than it has been in the recent past. Finally. Mr. President. this conference agreement places a high priority on placement in private sector employment for those whom the program serves. We must be concerned about jobs for peoplewhen they leave the CETA programand we all know that most jobs are in the private sector. This bill will result a much higher emphasis on private sector involvement in CETA and I believe that bodes well for the future. Again. Mr. President. I want to congratulate the conferees. Their task was not easy. but they have done well. I am pleased to be able to support the CETA reauthorization in this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise this evening to speak out against the outrageous Supreme Court decision in the case of Zurcher against Stanford Daily. That decision. rendered on May 31. 1978. poses serious threats to the very liberties upon which our democracy is based. Put simply. the majority opinion in the Zurcher case endorses surprise police searches of innocent citizens offices and homes. if those individuals are thought to possess any evidence relating to a crime. While the victim of the surprise search in the Zurcher case was a newspaper. the Stanford Daily. the implications of this decision go well beyond freedom of the press issues. Any number of people might be exposed to a search of this kind. under a wide range of circumstances. Thus. even an individual in a crowded street in which a crime was committedcould have his home or office searched. In such a search. the police could seize any property which they believe might be important to any criminal investigations they are conducting. Procedures and laws exist for seizing evidence from the home or place of work of a criminal suspect. However. no such protection exists against search and seizure of evidence from third parties. such as those persons thought by police to even unknowingly possess evidence of another persons crime. Not only does the Zurcher decision threaten the sanctity of the home. but carried to its logical extreme. Zurcher affords far fewer rights and protections to innocent citizens than it does to suspected criminals. I would like to take this opportunity to salute my distinguished colleagues. the Honorable ROBERT DRINAN )f Massachusetts and the Honorable DAN QUAYLE of Indiana. for their excellent work and leadership on this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation which we believe will remedy this perversion of our cherished due processes and of our legal rights. I urge my colleagues to swiftly address this issue and restore our treasured freedoms of speech and of press. and the protection from unreasonable search and seizure. I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to an excellent article on this issue by Prof. Samuel Dash. of the Georgetown University Law Center.

Title V. entitled \"Science. Technology and American Diplomacy.\" enunciates this policy by giving the Secretary of State primary responsibility for coordination and oversight with respect to all international scientific and technological activities of the U.S. Government.

June 15 is a date which should remind everyone of the millions throughout the world who do not enjoy even their most fundamental freedoms. On that day in 1940. the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics invaded and annexed free Lithuania and began the dictatorial subordination of the Lithuanian people. economy. and culture under Soviet rule. Since that time. an indefinite number of Lithuanians have been forceably exiled to Siberia as politically unreliable. Today. even the very expression of nationalistic longing made by a Lithuanian is considered a severe crime under Soviet law and is punished by imprisonment in a labor camp. With a population of over 3 million. Lithuania is made up of an ancient people and a beautiful. wooded landscape. The Lithuanian culture is among the oldest in Europe. Its songs. folk tales. legends. proverbs. and folk aphorisms have been handed down from generation to generationin spite of a modern. systematic effort to homogenize the Lithuanian culture into the mold of socialist realism. This is the era of detente. This is the era of Helsinki and Belgrade. Yet. it seems as though what the Soviets say and what they do have completely opposite implications. I cannot forget that the Soviets first violated the independence of Lithuania when the 1936 Soviet Constitution was the supposed supreme law of the U.S.S.R. The 1936 Constitution guaranteed the right of autonomy for Soviet nationals. Yet. Petras Plumpa was first arrested. at the age of 19. for raising the Lithuanian flag. The 1936 Constitution also protected the right of religious freedom. Yet. Viktoras Petkus was first arrested in 1947 for his participation in a Catholic Youth Organization. Thousands of Lithuanians are imprisoned today for the crime of attempting to exercise their basic human rightsrights guaranteed to them under the Soviet Constitution and the Helsinki accords. So. let us today. June 15. 1978. remember the plight of these political prisoners and the basic denial of fundamental human freedom in Lithuania. I include the following:",

In the eyes of those in power in developing nations. the United States is calling into question the continuation of the privileged position of the elite and is inadvertently contributing to the suppression of the people who our policies are trying to help.

Their patience and energy are vital to the future of our Nation. for the example they set for young people at an early age leaves a lasting impression on their lives. The San Pedro Boys Club. under the direction of Nicholas N. Trani. has for many years been an important center of youth and family activities in the Los Angeles Harbor area. During the past 31 years. Nick. as executive director. has been a driving force behind the many successful activities at the club. His recent retirement was an event which was felt deeply by the countless individuals he has helped over the years. Born in San Pedro on January 18. 1913. Nick Trani was an outstanding athlete from an early age. After graduating from San Pedro High School. he enrolled in Compton Junior College where he was an allschool tackle on the 193132 championship football team. After graduating. he attended Loyola University of Los Angeles. where he was a starter on the varsity football squad for 2 years. He also coached Loyolas freshman football team during his senior year. During World War II. Nick served in the U.S. Army from 194345. winning first place in the Fort Ord essay contest. After leaving the service in 1945. he became the volunteer football coach of the San Pedro Athletic Club. During the 2 years Nick led the team. it compiled a record of 37 straight winsa record that still stands today. Nick became executive director of the San Pedro Boys Club in 1947. Under his able leadership. the club has become an important center of community activity",

Since its inception 15 years ago. the Los Angeles Unified School Districts school volunteer program has grown both in stature and size to become the Nations largest. Today. 25.000 volunteers. 6.000 tutors. and 3.000 DOVES (dedicated older volunteers in educational service) contribute their time. talents. and skills to assist the students and teachers in our schools. Through their dedication. participants in the school volunteer program have given almost $4 million in free services to 600 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. They have demonstrated. through their love for children. an active and creative use of a vital and heretofore untapped human resource. With its admirable goal of quality education. the school volunteer program has brought enrichment into the lives of our children. with an emphasis on individual attention for a childs special needs. teacher assistance. creative classroom time. and invaluable behindthescenes preparation and innovative ideas. I am proud to have this opportunity to recognize the thousands of volunteers. tutors. and DOVES who together have worked tirelessly to make the Los Angeles Unified School Districts school volunteer program a most invaluable aid to both our teachers and our children. We are grateful for their continued dedication and determination to provide the quality education and environment so essential to creating the necessary groundwork for a childs future happiness and achievement. They deserve our appreciation. our respect. and our overwhelming support in the future.*",

The Federal Government plays almost no role whatsoever in regulating this industry. despite its major power in our national economy. I found the article most illuminating. and I want to share it with our colleagues. For I think it cogentlyif unintentionallymakes the major point I have been stressing for months now: That the State regulators. despite their excellent intentions. are not in a position to provide the kind of effective regulation required for this massive industry. There is something wrong. I think. when a State regulator. the president of the National Association of State Insurance Commissioners says. as quoted in the article. thatInsurers . . . play follow the leader. shrinking market after market and raising the prices to the point of recklessness. In fact. there are two things wrong here: First. that the companies would indulge in such practices but second. that the State regulatory mechanisms are not able to cope with practices of this kind and prevent them. What better testimony to the need for more effective regulation of an industry could we ask for than that of the president of the National Association of State Insurance Commissioners.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to concur in what the gentleman from Texas has just said. The gentleman and I served on the Select Committee on Intelligence in the last Congress. Let me tell this House. it was a real disaster. I supported the gentleman from Missouri in the creation of that select committee. We had good intentions. but if some Members have any problems with the staff. let me attest to the fact that an uncontrolled staff can destroy the work of a good committee. We had that problem with some members of the Intelligence Committee staff. The staff was very ambitious. It did a great disservice to this body. We had to actually prohibit the publication of the report which the staff had prepared and which I described as a cheap paperback labeled as a committee report. Fortunately. the House never permitted the publication of that report. I think we would face the same kind of dilemma with this kind of undertaking. I hope the rule and the resolution will be defeated. Mr. Speaker. with the creation again of a Select Committee on Assassinations. this House would wander far afield from its constitutional duties of lawmaking and oversight. Murder investigations are normally left to law enforcement agencies and the judicial branch. and I doubt that any previous Congress has undertaken criminal investigations of this type. Apart from this very legitimate question of appropriateness. we might also ask ourselves if these proposed investigations will settle anything. As the distinguished commentator Eric Sevareid has rightly noted. a veritable \"cottage industry\" has developed concerning conspiracy theories. New hypotheses have proven very profitable. regardless of their relationship to known facts. Will another investigation. many years after the eventswith many witnesses deceased and much evidence undoubtedly lostput an end to such speculation? Commonsense suggests that it will not. Given our marginal prospects for success. we might also consider the problem of quantifying the debt many of us obviously believe we owe to history. With so many other more pressing needs facing the country. do we owe history as much as $13 million over 2 yearsor any lesser figure that may be dreamed up to secure approval of this measure? The response must be in the negative. Finally. we should ask ourselves to consider seriously the civil liberties issues so appropriately raised by our distinguished colleague from California",

It gives the committee full authority to investigate the two assassinations and to make legislative recommendations regarding their findings. and that surely answers the constitutional question which the gentleman from Missouri has raised. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. when we vote on this amendment we are really voting on whether or not we want to investigate the deaths of these two persons.

The House Impeachment Committee was authorized to use this procedure. and actually its authorization was not as restricted as the one that is being used here. Second. I think that it may not be understood that the fact that designated counsel may take a statement does not give them subpena power. What it in fact does. is allow a willing witness who wishes to make a statement do so under oath. The oath is not given by counsel. it is given by a notary public. Once he is placed under oath. the witness can refuse to answer the question. but it will help keep a witness from giving false information. If a witness knows that his testimony is under oath and that possible risk of perjury can ensue from it. it is going to focus his attention wonderfully on being more truthful. Third. the purpose of this is to avoid the expense of either bringing witnesses to Washington or requiring committee members to travel to take the testimony of those witnesses whose statements may be relatively inconsequential and would not justify that sort of trip. Again. I want to emphasize that the gentleman from Texas has said that the committee will establish strict guidelines covering the rights of witnesses and making sure that they are protected. This procedure is implicit in rule XXVIII of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The Senate amendment will extend the Indochinese Migration and Assistance Act of 1975 for 4 years and provide funds for special language and vocational training. It is my feelingand the feeling of the other members of the Subcommittee on Immigration. Citizenship. and International Lawthat providing such special services as language and vocational training to meet the unique needs of Indochinese refugees will greatly reduce the possibility of these refugees becoming dependent on welfare and cash assistance and expedite their adjustment to American society. This bill would terminate Federal funding of social services and special programs after 4 years. at which time the refugees would be better prepared to market their skills in the economy. As you may know. the Indochinese refugee assistance program expired on September 30. 1977. In my home State of Virginia alone. which has the fourth highest population of Indochinese refugees in the Nation. some twothirds of the 541 refugees currently receiving cash assistance will not get their monthly checks unless the program is extended. Moreover. those refugees who are currently benefiting from social services and special programs may not be able to receive these benefits at all if Federal funding is cut back this year. The record indicates that 85 percent of the Indochinese refugees in Virginia are employed. But since they are often only able to find lowpaying jobs. some refugees require supplemental cash and medical assistance to make ends meet. I believe that continuation of social services and special programs for language and vocational training is a vital part of any program to helo the Indochinese refugees make a smooth transition into the mainstream of Americqn society. Again. I urge my colleagues to join in support of the amendment to extend the Indochinee refugee and assistance program for 4 years.",

Enactment of this legislation will come as welcome news to my home county of San Diego. which otherwise would have to assume more than $2 million in welfare and related costs for these refugees. When the arrangements were made to allow Vietnamese. Laotian. and Cambodian nationals to seek sanctuary in our country. it seemed only fitting that the Federal Government would assume the primary financial burden. To precipitously end this commitment is to renege on a promise. Our county governments were not responsible for the unfolding of the tragic events which forced these people. some 150.000 of them. to seek refuge in our country. Without the relief provided by this legislation. the taxpayers of San Diego would face a 3.3cent increase in the property tax ratewhich comes to about $5.25 for the typical household in the county.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the Foreign Aid Appropriations Conference Report now before this body. My reasons for doing so center around the very persuasive and incisive remarks made by my distinguished colleague from the State of Florida. How is it that this Congress is applying double standards in allocating direct and indirect aid to certain countries and not to others? Whereas Vietnam. Uganda. Laos. and Cambodia stand to receive our aid through such channels as the United Nations Development Program and the International Development Association. the U.S. allies of Argentina. Brazil. Guatemala. and the Philippines do not. Somehow the United States appears to be extending the Monroe Doctrine into Big Brother persuasion within the Western Hemisphere. that is where Argentina. Brazil. and Guatemala come into the picture. As for the Philippines the United States is still pulling the strings with its former colonial territory. It gave it its independence after World War II. but it continues to tell the Philippine Government how to run its own business under the nebulous banner of human rights. On the other side of the coin U.S. aid is being furnished to the closed societies of Vietnam. Cambodia. Laos. and Uganda and I need not remind my colleagues what atrocities continue to be committed daily in each of these countries. Foreign journalists and expatriates who are able to provide bits and pieces of information on the internal strifes in these nations report mass murders and other bizarre atrocities. Such infamy far surpasses any socalled \"human rights\" violations among those countries in the conference reports \"hit list.\" What is the explanation? Are we witnessing a backdoor attempt by the authors of this bill to supply postwar reparations to our former adversaries on the battlefield? Are we handling Idi Amins Uganda with kid gloves in light of some ambiguous Carter policy in the handling of our countrys affairs with tho continent of Africa? Mr. Speaker. if the Members of this House choose to accept the Foreign Aid Appropriations Conference Report without attaching the crucial Young amendment. we will have cowered to a shallowness which borders on hypocrisy. Our allies will have lost while our adversaries will have handsomely gained. I therefore call upon the House to assert its constitutionally mandated initiative and soundly defeat the conference report as it currently stands.",

This legislation was based on hearings by the Subcommittee on Resource Protection of the Committee on Environment and Public Works and reauthorizes the Noise Control Act of 1972 for 1 year. S. 3083 deals primarily with noise from sources other than aircraft and redirects our Federal efforts to assist State and local programs to reduce excessive noise levels. Aviation noise is a serious problem and costs over $3 billion in decreased property values annually. The Noise Control Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to recommend to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations to control aircraft noise. In 1976. EPA proposed that airport proprietors be required to estimate noise levels and to submit to FAA a plan. based on 15 actions. for reducing noise. The 15 noise control actions listed by EPA fall into four groups: Changes in operating procedures. land use controls. curtailment of nighttime operations. and landing fees. The Council on Wage and Price Controls has filed a report to the FAA on these proposals. focusing primarily on noise charges. EPA suggested that airports could renegotiate landing fees for the actual noise they produce. with the charges variable by time of day and the nature of the aircraft. The Councils report on the merits of such a policy consists of a detailed analysis of the economic. legal. and environmental feasibility of noise charges. It suggests that noise fees should be considered as a workable alternative for aircraft noise abatement. One of the principal authors of this study was Donald C. Cell. professor of economics at Cornell College. Mount Vernon. Iowa. Professor Cell worked with the staff of the Council on Wage and Price Stability while he was a guest scholar with the Brookings Institution. Mr. President.

In my term in the Senate.

When we disagreed. he was a formidable adversary whom one respected for the unique way in which he managed to blend tenacious opposition with unfailing courtesy. It is inevitable that a man whose legislative interests were as varied as were DEWEY BARTLETTS will be admired for different things by different people. Undoubtedly some will cite his work on defense matters. others will emphasize his tireless advocacy of the interests of the Oklahoma Indians he represented so well. and others will value his extensive knowledge of energy policy. Transcending those matters. however. and knowing no boundaries of party or ideology among his fellow Senators is the high regard we have for the rare courage he has displayed over the last 2 years.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the farmers of Iowa properly -require an efficient and economical transportation system for moving grain and commodities to their markets. After overcoming shortages of raw material. high fuel costs. and uncertain weather. they still must have an adequate supply of hopper cars and barges to move their products to the Gulf of New Orleans. The State of Iowa has developed an imaginative program for shippers to transport grain to southern ports quickly and profitably. Last spring. the Iowa Department of Transportation. in conjunction with the Milwaukee Railroad and the Alter Barge Co.. developed a joint railbarge tariff which saves Iowa shippers 2 cents to 3 cents per bushel in transporting corn and soybean to New Orleans for export to foreign markets. The innovative feature of this joint railbarge venture is a single. nonfluctuating tariff rate which guarantees the shipment of grain from Iowa elevators by rail to the Mississippi River. and by barge to New Orleans. Rates under this tariff are lower than railbarge combination rates usually negotiated by shippers. This enables small elevators and shippers to rent 5. 10. or 15 railroad cars at rates similar to those established for larger trains that they have been unable to use. The railbarge tariff also substantially reduces the time it takes to move grain to market. Under this proposal. for example. 15 boxcars can transport 9.000 tons in the time that they can deliver only 1.500 tons to New Orleans. Consequently. 15 railcars can do the work of 90 at an estimated $3.2 million savings. This is a more economical use of cars at a time when much of the Midwest is plagued by a serious shortage of hopper cars. About 3 million bushels of grain will be handled under this railbarge system by the end of 1978. Next year. the program will be expanded to move about 15 million bushels. It shows that competing modes of transportation can cooperate to provide efficient service at reasonable costs. As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. which oversees our inland waterways system. I believe this innovative and imaginative program greatly benefits both Iowa shippers and consumers. and could serve as a model for similar arrangements in other States. Earlier this year. an article in Business Week described Iowas combination railbarge tariff. and I want to include this informative article in the RzcoRD.",

But we have come through these very difficult times and at times very bitter disputes. but I know of no Senator who has left this Chamber with a bad feeling or without the spirit of friendship and cooperation that is necessary to make this institution one of the viable and vital portions of our democratic system. I am proud to have been able to report to the President. along with Senator ROBERT C. BYRD. this accomplishment. and I am sure that the minority leader would express these same views if he were here. So I thank you. Senator. and I join with all of us in wishing the occupant of the chair and everyone else. as I did the President. a Happy Thanksgiving and a Happy Christmas and urged him to see to it that we stayed with our families and not disapprove any of the vital legislation we have sent him.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. the reason I asked for a vote on the question of consideration was because a rule of this nature requires a twothirds vote to be brought up on the same day it is reported out. Just about without any notice to any Members interested in this issue. including the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations dealing with it under the rules. they convened this morning. at the direction. I assume. of the leadership. and reported this rule out. All the rule does is to change the order in which consideration of motions dealing with a conference report are normally handled. It says that. instead of the gentleman from Pennsylvania . if he chose. or any other Members. being able to offer a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment. which might be an acceptable compromise. that the House is forced by this rule to vote solely on the Senate language adopted yesterday. I think most of us who have stood steadfast against the compromise on this issue of right to life feel that the Senate language is totally meaningless as a compromise and is worse than many of the others that have been voted down. And there is other language being considered which may be offered by some of the members of the Committee on Appropriations that would have the support of the gentleman from Maryland. the gentleman from Illinois . the gentleman from Pennsylvania . and could very well possibly resolve this issue. However. the rule before us forces us to vote firstand possibly onlydepending upon the outcome of the vote on whether or not we swallow the Senate amendment wholly. I think it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position. I will oppose the rule. I am not going to force it to a rollcall vote. but perhaps some other Member will. There is still a chance for a compromise here. The language could be sent back to the other body this afternoon. in light of the closeness of the vote. in light of the paydays involved. and in light of the remarks of other Members who are desirous of leaving. Approximately 40 Members have left yesterday since this House voted. and we do have to resolve this issue.",

So I think we are dealing intellectually with some phrases. But in terms of substance and consequence. we really are not that far apart.

This is now the law. and there is not one Member who is supporting the Hyde amendment who has taken issue with this language.

If we were to incorporate the Secretarys language in this amendment and presented either -by the distinguished chairman of the committee or the gentleman from Illinois . it would probably be rejected.

The suggestion that the late Senator Bob Kerr could put $200 million of oil stock in a blind trust and have it meaningful would be like putting the Empire State Building in a blind trust and claiming you do not know what is there. It is impossible. If somebody wants to use a blind trust and it really is a blind trust. I have no objection to that. as long as there is disclosed what went into the trust. What I am saying is that the concept of a rule which says that if one has a substantial interest. he may not vote is wrong. I defy anybody to define what that is. If you drew a Bell curve and put on that Bell curve $1.000 worth of stock in some company. or $2. $3. $4. $5. up to $10 million worth. and asked 1.000 people to mark on the Bell curve where the substantial interest occurred. you would have 1.000 different marks on the Bell curve. So it does not make any sense whatsoever to get into the position of making those judgments. The public will decide whether or not they think he is voting his interest.

I am almost neutral on the question as of now. to be frank with the Senator. So the way we resolved it in committee was to adopt this procedure and not involve a group of outside citizens. which certainly should be considered. in my judgment. at the time the House of Representatives sends a statute over to us. Therefore I am not arguing for or against the proposal on the merits and may very well support it later in the year. or I may oppose it later in the year. So. I will move to table. But I do not know whether anyone wishes to speak first.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have tremendous respect for the able and distinguished Senator from Delaware. I think he is one of the finest men in this body. I cannot go along with him on this amendment. however. as I feel that a constitutional provision on this subject is important. Article I. section 5. clause 2 of the Constitution provides: Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. punish its members for disorderly behavior. and. with the concurrence of twothirds. expel a member. So we can see from this that the responsibility to punish Senators for disorderly behavior or to expel a Senator lies with Members of the Senate. It is possible that the court might hold to bring in outside individuals would be constitutional. but I do not think that is necessary. Mr. President. the Constitution specifically delegates to the Senate the right to discipline its Members and to the House the right to discipline its Members. To further delegate the investigatory function to an outside commission. unaccountable to the Senate as a body. is a delegation of authority which I view in derogation of article I. section 5. clause 2 of the Constitution. I fully understand the desirability of retaining outside counsel to conduct an investigation. I support such a procedure. as it removes the investigatory function from the hands of one who may have personally dealt or may in the future personally deal with the accused party on other committee matters. Section 204 of the resolution authorizes this procedure. but I stress the point that outside counsel retained by the committee is responsible and accountable to the Senate during the investigation. If we adopt the amendment of my friend from Delaware. we are failing to meet our responsibility of keeping our own house in order. Official conduct and ethics procedures are internal matters for the Senate to determine. and adoption of the pending amendment will be a step in the wrong direction. For this reason. Mr. President. I oppose the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I shall be very brief. But I wish to make a few additional comments. First. of all. I have great respect and admiration for both the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from South Carolina and am . pleased to hear the Senator from Wisconsin say that he still has an open mind on this matter. In answer to Senator THURMOND. I point out that under my proposal. the right to recommend appropriate sanctions is retained by the select committee. so we are in no way downgrading or minimizing the authority of the Senate as it is provided in the Constitution. One observation I make to Senator NELSON is that it does concern me that in writing a statute which involves the President. once we have a statute. we may be delegating a certain authority to the executive branch that would prevent us from making modifications in the future. So I have some reservations as to writing this into the statute. I prefer to see it done by rulemaking of the Senate. But I reemphasize once more that 10 years ago. when I was a freshman Congressman. I was very enthusiastic about the creation of the Ethics Committee. and I was one of a small group of freshmen who came up with the idea of modeling it. frankly. very much on what was done over here. However. as I pointed out. I feel very strongly that the disenchantment with the problems that the Senate is facing with public reaction is not because of a lack of rules but because the public feels very strongly that neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate has had the courage to investigate itself when there are serious complaints. As I indicated in my opening statement. it is very difficult for Members of the Senate to work with colleagues one day and then attempt to act as a judge the next day. What concerns me with this set of rules is that we are in the process of adopting some very complicted rules. and I really doubt seriously that it adequately addresses the basic question in the American mind. which is the question of enforcement. Mr. President. I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.",

If there is no objection. when I get through my remarks. I am going to ask that the amendments be considered en bloc. On page 35. where it says that the expense of the newsletter must come out of funds of the Senator. I add the words \"including his official Senate allowances.\" I am told that the committee had this in mind in drafting the resolution. but it is not clear enough. That is one point. On page 50. line 3. I ask the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Finance to work with the IRS with regard to a fund which raises and expends money on official expenses of Senate offices. The resolution abolishes such a fund. What the committee really was talking about was the tax aspects of payments out of a political fund to defray official nonreimbursable expenses. That is all that this wording has to do with. This also was approved by the committee. The third amendment. which Is nontechnicalit is substantivemakes the effective date of the newsletter regulation January 1. 1978. instead of August 1. 1977. The reason for that is that annual reports are required and. therefore. it should date from the lst of next year. Furthermore. the socalled nonofficial funds are allowed to continue until January 1. also. Some Senatorsnot this Senatoruse such funds to help defray the cost of newsletters. This would have the same uniform rule as to the effective date of the regulation. which is January 1. 1978. It also coincides with the ruling on the disclosure requirement.",

Many of these reservists served later in the Berlin crisis or Vietnam yet they have still been denied retirement because they have not been permitted to count for retirement purposes service in the Reserve performed during the World War.

The Budget Act of 1974 required that each bill or resolution considered by Congress be analyzed for its impact on the budget. providing an estimate of budget outlays which result from the proposed measure and the total of new budget authority. Under the act. the term \"budget authority\" means authority \"to enter into obligations which result in immediate or future outlays of Government funds.\" Outlays. on the other hand. was the term intended to define the expenditures or net lending with respect to a single fiscal year. Essentially then. the Budget Act passed by Congress in 1974 required Congress to consider the costs of each measure that came before it. both for the first fiscal year of implementation. and for commitments to futureyear expenditures. Section 208 of the housing bill would redefine budget authority so that only those payments required to liquidate housing assistance contracts in a given year would be included. This approach is simply contrary to one of the basic principles of the Budget Act which requires consideration of the longterm cost of each proposal. and it renders the term \"budget authority\" meaningless in the housing area. As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee well knows. he and I do not always agree on spending measures. and on occasion we have debated the merits of certain programs because of these costs. We agree. however. on the principle that these costs should be available for analysis. review. and debatenot hidden in some clever accounting technique which obscures the real costs of a legislative proposal. Mr. President. the Senator from Kansas does not want to see the budget process weakened in a way which would hide the future year costs of federally assisted housing programs.

I introduced an amendment on March 8. 1974. that clarified the status of existing section 23 contracts. This amendment was adopted. Unfortunately. I am here 2 years later to accomplish the same task. My amendment clarifies and reinforces the congressional intent in section 208 of the Housing Act that HUD should not interfere. with the continuity of a contractual agreement between an owner and a local housing authority and should permit such agreements to be renewed up to the maximum term prescribed by law. At present. HUD is permitting section 23 lease renewals only for occupied units or units to be reoccupied within 30 days and such renewals must expire by June 30. 1978--or by June 30. 1979 with HUD approval. This policy contravenes the intent of section 208 as spelled out in the legislative history by me and representations by HUD at the time of the enactment of the 1974 act. Concurrent Resolution p5982. March 8. 1974. HUD is urging public housing authorities to convert their section 23 units to section 8 units. They are also urging that conversion should be accomplished without eviction of families receiving section 23 assistance. However. public housing authorities are finding that many owners are refusing to convert because of the increased management responsibilities that they would have to undertake ifthey converted from a section 23 unit to a section 8 unit. In addition. there is no assurance that section 8 units will be available for tenants now under section 23 leases. or there may be a lack of available section 8 funds for conversion. This HUD policy may therefore deprive existing beneficiaries of their subsidies contrary to the intent of section 208. I understand HUD has no objection to this amendment and that it can be accepted.

The VA will only guarantee home loans for new condominiums and not condominium conversions. This is an inequitable situation which excludes from VA guarantee many substantial homes and apartment buildings which have been converted from rental to the condominium form of ownership. The apparent reason for excluding condominium conversions from VA loan eligibility was an interpretation by VA that it was not the congressional intent to permit VA loans for this purpose. This amendment serves to correct this mistaken impression. I need not reiterate the numerous statistics on our inflationary housing market and the fact that threefourths of our Nations families cannot afford the medianpriced new home today. The condominium form of homeownership offers one way for some of those people to participate in homeownership because frequently the financing terms and sales price are less expensive than the terms for a conventional fee simple house. As of March 1975. there were 125.000 condominium conversions in this country. most of them concentrated in the BostonWashington corridor. This is less than 10 percent of the total housing stock nationwide. Nevertheless. they are a housing resource which should be made available with all of the financing and ownership options available whizh are also available for the purchase of a conventional home. Many of our veterans have not been able to afford a home and are currently renters.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my amendment is a very simple one. In 1969 the National Housing Act established a maximum of $16.200 for FHA loans on property outside of an urban area. This amount is set forth in section 203(i) of the National Housing Act. Although the loan limit amount for FHA loans inside urban areas has been increased before and the committee has asked for an increase for $45.000 to $60.000 in this bill. there has never been an increase in the amount for single family loans outside the urban areas. Mr. President. I think we are all aware of the increased costs of construction and I think we can anticipate further increases in the cost of construction in the years ahead. My amendment would provide that the loan limit on such single family dwellings contemplated under section 203 (i) would be 75 percent of the $60.000 amount recognized by the committee as needed for urban housing. It is interesting to note that under the current law. the loans made under section 203(i) or the $16.200 figures are as follows: 1972. 26 loans for a total of $364.700. 1973. 16 loans for a total of $221.650. 1974. 14 loans for a total of $202.000. 1975. 3 loans for a total o- $43.650. and 1976. no loans made. So for all practical purposes the present program is not operative. Mr. President. I think these figures demonstrate the need to increase the amount and an increase of 75 percent of the recognized $60.000 figure is not unreasonable. This would establish a limit in single family dwelling under section 203(i) of $45.000. I submit that this increase is long overdue. The house bill is at the 75 percent figure. The Senate should adopt this amendment so that rural residents can share more equitably in the Nations housing program.",
