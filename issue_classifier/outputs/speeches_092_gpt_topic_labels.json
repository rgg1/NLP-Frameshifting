    "speech": "Now I must raise a most important question about General Abrams. Let us grant that he knew nothing about what General Lavelle was doing. But he was MAC/V. He was in charge. I want to go shortly to the question that Senator HuoxEs and Senator STENNIS raised with respect to the position of his authority. Nevertheless. General Abrams was responsible for what went on in his command. what went on by his deputy for air. a member of his personal staff. under his very nose. Is General Abrams responsible for those acts. or partly responsible. or remiss in his responsibility. for not knowing about it. The question is. \"Who was in charge of the shop?\" What was the attitude of General Abrams? Was the attitude in General Abrams command one of \"Go ahead. do what you want. but do not get caught\"? Was it \"Go ahead. but do not tell us about it\"? We do not know. And if this could happen to General Abrams in Vietnam by his immediate deputy for air. is it likely to happen again if he becomes Chief of Staff of the Army. During World War II. there was something called the Yamashita case. I am not in any way comparing General Abrams to General Yamashita. but I bring this up to indicate the standard of conduct the United States required even of enemy commanders.",

What became terribly distressing to me was to watch the reaction of my President and some of my colleagues who. either through sincerity or political expediency. joined in the clamora clamor that seemed to me as reasonable and logical as a lynch mob. I have not found it within. my capability to put into words my total feelings. It has been done for me by a young captain in the Judge Advocate Generals Corps. Aubrey M. Daniel III. Captain Daniel has spoken for me. I believe he has spoken for most loyal Americans who have had any experience in military combat. and I hope he speaks for the vast majority of American people who live in a nation dedicated to freedom and justice under the rule of law. Mr. Speaker. I intend to request a special order today at the conclusion of all business. and any other special orders heretofore entered into. to place in the RECORD the letter from Captain Daniel to the President of the United States.",

So outraged were the American people at the damage done to their Nations Capital that the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to prevent any recurrence of similar desecration to their CXVII633Part 8 hallowed land. Subsequently the bill was referred to the other body where no action was taken. and therefore it never became law. In order to meet the threat of this invidious invasion. I am introducing a proposal identical to that approved by the House almost 2 years ago. In no way does this proposed legislation interfere with freedom of speech or expression. It merely provides that the American people will be allowed to protect their heritage against the wanton destruction of sponging spoilers. The citizens of this Nation are in no mood to host another \"Insurrection City\" or to provide a propaganda pad for protestors.",

Since capturing the first U.S. soldier in 1964. the enemy has consistently failed to abide by its Geneva Convention agreements. It has repeatedly and flagrantly violated four points contained in the agreements. The Communists are breaking elementary rules which civilized countries are expected to follow in their dealings with prisoners of war. The Communists have never permitted impartial observers to inspect their prison camps and have refused such requests by the International Red Cross. They have released less than a dozen prisoners in the past 5 years. Although a few letters have been allowed to trickle back to the United States. the enemy has never allowed its prisoners a free exchange of mail with friends and family in the United States. The North Vietnamese have made incomplete lists for propaganda purposes. but they have never made a complete disclosure of the prisoners they hold. All these violations are creating unjustified pressures and anxieties for the friends and families of those missing in action. I call on all concerned Americans to join me and my staff in contacting North Vietnamese officials demanding that these conditions be corrected. We must bring the pressures of world opinion to bear on Hanoi.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday the people of Chicago reelected the foremost mayor of any city in the United States by a margin of more than 400.000 votes. Mayor Richard J. Daley now begins a fifth term at the helm of a city administration that has amply demonstrated it works better than any other city administration in this complex country of ours. Chicagos mayor has proved conclusively that urban problems can be handled. they can be solved. and a city of several million people can indeed be governed democratically. This victory of Mayor Daleys should serve as a sign of the health and vitality of one of Americas largest cities. During the 16 years of his administration. Chicago has faced the same problems that confront other American cities. Our people are just as diverse. We. too. have a large and growing population of emigrants from other States who are out of work. or who are poorly trained and equipped to work. We have had problems between neighborhoods and schools. between those in the city and those in the suburbs. But Mayor Daley has refused to walk away from these problems. His own example of trying to solve them on a 24 hours a day. 52 weeks a year basis. has inspired numerous communities throughout the country to reexamine their own problems and attempt once more to cope with them. Mayor Daleys example of dedication to a great metropolitan community has. I believe. made Chicago the leading American city. Richard Daley has proved he is equal to the difficult challenges of a vast urban area. The standards he has set for himself and his administration are high. as they should be. The results are impressive. as all the country can see. This election victory we applaud here today stays more eloquently than words that Mayor Daley has the full confidence of the people of Chicago. They know that he cares about our city and the health and wellbeing of the country as a whole. Despite efforts by the media to create presidential contenders for the election next year. the people of Chicago know also that Mayor Daleys voice will be heard in national politics as well. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to represent the city of Chicago in the Congress and to serve in the same political party with the best mayor of the 20th century.",

Mr. Speaker. this continuing resolution is necessary as the result of the fact that the appropriation bills for fiscal year 1972. which begins next week. have not been enacted into law. We have passed through the House several of the bills. According to the present schedule. we shall have passed half the annual appropriation bills for 1972 through the House by the end of this fiscal yearby June 30--of this yearbut of course not all of those will have passed the other body by that time. Then there are seven additional appropriation bills for 1972 which we hope to pass through the House in July. So. this is a \"stopgap\" measure to provide the departments and agencies of the Government with operating funds from July 1 until August 6. at which time Congress is expected to take a summer recess. or such earlier date as the regular appropriation bills are signed into law. Prior to .August.6 we shall have to take a reading of the status of the appropriation bills and. if necessary. pass another continuing resolution. But by August 6 we are hopeful that most of the appropriation bills for fiscal 1972 will have been enacted into law. Let me say that this continuing resolution is. generally speaking identical with initial continuing resolutions of past years. I would hope. in view of the fact that it is in the standard form and that it is for only 1 month plus. that we could promptly send this measure to the other body so that they may promptly get and thus assure the departments and agencies that they will not have payless paydays or be unable to operate because of lack of funds. We are especially anxious to pass this measure in this conventional. timetested form. because if it should be modified or changed or amended in some way different from the standard procedure of the past. we could encounter all manner of delay in the House and in the other body.

It protects the poor from tax overload without disrupting the flow of revenue from those able to pay. It is State financed to maintain the fiscal solvency of local governments and State administered to promote the greatest efficiency. provide the widest base. and maintain the dignity of the recipients. Four States have adopted it since 1963 and a fifth uses a variant of the same principle. Several other States have the circuitbreaker under serious consideration. The average urban household pays about 4 percent of Its income for the local residential property tax. But there are more than 3 million households that pay 10 percent or more. 2.5 times the average. And lowincome families in substantial numbers turn over as much as 50 percent of their meager incomes for the local tax on shelter (see Table 1). The property tax had its roots in a rural society where the value of a familys physical holdings. land and buildings. served as the single best measure of taxable capacity. Urbanization has changed the gaugethe most precise measure now of ability to pay taxes is annual flow of money incomebut not the character of the property tax. and it is still the single most Important revenue source for local government. The four States that use the circuitbreaker approach are Wisconsin (adopted in 1963). Minnesota (1967). Vermont (1969) and Kansas (1970). California. In 1967. provided for a similar type of relief (see Table 2). These States all administer their programs in generally the same manner. but the principle of the circuitbreaker permits wide flexibilIty and adaptation to individual tax systems and StatebyState tax relief needs.",

The shortage claim was based on statistics provided by the American Gas Association. which represents the producers interests. I challenged the FPC in my earlier statement to document the existence of a gas shortage because it is this claim of a shortage which will result in a $4 billion increase annually to consumers of natural gas. Numerous groups had challenged this shortage. Among them was the American Public Gas Association which alleged in a welldocumented statement that the shortage resulted from artificial control of supply by the gas producers. At that time I thought that the FPCs naive acceptance of the industrys figures was an innocent result of the dependence which often develops among regulatory agencies with the regulated industries. Since that time. however. substantial evidence has become available to indicate that this rate increase was approved by Chairman Nassikas and the other Commissioners with full knowledge that there was very serious question as to whether or not a gas shortage in fact existed.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have in my hand the statement just now made by the distinguished senior Senator from New York . It covers a big and very important area in the world and many facets of that part of the worlds problems. I might say. as one who was in the U.S. Navy and landed at Hhour on Dday in Okinawa. I join with the Senator from New York in identifying this as really an occasion for the highest degree of statesmanship. I carry. I am sure. like many others. certain emotional recollections relating to that war in which we fought and lost so many men. Yet. this is not the basis upon which we should make this decision. I am grateful to the Senator for his comments and for relating what he has learned from conversations and discussions during his travels. I never cease to be amazed at the incisive way in which the Senator from New York is able to put his finger on the heart of the question or to separate the issues from extraneous material and get to the very important part of the matter. I think that here again we have the benefit received from one mans travels and one mans observations which should help a great deal in forming policy and establishing our own opinions and viewpoints. I want to thank the Senator from New York. I also want to make one political comment. and that is that I am very proud to have the Senator from New York as a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee because he is not only able to share on the floor these very important views. but he is also in a position where. through his outstanding work and untiring efforts. he puts these views to the test. He puts them in a manner in which his colleagues on the committee can consider them. I am sure that in the years to come. as well as at the present time. that the Senators imprint upon major policy of this country will be very recognizable. His work has always been done in a very constructive and fundamental manner. I congratulate the Senator from New York and say again that I take pride in standing on the same side of the aisle. but on an issue that transcends the aisle.",

I know that the feelings among the Japanese businessmen. parliamentarians. and others are very strong that the reversion of Okinawa should be kept separate from any economic matters. I think it desirable that we do bear this in mind. They have an extreme sensitivity on this subject. They are entitled to the reversion of Okinawa to the Japanese sovereignty as a prefecture of Japan. The agreement being worked out appears to be a very wise agreement. taking into consideration the problems of both nations and all of the citizens of both nations. I am very pleased to see it announced. I sincerely hope that the United States will promptly move to approve the agreement between the two powers. While I have strong feelings on textiles and have said clearly to our Japanese friends that we need bilateral agreements between the industries or between the countries involved and alternatively multilateral agreements of which the United States is a part. all of this should be kept clearly apart.",

We all know that the Japanese Government is in a sense democratically structured state and they have their problems. I do not want to exacerbate them. But I do want them to understand them separately and apart. These are political issues. There is the issue on trade. This has become somewhat exacerbated in the past 3 years and the balance has shifted against the United States. I found quite a lot of understanding of this matter in Japan and quite a bit of realism. They have their constituents. too. as we have ours. They have to respond to their constituents. we have to respond to ours in the glass. ceramics. and textiles fields. We want to make them see that this relates to an exporting of Jobs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. arms control is a particularly vital aspect of our foreign policies. In recent years a series of agreements have helped to bring a degree of international regulation in the field of nuclear weapon testing. emplacement. and transfer. These agreements include the Test Ban Treaty. the NonProliferation Treaty. the Antartica Treaty. and the Seabed Treaty. The tragic situation in Vietnam calls to mind an especially important area of arms control that has been relatively neglected recently. both in international forums and within our own Governmentthe control of transfer of correctional arms from one country to another. In some cases. free world countries have competitively supplied arms to opposing sides in local. conflicts. In an article published in the Washington Post of May 3. Charles W. Yost. an experienced diplomat as well as a thoughtful columnist. called attention to this situation. Mr. Yost pointed to some of the reasons for the largescale transfer of conventional weapons from superpowers to smaller countries as well as to some of the difficulties in achieving any kind of negotiations or agreements in this area. In view of the importance of conventional arms transfer. I intend shortly to offer an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requiring a report on the problems and possibilities in this field from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. I believe that such a report to the Congress will give Senators and Members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to inform themselves of the issues and make a substantive contribution to the development of policy in an important area of our foreign policy.

The article entitled \"A Gamble Not Worth Winning.\" written by Richard Holbrooke and Anthony Lake. deserves the Senates full attention. They point out the contradiction in our current course of action in Vietnam: Vietnamizing the war versus negotiating for a compromise settlement. And the result was inevitable. \"the Presidents strategy ensured that an offensive would take place\" against the South Vietnamese. This left the President with shortened options. \"trying to create new bargaining chips while buying more time on the battlefield.\" The authors of the article see the key to this dilemma in the way the President defines \"internationally supervised ceasefire.\" a demand he has made over the past 2 years and a demand that has been consistently turned down by the North Vietnamese. Beyond this. the authors conclude thatIn the endthe Presidents gamble may simply fail. regardless of what his goal is. North Vietnam has fought on before. and seems determined to do so still. until it achieves what it has bled so long to get. I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \"A Gamble Not Worth Winning\" and a separate article by Mr. Holbrooke. entitled \"Relentless Patterns to Our Vietnam Nightmare.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

I wholeheartily endorse President Nixons disclosure of the efforts which have been made to end the war in Indochina and restore the countries of that area to a level of sound economy and better living. I have suspected for some time that private talks with the North Vietnamese were underway. but I did not know definitely until the President made the announcement last night. The people of that part of the world have suffered too much and too long. The losses in life and property and well being have been enormous. I grant that the United States has made mistakes over the past 10 years. but I do not forget that after the French evacuated that area that North Vietnam. without mercy. executed an estimated 200.000 people in their clamor for vengeance. Nor do I forget that the United States at that time furnished shipping to transport an estimated 900.000 refugees out of the dangerous area in order to keep them from sharing the same fate. It was our voluntary responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of these refugees that brought us into a situation in South Vietnam which eventually developed into war. The people of the United States and the people of the world should know and they will know from President Nixons disclosure that peace with honor and a restored economy can be achieved in that area whenever North Vietnam sees fit to abandon barbaric practices against helpless victims and expresses a willingness to cooperate in making the area of Indochina a better and decent place to live. I do not know whether North Vietnam will agree to this cooperation or not but. if it does not. then I believe that the countries of the world and particularly the countries of Eastern Asia. large and small. should realize that this problem is their problem. too. and take such steps .as may be necessary to restore the wellbeing of the people there.",

I stated for the Record that the press and other news media would misrepresent the deficit as being $25.5 billion. This misleading figure is based on the false assumption that the surpluses accumulated in the various trust funds. amounting to $10.7 billion in fiscal year 1973. can be counted as revenue and used to offset deficits in the budget. I said that the true deficit for fiscal year 1973 is $36.2 billion. which is the deficit in the Federal funds. or administrative. budget. Under this unified concept. which was begun in fiscal year 1969. the surplus in the trust funds of $10.7 billion has been deducted in order to arrive at a figure of $25.5 billion as the deficit. This is an erroneous figure. It actually serves the purpose of deceiving the American people as to the true cost of government. Illustrative of what I said on Monday on the Senate floor is a headline published in the Washington Post on Tuesday. January 25. 1972. reading: \"Nixon Asks $246 Billion With $25 Billion Deficit.\" That is wrong. The deficit is $36.2 billion. Here is the headline. and I show it to the Senate.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have recently witnessed the serious situation created by the increase in health insurance rates for most Federal workers. In January of this year. health insurance rates increased for most Federal workers. The rate increase was partially offset by more Government contributions toward the biweekly premium. Existing law provides that the Government must pay 40 percent of the average highoption premium of the six major plans. Nonetheless. the impact on the pocketbook of the Federal worker was direct and substantial. This is another example of the many inequities that have been leveled against the Federal worker. The legislation that I introduce today would alleviate to a considerable degree the inequities faced by the Federal worker in the area of health insurance. I propose that the Federal Government pay the entire cost of the Federal employees health insurance. There are those who will say this is an attempt to give Government workers excess privileges. It is my contention that Federal employees have never been the object of excessive privileges. We tend to forget that increased wages and fringe benefits for Federal employees have served to raise the living standards of the Federal worker to those enjoyed by his counterparts in private industry. rather than to surpass them. This is particularly relevant in the area of health benefits. Recent studies show that private firms have moved ahead of the Federal Government in the area of employee health insurance costs. The studies show a substantial number of private firms now pay all health plan charges. Industry practices from 1960 to 1970 show the percentage of factory workers covered by fully paid insurance plans rose from 48 to 66 percent. For office workers. the number in noncontributory plans during that same period rose from 39 to 53 percent. Although the trend is clear. the Federal Government has shown little inclination to ease the soaring costs of health insurance faced by Federal employees. I call upon the Senate to give serious consideration to the need to substantially increase the Governments participation in health insurance plans.

In order to protect these employees. this bill provides that when an agency or executive policy necessitates the dismissal or relocation of civilian employees. the head of the executive agency shall inform the Post Office and Civil Service Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. and the respective employee organizations at least 120 days before any such action is taken..

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. in conjunction with the Senator from Massachusetts and other Senators. I am introducing a bill to provide Federal assistance for the battle against childhood leadbased paint poisoning. The problem of childhood lead poisoning caused by the ingestion of leadbased paints is reaching epidemic proportions in most of our large cities. This problem is almost solely confined to young children living in city slums. The accessibility to flaking and peeling lead paint and broken plaster and the ingestion of these paint chips can lead to either death or irreversible brain injury. Since acute lead poisoning causes permanent brain damage which cannot be modified by medical treatment. it is imperative that prompt action be taken to eliminate this manmade environmental hazard. The bill I am cosponsoring extends the LeadBased Paint Elimination Act of 1970. which expires on June 30. 1972. Our proposal authorizes $45 million for the Department of Health. Education and Welfare to extend programs for detecting and treating lead poisoning victims. for identifying areas where leadbased paint poisoning presents a high risk and for State health agencies to analyze lead samples in centralized laboratory facilities. This proposal would also authorize $5 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to continue its research and demonstration program in the development of improved methods for removing the hazards of leadbased paint poisoning from residential housing. This bill also changes the acceptable limit of lead additives in interior paints from 1 percent to .06 percent. It is tragic that a disease which is entirely preventable continues virtually unabated. The cost per person to remove lead paint from residential housing units is miniscule compared to a lifetime of medical costs which is estimated to run as high as $250.000 for lead poisoning treatment and medical attention. I urge Senators to pass the bill at the earliest possible date.",

I just want to say that any Democrat who fails to support the current initiative to end the war is either committed to total surrender of all Americas strategic interests in Indochina or is more interested in gaining political advantage than in ending the tragic hostilities. What we saw on our television screens was a Republican President once again trying to bring an end to a war which began under a Democratic predecessor and was enlarged by another Democratic predecessor. It ill behooves any Democrat to belittle Mr. Nixons strenuous and constant attempts to negotiate a settlement of the war. In fact. Democrats should be the very last group to take such a position. After all. President Nixon. by May 1. will have reduced U.S. troop strength by half a million men. These are the same men that a Democrat President sent off to Indochina in a major escalation of the war. I. for one. have absolutely no respect for arguments and hairsplitting over methods used by the President and his national security adviser. Henry Kissinger. The important thing is that President Nixon is trying to end a war which began in the administration of John F. Kennedy and reached its tragic peak in death and injury and cost under President Johnson. He is attempting also to bring about the release of 1.500 men. most of whom were captured before he took office.

It is a beautiful river in an unspoiled and beautiful land. The proposal has its controversial aspects.

Two years ago it became apparent that again technology had created a new type of processed potato product in the processing of potatoes by dehydration. It was discovered that processors engaged in the dehydrating of potatoes were not exempt from the marketing orders. as were canning and freezing processors. In those States where Federal potato marketing orders existed. dehydration processors faced a severe problem. Being subject to the marketing orders. they were obliged in some cases to pay a higher price for potatoes used in their processing operations than were processors who were freezing or canning potatoes or dehydration processors in other States where the marketing orders did not apply at all. Consequently. the economics of the processing industry made it impossible for these dehydrators to continue to operate in those States where a Federal marketing order was in effect. Accordingly. the 91st Congress passed legislation to exempt all processing operations from marketing order controls. The final form of the legislation included a Senate amendment placing a 2year limitation on the legislation in order to allow for *a period of examination of the new exemption. This month the 2year period will expire. and the House Committee on Agriculture has reported a Senatepassed bill which would permanently extend marketing order exemption to all potatoes for processing. It seems to me that this legislation is necessary in order to equitably apply the processing exemption that will otherwise exist only for the freezing and canning operations of the processing industry.",

In other great production areas of food and fiber stuff we have marketing orders. with markoffs and advertising and promotion and so forth. as the gentleman well knows. I have no fault to find with that. when the people vote it as the individuals who are actually producers. But are we not making a mistake by accepting more and more exclusions including everyone in the basic industry? For example. in the milk marketing orders and the checkoff system. if we excluded that portion of the milk which goes into cheese. would we not be in about a comparable situation with excluding potato producers or heavy carbohydrate producers as to any basic crop. who freeze and dry or dehydrate instead of using the total basic production as the baseline? It seems to me we are exempting more and more. to the point where we cut under the original intent of the process for making these things more consumable in the minds of the buying public.",

    "speech": "The gentleman raises a very important issue and a very pertinent question. In fact. the Committee on Agriculture was faced with somewhat of a dilemma in the consideration of this bill. On the one hand. the great majority of the committee supports the marketing order concept and is reluctant. as the gentleman says. to erode that concept to any great degree. The problem which arises. however. is that there are only two ways we can. in effect. treat processors equitably. One would be to extend a marketing order to all processing. repealing the exemption both for canning and freezing. and extending the provisions of such a universal marketing order to every State in which potatoes are raised or processed. The only alternative is to extend the freezing and canning exemption to all processing operations as this bill does. As I noted earlier. the canning exemption under the marketing order system is a very old one. It goes back to the agriculture marketing legislation of the 1937 act. The exemption for freezing dates from the 1946 amendments to the Marketing Act. To be perfectly candid with the gentleman. I doubt very much if it would be easy for the committee or for the House to remove exemptions of such long standing. I might note in recent years that the percentage of potatoes going into processing channels as that against the socalled fresh potato crops has increased dramatically in all major potatoraising States. In my own State of Washington between 70 and 80 percent of our potato crop is now being processed in one form or another. Similar developments have occurred. I believe. in the State of Maine and in Idaho. Throughout the Nation more and more of the potato crop is going into processing. There is therefore a very real problem created when marketing orders exempt some types of processing but not others. and the only satisfactory and feasible resolution of this problem that the Committee on Agriculture can suggest is balancing the treatment of processors so that all processors stand on an equal footing with relation to marketing orders by means of a general processing exemption as provided in S. 2672. I urge the House to suspend the rules and pass the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the near future the House may consider H.R. 14370. State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972. what is euphemistically called \"revenue sharing.\" It is extremely doubtful that I will support the legislation. There are many good points of criticism deserving of note. Connecticut presently has about 1.5 percent of the Nations population. Although 2 percent of the Nations Federal income tax revenues are derived from our State. only 1.37 percent of the available Federal grant funds are allocated to Comecticut under the H.R. 14370 formula. It is estimated that for every $1 collected in the State only 65 cents is returned under the present Federalgrant program. Therefore. the taxpayers of Connecticut presently contribute far more to the Federal coffers than they receive in return. The implementation of the distribution formula embodied in the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act would not appreciably improve this disparity. Connecticut and its municipalities would not receive a fair share of the funds available since only 68 cents of every $1 allocated from revenues derived in the State would be returned. Another point is that Connecticut falls below the national average in the distribution of funds. The State government would receive $7.04 per capita while the national average is $8.73 per capita. The local and State governments combined would receive $23.82 per capita while $25.70 is the national average. Hardly a bargain for Connecticut taxpayers. Another disadvantage to Connecticut is the lack of recognition of the town structure of government unique to Connecticut. City and county governments are the basic local units recognized in the bill for distribution of funds. Connecticut has no county government. Many of the towns. which are distinct municipal units of government. have populations far in excess of some of the cities and yet they have not been included in the distribution tables. Until these areas of concern have been clarified and until Connecticut and all 50 States are treated rationally and equitably. I shall not support this legislation. I commend the following editorial from the May 18 edition of the Ansonia Evening Sentinel entitled \"Revenuesharing Mirage\" to the attention of my colleagues:",

Indications then were that New England turbo would be displayed at Transpo while the only other turbo in the United States. would be in the shop for servicing. Mr. Morgan assured me at that time that servicing of the second train would take place after Transpo. thus freeing it to operate between Boston and New York during Transpo. and preventing any cutoff of turbo service to New Englanders. I was therefore disturbed to learn that the spare train is in the shop for servicing right now. that the New England turbo has already left for Transpo. and as a result.

New England citizens are now without their most modern piece of equipment. and without the service to which they are accustomed and entitled.

This loss of the Turbo leaves New Englanders without their standard equipment. and temporarily widens the gap between performance and the transportation goals which Congress had in mind when it established AMTRAK.

Such an arrangement could have prevented the current Turbo problem in New England.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Committee on the Judiciary is presently hearing testimony on various measures introduced to meet the problem of schoolbusing. A recent proposal. H.R. 13916. would place a moratorium on any new or different busing so that Congress might have time for dispassionate consideration of another bill which would also limit busing. It is my considered opinion that the moratorium legislation is not necessary. It is not necessary because if Congress can enact an unprecedented moratorium on a constitutional right and deliberately weigh all the implications of such a step without the alleged benefits of a moratorium. it can just as well consider more orthodox legislation to set standards for busing without a moratorium. The history of this Nation is replete with crises which Congress met with legislation. legislation that was hammered out midst great controversy. Congress need not be \"protected\" from the feeling of the people. In fact. I had thought that the very opposite was necessary: That the peoples representatives be ever aware of how the people feel. Thus if the purpose of the moratorium bill is to allow Congress to consider the busing issue in a pressureless atmosphere. then it would seem necessary not to enact the bill. However. even if it were enacted. the moratorium bill would not be effective. It would not bring quiet to this controversy. It would cause a new flurry of litigation. And. in my opinion. the courts could only reach one conclusionthat the moratorium bill is unconstitutional. And such a ruling would only increase. not decrease. passions. The moratorium bill can serve its purpose only if it withstands judicial scrutiny. Otherwise. the bill will accomplish what it seeks to prevent. The committee has received the opinion of 135 legal scholars on the wisdom and the constitutionality of the moratorium bill. It appears that the legal community does not think highly of the legislation. Of the 135. only one has been in favor. 134 have been in opposition. I do not think that is a very good showing.

The historical significance of Jefferson College has not been limited to Mississippi.

The people of Mississippi have long recognized the historical importance of this college and efforts are underway to restore it. Not only can it serve as a reminder to a proud past but its potential to the area as an historical attraction is unlimited. In further recognition of this landmark in our history.

We have spelled out the intent in the committee report. as well as in the language of the bill. The Secretary will draw up the guidelines. The definition of private nonprofit agencies has a welldefined meaning and we are protected against the kind of problems that the Senator is concerned about. I would be concerned about them. too. if we had not spelled out the intent in the committee report. if we did not have a 10year history with such legislation. and if it were not for the fact that the guidelines will be spelled out by the Secretary who will obviously follow the intent of the bill and be careful that the intent is complied with. We did not wish to name all the specific organizations that might engage in some kind of important public service work. If we tried to enumerate them all we would omit some group. which the Secretary may want to approve because they are performing a significant public service in a significant area.",

I think we have moved toward the Presidents position on several matters of real substance. This is not a permanent employment bill. It is an emergency bill. Recommittal would act as if we have no emergency. that there is no unemployment facing our country. The desire here is to get going with a bill that will meet the problem now. If it were passed now. there would be employment for at least 150.000 unemployed Americans by this spring or summer. if the other body acts with the dispatch that this body does. and if the President does not veto itand I do not think he has any grounds for vetoing it so that it will not be vetoedwe would at least make that dent in unemployment now and demonstrate that the program could work. and then have a full opportunity with the permanent legislation that comes before us to make a wise decision based on the experience with this or that bill.

The committee report was not available until 10:30 this morning. The bill itself is a long bill and. of course. we have barely onehalf of the Senate present. I think what the majority leader proposes. which I interpret to mean that substantive action will go over until Monday. except on such amendments that we could perhaps agree on this afternoon. is not unreasonable. and although I have resisted up to this time any unanimous consent for what I would consider to be hasty action.

One of the cases in point was not long ago when we adopted a conference report on military appropriations without having the report written and before us. By the time the report was written. there was language in that report which prohibited the expenditure of funds for advertisements by the Department of Defense. which precluded advertisements for enlistments. and which was quite a blow to the concept of a volunteer Army. which is one of the administrations primary objectives. I just think if we can avoid shortcuts which bring about those embarrassments. we are well advised.

I would also like to mention the fine work done in recent months by Mr. Harley M. Dirks. Mr. William J. Kennedy. and other members of the staff. Mr. President. there is one item in the bill that I should like to mention. The subcommittee has seen fit to increase the appropriation for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to a total of $179.318.000. This represents an increase of nearly $25 million over fiscal year This Institute. while perhaps not so glamorous as some of the others. has performed most valuable work in the fields of genetics and in biomedical engineering. NIGMS. in the past 2 years. has also collaborated with the National Bureau of Standards in the development of standard reference materials for use in laboratories throughout the country. The subcommittee has taken note of this most important project. and in its report has said: Such national standards are essential if laboratory tests performed in different parts of the countryor indeed. in different laboratories anywhereare to be comparable and provide a reliable and unvarying basis for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Within the increase provided no reduction will occur and this program will continue. I heartily concur with this thought and I would hope that NIGMS not only continues its collaborative program without reduction but will expand it. The record established in the committee indicates that part of this increased appropriation should go to expanding the interagency agreement between NIGMS and the National Bureau of Standards this year.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill which I think will both settle a current constitutional debate and restore a proper balance between the President and the Congress. Every Member of the House is aware of the controversy generated in the past 2 years over the impounding of funds by the Presidents Office of Management and Budget. Some Members have defended these actions as antiinflationary steps while others have challenged either the Presidents authority or specific instances of impoundment. On one point we can all agree. at this time the Congress is without recourse in such cases. The bill I have introduced seeks to serve two purposes. It affirms the Presidents authority to impound and also gives the Congress the opportunity to review and overrule specific instances of the use of this power. While I have disagreed with some of the recent cases of impoundment. I believe that in general it may be necessary at times in order to fight inflation. I feel just as strongly. however. that since this power means that the President can change the budgetary priorities which are established by the Congress. we must have an established procedure that restores the check and balance theme to the appropriations process. The latter goal is accomplished in the bill by using the same procedures in cases of impoundment as in cases of administrative reorganization. The President would be required to notify the respective committees of the House and Senate of the intent to impound funds and explain the reasons with respect to the specific agency and program to be affected. Either House of the Congress could then vote to stop the intended action if in the judgment of the Members there were an insufficient case made for impoundment. As in the case of administrative reorganization. the congressional action must be taken within 60 calendar days of the date on which the President communicated his intention to impound. Mr. Speaker. I am sure the Members will agree with me that there is more at stake here than the separate instances of the freezing of funds. We are now in a situation of constitutional imbalance of power. I hope. Mr. Speaker. that all of us can agree on the constitutional imperative for this legislation and that it can be considered without regard to partisanship or our individual views on specific prior cases of impounded funds.",

I rise to commend the distinguished gentleman from Michigan for his dedicated and persistent effort in urging this House to face up to the desperate need for new legislation to protect the public from devastating strikes. It is well known that I share his dismay at the irresponsible failure of the Congress to. come to permanent grips with this problem. Organized management and organized labor working together in an effort to resolve labor disputes have obviously failed to protect the public interest. and when I speak of those involved in the public interest. I mean the members of striking unions as well as the stockholders and management of the shipping companies. The public interest is sacrificed as the warring parties fail to find a peace agreement. This Congress.-which should give highest priority to iepresenting the public interest in these labor tieups causing widespread economic damage. stands helplessly by and does nothing. It is incredible that in these early weeks of this session of Congress when we have had a very thin schedule. we have devoted not 1 minutes time on the floor of this House to this great problem facing the Nation. As chairman of the House Republican Task Force on LaborManagement Relations. I have had the special opportunity to study our experience under existing laws and I must say. I have been appalled at the record. In the 25 years since Congress passed the TaftHartley Act. its provisions for dealing with strikes which imperil the public health or safety have had to be invoked over 30 times. Moreover. its emergency procedures have been used more often to halt work stoppages already in progress than to avert threatened strikes. In other words. the damage has already been done before relief comes. So that all of the Members may have an opportunity to see the facts of this record for themselves. I am inserting at this point in my remarks tables summarizing the TaftHartley experience up to the recent longshore disputes:",

I think the time is past when the American people are going to continue to tolerate the crippling strikes that tie up transportation and threaten the health and safety of the Nation. I congratulate the gentleman on sponsoring the legislation which I was proud to cosponsor with him to provide some reasonable machinery and machinery which takes into consideration not only the health and safety of the people of this Nation. but also the rights and responsibilities of both organized labor and the employers. I would say that particularly worthy of approbation would be the imaginative provision of options to the President in the event of such a crippling strike. I am entranced by what to me was a new idea of this final offer selection mechanism which. as I have heard the gentleman say before. has a tendency to bring the negotiating parties together instead of. as collective bargaining does so often today. thrusting them apart. I believe the more we can bring labor and management together the more the American people will benefit. I thank the gentleman.",

    "speech": "bill. which I have the privilege of cosponsoring. recognizes the disastrous effects prolonged transportation strikes can have on the Nation. Millions of Americans can be. and are. affected by such strikes. The recent dock strike dramatically illustrates such effects. It has been estimated that the dock strike cost the United States billions of dollars. However. we may still askis this legislation really necessary? Former President Lyndon Johnson. in his 1966 state of the Union message. recognized this problem and asked \"Congress to consider measures which. without improperly invading State and local authority. will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest.\" President Nixon also faced thi.- issue and called for a solution. Most major groups feel that something must be done. although. admittedly. most disagree as to the elements to be included in any legislation. Since 1936 we have been faced with 158 major transportation labor disputes. an average of over 4 per year. These disputes have had an untold adverse effect on our Nation. but any reasonable estimate would be in the billions of dollars. Today there are three impending transportation strikes which will add to that total. The history and extent of these disputes has been well documented and debated before. and further reference is unnecessary. The concern now becomeswhat can we do to prevent such crippling strikes from continuing. Here we must note that the emphasis is not upon prevention of strikes. rather. the emphasis is on providing the necessary machinery to curtail such devastating strikes and bring about their successful settlement. The numerous bills introduced to date offer various solutions to the problem. The bill offered by Mr. HARVEY seems to provide the most efficient and effective machinery. But whatever bill can. or will. be decided upon must provide realistic machinery and must be fair to labor as we deal with prolonged. costly transportation strikes. We cannot afford to overlook this issue again. To do so would be failure on our part to face important issues and provide solutions to the problems. I hope we will have an opportunity to consider this legislation this year.",

But certainly. whatever we do. we ought to consider it on a permanent basis. I may say also that in a meeting I was in the other day the indications were that we are probably going to face another emergency situation very soon. because the Pay Board is probably going to reject. in part. the longshoremens settlement. which may well lead to another strike on the west coast and which may very well lead to a strike on the east coast and in the gulf ports as well. and it may be impossible then for this Congress no longer to avoid facing up to some sort of permanent action in this field.

Time after time in recent years. we in the Congress have faced a crisis strike threat in the transportation industry particularly the railroad industry. With the rain pouring in. we have patched our window temporarily with Scotch tape and Saran Wrap. Then as soon as the weather improved and we had an opportunity to enact permanent legislation to replace our juryrigged patch job. we have backed off to wait for \"manana.\" It is ridiculous for the Congress to act hastily and under pressure in times of emergency and report legislation which is not really satisfactory to either side and is seldom satisfactory to us because we are forced to do so by the urgency of the immediate situation.

I have also participated in the sponsorship of a bill to establish a National Labor Court to adjudicate major labormanagement disputes generally. At this time. I do not undertake to advocate a particular bill to the exclusion of others. I simply want to join in urging this House to face up to its clear responsibility to protect the public interest by establishing mechanisms to supplement those which have proved inadequate. For far too long the Congress. by ignoring developing crises. has permitted itself to be forced ultimately to undertaking specific legislative settlements of individual work stoppages. This is not orderly conduct of the public business. The Congress is not the proper arbitrator of specific labormanagement disputes. neither the interests of the contesting parties nor those of the general public are appropriately served by such a procedure. Among the bills which have been introduced. there certainly is to be found a sensible framework on which can be built a flexible system with capacity to avoid protracted major strikes. Strangulation of the economy through widespread coordinated work stoppages in transportation cannot be tolerated. the huge financial losses which they involve. affecting as they do the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of citizens not directly involved in the disputes which precipitated the strikes. are an inconscionable mockery of both our free enterprise system and our representative form of government. That Government must respond within the framework of law. When that framework does not permit an effective response. it must be altered: We have been on notice for sufficient time that this remodeling is required. Even today. we discuss this problem under threat of further work stoppages at our portsa freezing of trade at a time of unfavorable trade balances. when we are attempting to apply our best ingenuity to improvement of our national position in world commerce. Jobs are on the line in thisnot merely the jobs of transportation employees. but also of the many industries dependent on the scheduled arrival and departure of raw materials. parts and finished goods. This is not a partisan matter. and I cannot believe that the majority in this House will not join in moving appropriate legislation to the floor.",

The uniqueness of the situation and the reason for our request for this legislation is the seasonality of the industry. Harvesting time is dictated by the product not by HEW decisions in Washington. Prior to the canning season the cooperatives and the canners involved checked with Federal regulatory agencies having the responsibility for marketing guidelines and found that it was permissible for canners to include cyclamates. There is absolutely no question of those involved adhering to the legal requirements of the regulatory agencies and this has been completely verified. As a result of the timing of the ban. the seasonality of the industry and the perishability of the product. these growers are in an entirely different position from that of the soft drink bottling industry and others affected.

I think there is no particular reason why a canner or a grower would have had any particular knowledge of some of this scientific evidence that was accumulating on this particular food additive. Another statement has been made that the canners of canned food had 31/2 months warning. That is not true. They had 312 months to dispose of the inventories which they had accumulated because they were not warned in advance. God does not turn the maturing of fruit on and off like one can stop the bottling line of CocaCola or Pepsi.Cola. It comes once a year. If they had told us about this in March we would not have canned the stuff. but it came in October. at the highest inventory level of the year. It has been said that the businessmen were skating on thin ice. implying they knew all along that this was dangerous. and that they ignored the warnings. I should like to point out that in April 1969 the National Academy of Sciences established informal tolerances for the ingestion of cyclamates by human beings. If we used that level of tolerance one would have had to eat from 25 to 35 servings of cyclamatesweetened canned peaches each and every day for all of his life. Now. as to these rats. the experiment that triggered this withdrawal. The rats were fed cyclamates at a proportionate level 50 times that recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. That meant one would have had to eat between 1.250 and 1.500 servings daily of cyclamatesweetened fruit to equal what was fed the rats. There is talk about the Secretary Finch letter. which says the rats received only 81/2 times the level of human tolerance. All right. At that level one would have had to eat between 240 and 280 servings offruit. Can you imagine eating 240 to 280 servings of canned fruit each day of your life?",

The Government will contest this. and every financial transaction will be subject to an FBI audit.\" This will be an adversary proceeding. It is not open and shut. Mr. Speaker. a couple of years ago we had a big argument on this floor about the Committee on Rules and its proper function. Some people felt that the Committee on Rules under the chairmanship of the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. Smith. was blocking legislation and was engaging in obstructionist tactics and was denying intelligent debate on the floor of the House. If I recall correctly. the gentleman from New York voted to enlarge the Committee on Rules thinking that it should no longer be allowed to obstruct free and open honest debate in the typical American fashion. I ask you now. are you afraid of the case that we are going to present today? What is so wrong with free and honest debate? If it was a good argument when we enlarged the Committee on Rules to the present membership of 15. then it is a good argument today. We ask only that the prospective claimants under this bill have a chance to go to court. All we ask of you is the chance honestly to debate this question as to whether or not they should go to court. Is there any thing more fair? Is there anything more American? I ask you to vote for this rule.",

I would like to call attention to my additional views in the report which the House Judiciary Committee submitted on this bill. As I stated there cyclamates were in general public use for a period of almost 20 years. During that time. many persons benefited from their use by successful programs of weight control. and many otherswho were physiologically prevented from consuming sugarenjoyed the. sweetness in food which most of us accept as an everyday fact. During those two decadesindeed. to the present datethere has been no evidence indicating that any human being. young or old. has contracted cancer of any kind as a result of ingesting cyclamateseven in excessive amountsor over a long period of time. For the greater part of the period in which cyclamates were in use. the Food and Drug Administration listed them on its \"generally regarded as safe\" (GRAS) list. Compensating manufacturers and distributors of these food additives for losses resulting from the FDAs abrupt decision to ban them strikes me as an equitable method for saving from financial lossin some cases. ruinthose who. in good faith. relied on an explicit representation of the Federal Government.",

Let me say first that as far as I know I have no canners in my congressional district which would be affected at all by this bill. I have thousands of coyotes. and I have a cattle and sheep industry there of substantial importance. Nevertheless I think there is a real distinction between that bill and this one. That bill went to the future. and there would have been terrible administrative problems in deciding whether a sheep or a calf or a chicken or a turkey was or was not killed by a predator. but there was no provision requiring going to court. This bill has to do with damages already suffered by persons who relied upon what they felt was the Governments assurance that they could safely use this particular chemical in the canning of their products. All they are asking for is the right to go to court. It does not have the administrative difficulties nor the other problems. to me. at least. that the other bill had. I think tlhe bills are clearly distinguishable. and I do support this bill.",

It is important for us to understand that we are not talking in all cases of indemnifying large corporations. In my district many small farmers have joined together in coops to can their fruit such as pears. I went to one such warehouse of one of those coops and saw cartons of pears that had been legally canned with cyclamates. The stack of cartons probably would have filled this entire Chamber from the floor to the ceiling. When I asked what would be done with them. the man simply turned away and said. \"I do not know.\" These farmers are. in many cases. the claimants we are discussing.

One such feature which has developed operates to the particulardisadvantage of those who rent rather than own their homes. A homeowner is presently permitted a tax deduction for the amount of his property tax as well as the interest on his mortgage. Even the owner of a cooperative apartment is allowed to deduct that portion of his rent or maintenance which represents the property taxes on his building and the interest on the mortgage. A tenant. however. is permitted no such deduction. even though his rent includes a proportion of the property tax passed on by the landlord. To eliminate this discriminatory feature. and to take an important step toward equalizing the tax burden. I am today introducing a bill which would permit a tenant the light to deduct from his personal income tax 25 percent of his annual rent. This legislation closely resembles a measure proposed in the New York State legislature by Assemblymen Eli Wager and Irwin Landes that would permit a 25 percent deduction from the New York State personal income tax. Mr. Speaker. by so acknowledging the substantial contribution the tenant makes to the property tax on his building. I believe this legislation will effectively equalize tax treatment for tenant and homeowner alike and theroby restore a long absent measure of justice to the millions of renters who now reap no benefit for the taxes they pay.",

So ignorant is the public about SIDS that even the labeling of this killer as a disease has been a major step forward In the past 3 years. Due to a lack of medical research. virtually all we know about SIDS is that it affects babies between the ages of 1 month to 1 year and fatalities reach a peak at age 3 months. Most infants die silently in their sleep without the slightest indication when they were put to bed that anything was wrong. Very often. an autopsy is performed but it fails to disclose the precise cause of death. \"Crib death.\" as it is also known. is the explanation offered to parents. Ignorance of the cause of death leads many parents to despair over the way they cared for their child and makes the entire experience especially traumatic for them. Occasionally. parents are even subjected to a police investigation because the authorities suspect some wrongdoing on the parents part. Thus. lack of knowledge compounds the tragedy for the parents.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to provide Congress with a mechanism to establish national priorities and control Federal expenditures. Our Nation is faced with a national crisis brought about by uncontrolled and misdirected spending. This fiscal crisis affects every American: In the past 10 years. the average familys share of our national budget will have risen by 82 percent from $2.022 to a projected level of $3.681. Over 10 percent of the familys taxes go down the drain to pay for the annual interest on the national debta debt which is approaching onehalf trillion dollars. Excessive spending continues to push the cost of food so high that even meat is almost out of reach of the average family. The cost of housing has escalated to the point that the average family finds it virtually impossible to own its own home without public subsidy. And now we are faced with a new kind of inflation. Just starting to take hold are fresh pressures that push up living costs. They center on the expense of cleaning up air and water. fostering consumerism. and meeting other social goals. Social programs account for about half the proposed spending for the 1973 fiscal year which starts July 1. Costs of such programs in the areas of education. manpower. health. income security. housing. civil rights. and crime reduction are estimated at $122 billion in the coming year out of total projected outlays of $246 billion. The problem of Federal spending is compounded by the diversity of roles the Federal Government Is being asked to play in the Nations economy. Setting priorities no longer involves simply a determination of how much of the Nations resources should be devoted to a particular purpose. it also requires a human audit about how each purpose can best be accomplished. At present. however. Congress lacks procedures for determining spending goals and priorities. As a first step to remedy this. Congress should: First. Project all major Federal expenditures over a 5year period. Second. Evaluate all major Federal programs at least once every 3 yearszero based budgeting. Third. Pilot test every proposed major Federal program. Fourth. Designate a joint congressional committee to evaluate the Federal budget in terms of priorities. and Fifth. Subject Federal programs financed through trust funds to the annual appropriation process just as other taxsupported programs.",

Education. and Welfare. and from all groups having an interest in vocational rehabilitation requesting to be heard. as well as from individual experts in all fields of rehabilitation. including medicine. training. and research. It was the committees intent to ascertain from those who truly know the needs within the program just what should be done. We learned a great deal during these long and substantive hearings and have applied this knowledge to the development of S. 3987. I believe we have developed an excellent bill which has as its major premise to do the very best for the individuals that the system serves. The legislation we are introducing today represents the bipartisan efforts of six Senators who gave of their time and staffs most generously in order to develop this most comprehensive bill. I refer specifically. in addition to Senator RANDOLPH. to the distinguished ranking minority member of the subcommittee",

    "speech": "Mr. President. during the recent weekend I was in Oklahoma and spent considerable time with Oklahoma wheat growers. I was greatly impressed and pleased by the good spirits and optimism which this group now exhibits in light of the healthy improvement in wheat prices. Mr. President. as a wheat grower I know from first hand experience of the disastrous costprice squeeze which the American wheat growers have faced through the last decade. In my own farming operation the income from wheat has not been suffibient to meet costs of production for many years. Therefore. the improvement in wheat prices which has occurred since the signing of the wheat agreement with Russia on July 8 is vitally important to getting this basic industry. which provides much of the food for our Nation and the world. into a profitable position. At the local elevator where I do business. last Saturday the price for hard red Ainter wheat was $1.85 per bushel. This is up roughly 50 cents since the day in June when I sold my wheat for $1.37. This healthy increase in price still leaves the price of wheat well below the parity price of $3.03. However. the increase may lift wheat growers incomes into the black when combined with the certificate payments. Mr. President. Members of the Senate have long bemoaned the plight of American agriculture. We have on many occasions undertaken to legislate a solution to the farm problem. The present farm bill. which was passed in 1969. is in my view the best farm legislation Congress has ever passed. but even. that law had not been able to improve farm income sufficiently until the consummation of the Russian grain arrangements. There are many additional benefits which are likely to come from this trade between these two nations. and I believe those who successfully concluded these difficult and delicate negotiations deserve the commendation of Congress. For that reason. I am today submitting the resolution of commendation. In this I have been joined by the distinguished Senator from Oregon . the distinguished Senator from Wyoming . the distinguished Senator from Nebraska . the distinguished Senator from Idaho . the distinguished Senators from Kansas . the distinguished Senator from North Dakota . and the distinguished Senator from Colorado",

The dramatic improvement in the grain prices shown by the present markets occurred long after the public announcement of this sale on July 8. Mr. President. I note in the morning newspaper that apparently mainland China is now about to conclude a sizable purchase of American wheat with this country. The article says: According to the Southwestern Miller Report. a grain trade journal in Kansas City. which reported today the imminent opening of grain sales to China. the initial sale is 400.000 to 500.000 tons. or 14.5 million to 18 million bushels. Thus. it appears that the initiatives taken by the administration in opening negotiations which led to sizable grain sales to Russia are now going to produce important sales to China and again result in sizable improvement in the prices received by producers of American grains. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have an excerpt from the article printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. at a time when the American farmer was faced with record wheat surpluses and continued low prices. it is inconceivable to me that fault can be found with the recent and historic wheat sales to Russia. In early July there was a wheat carryover of 900 million bushels. This will be supplemented by the estimated 1.450 million bushels the current crop is expected to bring. With sales totaling 400 million bushels. surpluses necessarily will diminish. The increase of price from 25 to over 40 cents a bushel speaks for itself. Wheat sales at these quantities and prices will benefit not only the farmer but all other facets of the American economy as well. Accusations of deals and inside information are absolutely unfounded and carry political overtones of the worst sort. These accusations result in nothing more than political and economic sabotage and could well jeopardize any future grain export negotiations. Failure of such future negotiations would hurt everybody. but -no one worse than the American farmer. The agreements to sell this wheat are good for the American farmer. good for our balance of trade. for our maritime workers. for the public and the taxpayer. They have enhanced the value of the farmers crops by nearly $1 billion. That is good now. Its thrust will be into the future by enhancing the prospects for stronger prices for 1973 and future years. The alternatives are not to engage in such sales which would mean less income to the farmer. larger surpluses. lower farm prices. tighter controls on farmers. higher Government costs at the expense of the taxpayer. and no progress in the reduction of deficit in our foreign trade balance. In fairness. hasty. intemperate critics should follow their sniping by frankly approving or rejecting such alternatives. The facts are that the general and lasting benefits of the sales are a credit to those who worked diligently and with foresight to gain them for America.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in May of this year. prior to President Nixons Moscow trip. I spoke before this body in support of SovietAmerican trade. For too long we have been locked in a struggle which led to the polarization and division of much of the world. As I said then. a degree of understanding is in our grasp through trade and economic development between the worlds leading industrial powers. President Nixon actively sought this understanding and has laid the foundation. On July 8 he successfully completed negotiations with the Soviet Union for the purchase of at least $750 million of U.S. grain over the next 3 years. He secured Russias agreement to our credit terms and paved the way for purchase agreements between U.S. firms and the Soviet international trading agencyExportkhleb. The economic benefits are clear to all who will take the time to look. The sales have increased the value of farmers crops by nearly $1 billion. Governmentheld stocks have been reduced. This enhances the prospect of stronger grain prices for farmers next year. The sale to Russia has reduced the cost to U.S. taxpayers. the export subsidy payments which equalize highpriced U.S. wheat in competitive world markets with lower cost wheat from other exporting nations is now offset by dollar savings. Efforts to discount the value of this agreement are totally irresponsible. Although the agreement was signed after some farmers had already sold their 1972 wheat crop. estimates indicate that by July 15. farmers had sold only 330 million bushels of wheat out of a total supply of 1.958 million bushels under farmers control. The whole world should rejoice over this historic grain sale. The key to the future peace and political stability rests with economic interdependency. By developing peaceful but binding trade links with the Soviet Union. the United States can accomplish through economic means that which we cannot accomplish with force at the presenta reduction of tension and an increase in understanding. Even more important. if we have the courage to pursue this process in a manner consistent with the principles and values of America. we can achieve our most fundamental objectivethe extension of freedom.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of Senator BELLMoNs resolution commending the administration and Americas farmers for their ability to negotiate recent large sales of American wheat. corn. and soybeans to the Soviet Union. thereby improving the economic situation for this countrys farmers. In recent years as we have witnessed the decline in numbers of family farms and increasingly difficult circumstances for agricultural producers. politicians have become adept at giving lipservice to rural problems. but devoting their energies to matters of impact in more urban areas where there are more people. The recent negotiations for the sale of agricultural products to the Soviet Union represent a concrete and important action to improve the lot of agricultural producers in this country. The Russian sale is a boon to American farmers. Higher market prices resulting from greatly increased exports have given farmers a definite market advantage. The value of the 1972 wheat crop is now estimated at about $2.2 billion. compared with $1.9 billion in 1968a year when the crop was almost identical in size. Any reduction in the pressure on domestic supplies tends to strengthen prices of wheat in the U.S. markets. Domestic prices have moved up for wheat more than 40 cents. I cannot conceive of these negotiations as anything but a plus for American agriculture. and I think it is most unfortunate that some have attempted to detract from this important and valuable transaction by making unfounded charges in a distinctly sourgrapes fashion.",

State. and local agencies and courts. It concerns the purchase or renting of a residence. The amendment merely adds another example of the \"interests of consumers\" to the many now listed in section 401 (11) which attempts to define this term. It makes clear that one of the substantial interests of consumers of real property for residential use is the availability of nearby school facilities for the use of their children and the protection of such children from the delays and dangers of forced busing to schools outside their neighborhood. If there is any doubt about the fact that this is a substantial interest and concern to purchasers or renters of residences. one need only ask any real estate agency about the matter. Among the first questions. after price. asked by potential residence purchasers are: \"Will our children be bused. and. if so. to where and how long will it take?\" There is no doubt--as even the most avid proponents of this bill knowthat this is a substantial concern of consumers. and therefore should most certainly be covered by the bill. This amendment is neededand I say this for legislative historyto show that busing is a priority concern of consumers who are in need of priority protection by forceful advocates in the confused deliberations of Government at all levels. and to make it clear that these consumers can organize nonprofit antibusing groups that would be eligible for Federal funding under title III of S. 3970.

We are called upon to approve an interim agreement which provides for Soviet superiority in landbased and seabased missiles. Why do I say that? We are called upon to ratify an interim agreement that says the Soviet Union can have 1.618 intercontinental ballisic missiles. we can have 1.054. They can have 62 Polaristype submarines. we can have 44. So it is 1.618 versus 1.000 ICBMs. and. seabased. it is 62 Polaristype submarines for them. 44 for us. if we give up the 54 Titan missiles. Mr. President. we are called upon. on an interim. temporary basis. to approve that agreement.

Therefore. it is not a reservation on the interim agreement. It is a policy statement in connection with future negotiations in SALT II. to start in October. Confusion could arise from the fact that the Senate is agreeing. on an interim basis. to a freeze on land- and seabased missiles that gives them superiority. so that when our negotiators go to Geneva. the first thing the Russians are going to say is. \"Well. we will start right from here. You have already agreed to this ratio of 50 percent more delivery vehiclesand a 4 to 1 advantage in throwweight.\" All I am saying. and the President supports this. is that it will strengthen his hand when the negotiators sit down at Geneva to say. \"We want to be there on the basis of equality.\" The Russians demanded equality on the ABM.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the news of the weekend brought us face to face. once again. with a business failure and the name of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. This time it was the prestigious RollsRoyce. Ltd.. that found itself in receivership. mainly because of its inability to produce engines for the Lockheed TriStar airliner. Rolls had bid for the Lockheed contract and won on the basis of an unusually low bid. Parenthetically. it should be remembered that Lockheed got the C5A contract on the basis of a very low bid for the mammoth plane. But the interesting facet of this whole adventure is how the British government of Prime Minister Heath reacted to the financial failure of its largest defense supplier and a firm whose stability and prestige is a cornerstone of the British economy. Heath moved quickly to take over the operation of the film. There was no haggling over how much money should be paid to RollsRoyce to \"bail it out\" of its problems. It appears to me as if the British reaction to their dilemma was far more responsible than a similar American response when Lockheed. blending incompetency with greed. proved incapable of fulfilling the C5A contract and faced bankruptcy. We are making plans to give money to Lockheed when we should be assuming their assets on the basis of default. We now own the plants that produce the C5. I know of defense contractors who would rush to assume the C5 contract and who would probably do a much better job. The lesson here is plain. and that is no pun. The British decisive takeover of a failing RollsRoyce is a much more enlightened. pragmatic. and wellreasoned decision than the Defense Departments scheme to bully Congress into giving Lockheed unknown millions in reward for their failure. We should mirror our English cousins in this regard and not shillyshally with propping up defense contractors. CXVII134---Part 2",

State water officials endorsed. for the first time. the recycling and reuse of waste water to meet the anticipated needs of the future. Previously. Mr. Speaker. State officials have been reluctant to give more than faint acknowledgment to this process and reusage of a precious natural resource. Instead. they have steadily plodded on maintaining that high dams. reservoirs. and interbasin transfer systems are the only means of augmenting the water supply of a growing metropolitan area. Those officials. principally within the State of Californias Department of Water Resources. have declined to give more than passing notice to water recycling. despite the efforts of many interested conservationists and scientists. In short. Mr. Speaker. the technology of the 1970s has been abandoned in favor of water storage facilities conceived 50 years ago when environmental and ecological considerations were nil. I think it important that the State of California has finally recognized the merits of water recycling. I would like at this time to submit in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a newspaper article that appeared in the Palo Alto Times on this matter. It should be noted. however. that only northern California is mentioned in this article. I would hope that the omission of southern California in the comments of State officials was not intentional.

The article which follows is chapter 5 of Mr. Lairds stimulating book published by Henry Regnery. entitled \"A House Divided.\" The difference between 1962 and 1971. as far as force relationships are concerned. is that the Soviets have achieved nuclear parity with the United States in practically all areas and in several crucial aspects of defense preparedness enjoy a position of relative superiority. Several outstanding and respected strategists speculate that the Soviets may be as far as 3 years ahead of the United States in the field of space weaponry. The question to be settled today is not whether we will do the things necessary to maintain superiority. we failed to do so and it vanished. but whether we will attempt to assure our survival by establishing an equilibrium which can only be maintained by a position of sure U.S. superiority in strategic weaponry.",

The agency was established in 1968 by the State legislature to protect and study the water resources of the SacramentoSan Joaquin River Delta. The agencys resolution condemned the proposed water diversion canal in no uncertain terms by stating: Be it resolved by the Directors of the Delta Water Agency that this Agency is unequivocally opposed to the proposed Peripheral Canal. This is a striking victory for those who have been fighting for the preservation of the baydeltas environment. Of all the numerous agencies and entities that are concerned with the delta water resources. none is more directly representative of the delta itself than the Delta Water Agency. Mr. Speaker. it is no secret that the Delta Water Agency was originally conceived and formed with the blessing of the state department of water resources. The department expected that the agency would meet whatever demand the department considered necessary in order to facilitate delivery of the water to customers to the south of the State. However. and to the great credit of the directors of this agency. it has shown that it would not be a \"rubber stamp\" organization serving the special interests of Mr. William Gianelli. Director of the department of water resources.

I suppose seriously. in this body and in the other body. I f rankly think that it would not only undermine the possibility of obtaining fiscal reform for local government. such as revenue sharing. but it would be a disservice to local governments. as well. It seems to me that if we were to adopt the plan of simply taking $5 billion of welfare costs off the shoulders of local governments and transferring it to the Federal Government. instead of adopting revenue sharing. these things would occur. although they would not be intended. First. 11 States of the Union would be recipients of about 50 percent of the benefits. Thirtynine States of the 50 States would be worse off than they were before. which hardly seems an equitable response to the problem. Second. local governments. distinguished from State government. meaning our hardpressed cities and counties. would share hardly at all. only States would. Third. and this is especially important. we would completely eliminate the present hard pressure to reform a patently unworkable welfare system. I do not mean to create the impression that I derive any satisfaction or take any happiness from our plight in the welfare field. but this plight itself is a stimulus to Congress to reform the welfare system. All. three of these results would be undesirable. and I feel these things would occur if we were to substitute welfare relief for revenue sharing.

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Tennessee. The argument is made that there is no Federal revenue to share. This comment is based on a misconception. It erroneously assumes that the revenue sharing concept should apply only when and if there is an \"excess\" or surplus of left over Federal revenue after other requirements are taken care of. As envisioned by the Nixon administration. the recommended revenue sharing is as important and essential as other items in the Federal budget. \"The alternative to revenue sharing.\" says Treasury Assistant Secretary Murray Weidenbaum: Is not a smaller Federal deficit. The alternative is a higher level of Federal spending in some otherand. in our view. lower priorityprogram areas. President Nixon makes it clear that he regards revenue sharing. like defense spending. or other major national efforts as one of the important programs of this administration. Viewed in that light. revenue sharing would bear no greater responsibility for a deficit than any other program referred to in the budget. Some opponents charge that bureaucratic waste results when taxes are paid to the Federal Government and then routed back again to the States and localities. This is the socalled costly round trip. Actually. Treasury costs for tax collections are lower than comparable costs incurred by State or local government when it acts as a collection agency. Skeptics. as we have seen. are asking: Will State and local governments spend the revenue they share effectively. without hankypanky and with wisdom? Who knows? This Is a hazard faced by democracies and tyrannies alike. Human frailties. human Judgments. all these imponderables are involved. William Gladstone once said that: The proper function of government is to make it easy for the people to do good and difficult for them to do evil. That is what revenuesharing is all about. More and more the officials who actually make the decisions will now be operating in goldfish bowls closer to the people. where it will be easier to do good and more difficult to do evil.

Mr. Bartley addressed himself to the recent spate of charges and countercharges on the issue of wiretapping and other forms of Government surveillance of private and public citizens. As Mr. Bartley points out. there have been excesses on both sides. and it is precisely in these excesses that Mr. Bartley perceives a longterm danger to the bonds that hold our society together. He notes with regrettable accuracy that \"rhetorical exaggeration is a standard instrument of politics.\" and it would be naive of me or anyone else to hope that this might cease to be the case. But I do believe quite strongly that as elected public officials we have a special responsibility to nurture and protect those forces that tend to hold the society together. This does not mean that we should avoid the unpleasant features of our national life or that we should feel any inhibition to speak out forcefully in support of programs and policies that we feel. as individuals. would work to make a better America. But at a time of great national stresswhich this certainly isit may be that some of us do damage to those causes in which we most deeply believe when we seek to draw attention to them with exaggerated rhetoric. Words are among the most important tools of a practicing politician. Words can lose a great deal of their meaning and usefulness if they are not used with care and precision.

Thousands of jobs for low- and middleincome workers are being transferred into areas in which adequate housing is unavailable for them. The New York Times article documents the active competition between suburban areas for the location of new industry. Any city that seeks to derive the benefits of industrial location should also be required to assume the responsibilities of providing adequate housing for the workers associated with such businesses. I have. therefore. introduced S. 1282. the Government Facilities Location Act. which would require Federal agencies and companies with Federal contracts to insure that adequate housing exists for their low- and middleincome workers before they locate or expand in any area. Providing housing in the suburbs to those with jobs there would be a major step toward bridging the increasing gap between our impoverished central cities and the affluent suburbs that surround them.

One of the major points made by the article is that the Advisory Council is recommending broadening of medicare at the very time that the executive branch is advancing proposals which would seriously reduce the effectiveness of that program. Briefly. the administration is proposing reduction of the hospitalization period under which medicare would pay the costs and higher deductible for the medical portionpart Bof medicare. The Social Security Advisory Council. on the other hand. proposes extension of medicare to include payment for some outofhospital prescription drugs. an increase in hospitalization from 60 to 120 days. and extension of medicare to those receiving disability benefits under social security.

Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD two perceptive articles written during the past few days by Marjorie Hunter of the New York Times.

Recently. the Senate Committee on Aging took testimony on proposed administration cutbacks under the Older Americans Act. and we were told bluntly by witness after witness that the reductions would cause widespread setbacks to promising programs. Now we are given additional evidence of administration determination to reduce beneficial programs for older Americans.

I transmit herewith a copy of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation. signed at Montreal on September 23. 1971. The report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention is also transmitted for the information of the Senate. The problem of sabotage. armed terrorist attacks. and other criminal acts against aircraft and air travelers poses an increasingly grave threat to civil aviation around the world. Events have shown that no country or area is exempt from the human tragedy and immense costs which result from such criminal acts. At the International Conference on Air Law at The Hague in December of 1970. the Hijacking Convention was adopted. It contains provisions to ensure that all hijackers. wherever found. would be subject to severe punishment. The United States and 39 other countries have now ratified that Convention. It is hoped that all States will join in this major step to deter the peril of air piracy. The work of applying similar provisions to other acts directed against the safety of civil aviation was completed by the Diplomatic Conference at Montreal in September 1971. The Convention which that Conference produced and which I am transmitting today covers sabotage and other criminal acts. Like the Hijacking Convention. it requires States to extradite offenders or prosecute them where they are found. It is designed to ensure the prosecution of saboteurs and other terrorists who attack aircraft. and it can help serve to quell this Increasingly serious problem for civil aviation worldwide. This Convention and the Hijacking Convention are vitally important to achieve safe and orderly air transportation for all people of the world. I hope all States will become Parties to these Conventions. and that they will be applied universally. I recommend. therefore. that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention.",

But these Members. many of whom have become candidates for the Presidencyarmchair generals. who sit in this and the other bodyhave about as much capacity in my judgment to run the war and the country as some of those who constantly criticize everything that is done in this Nation. This is not a bad country. This country is made up primarily of good people. While I respect the service rendered this Nation in the Vietnam war by those who are now demonstrating in front of the Capitol. I do not respect the manner in which they are registering their complaint against the war. They are not impressing anyone but themselves. And they are not helping anyone but the enemy. This kind of conduct is not going to get us out of the war. neither is the conduct of the current armchair generals and candidates for President. Hanoi hears with glee every criticism they make of the Presidents direction of the war. Neither I nor the Nation is impressed with these \"instant\" candidates for the Presidency. This is the earliest a presidential campaign has ever been inaugurated. Those who think they are running for President are dividing this Nation over the war when we all should be pulling together. I think by the time the conventions meet next year those who are now running for President will be long forgotten. The plan of our President to get us out of Vietnam is working. In spite of the armchair generals and obstructionists here in the Congress. we will soon be out. with honor. We could be out much sooner if these obstructionists who think they are running for President would invoke a moratorium on their mouthing criticisms. Let us all try pulling together behind the President for a while. Just let us try.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to make two points in response to the gentleman from Missouri. No. 1. there is no literacy test required for voting in the United States today by virtue of the action of the Congress. In 1970 in extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965. we enacted a nationwide ban on literacy tests for voting. No. 2. this bill merely proposes to extend the present law. Under the present law. if an alien was 50 years of age and had lived in the United States for 20 years as of December 24. 1952. he would have been eligible for naturalization without passing a literacy test. This bill advances that date to exempt an alien over 50 years of age who has lived in the United States for 20 years at the time of filing an application for naturalization. In other words. if an alien is 50 years old and has lived for 20 years in the United States. at the time of filing his .petition for naturalization. he shall not be required to pass an English language literacy test. Mr. Speaker. there is a very humanitarian purpose behind this legislation. and that is to permit those aliens who wish to be citizens. yet are barred by the literacy requirement. to do so after they have lived in the United States for 20 years and are 50 years old. There are many people in this country who have come from foreign lands seeking freedom and opportunity. They have made major contributions to our national life. but for one reason or another. and usually it is a psychological matter. they find it very difficult to take and pass a literacy test. This legislation is consistent with the purpose that we had in mind when we abolished the literacy test for voting. and we should do no less for the small number of deserving people involved under this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1535. a bill to amend section 312 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. This bill is similar to a measure I sponsored which passed the House on December 4. 1967. but did not become law because of the failure of the Senate to act. This change is still greatly needed to obtain equity for many deserving persons. and I am happy the House is acting on it early in the 92d Congress. Section 312 which was amended by Public Law 82414 provided that aliens who were 50 years old and who resided in this country for 20 years. as of the effective date of this act. could become naturalized citizens without meeting the requirement of being able to read. write. and speak the English language. It happened that the effective date of that act was December 24. 19.52. Thus any alien born before December 24. 1902. and who lived in this country for at least 20 years could have the benefit of this waiver. This arbitrary date has created a great inequity in law. Many longtime resident aliens who have lived here for 30 or more years. but who were not 50 years old as of December 24. 1952. are arbitrarily denied the waiver. I think it is only fair that these longterm residents of our country who wish to take a full part in the affairs of their adopted homeland be given the same opportunity for citizenship as those who arrived here before them and who took advantage of this waiver because of the prior act of Congress dated December 24. 1952. which since that date has become an arbitrary cutoff. Todays 20year alien resident must be 68 years old to qualify for this waiver. If in 1952. 50 years of age was appropriate. then I think it is still appropriate today. The present cutoff date merely perpetuates an inequity that has no logical basis for being. In view of these factors. I strongly urge that the House act favorably on this legislation which I originated in 1966.",

I feel that the frustrations of persons like this particular citizen. who wrote in despair. \"What can we do to crack down on these violators?\" might be answerable.

I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for the purpose of his amendment. but I should like to respectfully disagree with the method and tack he has taken. I agree with the Senator that so far the environmental protection statutes of the United States and the several States have not been totally effective. I think we will all agree that the original efforts in this direction. beginning at the Federal level in 1948. have been sketchy and spotty and incomplete. But dating from the more recent efforts in the 1960s and now. with this bill. in 1971. I think we will all agreethat we have learned a great deal. One of the things we have learned. however. is that it is not an absence of statutes that has caused our problem but. rather. an absence of the will to enforce the statutes. or the practical enforceability of the concept. I am sure we will all recall that a recent bit of legal archeology has unearthed the socalled Refuse Act of 1899. which is far more severe than the water quality bill before the Senate. The Refuse Act of 1899. which would apply to the discharge from the industrial plant that the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois referred to. and would absolutely prohibit that discharge into the receiving waters of the United States. is far more severeand has been since 1899than anything the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin proposes or anything that is proposed in this bill. The heart of the matter is simply that we have not gotten around to enforcing the Refuse Act of 1899. nor had we even known that it existed. so far as most of us were concerned. until it was brought to our attention by litigants on behalf of the quality of the environment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I strongly support the objectives of title IX of H.R. 10947. to provide more equitable tax treatment for citizens who make contributions to candidates for public office. I have always resented the attitude that political giving is somewhat less noble. less in the public interest than giving to the United Fund. buying Easter seals. supporting the Red Cross or many other similar socalled taxexempt organizations. Government is a necessary part of society. In our system. political parties and campaigns are equally necessary. Citizens who support the political process are in most cases among the most unselfish and the most to be admired. They deserve to be treated the same as others who make sacrifices in the public good with no expectation of selfish gain. The citizens who support the political process in most cases are most unselfish and most of them are to be admired and deserve to be treated the same as others who make contributions. While I am in agreement with the purposes of title IX. I feel there is a small but highly significant deficiency in the amendment. I am offering this amendment to help correct it. The problem is that. under the bill as written. special interest groups can use the device and the inducement of tax exemption to gather large sums of money from their members and then use these funds to make large single contributions to certain candidates.",

Never in my tenure as a Member of this body have I seen a more careless and hastily contrived piece of draftsmanship than is evident by this amendment. I have been pleased and honored to work very closely with the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island for over a year to develop a sound campaign reform bill. His diligence and expertise in this matter is not easily surpassed and he was instrumental in having the Senate pass. by a wide margin with bipartisan cooperation. the strongest election reform bill in history. His present amendment does his earlier work a tremendous disservice. When Senators MANSFIELD. PASTORE. and CANNON first introduced S. 382. the Election Reform Act of 1971. they included an alternative tax credit or tax deduction for small political contribu* tions. My own bill. S. 956. contained a similar provision. Yet now we have the Pastore amendment presented to us as an - all or nothing proposition. The Senate has not held one hearing on this proposal in over 5 years and now we are beI ing asked to have the American taxpayer cough up a dollar. not only to finance the candidate of his choice but his opponent as well. This is witless and invites the taxpayer to ignore this doubleedged invitation to bite himself.",

The Senate of the United States has not even completed action on this measure. We are still debating the administrations tax package. The Senator from Minnesota had an amendment last week with respect to the lowincome allowance. The amendment was passed by this body. and it affected the tax year 1971. The Treasury will have to accommodate that amendment in the 1971 tax forms. if it is accepted by the conferees. The Senator from Kentucky actually voted for that amendment.

But there is no question that the major hearings that were held by the Finance Committee in 1967 have made a solid record in support of the present version. as has the excellent committee report filed in November 1967. This is not a flybynight measure. It has been given careful consideration. Major hearings have been held on it. and the Finance Committee reported it favorably in 1967. I feel that is a most important reform. and the groundwork has been carefully laid. I reject the suggestion by the Senator from Connecticut. He does not understand title X. The checkoff it provides is purely voluntary. and I think it will be one of the most significant and important reforms we have ever enacted for our democracy. It involves two very important factors. First. it broadens the base of participation in our political system and. second. for the first time in the history of our Nation. it provides the kind of financial independence required for people who wish to seek high office. but who do not want to be dependent upon special interests in this country.

I have long been an advocate of a breakthrough in housing through inproved technology and the revision of archaic and anachronistic building codes. including work rules. which only add to the cost of housing projects. I believe it is high time that we acted in this country. Too often we have been. perhaps. more concerned with how organized labor might react than we have been concerned with getting the costs of housing down within the reach of lowincome families. In the original breakthrough proposition. I remember it was supported by Walter Reuther. then the president of the United Auto Workers. He testified before the committeee that the big problem is that the American people are getting Chevrolet homes at Cadillac prices. I concur with that remark. I think that now is the time for this country to use the technology it has. and the production methods it has. to bring housing within the reach of the lowincome family without exorbitant cost. Thus.

I very much appreciate the assurances both in committee and on the Senate floor from the chairman of the committee that we will have full and adequate hearings on this matter. I know that the Senator from Alabama supports lower costs in housing for every American family. There is no question about his sincerity. Nor is there any question in my mind about some of the examples such as the one he cited in Mississippi. We have had some in the State of Tennessee when a tornado has hit. The Senator spoke of the recent signing of the agreement in Washington. There is not any question that some of these things will happen. My question. however. is whether enough things are happening. The tornado of high prices have affected every American family. and I question whether the building codes and restrictive work agreements are being relaxed to truly respond to the needs. I know that labor has done a magnificently responsive job in crisis situations such as tornadoes. I am most grateful for their sense of public responsibility. However. I also know what happens at the local level when we try to get plastic pipe approved in San Francisco or plastic electrical conduits approved in Los Angeles. I know that it is almost impossible to do because of the political pressures that exist to maintain the status quo. And the status quo is the 19th century construction techniques which impede the construction of housing for every family in the country. I think it is an absolute tragedy that because of politics this Congress has allowed a situation to develop which has priced most housing out of the reach of most families today in America. The very bill we are debating would raise the Federal subsidy up to an amount that would cover families with earnings of $11.000 a year. The very fact that we have the pending bill before us indicates that something is fundamentally wrong with this industry. I think it is up to Congress to address this problem and to address it now.",

Many different modular housing producers are doing it. It is not limited to disaster areas. One other thing I would like to say. talking about the high cost of housing. I remember 2 or 3 years ago during the course of our hearings we had testimony on the question of rising costs. The figures. as I remember them. showed that the increase in the cost of land was the highest of any of the figures.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this is a teclqnical amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify further the provision already in the bill relating to rehabilitation property under FHA guarantees which would extend the life of existing loans. to provide funds for rehabilitation purposes in accordance with the act. It stems also out of misinterpretation of language in the committee report. I am proposing the amendment. because it makes it clear that in the case of the refinancing of a home mortgage which involves rehabilitation. the mortgage amount eligible for FHA insurance will be based on the appraised value of the property before rehabilitation plus the estimated cost of rehabilitation. This is a technical amendment which insures that loantovalue ratios will be applied to refinanced mortgages involving rehabilitation in the same way as they are applied to other mortgages involving rehabilitation. The amendment is necessitated by an erroneous statement in the committee report. which reads: Where the mortgage would also refinance existing indebtedness. it (the mortgage amount) would be further limited to the (loantovalue) ratios as applied to the cost of rehabilitation plus the amount required to refinance the outstanding indebtedness. The effect of basing the maximum mortgage amount on the outstanding indebtedness rather than the appraised value of the property before rehabilitation would be to force homeowners who are refinancing their mortages in order to obtain money for rehabilitation to put up an increased amount of their own equity in order to be eligible for refinancing. even though they have already been making payments on the property for 3 years. One of the main advantages which the committee saw in the refinancing provision was that unlike home improvement loans which force homeowners to assume second mortgages. refinancing of the first mortgage over a longer period of time would make money available for rehabilitation without forcing an increase in the homeowners monthly payments. This should be a great advantage to owners who would like to rehabilitate. but just cannot afford to increase their monthly payments. The committee report language would to some degree counteract this advantage by eliminating homeowners who could not come up with the additional equity required at the time of refinancing. I hope that the Senate will move quickly to adopt this technical amendment.",

Although there have been numerous meetings between representatives of FDA and the McNaughton Foundation during the past 9 months. the status of this drug remains unchanged: It cannot legally be sold in the United States. and no physician is authorized to investigate in cancer patients whether or not Laetrile is of value. Mr. Speaker. I have no basis for judging whether or not this drug is safe and effective for the treatment of cancer. nor do I know if the McNaughton Foundation has provided FDA with adequate data to warrant clinical testing with Laetrile. I do know. however. that a great many Americans believe that they. or members of their families. have been helped by Laetrile treatments obtained in Mexico or elsewhere. I know this from letters sent me from all parts of the country and from the numerous inquiries I have received from Members of both Houses of the Congress. For the information of my colleagues who are concerned with this matter. I am including with my remarks a letter which I have sent to Health. Education. and Welfare Secretary Elliot L. Richardson. In that letter I have urged Secretary Richardson to arrange for an impartial review and evaluation by cancer experts of the patient records for the approximately 1.000 cases in which the McNaughton Foundation claims Laetrile has already been used successfully in the treatment of cancer. I have also proposed that the National Cancer Institute perform further animal tests with Laetrile. inasmuch as this drug apparently has shown some activity in the tests sponsored by the McNaughton Foundation. An immediate and objective evaluation of the recent clinical experience with Laetrile. particularly in Mexico and Germany. is imperative in my judgment both to give the American people the facts about this drug and to strengthen public confidence in our Government.",

From the report we read: Every American should be able to look upon Washington. the Nations Capital. with a personalsense of pride in its beauty and dignity. Later on in the report. it is stated: The level of crime in the Nations Capital is a national disgrace and the recommended 1970 appropriation for the District of Columbia reflects the resolve of this committee to deal with the problem as a matter of the utmost importance. The population of the District of Columbia in 1971 is only about 765.000 persons. which is significantly less than the population was 20 years ago in 1950. with 802.000 persons calling Washington home. But crime. instead of keeping pace with the population. has skyrocketed. This year the District of Columbia is spending nearly $85 for each person in the District as an expense of operating the Police Department. This is 21/2 times the cost in Milwaukee. for example. a city with the same population. We have in the Nations Capital almost seven policemen per 1.000 of population. whereas Milwaukee has less than three.

Not the least of these problems is racism promoted and preserved by racists in high positions. In Europe. charges of rampant racism have been leveled by black GIs for years and until recently. they obviously had fallen on unsympathetic ears. Ever since I took office in Congress 2 years ago. I have been getting letters and petitions and complaints from black soldiers alleging unfair arrests. transfers in the middle of the night. unequal punishments issued to blacks and whites for the same alleged crimes. unequal opportunity for decent housing. and discriminatory practices by biased German landlords. often with the encouragement and approval of high military officials. At no place were these reports more numerous than in General Polks area of command. It is common knowledge among black GIs that General Polk is a bigot as exemplified by his actions and offtherecord statements on many occasions. Had General Polk used the powers he had. he could have eliminated many of the problems that existed thus lessening the animosities and hos.tilities between black and white troops and between black soldiers and biased German businessmen. Secretary Laird. at a yearend press briefing. stated that the Defense Department was going to lead the way in providing equal opportunity for all of its personnel. I would like to commend Secretary Laird on his obvious intent to make good on his promise to cure an illness that has been reflected in our armed services too long without relief for minorities. It was obvious to all of us that the racial situation would never improve in Germany as long as General Polk was in command. While I commend the Secretarys actions In this case. I feel that part of the deterrent value has been lost because the Army permitted General Polk to retire Instead of filing formal charges.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill to amend the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. This amendment will require the retailer to advise the customer of the unit price of a commodity as well as the price of the particular package. This bill is designed to aid the household shopper in the supermarket who has been victimized for many years by the proliferation of sizes of commodities. sizes which do not indicate on their face the true price of the commodity by weight. For example. I have often entered a supermarket and found laundry soap in containers marked \"regular size\". \"economy size\". \"giant size\". and \"family size\". In each instance I have been led to assume that the price per ounce of the product was less If purchased in a larger package. This is not always the case. and unless the shopper carries her own computer. it is difficult to determine the true cost of the product. This legislation is very simple. It merely requires the retailer to prominently display on the shelf. not only the cost of the product as packaged. but also the cost per weight measure of the particular commodity. In most cases the weight measure would be listed in terms of ounces. This. of course. is an administrative detail best left to the Department of Agriculture which would administer the law. In any case. Mr. Speaker. it is time that the consumer not only knew what he was purchasing. but also the true cost of these products.

Under -the sponsorship of the Student Bar Association of the Georgetown University Law School. a national conference will be held on April 17 and 18 at Georgetown Law School to focus attention on the legal problems faced by enlisted men in the military service. The goal of the conference will be to establish several legal aid offices manned by civilian attorneys and law students near military bases which will begin to operate this summer and later evolve into a nationwide organization. Preliminary plans include a 4 to 6 week course in military law to be taught by qualified attorneys followed by the formation of a network of GI legal services groups to be set up near large military installations. These groups will provide free legal service to any serviceman who requests it. This initiative is consistent with insuring the constitutional rights of all our citizens. and I commend the Student Bar Association of Georgetown University Law Center for its efforts to secure equal justice within our system of Constitutional Law.",

I take this time to announce that hearings on this legislation will begin on Wednesday. March 1. and continue on Thursday. March 2. Tuesday. March 7. Wednesday. March 8. and Tuesday. Mir. Speaker. in the last session of Congress. the Select Subcommittee on Education conducted hearings on various bills to expand and improve services to older Americans. Hearings were held not only in Washington. D.C.. but also in Chicago. New York. and Boston. Witnesses included major organizations representing the aging. State. and local officials. Governors. Senators. the administration. and private individuals. As a result of those hearings. together with nine other members of the Education and Labor Committee. I introduced H.R. 12017 on December 2. 1971. Over 75 Members of the House have introduced identical or similar legislation since that time. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 12017 is aimed at providing comprehensive services for the elderly. including nutrition. transportation. preretirement training. and health services. Here is a list of the key features of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1972: First. Strengthened role of the Administration on Aging in the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. Second. Expanded services under the Older Americans Act. Third. Lowcost transportation. Fourth. Expanded work service opportunities including strengthening the retired senior volunteer programRSVPand the foster grandparents programs. Fifth. Effective coordination of Federal aging programs. Sixth. Preretirement training program. Seventh. Health. nutrition. education. and other social services. Eighth. Improved system of delivering services to older citizens. and meaningful employment opportunities. Ninth. Establishment of a gerontological research center to study the aging process. Tenth. Multipurpose senior centers. Eleventh. Establishment of a National Information and Resource Center for the Aging. Twelfth. Program of continuing education. Mr. Speaker. a major theme of last Decembers 1971 White House Conference on Aging was that the time for action. as distinguished from rhetoric. on behalf of Americas older citizens. is now Members of the Select Subcommittee on Education intend to do their part to enable the House to have an opportunity to act on behalf of the older people of our country. .

Millions of the captive nations victims were loaded into boxcars and sent to slave labor camps in Siberia and other remote localities. Many died of starvation and for lack of shelter.

I have received many letters from my congressional district and other parts of Indiana from citizens of Ukrainian descent protesting the inhuman treatment being inflicted on thousands of Ukrainians now under the Soviet Government.

We gave them $420 million last year. They asked for $400 million in fiscal year 1972. We gave them $200 million. We cut that by 50 percent. So in some areas of course we have cut it very substantially. Had it not been for some of the other organizations. such as the InterAmerican Development Bank. the World Bank and others. this bill would have been much lower than it is. But I think we made a very good start in this long conference to bring this program under control. If the gentleman will yield for one further statement. The trend is toward multilateral foreign aid. In the multilateral organization we do not know when the money is obligated. we do not know the amount obligated. we do not know to what country it is obligated to. and we do not know for what purpose it is obligated. We are gradually pushing foreign aid over into the multilateral area where we have little or no control.

Second we were prevented from cutting further by the fact this appropriation was held up for many. many months in the other body. While under the continuing resolution the moneys were spent at such a high level that at this late date in the fiscal year it would have been irresponsible to cut further particular military aid items. since nothing would have been left to carry on the program during the remaining few months of the year. Thus the blame for the high appropriation for military foreign aid must rest with the other body which delayed this appropriation so that now it is impossible to cut it.

I take strong exception to the figure of $72 million appropriated for the Peace Corps. since I believe the full amount authorized by the Senate. $77.2 million. should be appropriated. The Peace Corps is a positive force. an operation that has reached maturity and. if anything. it should have its appropriations increased and not decreased. It is unfortunate that the chairman of the House subcommittee was successful in his vendetta in having the Peace Corps appropriations decreased. In my judgment the limit on foreign military credit sales is also unfortunate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the motion by Mr. VAN DEERLIT. On December 8. 1971. during consideration of the Foreign Aid Appropriations Act. the House of Representatives adopted an amendment which prohibited any of the funds in the act from providing assistance to Ecuador. Many of us feel very strongly that nations. such as Ecuador. which hijack our vessels on the high seas. and then exact fines totaling over $2 million in 1971 alone. should not receive foreign aid. Why should the American taxpayer be asked to give $25 million in aid to Ecuador. as requested by the administration? I do not believe we should. If we approved granting foreign aid to those countries which voted against us in the United Nations. then Ecuador would rightly deserve U.S. foreign aid. If we approved granting foreign aid to those countries which violate International law by pirating our fishing vessels. then Ecuador would rightly deserve U.S. foreign aid. If we approved granting foreign aid to those countries which use U.S. vessels on loan from the Navy to seize our ships on the high seas. then. again. Ecuador would rightly deserve U.S. foreign aid. But. Mr. Speaker. I do not believe we should adopt a policy which grants aid to a country which commits the above acts. and thus. I vigorously supported the amendment barring aid to Ecuador on However. when the bill went to the Senate. this provision was deleted. In the HouseSenate conference. which convened to iron out the differences in the two bills. the language of the Housepassed amendment was altered in order to bar aid to Ecuador. unless the President determines that the furnishing of such assistance is important to the national interest of the United States. Mr. Speaker. the loophole allowing the State Department to continue granting foreign aid to Ecuador will remain open. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I support the motion by Mr. VAN DEERLIN which would reject the conference amendment. Instead. I believe that the conference committee should accept the Housepassed amendment which would close the loophole and bar aid to Ecuador.",

    "speech": "I yield myself 4 minutes out of those 5. I should like to read this paragraph from the decision. which is very thoughtprovoking and worthy of the attention of every Senator. and especially that of every lawyer in this body. The Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit said: We think .. . that the exercise by Congress of its control over court jurisdiction is subject to compliance with at least .the requirements of the Fifth Amendment. That Is. while Congress has the undoubted power to give. withhold and restrict the jurisdiction of courts other than the Supreme Court. it must not exercise that power so as to deprive any person of life. liberty or property without due process of law.... And the corollary to that proposition is found in the decision of Bolling against Sharpe. decided in 1954. as the companion case to Brown against Board of Education. In that case. the Supreme Court found that racial segregation in the schools is not only prohibited by the 14th amendment. the equal protection clause. but is prohibited as well by the fifth amendment. to wit. the one I have just referred to. that is. the right not to be deprived of life. liberty. or property without due process of law. As I have said. that raises very inherent constitutional questions about the first section of the proposal. the second section of the Griffin amendment absolutely strips the Civil Rights Act of 1964 of its application to most current school desegregation problems. the third section lowers the barrier of constitutional protection in any action on a decree for desegregation so long as any appeal or motion is pending. and encourages the whole panoply of frivolous appeals and delays for that purpose. into the picture. with our consent and approval. I think the Griffin amendment falls heavily of its own weight simply because it goes beyond what even reasonable people who do not like busing but still understand constitutional rights have to be safeguarded may logically advocate. if there is a scintilla of good faith in the proposition that they really do want families and their children to have the constitutional right of an equal break. which is what it comes down to. in respect of educational opportunity.

But. Mr. President. if the Federal court orders an educational agency to bus its students from one end of the county to another. from one school district to another. where is it going to get the money?

In my study of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. I have become aware that women are often subjected to discrimination in employment and remuneration in the field ol education. This is Intolerable. and I welcome adoption of the Bayh amendment which attempts to rectify this problem I also welcome the opportunity to support legislation which will assure women equal access to all levels of education. undergraduate. graduate. professional. and vocational. Direct legislation such as this -amendment seems to me to be the most effective way to deal with the problems of sex discrimination. Most of the discrimination against women which has brought about the equal rights movement can be eliminated by application of the 14th amendment. coupled with such specific legislation as this amendment to the higher education bill. I cannot foresee all of the consequences of adopting the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. and I am concerned that such a constitutional amendment may prohibit recognition of differences between men and women which elevate the status of women. This problem may be avoided by attacking discrimination with specific legislation aimed at specific problems. Discrimination against women should be ended. and I will certainly support appropriate legislation. I am pleased. therefore. that amendment No. 874 was adopted by the Senate yesterday.",

The other thingI think it is clearly established. regardless of what the testimony may have been when Father Menger and Reverend Roffe were translating for you is that the Pathet Lao had occupied those villages. Perhaps. at the moment they were not there. but we all know that every dry season the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese alternately occupy this region and that during every wet season the Meo tribesmen come back.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on June 3. I introduced H.R. 8903. a bill to prohibit the Government from indiscriminately selling or distributing mailing lists. Today. I am reintroducing this measure together with 64 of my colleagues. If enacted. this legislation would limit Federal agencies from distributing or selling any list of names of Federal employees. past or present members of the Armed Forces. or persons who are licensed or required to register with any Federal agency unless there is certification that such a list will not be used for commercial or other solicitation or for any unlawful purpose. The bill is the result of an independent study I conducted of mailing list sales by the Federal Government. The survey of 50 departments and agencies revealed that there is not established Government policy on the sale of mailing lists. Some agencies provide such lists routinely. others do not. Each cite the Freedom of Information Act as the basis for their decisions. The Freedom of Information Act was enacted in 1967 to provide the public with as complete access as possible to public records. Its purpose is to prevent Government agencies from unjustifiably withholding information that should be reasonably available for inspection by the news media and the public. Information can be withheld if it involves national security. proprietary business information. investigatory files or personnel or medical files. Other statutes protect the confidentiality of income tax and census data. However. the Act overlooks completely the mailing lists complied by Federal agencies in carrying out their proper roles. This gap in our Federal laws encourages the invasion of an individuals privacy and. in some cases. jeopardizes his safety. The legislation we have Introduced today will provide the missing policy while maintaining a positive balance between the publics right to know and the individuals right to privacy. Mr. Speaker. I am gratified that this legislation has received broadbased support from 35 Democrats and 29 Republicans and that the Government Operations Subcommittee on Foreign Ooerations and Government Information intends to hold hearings on the measure before the year is out.

I find it hard to comprehend the logic and basis for responsible action which lies behind the recent announcement by the State Department that the United States is extending $5 million in military credits to the Marxist regime of Chile.

I understand that our announced intention of extending the military credits is being made in response to a request for this assistance by the Chilean Government and that the funds will be used to purchse new C130 transport aircraft and paratroop equipment. Apparently. there are still those in the White House and the State Department who minimize the theories set down so long ago by Karl Marx that total Communist domination of the world is the ultimate goal. Perhaps they have minimized Fidel Castro and what his Communist Island stronghold of Cuba represent. And. perhaps they have completely forgotten the Cuban missile crisis of Chilean President Salvador Allende is. whether we want to believe it or not. nothing less than another welloiled cog in this Communist plan for world conquest. Nickolal Lenin once said that the United States would spend itself to death. Apparently. our State Department policymakers are not too concerned about the outcome of this grave prediction. We are not spending ourselves to death. but some of that money is going to assist Communist governments. While it is hard to justify excessive spending any time. this question pales into insignificance when it comes to the question of helping our enemy.

Just 54 banks in the whole country. as of June 30. 1970. were classified as having serious problemsthat is to say. problems that could lead to their closing. and could lead to the FDIC making any kind of payout to cover the deposits of bank customers. The Sharpstown State Bank was one of these. Very few banks get In trouble with the FDIC. very few stay in trouble. few ever get Into serious trouble. very few big banks ever get into trouble. and very. very few big banks collapse. Sharpstown State Bank was one of a tiny fraction of problem banks in the whole United States. one of the handful of banks its size that had any trouble at all. it was practically the only one of its size that had any serious problems. Sharpstown was a strange bank indeed. and it was the habitat of real sharpiessharpies in the sense that they knew how to commit fraud on a grand scale. The specialty of Sharpstown State Bank was loans to its own officers and directors. The bank went to extraordinary lengths to get money to lend to its officers and directors. through the use of brokered deposits. Of recent bank collapses a goodly number are attributable in some paxt to the use of brokered deposits. Sharpstown State Bank had $31.6 million in brokered deposits at the time it collapsedand it also had loans to Frank Sharp and his companies totaling perhaps $30 million. So frantic were these inside dealings that near the end of Sharpstown State Banks decline. Frank Sharp increased his loans from $22 million to $30 million within the span of 30odd days.

Last evenings Washington paper. the Evening Star. carried a classic example of the transfer of the war responsibility by developing an image of scorn and rebuke against the military while at the same time promoting CFR spokesmen as peacemakers. On page 1 of the paper appears a picture captioned: \"At the Paris Meeting.\" It portrays Henry Kissinger and Ambassador K. A. Bruce. both smiling to give the American people an image of confidence that something is being done in the name of peace. Immediately beneath the KissingerBruce photo are the pictures of two U.S. Army generals in a story captioned: \"Leader of Americal Division is Relieved of Command.\" The article infers that the reprimand was due to the loss of too many American men in a recent nowin battle.

I am proud that this year. through congressional approval of my resolution. the scope of the celebration has been widened to include special recognition for the countrys law enforcement personnel. For many years. Law Day has been a tradition observed in courtrooms and classrooms. The observance has been by. and for. judges and lawyers and law students. It has been a day reserved for the theorist of law. But law does not begin in the quiet of courtrooms and class buildings. It operates in patrol cars and on the beat and in precinct stations. By the Congress recent action. signed into law by the President on April 27. 1972. we have allocated a portion of Law Day to the practitioners of law. Sheriffs deputies. highway patrolmen. police men and womenthese people are a part of the legal profession. In fact. they are its very foundation. Our law enforcement personnel face formidable challenges today in protecting our rights and properties. Nineteen policemen were killed in ambush in 1970. Political activism fills the streets. and our law officers must be both safety personnel and diplomats. trying to maintain a balanced perspective about what is free speech and what is anarchy. While legislators and citizens talk about prison reform. prison guards encounter the daily hazards created by our neglect of the penal system. Will we forget the guards at Attica? We must not forget. and that is what this Law Day is all about. Today we give our law enforcement personnel their wellearned praise and appreciation. Congress in 1961 dedicated May 1 as Law Day. focusing on national rights and liberties under law. I hope that Congress. through appropriate legislative action. will continue what we have begun in 1972. I hope the Congress will see that each year a part of Law Day belongs to the law officer. I am reintroducing my resolution to attain this goal and I hope for earlier action next year. This years action by the President came too late to prepare a full observance. We can do better in 1973. and we owe our law enforcement personnel no less than our full attention.

As Mr. Noyes pointed out: That period started with a strong reassertion of legislative prerogatives by a Republicancontrolled Congress. It was. in effect. a reaction to the fantastic expansion of presidential power assumed by Woodrow Wilson in the course of the war. It ushered in an era of rockbound isolationism in American foreign policy that was to last until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

This movement is composed of Americans who have experiencedand causedmore change than any one group in the history of our Nation. These people are the 20 million Americans age 65 and older who have helped make this Nation what it is today. In every field. at every level of society. these men and women have accomplished the changes which turned this Nation from an adolescent in the world community to the most powerful. complex. and industrialized country on the globe. Today. our senior citizens have accepted a new challenge. They are engaged in a quiet revolution to change their image and role in American life. Retired Americans are refusing to yield their places in the mainstream of our society. They are revolting against the institutions and attitudes which deny them opportunities to use their energies and talents as full participants in our national life. Above all. they are proving by their own actions that ability. creativity. dedication. and wisdom cannot be measured in terms of years. Next month. Mr. President. is Senior Citizens Month. an appropriate time to consider what Congress and the Nation can do to help our older citizens and. more importantly. to recognize what older Americans are doing to help themselves. For in the final analysis. older Americans want to be firstclass citizens. partners in the progress of this Nation. They believe that they have earned the right to choose their own lifestyles. to retain the same options that other citizens enjoy. to reap the benefits of comfort and security which they have worked to provide for others throughout their lives. Our task. therefore. is to provide the elderly with more options. with greater opportunities to enrich their own lives. with the chance to rekindle the spirit of purpose. dignity. and independence which is woefully lacking in the lives of millions. of older Americans today. By doing so. we will be heeding the warning of our beloved and respected former colleague. the late Senator Winston Prouty of Vermont. who said: We are shortchanging both the United States and our older citizens when we refuse to give older Americans a chance to participate as fully as they can in our national life.",

His work as a Government forester spans four decades and began in the State of Washington. Between that assignment and the one as head of the U.S. Forest Service. Ed served for a time in Ogden. Utah. as assistant regional forester in charge of the Division of Range Management. He became the ninth Forest Service chief on March 18. 1962. Ed has directed the Forest Service through a decade of immense growth and redirection. It has also been a stormy period for all agencies dealing with conservation of the Nations natural resources. While many selfstyled ecologists have pushed their pet programs for salvaging the countrys environment. Ed has led his Agency quietly and efficiently in its own great efforts to wisely manage our resources and clean up the environment. During his tenure. Congress created a National Wilderness Preservation System. made up in part from National Forest lands. forest and land management research was expanded. and the multiple use concept of forestry developed. Under this concept. equal emphasis is placed on noncommodity values of the forest. such as recreation. water management. and wildlife. along with the commodity aspects. including timber. forage. and minerals.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like to acknowledge the strong leadership the distinguished Senator from Illinois has offered to the Senate in dealing with this question of the reorganization of the volunteer programs which have been carried on under the auspices of the Federal Government. He has done more than any other single person. in my judgment. to strengthen the positive role that reorganization can play in volunteer programs and to dispel some of the advance fears with regard to the program. Everyone of us has heard some of the expressions of concern. We are all aware of the fine record of the Peace Corps. for example. as well as VISTA and other volunteer programs. People have been worried that the programs would lose their special character. would lose the appeal they have not only to the young people of America but also to the spirit of America around the world. I have personally made some very searching inquiries. I feel perfectly assured that there is not any attempt to deprive these programs of this special character. I think because of the administrative reorganization some of the effort and energy that goes into administration now can be concentrated on the program and new energy and new initiative can be given to it. I was concerned whether volunteers who want to serve. for example. in the Peace Corps will find. as we sometimes unfortunately find in the armed services. that what they have signed up for is not what they get. I was concerned that the program not produce disillusionment. I think what we are really doing is streamlining the administration of the whole volunteer function so that we can get what the name of the new program implies--action. less overhead. less energy spent on the routine tasks involved in maintaining any kind of program on a large scale. worldwide. or nationwide program as this would be. and a concentration on the real motives and purposes of the program. I think the Senator from Illinois has demonstrated by his remarks here the very strenuous efforts he has made on and off the floor. that this has been the result and that it constitutes a better atmosphere for these programs. It is for that reason that I intend to support the plan when it comes to a vote in the Senate.",

No one could say that the Senator from Maryland is interested in the reorganization plan for partisan reasons. If he thought this program would set back the programs he believes in so deeply. he would oppose it. It is for this reason that. after he read through the hearings and evaluated the testimony of the witnesses. he came to the independent judgment that this program was good for America and would not in any way injure the programs. I would like to point out that. whereas I pay great tribute to the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts about the Peace Corps and VISTA. I believe deeply that the young people want to have influence in the countrys course and do want to help their fellow man. This generation has distinguished itself for its lack of materialism and lack of interest in going out. purchasing a home in the suburbs. buying two cars and letting it go at that. They have evidenced more concern here and abroad for their fellow men than any other generation in history. This generation has responded to the calls of this cause. Volunteers in Peace Corps will reach a high of 26.000 at the end of the recruiting period in August. That arrests the downward trend we have experienced in the past 4 years. Rather than getting fewer volunteers. we are getting more. and the programs are more meaningful in content. We note that many of them have professional training. They are getting more sophisticated in their requirements. so that not only is the number increasing. but the quality of our applicants is also going up.

The Peace Corps has already changed very substantially from its original purpose. It was started in a period before we became embroiled in the Vietnam war. and before the young people of this country were disillusioned with the foreign policies of this country. They used to have 10 applicants for every place they could serve. Today. they are mounting a very expensive recruitment programI take it is expensive. I hear it repeatedly on the radioto solicit volunteers. But they are no longer doing anything the AID program cannot do. They are not looking for inspired men and women to go out and serve the country. they are looking for mature. developed craftsmen. carpenters. agriculturists. and what have you. to perform specific acts. which is exactly the same type of thing done by the AID program. The real question about the Peace Corps is whether or not. in view of its changed character. there is any excuse for continuing it at all. Under this legislation. it looks to me if we merge all of these agencies we will have one big bureaucracy. they will all lose their identities and we will have a new bureaucracy that will develop a momentum of its own. Those two activities having to do with the Small Business Administration. for example. have quite a different objective from people who are interested in VISTA. The VISTA program still has. I think. a considerable amount of enthusiastic support on the part of young people. who can see around them the opportunity to do something for their fellow menquite different from the foreign situation. Besides. our foreign policy has so disillusioned the young people that they do not apply to the Peace Corps. Moreover. these countries are disinviting us. As I mentioned. just within recent weeks two have asked us to leave. the first ones in Latin America. Why did they do this? It is because they also are disillusioned with our foreign policy.

I notice that according to published reports over the weekend. the American Civil Liberties Union. the nonprofit conscience of America which has been seeking in recent years to remold Americas basic institutions and laws through court proceedings. has now extended its area of operation into that of selecting Supreme Court Justices. I would request that the Internal Revenue Service look into the question of their taxexempt status now that they are actively engaged in lobbying. Aside from the ACLUs excursion into areas previously considered beyond their scope. an interesting question was posed to me yesterday. The question was asked: \"Upon assuming his seat on the Supreme Court. would Mr. Rehnquist not now be expected to disqualify himself from any cases in which the American Civil Liberties Union was involved?\" In my own opinion. it would be a serious error in judgment on the part of Mr. Rehnquist or any judge to disqualify himself from hearing a case simply because a participant in the lawsuit had voiced disapproval of the judge. If such a precedent were established. a litigant or a lawyer could make it impossible for a case to be tried by simply saying scandalous things about every judge who tried the case. The fact that the American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to slander a mans name and reputation is evidence of bad judgment on the part of the ACLU. The judge being slandered is expected to be above the pettiness of petty people and exercise judicial temperament far removed from the squabbling which might be associated with his original appointment. For myself. if I ever felt any reservations about Mr. Rehnquists qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court. those reservations were dissipated upon the announcement from the ACLU.

It was entitled. \"Crisis at Sea: The Threat of No More Fish.\" It pointed up the desperate need for enforceable international conservation measures if the worlds fisheries resources are to be saved. Today. I would like to call the attention of the House to an article on the same subject by New York Times columnist C. L. Sulzberger. It appeared in that newspaper last Sunday. December 5. as well as in other newspapers subscribing to the New York Times service. Writing from Oslo. Norway. Mr. Sulzberger warns of what he properly describes as: The rapidly approaching death of that king of all game fish. the Atlantic salmon. He notes that: The salmon is not being murdered solely by pollution. but that the worst offender is the greedy commercial fisherman aided by modern electronic devices. He calls attention to the fact that: Two organizations exist which could in theory end this tragic situationthe International Commission for Northwest Atlantic Fisheries and the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission. But. as Mr. Sulzberger adds: No country opposing any proposal favored by either commission is obliged to observe itand the Danes dont. He goes on to suggest. however. that: Denmarks application for membership in the European Common Market can be shelved until Copenhagen agrees to cease deepsea salmon netting. I must certainly agree with the Sulzberger thesis that. with the world rapidly running out of such fish as the Atlantic salmon. economic sanctions against those responsible for it could be an effective means of combating the trend. Even if such sanctions were imposed against offending nations. however. it would not resolve the total problem of finding a positive. enforceable and lasting means of preserving the rich resources of the worlds oceans. That total problem can. and must. be solved at the Law of the Sea Conference to be held in Geneva in 1973. As I said yesterday. this vital conference is our last chance to end that threat of no more fishand we must make the most of it. Here is Mr. C. L. Sulzbergers article in its entirety.

This year and last. the Senate has adopted sweeping legislation designed to reduce the pollution of our air and water to the extent feasible. In the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1971. in fact we have set as our goalor more accurately. as our idealthe elimination of the discharge of all pollutants into our navigable waters by 1985. except in instances where the \"social and economic benefits\" to be derived from the imposition of this standard will not justify the \"social and economic costs\" which would have to be incurred in order to eliminate such discharges. This legislation. however. has had to beg a rather substantial question. namely. just how do we go about measuring \"social\"which in the context includes environmental--costs and benefits with sufficient precision to make the necessary judgments? To the extent that we do not have at our disposal widely accepted techniques for making such measurements. to that extent must we rely on what in the last analysis will be the subjective judgments of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. One of the difficulties which we face at the present time is that our normal systems of accounting cannot accommodate commodities whose cost and values are not known. While we now generally accept the more enlightened concept that air and water cannot any longer be considered \"free.\" we have not yet achieved any clear idea as to how we can place a cost figure on a given volume of air or water which is returned to the atmosphere or to a stream with impurities added. A system of \"accounting\" for the environment is rendered especially difficult to achieve because so many of the problems deal with effects separated by time and place from the specific action which is taken.",

Until we have at our disposal the tools for making reasonably objective choices between environmental alternatives. we will inevitably find ourselves in the unhappy. and potentially dangerous. position of having to place extraordinary reliance on the judgment of a handful of individuals who will have the power of economic life and death over any number of businesses and communities. Mr. President. we cannot begin too soon to launch an intensive effort to develop these techniques. I believe that the National Environmental Centers contemplated by the legislation before us will provide us with an ideal vehicle for the achievement of this essential goal. i I want to say that we need this tool if we are to provide ourselves with an efficient. effective. and generally acceptable technique for making decisions with respect to the environment.

At present. the Internal Revenue Service recognizes blood donations as a \"service\" which is not deductible. rather than \"property\" which is. While someone can take a tax deduction for a $25 monetary contribution to the American Red Cross he cannot take a deduction for the pint of blood he gives them. I view this as inconsistent with the purpose of the charitable provision in our tax code which encourages contributions to nonprofit organizations serving the public interest. Another need for this legislation is to prevent the proliferation of commercial blood banks which attract persons who do not meet the minimal health standards but which are flourishing because of a shortage of whole blood and voluntary donors. This bill would. therefore. not only increase the quantity and improve the quality of available blood. but also give a tax deduction to publicminded citizens who donate blood and thereby contribute to the public welfare.

Under a 1962 amendment. business associations may carry on lobbying activities and remain tax exempt. But charitable and public interest groups become subject to taxation for \"carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.\" This bill would tend to equalize the taxation factor by giving publicinterest groups the same lobbying privileges as business associations. It would permit certain charitable and educational organizations which qualify as tax exempt under section 501(c) (3) to communicate directly with the Congress and with State legislatures to effect legislation of direct interest to the organization. The bill would not. however. allow tax exemptions for lobbying the public or for participation in political campaigns.

The hearings considered various aspects of advertising and its relationship to small business. and one topic of particular interest was the liaison arrangements established between the various Federal regulatory agencies. It appears that while in some instances Federal regulatory agencies have excellent liaison agreements. other agencies apparently have none at all. or if they exist. are not effective. Two agencies that appear to have developed a close working liaison arrangement are the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. R. Joel Slomoff. Special Assistant to the Associate Commissioner for Compliance of the Food and Drug Administration. and Mr. Robert E. Freer. Jr.. Assistant to the General Counsel and Liaison Officer of the Federal Trade Commission. have recently written an excellent article appearing in the April 1971 edition of FDA Papers. describing the close working relationship between those two agencies. For the information of the Members. it is requested that this article appear in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for a decade this Nation has sent her young men to die in a senseless and tragic war in Southeast Asia. The price for this tragic venture has been incalculably highin terms of lives lost and blood shed. in terms of treasure squandered and opportunities lost. in terms of the erosion of our position in the world community and the disaffection of our people at home. Yet the war drags on. Despite the peace promises of the Nixon administration. the killing continues. The administrations policy is a vehicle to substitute Asian blood for American. The death is not going to stop. The destruction is not going to halt. The misery of the Vietnamese. and Laotians and Cambodians will persist. The vaunted policy of Vietnamization means the outfitting of client armies sustained by American air and logistical support. The presentation of the sevenpoint proposal at the Paris negotiations offers the possibility of negotiating an end to this seemingly unending conflict. W. Averell Harriman has long been one of this Nations most astute and concerned analysts of American involvement in Vietnam. And as the chief negotiator on Vietnam under the Johnson administration he has a unique understanding of the possibilities of ending this war through diplomatic means. Governor Harriman has written a thoughtful article. which appeared in the July 15 New York Times. analyzing the situation in regard to the present opportunities for negotiations at Paris. As Governor Harriman says. the President should explain what he meant in his April 7 address on Vietnam when he said that his plan would provide the South Vietnamese \"a reasonable chance to survive as a free people.\" Is the President insisting upon the survival of the ThieuKy regime or is he finally prepared to instruct our negotiators in Paris to seek a political settlement?

I send to the desk for appropriate reference a bill to amend the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950. and ask -that it may be appropriately referred. This is a bill which was transmitted to the two Houses of the Congress. in draft form by the Attorney General of the United States. The purpose of -the bill is to facilitate the performance by the Subversive Activities Control Board of new responsibilities which it must deal with under the Presidents amendment of Executive Order 10450. on July 7 of this year. As I am sure Senators know. the amended Executive order will permit the Board to deal with and make appropriate determinations with regard to violent. actionoriented organizations. whether or not such organizations are Communists in nature. In performing these new functions. the Board will need to exercise. in proper case the power of subpena. and to hold hearings and to take testimony and keep a stenographic record of its proceedings. These functions are now authorized by statute with respect to the responsibilities imposed upon the Board by the Subversive Activities Control Act. and the bill I have just sent forward will provide authority for the exercise of these necessary functions in connection with the Boards new responsibilities. The bill will also provide for changing the name of the Board to the \"Federal Internal Security Board\". I feel this is a desirable step. for the fact is the Board has never been greatly concerned with controls. but rather with the quasijudicial adjudication of questions with respect -to the nature of subversive organizations. Mr. President.

One can understand this. for the media apparently feels that its prerogatives are being challenged. Under the circumstances. a defensive reaction is not surprising. On the other hand. many concerned citizens view the controversy from a broader perspective. It seems to me that their viewpoints and opinions have received less public attention than they deserve. From the perspective of an objective television viewer. the production entitled \"The Selling of the Pentagon\" was but a single episode in a serial of socalled documentaries. Many of these presentations are characterized by the questionable virtue of an \"evil eye.\" Time after time. in dreary sequence. vast. and complex social problems of our Nation are isolated. magnified. doctored. and orchestrated with verbal harping. nitpicking. and other criticisms which demean our Nation. In the aggregate. they reflect attitudes on the part of producers which are disturbing. Mr. President. Mr. Samuel Brown. a distinguished business and civic leader of Mobile. Ala.. has written a persuasive letter to Dr. Frank Stanton. president of CBS. in which he challenges Dr. Stanton with constructive questions and a constructive suggestion which I commend to the attention of Members of the Senate and to the public.

Mr. Chairman. it is with a great deal of reluctance that I oppose the amendment offered by my good friend from North Carolina. because I know of his longtime interest in getting at the very roots of the problem we are considering here today. I do join him in the objectives of his amendment. I wish the amendment was prepared as an addition to the bill rather than in the form which strikes section 3014 of the bill. The section now in the bill entitled \"Unsolicited mailing of potentially offensive sexual material\" was recommended by the Presidents Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. While it does require the mail patron or householder to put his name and those of the minors in his household on a local list. the problem has been created by the interpretation of the court as to what rights mailers have and what protection they have under the Constitution. Many of us are dissatisfied with the decisions of the courts in this area. But. having studied those decisions. I have concluded Congress cannot make this matter nonmailable. inasmuch as the courts have held that the sender has a right to mail it. and the recipients. if they want it. have a right to receive it. Mr. Chairman. I wish we could put this language in a separate section of the bill and again let the Court decide its Constitutionality. I am sure the gentleman does not intend that the section which we have in the bill and which has been recommended by the Presidents Commission. and which I think is better than the present pandering law fall with his amendment. In other words. the effect of the gentlemans amendment would be to knock that language out of the bill and substitute the language which many of us feel the Court would hold unconstitutional. We would like to put as many tools into the law as we can. hoping that the Court would uphold the legislative action where it does not violate the Constitution and thereby give some protection to the mail patron. We believe that this section will be held within the framework of the Constitution. I am afraid that the gentlemans amendment would be held unconstitutional because it makes this material nonmailable.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am offering this amendment to avoid constitutional attack on this statute. which may result if the word \"conclusively\" remains in this section. The use of the word \"conclusively\" presents a situation in which the statute might be attacked constitutionally on the ground that it does not permit the handling of such materials in situations where their use might offer redeeming social value. as was the case in U.S. v. 31 Photographs (156 Fed. Supp. 350). sited in U.S. v. Ginzburg (16 L. Ed. 2d 31 at 40). In that case. material which was obviously hard core obscenity was held not to be obscene when handled by specific audiences. In this case. it was a group of sociologists who were using the material for legitimate purposes. The trial judge in the 31 Photographs case acquitted members of the group when the use was shown to have social value. The present language of H.R. 8805. in this particular section creates an irrebuttable presumption that material is deemed to be obscene and does not allow for a situation where the materials may be used for other purposes. for instance. law enforcement purposes. The problem with this language is that it may well allow a legitimate constitutional attack and. therefore. endanger the validity of the statute before the courts. My amendment would allow for an affirmative defense to be presented by the defendant in an action under this section. I want to point out that the prosecutors burden would in no way be increased by this amendment. but. on the contrary. would make it incumbent upon the defendant to come forth with an affirmative defense to an action under this bill. The fact that the 31 Photographs case was cited in a footnote by the U.S. Supreme Court indicates that the Court approves of a situation where obscene materials may. under certain limited circumstances. be used by legitimate groups. such as law enforcement. social. and so forth. Again. I believe my amendment would in no way endanger the effectiveness of this legislation. but in fact. provide for a legitimate affirmative defense in the event such materials art used by legitimate groups.",

Mr. Chairman. the inclusion of the word \"conclusively\" as recommended by the committee removes any question of a presumption as to the matter being utterly without redeeming social importance and precludes any rebuttable argument being made on this point. One of the recommendations included in the statement of Morton A. Hill and Winfrey C. Link and concurred in by Charles H. Keating. Jr.. included in the report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography on page 418. is that as a matter of public policy. anything which is obscene by definition shall be conclusively deemed to be utterly without redeeming social importance. Our committee attempted to carry out this recommendation by including the provisions. as the committee did. in subsection (c) of section 3013. That is why we took this course. As to the second paragraph of this amendment. and I read. beginning at (d) : This section shall not apply to persons who may possess or distribute obscene matter or participate in conduct otherwise proscribed * * * etc. I point out that what this amendment seeks to do is to have this committee write into the bill the people who are excludedand not the people and situations which are included in the law at this time. Mr. Chairman. if we allowed ourselves to be drawn into this sort of exercise. we would have to change all of the criminal statutes of this country in order to include those who do not come under the provisions of the law.

I oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio although I do so rather reluctantly because I think he has pointed to an area that has demanded some concern on the part of each of us and that is the legitimate uses of some materials which in the hands of some would be determined to be obscene or pornographic but in others are legitimate efforts of people engaged in scientific research or in educational pursuits. I do think. however. that the amendment has a couple of defects which lead me at least to oppose the adoption of this amendment. One is the fact that the bill we have presented to the Congress 48059 0 - 72 - pt. 18 - 40 from our committee deals with the mailability and this amendment is much broader than that and deals with possession and conduct as well as distribution and. therefore. I think is far beyond the purview of the statute we are discussing here today. The second one is that I think in this very difficult and very troublesome area for definitions to hinge on commas and where interpretations are fought over by various members of the courts who are compelled to rule upon the interpretation. we must be extremely careful in the wording of a statute that we adopt. I would say to the gentleman who has offered this amendment that I understand his purpose and I agree with him that we want to avoid unnecessary attacks upon the constitutionality of proposed legislation. I will pledge to him my continued effbrt to get before our committee consideration of the affirmative defense which he has here sought to have imposed in one section of the bill. I think it is worthy of noting in that connection tliat we have felt it was necessary and didiidlfide iiianther section of the billthat affirmative defense with respect to the mailability of obscene materials to minors. Similarly there may be an area of an affirmative defense that ought to be available under this section of the legislation as well. However. I do believe it ought to be subject to hearings. It ought to be subject to rather protracted and detailed consideration and not adopted in this manner on the floor of the House. I yield back the balance of my time.",

My Chinatown.\" \"Star Dust.\" \"Sleepy Time Down South.\" \"Just a Gigolo.\" and many others. With the ebullient power of his trumpet rising above the sometimes uninspired accompaniment and with his raspy. but warm and rhythmic voice and above all with the power of his enthusiasm and his phe-. nomenal energy. he made an impression that was instantaneous and lasting. Although unschooled and brought up in poverty. he retained throughout his life his pleasant disposition and his willingness always to look upon the constructive and progressive side of life. He kept to the end his innate simplicity. and in the midst of tawdriness. degradation. and artificiality. he found human goodness. sacrifice. and charity. Louis Armstrong rose from the role of playing the trumpet in the red light district of New Orleans to that of unofficial ambassador of good will throughout the world on behalf of the United States. In Europe. in Africa. and behind the Iron Curtain. he did more for the image of our country than a thousand official members of the Foreign Service. Although music was Armstrongs forte. from time to time he wrote an article for a prominent periodical and in his warm. artless. unmannered but expressive style. he duplicated the genius of his music and left a memorable record of his early days. his family life. his friends and his musical career that the finest literary craftsman could not have improved.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been my practice to keep. the people in my district informed. This is particularly important to our older Americans who lived on tight budgets and who need information at once concerning their rights under the Federal laws that we are passing. Recently I directed a letter to them. together with information of value to assure that they fully participate in the Federal programs that Congress has made. The letter follows: DEAR FRIEND: As you are one of the Older Americans who lives in what I like to call the \"Fabulous Fifth\" congressional district. I wish to keep you informed of programs that may be helpful to you. The Congress has taken actions recently which have been helpful to the senior citizens. such as the 20 percent rise in Social Security. but there are many other programs that can help and aid senior citizens. Unfortunately. too often we find out older Americans are not aware of them. I am enclosing a booklet describing some food and housing programs for th.. elderly which may be helpful to you. If you have any further questions about them I would be glad to hear from you. Last spring you were invited to an Older Americans Forum I arranged. at which approximately 400 older Americans from all over the Fifth district attended. Much information was made available to the people who came and I have prepared special folders containing many booklets of general information of use to older Americans. Some people have suggested I make these booklets available to other older Americans who could not attend the meeting. I will do this upon your request. The folders are free. but I do have a limited supply. If you would like one of these folders. with the enclosed information. just drop a line to me at my local office. 150 Old Country Road. Mineola. New York 11501 and say you would like the Senior Citizens Special Packet. If you have any other questions or needs. please let me know. I am always glad to be able to be of help to you. With every good wish. Sincerely yours.",

With the days already growing short. I find it anachronistic that we should be deprived of afternoon daylight right at the time we need it most. According to the Washington Post this morning. sunrise here in the District of Columbia today was a 7:14 a.m. Sunset tonight will be at 6:35 p.m. In 21/2 weeks. on the first day of standard time. the sun will rise at 6:32 a.m. and set at 5:12 p.m. That. I submit. will be good news for the Nations farmers. early morning joggers and early evening muggers. But for the majority of Americans. it will be bad news. To me and 15 of our colleagues. it seenis more logical and responsive to the needs of our present society that we do not set the clocks back. The result would be yearround daylight saving time. adding an extra hour of daylight to the end of the day rather than the beginning of the day. To that end we have introduced H.R. 5464 and H.R. 15579 to establish daylight saving time on a yearround basis. We propose that this become the \"new\" standard time or. as it has been nicknamed enlightened time. And while we certainly do not expect a legislative stampede to enact this bill before adjournment. we do expect to reintroduce this measure in the next session. We fully intend to waterdrop this issue until people realize that the time zones and schedules are not established in Heaven but should be responsive to the public need.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the town hall meetings have substantially vanished in our changing times. The farmers of this country are the last group of citizens to forsake the heritage of our forefathers. The limitation of tenure imposed upon the farmer elected committeemen of the .local Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service is an unwarranted invasion of the free choice of the governed. I have proposed an amendment to existing law to permit the farmer elected committeemen of ASCS to succeed to subsequent terms of office at the will of their peersthe electors. My proposal was amended in committee to provide for a maximum of four consecutive terms of 3 years each for a total of 12 years. The existing law provides for three successive terms and a limitation of 9 years of successive service. The administration objects to any change in the existing law. The Agriculture Act of 1970 will expire in 1973. A new national policy for agriculture will be determined in the next session of Congress. The farmers should have the lawful right to elect committeemen of their choice. In many instances men of experience will be denied the right to seek reelection in December of 1972. unless the existing law is amendedunless tenure is extended and the will of the people preserved. I do not agree that the free choice and the will of the people should be infringed upon without cause. However. the legislation that I have proposed to provide for the elimination of limited tenure has been amended to limit tenure of committeemen to a total of four successive 3year terms. The Agriculture Act of 1970 is subject to change next year and this matter can then be considered again. I submit that H.R. 16182. as amended. be enacted. It is right that the governed shall govern. It is right that men of experience be permitted to continue. if elected. as committeemen through any change of existing agriculture programs. There is nothing more democratic than the procedures of the governed in the administration of their own affairs. That is democracy in action. That is a goal worthy of the best effort of every citizen of this country. I urge that H.R. 16182 be approved accordingly.",

While I have no views on the various national polling institutions. I have been greatly impressed with the highly accurate results gained over many years from a single bellweather precinct poll in my own community of Evansville. Ind. Conducted by Bob Flynn. political writer for the Evansville Press. the poll of this precinct has produced not only an amazingly accurate forecast of Vanderburgh County. Ind. elections but. as Vanderburgh County itself has been a national weathervane county. has forecast national trends with great precision. Once again Mr. Flynn has conducted his poll of precinct. 21. ward 4 and I would like to share the results with my colleagues. His analytical article from the Monday. October 9 Evansville Press follows: (By Robert Flynn) Voters in Vanderburgh Countys weathervane precinct forecast such an overwhelming victory here for President Richard Nixon that a Republican sweep appears certain on Nov. 7. A poll of the area last week showed the only candidate with a chance to outscore Nixon is another Republican. 8th District Rep. Roger Zion. House Speaker Otis Bowen. the Republican nominee for governor. though running third. had a lead in the poll over his better known Democratic opponent. former Gov. Matthew Welsh. Eighteen were undecided. Most of the candidates for local offices. regardless of party. werent well known among the 86 residents polled. The answers. however. produced a disturbing statistic for the Democrats since 31 said theyd vote straight Republican. and only 9 Democrats promised the same for their party. The other 46 said they were \"undecided\" about the local ticket. The poll was in Ward 4. Precinct 21. the politicallysensitive area between Parkland Avenue and Pigeon Creek. an area bounded on the west by Heidelbach and on the east by Kentucky Avenue. Its the same area which came within half a percentage point a year ago in predicting Republican Mayor Russell Lloyds upset victory a month in advance. Its importance is heightened this year because Vanderburgh County has an 82year history as a national weatherervane. Last week it showed that: Only 7 of the 86 interviewed were \"undecided\" about the presidential race--while 73 favored Nixon and only 6 said theyd vote",

The theater was renamed and refurbished for the event which marked the beginning of an unprecedented and. to date. unmatched success story within the Los Angeles theater milieu. The fact that \"Hair\" has been seen by over 30 million people all over the worli in over 30 countries and 15 languages. and the fact that after 5 years it is still in great demand and going strong in cities all over the United States and more than five major capitals in the world. testifies to the universal opinion that \"Hair\" is one of the alltime greatest theatrical phenomena. Its success was perhaps most striking in the case of Los Angeles. where the show skyrocketed the entire Los Angeles theatrical box office figures for 2 years. and indeed. created nationwide notice and respect for the viability of Los Angeles as a highly favorable and desirable theater market. The figures are astonishing. Variety states that during the shows first 39 weeks the gross was $2.098.45839 weeks in which the Los Angeles box office soared nearly 17 percent from the previous year. This highly unusual gain was directly and singularly attributed to \"Hair.\" whose gross during that time constituted the greatest take in Los Angeles history. Hairs\" next full year record racked up a blistering $2.712.093. pushing the local market up another 6 percent. As the longest running engagement of any major production in Los Angeles theatrical history. \"Hair\" continued to shatter the reputation that Los Angeles was a notheater town. When \"Hair\" closed. its final $484.920 in 12 weeks pushed the total volume to nearly $51/2 milllon-$51/2 millionfor the most part spent employing Los Angeles actors. musicians. stagehands.",

We are all aware of the important role Christopher Columbus played as the discoverer of our land. and there is no need to recount once again his bravery and foresight when he made his historic voyage nearly 500 years ago. Yet it has recently come to my attention that despite our recognition of Columbus brave deeds by our designation of a national holiday in his honor. we nevertheless have never properly honored his importance within the. halls of our own Capitol Building. Unbelievable as it seems. nowhere in the Capitol is there a statue of Christopher Columbus. So many of our national heroes and other men and women who played an important part in the development of our country are represented throughout the Capitol Building. and I see no reason why the same honor should not be extended to the individual who set out. against great odds. to explore the unknown. and who finally reached this land.

In the past year the Education and Labor Committee has done some excellent preliminary investigation into the problems of our school systems across the Nation and possible solutions which might be included in revisions next year of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Although many problems have been raised. three seem most susceptible to -the solution of immediate concentrated resources. First. there is a socalled teacher surplus. Estimates from across the country count as many as 250.000 persons who have been trained to be educators but are not employed in the profession. Second. there is a definite teacher shortage in schools with high concentrations of children from lowincome families.

If present trends are not reversed the cost of electric power to private and industrial consumers will spiral to an extent that is unprecedented. This threat is real and it is now. Coal is a major source of electric power and the coal industry has problems of its own. Surface mining is under attack. and safety in deep mines is a burning issue. These problems need to be addressed logically and effectively. Irresponsible actions and inflammatory statements do not contribute. and in fact detract from. the exercise of the considered judgment that must be applied. Congress has come to grips with the problem of mine safety by passing the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. which I supported wholeheartedly. No one would suggest that this legislation is perfect but it at least has provided the basis for the protection of mine workers. How well it works is dependent upon the execution by the Bureau of Mines of its inherent responsibilities to supervise the operations of our coal mines. I am deeply concerned. therefore. when it comes to my attention that the U.S. Bureau of Mines has recently issued a press release on the subject of mine safety that I consider to be irresponsible.

Thus. the Czechoslovak National Council of America. speaking on behalf of Americans of Czech and Slovak descent. submits the following for your consideration: We believe that the position taken by the American delegation. and indeed all western delegations at the onset of the Conference should be to insist on the (1) Withdrawal of all Soviet military and police units and Soviet advisers from all occupied nations west of the Soviet Union proper. (2) Neutralization of the same area and the establishment of a nuclear free zone. both under international guarantees. (3) Free elections under international control. The establishment of such a cordon sanitaire would tend to Eliminate the danger of inadvertent confrontation between the armed forces of the two atomic superpowers. Mitigate the fears of Western Europe concerning further military penetration of the Soviet Union into Western Europe. Curtail alleged suspicion on the part of the Soviet Uhion of Western aggressive intentions and German revanchism. Increase the chances for an agreed balanced reduction of the armed forces of the East and West. Make possible the organization of a viable economic community comparable to EEC (Common Market). Meet the requirement of selfdetermination. political independence and territorial integrity of the supposedly sovereign nations living between the Soviet Union and nonCommunist Western Europe. stipulated by the United Nations Charter. Satisfy the wish of the people concerned who have manifested on many occasions their desire for neutrality. such as enjoyed by Austria since 1955.

The eagerness now manifested by the Soviet Union to conclude a European security pact leads one to believe that the pressure of circumstances. the unreliability of the satellite armies. the discontent of the satellite people. as well as the good will of the United States might produce an unprecedented degree of willingness on the part of the Soviet Union to agree to thesse demands.

Perhaps the Soviets are convinced we will not let human rights stand in the way of making a few dollars in wheat and other trade deals. The Congress of the United States must make it unmistakably clear that we value human rightsincluding the right of emigrationmore than the dollars we stand to make as a result of these new trade deals. We have successfully existed without trading with the Soviet Union for decades. We can certainly wait a little longer and insist upon some standards of human decency on the part of those with whom we intend to trade in the future. I. for one. can never condone a governmental policy of extortion for human freedom. and the time has arrived to draw the line on this moral question. A nation which demands extortion for human beings must not be rewarded with increased trade. increased credit. or any of the other amenities involved in international trade and investment financing. It is my feeling that so long as the Soviets insist on these new and exorbitant exit fees. the United States must withhold favored nation status as far as trading is concerned. It is our moral responsibility to use all the power that we possess to influence the Soviet Government to stop its reprehensible policy of harassment and persecution against the Soviet Jews who wish to leave the U.S.S.R. Consequently. a few days ago I joined many of my colleagues in introducing a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress urging suspension of trade with the Soviet Union until such time as that country does away with its arbitrary and discriminatory methods of limiting the right of emigration.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a newspaper which has always taken a liberal viewpoint and is nationally known finds it difficult to understand that this country in 1972 is basically conservative or moderate. There is no doubt the New York Times has had a great influence in the tristate area of New York. Connecticut and New Jersey. It may not be the most widely distributed newspaper but it is influential with many people. New York is probably one of the most liberal States in the Union. However. the Daniel Yankelovich. Inc.. polling service employed by the New York Times finds that twothirds of New York Staters are conservative or moderate and only 24 percent consider themselves liberal. The Times itself believes that this represents a continuing swing to the right which was evident in a 1970 Yankelovich survey of the gubernatorial and senatorial election. This swing is having a definite effect on the 1972 presidential election. Four out of five of those surveyed considered President Nixon conservative or moderate and thus in tune with their thinking. In contrast. three out of five considered Senator MCGOVERN either liberal35 percentor radical25 percent. This poll indicates a swing and in some ways will have an effect on the 1972 election. For those of us who have been watching the polls over the past several years. this swing has been evident in many ways. It was certainly evident in 1970 when Senator BUCKLEY. while running on the conservative linedefeated both the Democratic and Republican candidates. It is interesting to learn that the principal issues in the country are crime. law and order. drugs. taxes. and unemployment. and these issues are far ahead of such traditional liberal issues as equality and poverty. The issues predominantly in the minds of people are those that directly affect them or their dear ones In everyday life. The electorate has never before voted on issues on which they will have a direct effect. I know my colleagues will be interested in this poll which indicates a trend which many of us have known has been going on for the past 4 to 6 years.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on January 19 the President issued a statement in which he said: I am today ordering a halt to further construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal. This canal is somewhere between a third and a half complete. Fifty million dollars has been spent on it. It was being built because it is authorized by law and appropriated for by law. The reasons ascribed by the President in the statement were that the Council on Environmental Quality recommended the halt and had pointed out to him \"that the project could endanger the unique wildlife of the area and destroy this region of unusual and unique natural beauty.\" referring to the beautiful Oklawaha River Valley. Since ending the canal would allow the land to go back to private ownership. and since this narrow strip of land could hardly protect much wildlife anyway when one considers that only a short distance away are 439.000 acres of national forest where the wildlife could really be protected. it is apparent that the President was misled as to the wildlife protection which could result from closing the canal. Since the alternate route suggested by the Corps of Engineers would bypass the Oklawaha. this other point raised by the Council and relied upon by the President is also not a valid reason for abandoning the canal. But this matter of the reasons for the action of the President is not what I would like to discuss at length today. I already discussed those reasons more at length on February 8. as has appeared in No. what I would like to discuss today is the fact that if the President means to terminate the canal permanently. not just halt to restudy. then this action is unconstitutional. There is in fact no authority I know of to the contrary. The Constitution does not say that the President shall execute the laws. but that \"he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" (Art. 2. sec. 3.)",

Lest one attribute Mr. Kiesingers criticism of the new German policy to political motivations. it must be remembered that former highranking officials of the U.S. Government such as Gen. Lucius Clay.

Apparently this is not so with the newcomers. The Russian Jews presently escaping the Bolshevik terror have seen enough of socialism at work in Russia and by personal experience have learned that the better things in life are more likely to found in the capitalistic West than in the socialistic East. Noteworthy. this confrontation between the socialists and nonsocialists is showing up in Israel where the latest arrivals from Russia refuse to be convinced that the kibbutz is any different from the kolhoz and that neither are any good. If the reports reaching us from Israel are authentic. we may well see a change in attitude and direction of the Israeli Government from socialism back to free enterprise capitalism. which in turn would manifest itself in the American society overnight. If this is true. and becomes a reality. the West will certainly welcome the new anticommunist converts and the free world may yet be saved from world slavery under socialism and communism.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the sudden intensity of attacks on my tuition voucher proposal strongly indicate a concerted effort by educational bureaucrats to undermine the groundswell of support for this legislation. In the past few weeks a number of articles and editorials strongly opposing this approach to educational excellence have appeared in some of the Nations most influential newspapers. Often conflicting arguments are advanced. One article made a blatant and inflammatory appeal to prejudice by claiming that tuition grants-\"Would open a large number of white public elementary schools to black applicants.\" The next day another article quoted Governor Rockefeller as being opposed to tuition grants because they would end-\"The whole movement to integrate the public schools of our country.\" The fact is. the very essence of the tuition voucher concept is to provide equal educational opportunities for all childrenregardless of race. religion. color. or geographical location. Contrary to statements by bureaucratic fright peddlers. the evidence shows that supporters of the tuition voucher proposal are perhaps more dedicated to educational equality for all children than are the opponents of this legislation. Not to be outdone in its opposition to the tuition grant plan is the Office of Economic Opportunity. However. their efforts are more subtle. The OEO pilot project is scheduled to run for 5 years. While it offers hope to the hardpressed. tuitionpaying taxpayers with children in nonpublic schools. the experiment is apparently designed to bury the voucher plan under a mass of unfounded assumptions. which allegedly prove this approach to educational equality is not only unworkable. but unAmerican. It is also interesting to note that this 5year project will terminate at a time when the present administration is certain to have concluded its term of office.

The mans character was his greatest attribute as well as being a phenomenal asset to his country. George Washington succeeded in turning back the British largely because he was able to keep the military coalition of the States from breaking off into fragments. He had the stature and the singleness of purpose that gave the States confidence. the rallying power. and the tenacity needed for victory. He was a man of goodwill and absolute integrity. in whom all Americans could believe. After the war was won. it was Washington to whom the leaders of the several States turned. Washington was a great guiding force at the Constitutional Convention. He stood above the bitter debates that racked that prestigious group of men. His dedication to the concept of a strong. unified America helped bring together the many factions. Although he used his authority sparingly as presiding officer of the Constitutional Convention.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 18 months ago the President described in ringing phrases the immediate need for a national policy on population growth. He described how the population was growing faster than we could comfortably accommodate it and set a number of ambitious goals for the Federal Government in family planning programs and population research. The Congress responded to the problem by passing the TydingsScheuerBush family planning services and Population Research Act in November 1970 authorizing $382 million for the Federal Government to meet those presidentially supported goals. We thereby gave the administration an opportunity to move beyond its eloquent description of the need and develop a program of action equal to the problem. The size of that program of action is now becoming clear. As the following editorial from the New York Times of February 1. 1971. points out. the administrations strong public declarations have become feeble appropriation requests. The Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare has indicated that the administration will request that only $6 million be appropriated of the $72.75 million authorized by the Family Planing Act for fiscal year 1971. and only $57.3 of the $129 million authorized for fiscal year 1972. Thus the administration is requesting less than a third of the funds that the Congress has deemed appropriate. Appropriation requests are not the only area where diminished zeal is apparent. As the Times editorial points out. some administration spokesmen are trying to dampen the rising concern about population growth in this country. They point to the fact that consumption has increased at a much faster rate than population. and it is this increasing consumption not population growth that generates such heavy pressures on our environment. However. Census Bureau figures indicate that a minimum of 37 percent of our growth in consumption in the next 15 years will be due to population growth alone. If slowing population growth would ease the consumption growth rate by one third. would not this be a significant easing of the pressures on our bruised and battered environment?

Since it formally came into being on April 28 last year\" OSHA has concentrated on recruiting. training and putting to work an effective compliance staff in a decentralized field structure. making inspections to assure standards are being observed. Since it can never have enough compliance officers to inspect every establishment frequently. OSHA has had to set priorities. First attention is given to Investigating catastrophes and fatalities. second. to investigating complaints by employees. third. to activities in target industries with high injury rates and health hazards. and fourth. to inspecting a random cross section of establishments of all sizes and types all across the Nation. I am sure many of us in this Chamber have received complaints from employers in our States that the compliance officers are too tough. At the same time. we hear from labor unions that the inspectors are too lenient. Obviously. the truth must lie somewhere in between. It must be remembered that a trigger for passage of the act was the fact that voluntary efforts had not worked. as evidenced by the steadily rising injury frequency rate for the last decade. So any new Federal inspection inevitably would produce protests. OSHA therefore has established a policy of administering the law firmly but fairly. In its first year. OSHA seems to have done an effective job of staying within the guidelines we in the Congress wrote. It is our hope that this will continue.

I am concerned that these policies deny military families an important convenience in being able to learn from an advertisement whether a product is available in the exchange. In addition. it seems to me that action might constitute restraint of trade and is an interference with freeenterprise business firms. which is certainly beyond the prerogative of the Exchange Service. I suppose the policies derive from a desire to avoid having the exchanges appear in competition with private retailers. The objective might be commendable. but the reasoning is ridiculous. The Navy and Marine Corps exchanges and all service commissaries get along very well without any such artificial restrictions on suppliers. AAFES has no right to set itself up as judge of business firms in this way. a company has a right to set its own advertising policy. One thing we do not need is additional secrecy in procurement matters. And we do not need unnecessary policies which hide information from military families. The editorial follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the noted Soviet scientist. Trofim Lysenko. opposed and rejected the theories of heredity accepted by most geneticists. Lysenkos theory. that environment controlled all. was consistent with atheistic Marxian ideology and won him the support of the party. By ordering into practice his theory that environment could change spring wheat into winter wheat. the Supreme Soviet caused millions of Russians to die from famine. And in Russia. it was the rankest heresy for any Party member even to suggest that winter wheat was inherently different from spring wheat. The spring wheat just refused to comply with Lysenkos theory that environment controls all life even though assisted by decree from the Supreme Soviet. Yet in our country today we continue to pour billions of taxpayers dollars into educational experiments. the busing of schoolchildren. an equal employment bureaucracy. urban renewal. model cities. and a myriad of progressive social experiments. all based on the fallacious assumption that an improvement or change in environment will mysteriously raise the level of intelligence. create initiative. and control behavior. The timeproven theories of heredity are labelled as taboo in polite discussions. forbidden in political considerations. and feared as revealing undisputable truths. This week the House appropriated $673.8 million to the National Science Foundation for fiscal year 1973. Many of the research programs are designed to determine why the many Federal projects based upon the common acceptance of environmentalism as a positive science have failed. No authorization of money was invested to utilize the many statistics and the available experience to get at the root causes of many problems or to seek honest solutions by scientific research to determine the relationship of heredity to educational achievement and intelligence. So long as our politicians and social scientists continue to waste the taxpayers dollars on fighting effects instead of investigating causes. our problems will become complex to where as in Lysenkos time. we too will have a faminea cultural famine. If the genetic traits of nature in a minute grain of spring wheat cannot be altered by environment. can we much longer afford to ignore the genetic peculiarities of man?",

The list of errors and mistakes are compounded with each passing payday. To enumerate. here are some of the complaints I have received from employees of the Northeastern Water Supply Laboratory. Narragansett. R.I.: First. some paychecks not received. second. State tax not withheld. third. withholding tax. fourth. health and insurance benefits. fifth. union dues not withheld. sixth. pay raise not included. seventh. charitable deductions not withheld. eighth. incorrect LWOP status. ninth. incorrect social security number. 10th. incorrect spelling of names. 11th. short hours of pay: 32 hours. 20 hours. 16 hours. and 12th. incorrect amounts in pay checks. It is somewhat understandable even in this day and age of the computer that one of these discrepancies might occur on occasion. But does it have to happen every payday? Must it be routine? Is there no end in sight? My office has called the Payroll Accounts Office a number of times in the past 4 months and no one answers the phone. On the few occasions that someone did respond to the ring of Alexander Graham Bell and a message was left. there was no return call made. I have finally decided that the only way I might be able to help straighten out this typical bureaucratic blooper is to shed a little congressional light on the matter. Thus.

Swedish aid to Hanoi is scheduled to be over $16 million or exceeding onetenth of Swedens entire foreign aid program. Castros Cuba is scheduled to receive $3 million and the Swedish International Development Authority has allocated $1.7 million to buy guns and military equipment for African guerrilla movements to slaughter whites in Mozambique. Angola. Rhodesia. and Southwest Africa. And while Sweden aids the enemy fighting us in Vietnam. the United States in fiscal years 194671 provided Sweden with foreign assistance totaling $135.300.000.

It should be obvious to most of us in the Congress that expulsion of Taiwan to make room for Communist China was a callous stroke of power bloc politics which is certain to backfire in obliterating the original purpose and goals of the United Nations. Since the establishment of the U.N.. the United States has borne the brunt of its financial operations. While that burden has been reduced somewhat in recent years. U.S. contributions still represent more than onethird of its operating expenses. Despite our excessive contribution to the maintenance of peacekeeping forces of the U.N.. Congress saw fit to approve a $200 million bond issue back in 1962. even though there were 134 of us who opposed the action for reasons which have now become more obvious than ever. It is encouraging to note that there are many who supported taking on this additional financial burden who are now calling for a sharp reduction in U.S. contributions to the world body.

I believe that it is of the greatest importance that the profound contributions of Martin Luther King be recognized and kept before cur attention. His absolute dedication to the achievement of civil rights and human dignity through nonviolent means has left an imprint upon the history and the conscience of our Nation. Martin Luther King lived but 39 years. but. in all that he did. in this short time. he never failed to recognize and realize that the goals and concerns he expressed were for the benefit of a whole people and a whole nation. When he stood at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28. 1963. the dreams he articulated in his famous speech were not just his. These dreams were the dreams of our Founding Fathers. the same men who wrote in the Declaration of Independence the resounding words: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. They were the dreams of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who laid before this great Nation. blessed with tremendous natural resources. the challenge of feeding the hungry. educating the illiterate. housing the unsheltered. clothing the naked. and uplifting the oppressed. In a sense. it was as though Dr. King had taken upon himself the great unfinished tasks of our society. He took the yoke upon himself just as Isaiah in response to the call from God when he asked. \"Whom shall I send. and who will go for us?\" In the decade of the sixties. the man who went for us was Martin Luther King. Never did he waiver in his allegiance to nonviolence. The recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. he spoke out against the senseless war in Southeast Asia long before it became popular to do so. He foresaw the violence that was to be wreaked upon this Nation by this torturous war. He was never content to sit back with his recognitions and bask in the requests for conferences by heads of state. but he felt compelled to always justify the faith trusted to him by this and many other awards.

Some people seem to think that if the various Communist leaders disagree on little things this is a big thing and that if they agree on a big thing. namely the destruction of the free world. this is a little thing. Many of us who are interested in the survival of the Nation are more concerned with the common end these fellows have of replacing all nonCommunist governments with Communist dictatorships than with factional disputes concerning the exact means by which the well struck blow can be brought about. It is not that we fail to recognize differences. and indeed no two things in the world are exactly identical in all respects. but it would not seem wise to make a fetish of characterizing our enemies according to the degree with which they differ from one another and ignore that great object. fatal to ourselves. upon which they all agree. Neither is it helpful to our national security to develop amnesia about the past activities of the various Communist tyrants.

I said on that occasion: Too little attention has been focused on the many responsible and dedicated policemen who are quietly working in communities throughout the Nation in efforts to strengthen the forces of Ju3tice. law. and order. One such policeman is Sgt. Harry Chinn of the Honolulu Police Department. For some time now Sergeant Chinn has been teaching an experimental \"law and justice awareness\" class at the Watanae Intermediate School. on the leeward side of the island of Oahu. and the response from the students has been enthusiastic. Today. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues and to other the latest honor that has been bestowed upon this unusual officer who. I am privileged to say. is a personal friend of mine. Sergeant Chinn was selected for honorable mention in the National Outstanding Policeman of the Year competition by Parade magazine and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The best accolade to Sergeant Chinns important contributions to the community he serves so well is found in Parades own terse description: \"A policeman with imagination.\" Mr. Speaker. the story of Sergeant Chinns most recent honor is told by Mike Keller in the Honolulu Advertiser of September 27. 1971. and I would now like to submit that article for inclusion [From the Honolulu Advertiser. Sept. 27. 1971]",

The President has expressed the need for an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer. The Congress has recognized this need and the study done by the Subcommittee on Public Health and the Environment has been intensive. The bill before us today is the product of this study and was unanimously reported to the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee on which I am proud to serve. The full committee subsequently overwhelmingly endorsed the subcommittee bill. The research into the causes of cancer has shown the picture to be a many faceted one. It is because of the wide spectrum of research that is presently being conducted that the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee has recommended that the national program for the conquest of cancer be retained within the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The need for a wellintegrated plan of biomedical research and a flexible administration of these programs has been urged by the leading scientists in the cancer research field. Research scientists testifying before the House subcommittee indicated their preference that this invaluable work be continued within the existing structure of the National Institutes of Health. The Director of the National Cancer Institute. in his capacity as an Associate Director of the National Institutes of Health. would assure this coordinated effort and maintain the vital interrelationships among the scientific community. Notwithstanding our hopes. it is not likely that the conquest of cancer is imminent. Too many questions remain unanswered. No one disputes the need for additional moneys to continue and intensify the battle. but money is not the only answer. We must recognize that only through the introduction of new ideas and new testing methods can we hope to win this struggle. It has been suggested that the program for cancer research \"make haste more slowly.\" We must proceed in a sure and deliberate manner to insure that we reach our goal. I believe that this bill before us today gives us the tools with which to work that goalthe conquest of cancer.",

Mr. Speaker. Interpol. the International Criminal Police Organization. is independent of the United Nations and other world agencies. It is an independent organization of 109 member countries designed to coordinate the police work of its members in law enforcement and crime prevention. It has become increasingly involved in fighting international drug traffic. and it should play an important role in this effort in the future. Interpol performs no independent investigatory functions. but rather serves to transmit the needs of one country to another. For example. if a fugitive from the United States is thought to be fleeing to France. Interpol is the mechanism whereby we request the assistance of the French police in apprehending the individual. Within the United States. Interpol is represented by the Treasury Department. Under existing law. 22 U.S.C. 263(a). there is a ceiling of $28.500 per annum on the total dues to be paid by the United States for membership in Interpol. H.R. 11350 raises the ceiling to take account of an increase in dues effective in the calendar year 1970 and provides authorization for payment of part of our 1970 dues which are still outstanding. Legislation was introduced in the last session to raise the limit. but no action was taken. and the United States could not pay its dues in full because of the statutory limit. The United States share of the costs of Interpol represents only about 6 percent of the total amount of dues payable and is equivalent to the individual shares to be paid by each of the following members: France. Germany. United Kingdom. and Italy. The limit established by H.R. 11350 is that proposed by the Treasury Department with a very slight cushion to take account of fluctuations in the dollar which have caused the Treasury Department to modify its original request. Mr. Speaker.. H.R. 11350 allows continued U.S. support of an international police organization which provides vitally important services to our country.

This measure provides for an overall increase in pension of approximately 6.5 percent for all veterans and widows on the pension rolls. and is designed to overcome the increased cost of living for those Veterans Administration beneficiaries who are subsisting on only the lowest of incomes. Most importantly it will pievent any reduction in pension next year that. under existing law. would have resulted from the increase in social security benefits awarded in 1971. The bill raises the income levels by $300 in all categories. including the pensioner receiving benefits under the Veterans Pension Act of 1959. It increases the rates under a new formula which establishes several income levels with any future changes due to increased income minimized by relating them in terms of a reduction of a specified number of cents for each dollar of increase over the established levels. Another important feature provides that a veteran. widow. or child when confronted with unusual medical expenses may deduct them from their declared incomes. I consider this a timely bill and am in favor of it.",

Members are aware of the fact that each time social security is increased. it can and in most instances does have an adverse effect upon veteran pensioners who receive both social security and pension. Public Law 925. enacted earlier this year. authorized a 10percent increase in social security benefits. Unless the Congress acts to protect them. thousands of pensioners. widows. and veterans alike. will have their Veterans Administration payments reduced or terminated next January 1. The bill before you will prevent that possibility from happening by insuring that no pensioner will suffer the reduction or termination of his pension benefits solely because of the 1971 social security increase received in his own behalf. The bill accomplishes this purpose by establishing a new formula for the payment of pension which will be more responsive to the needs of veterans and widows and. as long as a pensioners income does not exceed the new maximum annual income limitation of $2.600 for single pensioners and $3.800 for pensioners with dependents. it will preclude the loss of aggregate income in the future when a pensioner receives an increase in income from other sources. In the process of accomplishing this Worthy purpose. the bill provides an average costofliving increase of approximately 6.5 percent for approximately 1.6 million veterans and widows. Although I am not a voting member of the Subcommittee on Compensation and Pension. I did attend most of the hearings and executive sessions relating to the consideration of this legislation.

Congressman OLIN TEAGUE. of Texas. who was so influential in getting this legislation passed. This legislation will enable widows of servicemen who were killed in action to receive an increase in monthly payments. These measures will also make certain that veterans and widows who are receiving pensions for disability or death that is unrelated to military service will receive monthly increases. Approximately 176.000 widows will receive a 10percent increase in their monthly dependency and indemnity compensation rates and 46.000 children will receive a 5percent increase if these bills are passed. This legislation will also provide a costofliving increase in nonserviceconnected pension rates payable to approximately 1.6 million veterans and widows and would prevent these pensioners from losing any of their VA pensions because of the 1971 social security benefit increases.

Mr. DORN. will explain thedetails of H.R. 11652. but I want to make some general comments concerning this second major proposal which our committee is recommending for the consideration of the Members. One of the major obligations of our Nation in the field of veterans legislation is directed to providing reasonable monetary assistance to widows. children. and dependent parents of veterans who died in the service or as a result of serviceincurred disabilities. The modern program designed for this purpose was the outcome of extensive hearings and deliberations on the part of a Select Committee on Survivors Benefits which presented its recommendations in 1956. The legislation enacted was effective January 1. 1957. During the succeeding years this program for widows and other survivors has proven to be a marked improvement over the previous program. However. it has been necessary to amend it from time to time as the need for further improvements have been demonstrated. H.R. 11652 is basically a rate increase bill which can be fully justified in the light of the costofliving increases which have occurred since the Congress last had under consideration the adequacy of the rates.

The increases are 10 percent for widows. 5 percent for children when there is no widow involved. and an overall increase of 6.5 percent for dependent parents. The variation in these percentages results from the fact that the increases are representative of increases in the cost of living since the last adjustment in the rates for each of these categories of survivors. I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina . chairman of the Subcommittee on Compensation and Pension. and the gentleman from Arkansas . the ranking minority member. and their colleagues on the subcommittee for presenting this needed legislation. The Veterans Administration has expressed its support of an adjustment in these benefit payments to compensate for price increases since the time when benefits were last increased.

A very important change is an additional allowance of $55 to the parent who is a patient in a nursing home or who is so helpless or blind as to be in need of a regular aid or attendant. This same extra allowance is extended to parents receiving death compensation under the law in effect prior to January 1. 1957. This measure also will permit those persons receiving death compensation because they were ineligible to elect to receive dependency and indemnity compensation to now make an election in favor of the latter.

It would be well for the record to reflect that on two previous occasions. previous to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress had passed voting rights legislation. It passed such legislation in 1957. and again in 1960. Then it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On the two previous occasions. those of us who opposed the bill. were of the opinionand that was one reason why the bills came to a vote--that in the event a motion for cloture were filed. and a filibuster were attempted on the bill. the Senate would vote for cloture. If not on the first vote. then certainly on the second vote. I am of the opinion. without regard to whether or not I vote for itand whether I vote for it would depend on what it looked likethat a bill that appe ars to be reasonably tailored to meet the problem that exists. using no more Federal interference than is necessary to meet the problem. will pass the Senate. and will pass the Senate under the existing rule. without the rule being changed. For that reason. the Senator from Louisiana hopes that the Senate will schedule a voting rights bill when it is reported. and vote on the bill on its merits. If we did so. it might not be necessary to have to vote on a proposed change in rule XXII. It should be remembered that rule XXII does more than protect those who are opposed to some civil rights measures. As the Senator knows. there was a measure before the Senate to prevent the reapportionment decision of the Supreme Court from going into effect. which perhaps could have been passed by a majority vote. It was defeated. So this proposal tends to work both ways.

Congress added $400.000 to initiate construction because it was considered an urgent small flood control project with damaging floods which have occurred on an average of more than once a year for the last 50 years. They had floods in the area in May and September of this year. 1970. which caused damage estimated at $1.148.000. In other words. they had at least one flood a year for 50 years and it was of high priority. of great urgency. with a benefitcost ratio of 1.6 to 1.

But this will not be simple. especially since any solution will impinge upon many of the important policy issues facing our Nation. including national security. environmental protection. and economic growth. Mr. Speaker. the longrun answers to the energy crisis must depend on science and technology. Our traditional energy sources cannot meet the needs of the future. so we must develop new ones and find new methods for converting these energy sources into desirable forms such as electricity and gas. We must also develop more efficient means for transmitting energy to locations where it is needed. In an effort to promote new research in science and technology directed toward the energy crisis. last summer I constituted an energy task force within the Committee on Science and Astronautics. Chaired by Representative MIKE MCCORMACK. of Washington. this task force is under the jurisdiction of Chairman JOHN DAVIS Subcommittee on Science. Research and Development.

Congressman MCCORMACKS task force has done a superb job of studying and evaluating the legislative issues related to energy research and development.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has. as a result of the devastating flood. sustained the worst damage from a natural disaster in its entire history. From a discussion with Gov. Milton J. Shapp and as a result of the visit to the Commonwealth by President Nixon and General Lincoln. of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. it would appear on the basis of incomplete information that damage to highways and bridges alone is in the neighborhood of $550 million. that the latest count is that 126 bridges are out in Pennsylvania. that as of noon yesterday. damage to schools is in the area of $40 million to $50 million. with no reports yet in from colleges and universities. that whole cities are inundated and have suffered extraordinarily heavy damage. that the downtown district of WilkesBarre. Pa.. is entirely under water. that the principal industry of Bloomsburg. the Bigelow Carpet Co. is half under water. that the Bethlehem Steel plant is totally under water. that 150 to 200 major factories have been disabled in the State. and that more than 50 sewage systems are out. It is estimated that somewhere between 40.500 to 50.000 houses have been damaged in Pennsylvania. The Office of Emergency Preparedness has assured the Commonwealth that It will furnish all assistance within Its power. subject to its authorizations and the funds available. That may not and probably will not be nearly enough. The water is stagnant there. Unlike damage in other areas. the water remains. It has not flowed off. It has not acted as a flash flood would in most cases. When water stays 5 or 6 days in a community. it means the virtual destruction of that part of the community so inundated. Mr. President. it may well be necessary for us to ask for an emergency authorization and appropriation providing for a substantial sum to aid the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to recover from this terrible disaster. I have discussed with the Governor the advisability of meeting with the Pennsylvania congressional delegation. probably tomorrow. and if it is necessary to ask for emergency funds. we will appeal to our colleagues in both bodies for sympathetic understanding. and expeditious action on this request.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as yesterdays Washington Post editorial and todays New York Times editorial accurately indicate. President Nixon has made it clear that he does not wish to enact a welfare reform bill. I am deeply disappointed that President Nixon does not wish to work with those of us in Congress seeking meaningful welfare reform. In the past the President has asked to be judged by his deeds. not his words. He has failed his own testdelivering words on welfare reform but little else. As a result of his lack of commitment to secure passage of reform legislation. the prospects for reforming our Nations welfare mess are growing dimmer. For some time it has been evident that the only possibility for enactment of worthwhile legislation lies in accommodation between those of us supporting improvements to H.R. 1 and the President. I fail to understand how the President can say that moving in the direction of compromise is wrong on the merits. The fact is that in the past he has supported virtually every element of the proposed compromise bill. In 1969 and 1970. President Nixons welfare reform guaranteed benefits no lower than under the present system. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to optional work registration for mothers with preschool children. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to require State supplementation of families headed by unemployed males. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to Job suitability provisions. eligibility based on current need. simplified. efficient administrative requirements. Now he rejects these principles. In short. by rejecting an accommodation with those of us seeking meaningful reform. he is turning his back on all the principles he has supported In the past. He is left with H.R. 1a regressive. inhumane. and unacceptable welfare bill. It should be obvious to him by now that there are no -supporters for H.R. 1 as it passed the House. Not one Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee supported it. Instead. they supported a subpoverty makework program. which is completely incompatible with the concepts of the family assistance plan. A large group of Republicans and Democrats remain committed to passage of worthwhile welfare legislation. Without the Presidents support. however. welfare reform is dead.

I commend such lofty thinking. it is heartening to know that there are those who recognize the everincreasing need for respect and cooperation among the worlds people. As the earth becomes more crowded. the behavior of individuals and of nations must be based on ever higher and more humane standards. President Kennedy eloquently expressed his awareness of this need when he said: The daytoday unfolding of events makes it ever clearer that our own welfare is interrelated with the rights and freedoms assured the people of other nations ... There is no society so advanced that it no longer needs periodic recommitment to human rights. The United States cannot afford to renounce responsibility for support of the very fundamentals which distinguish our concept of government from all forms of tyranny. Mr. President. we have an opportunity to recommit ourselves to that basic belief in the sanctity of human life upon which our Nation was founded. we have an obligation to reaffirm our opposition to that desecration of human life which we have so often fought.

Blood is critical for open heart surgery. for the treatment of wounds and burns. bleeding ulcers. and certain types of anemia. to mention only a few examples. Furthermore. blood byproducts have many medical uses. For these reasons I was particularly interested in reading a recent book review in the May 9 issue of the Washington Post by Mr. Robert Claiborne. entitled \"Blood Will Tell.\" Mr. Claiborne reviewed \"The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy.\" by Prof. Richard M. Titmuss of the University of London and the London School of Economics. Professor Titmuss contends that blood collected through an economic framework downgrades generosity and pushes aside altruism to make way for greed. Commercial bloodbanking depends on people who are willing to sell blood at a price. The current rate of hepatitis infection. caused by blood transfusions. is 2 to 4 percent among U.S. blood recipients. A sizable proportion of U.S. blood is purchased from alcoholics and addicts who are likely to be diseased and far more likely to lie about their condition. By contrast. England through its National Health Service. has managed to keep pace with the rapid increase in medical demand for blood. An improved system for the collection and redistribution of blood will be a central part of the program for health reform in America. The comparisons with Great Britain. as cited by Professor Titmuss. are shocking. Currently. the American method of collecting blood costs 5 to 15 times more than in England. We waste 15 to 30 percent of the blood that we collect. because the blood becomes outdated after 3 weeks. or it is used unnecessarily. England has only a 2percent waste of its blood supply. High quality health care requires a pure and adequate supply of blood. I believe that Professor Titmuss book raises basic questions concerning the collection and distribution of blood in America.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is much confusion about the propbr roles of government and the private sector in restoring our -cities and creating new communities. There are those among us who would place the burden for such activities solely on the already overburdened Federal Government. even though history has proven that Government alone has a rather poor record for solving such problems. Our national successes to date can be attributed primarily to our capacity to leave to the private sector those responsibilities which it can best handle and to relegate to Government only those which the private sector cannot accomplish. It is my firm conviction that when we stray far from this philosophy we not only diminish the return for our efforts but we endanger the foundation of our entire system. This is why it was pleasing to me to note in the June 7. 1971. issue of U.S. News & World Report a comprehensive interview with David Rockefeller. chairman of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank. a man who is eminently qualified to enlighten us in the field of urban affairs and community development. Mr. Rockefeller proposes an imaginative plan to harness Governments capacity to acquire large areas of land together with the private sectors ability to arrange the capital formation necessary to underwrite major renewal or development projects. Such a combination of talents. it must be conceded. is a most welcome alternative to proposals such as we are constantly besieged with. that is. proposals that the Federal Government attempt to underwrite the major portion of the projects. Those who believe that our Federal Treasury has no bottom to it will no doubt disagree. but reason must indicate that the job we are talking about in our cities is beyond the scope of even our bountiful although overworked largess.

The rural electrification program has ifieant much to the people of North Carolina. especially to those in the congresional district I have the honor to represent. Since May 18. 1936. when the first REA line was energized in my State. the rural electric cooperatives have been highly successful in providing. the service needed by our rural population. When they began. only 3.2 percent or 9.672 of North Carolinas farms had electric service. but today 99 percent of our 157.000 farms receive service. This has made and continues to make a dramatic difference in rural life in North Carolina just as it has and does in other States. The service provided by our rural electric cooperatives is of vital importance not only to the members served. but also to those living in urban areas. Without a plentiful supply of electricity in rural America. it is not likely that our farms would be nearly so capable of meeting the Nations needs for food and fiber at reasonable prices. People would not want to liveand work in rural areas without electricity. And without the laborsaving help of electricity farm output would be greatly and adversely affected. In short. the rural electrification program is absolutely essential to the Nation as a whole and we should not hesitate to do all we can to insure its continued vitality. especially in the area of adequate loan funds. This program provides a necessity of lifenot a luxury. and we should not forget it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. all of us have heard the shrill cries of denunciation that have been hurled at J. Edgar Hoover. the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As these charges are being leveled at this man of vast competence and character. I am reminded of the words of Longfellow when he said: We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing. while others judge us by what we have already done. It is quite apparent what J. Edgar Hoover has done. that is. to put into operation one of the most effective investigatory bodies that has ever functioned toward the end of protecting our national interest. It is interesting to observe that in the course of this storm of accusation. Mr. Hoover has remained. aloof from its blasts. keeping his composure and maintaining his stature as the head of that outstanding institution known as the FBI. This would serve to suggest something of the character of the man and the futility of his accusers. No man is. of course. perfect. because imperfection is in the nature of mortals. However. when J. Edgar Hoover is evaluated according to the contribution he has made to his Nation through his public service. it must be declared that beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. he has done a superlative job. It is in the American tradition to extend appreciation to someone who has performed a yeoman job in public service. but there are always some whose vision is blurred to such service. As Elbert Hubbard once said: There is something that is much more scarce. something finer far. something rarer than ability. It is the ability to recognize ability.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Mr. J. Edgar Hoover has served the Department of Justice for 54 years. Throughout the last 47 of those 54 years. he has served as Director of the Departments Federal Bureau of Investigation. I am confident that no one is more aware than Mr. Hoover that one who serves so long in such a key public position becomes viewed. in the public mind. as virtually synonymous with the institution itself. I am also confident. however. that no one is more aware than Mr. Hoover that. in our constitutionally defined Republic. our institutions are viewed as permanent while those who serve them remain viewed as mortal and. therefore. replaceable in the normal. proper order of things. My confidence of these facts has its basis in the root fact that Mr. Hoovers entire 54 years of outstanding service have been in the dedicated area of defending our Republic and keeping its institutions secure. It is understandable that. from its inception. the Federal Bureau of Investigation has earned the animosity of gangsters. common criminals. our external enemies. and those who serve those enemies efforts to destroy us from within. Down through the years. the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its Director have been routine targets of criticism and charges from these same criminal and aliendirected sources. Recently. however. the Bureau and its Director have become targets of wild and unproved charges from partisan political sources. This is unfortunate and shocking. for. throughout the more than five decades of the Bureaus existence and of Mr. Hoovers direction. both have served under both Democratic and Republican Presidents and Attorneys General. After Mr. Hoover has retired. and a new Director has assumed command. there is every reason to accept that charges and criticism will continue to flow from the criminal and subversive elements. What will be interesting to note will be whether those partisan politicians who. of late. have chosen to direct their fire against Mr. Hoover and the FBI will do the same. Whatever history may write in this regard. I wish to record. here. my tribute to Mr. Hoover for his 54 years of faithful service to this country and to wish him well in the days to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Roman poet. Virgil. wrote: \"The noblest motive is the public good.\" These words might well serve as the key to the life of J. Edgar Hoover. From the beginning of his career in public service. the public good has been his guiding motive and singleminded concern. In times of war and in times of peace. he has provided an example to inspire all Americans with love of country and of God. Ideals of citizenship. honor. and duty have been paramount in his administration of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. an agency which he has made his own insofar as it has come to embody the ideals and values by which he has lived. As a people we may breathe more securely in the knowledge of the FBIs vigilant operations under Mr. Hoovers distinguished leadership. The war against crime in all its many forms and the war against subversion in all its forms have been a vital part of the FBIs continuing struggle. requiring patience. energy. and courage. The members of the FBI have earned the respect of a grateful America. During decades in which free governments throughout the world succumbed to tyranny and disruption. the United States remained strong. protected within by those who loved her. Mr. Hoover foremost among them. Coming to his great office some 47 years ago. Mr. Hoover has lived to see the FBIand the legend and reality of his own personan enduring part of the national consciousness. honored by all for the integrity of its dealings. \"True courage.\" wrote Lord Shaftesbury. \"is cool and calm.\" So has it been with Mr. Hoover. who has never sought the accolade of the crowd. He has risen above smallminded sniping and criticism in the past and today. I am happy to pay this tribute to him. to commend his extraordinary career of service to the Nation. and to congratulate him in this anniversary year.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. almost 30 years ago. as a young man just graduated from law school. I received a wire from J. Edgar Hoover. advising me that my application for service as a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been accepted. and instructing me to proceed to Washington. D.C.. for training. I served only a year before entering the service in World War II. However. during my period of training. and my subsequent months as a special agent. I had considerable contact with Mr. Hoover. and of course. with the system of training agents. and using agents in investigative work. I was. and ever since have been. enormously impressed with the efficiency of the organization Mr. Hoover has built. There is no doubt that he designed the system. and that he has been very carefully supervising the operation of the Bureau during his long tenure as Director. He has been most zealous to protect the Bureau from political and all other outside interference. so that the efficiency and effectiveness of the Bureau would remain very high. That you can have an organization within the vast Federal bureaucracy of the size of the FBI which is at once so effective and efficient is a living tribute and monument to the great ability and to the personality of J. Edgar Hoover. The recent efforts made to discredit both Mr. Hoover personally and the FBI as an institution have been despicable. I. for one. do not feel that just because I am a Member of Congress. gives me any immunity above and beyond that which is enjoyed by every other citizen in this land. The enormous contribution to America that Mr. Hoover has made will be recorded in history long after the petty harping of his critics is forgotten. Nearly every year since my election to Congress. I have called on the Director personally to extend my best wishes to him. and to discuss some of the current problems of interest to the Bureau. I have found him extremely alert. sensitive. very well informed on details. and certainly competently on top of his most demanding job. It is a pleasure to join in wishing him well on this anniversary occasion.",

Ind. This legislation has been introduced in previous years by myself and by my distinguished colleague from Indiana. Representative LEE H. HAMILTON.

The portion of the Ohio River that would be banked by this parkway is one of the most scenic of the rivers entire length. The proposed plan would bring these beautiful sights within the reach of 10 million people from Indiana. Kentucky. Ohio. Tennessee. and Missouri. In addition to the esthetic benefits derived from the parkways location. it would also serve as a connecting link to the Lincoln Trail in Spencer County and. possibly. with the Lincoln Memorial National Parkway. The Ohio River has played a significant role in the expansion of our country. and the trail history winding along its shores should be made available to more people than the present highway system permits. The bill I offer today will not only enable area residents to enjoy the historical and recreational sites this section of -the country has to offer. but it will also make it readily accessible to visitors coming from other parts of the Nation. Mr. President. I hope that my colleagues will give this proposal the consideration it merits. and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

I am therefore heartened to find my concern mirrored by those most intimately involved with administering such computerization. An article in the current issue of the Public Administration Review discusses the problem in a very lucid fashion. It first presents an excellent summary of what steps have been taken by Congress and other bodies to explore the complexities of the issue. Then. in what I consider the heart of the article. the author urges administrators to take action on their own. In his words. Clearly. the complexity of this issue has many illdefined or cloudy areas. But. this does not mean that those in public administration can sit back and wait for the Congress. the states. the courts. or the data processing profession to act for them. In these days when people are making extraordinary demands on government. not to have a forwardlooking perspective is dangerous for both the individual administrator and his organization. In particular. the author urges administrators to allow the subjects of dossiers to read and challenge entries in their files. Mr. President. I could not agree more. Awareness is more effective than any legislative investigation or enactment could hope to be as a deterrent for misuse of governmental powers. I find the suggestion of allowing subject access and challenge particularly interestingit is the cornerstone of any system to protect .privacy. The author then notes that the administrator may fear to act because he may \"hinder or compromise Government operations.\" In answer to that fear. the author adduces the example of the Freedom of Information Act. commenting that studies of. the acts effects show that agencies prior fears about Government security were groundless. Mr. President. I am very glad to see this argument made. In dealing with governmental agencies. I have found them sometimes too worried about efficiency.

This area is located in centralwestern Montana about 75 miles west of Great Falls and 75 miles northeast of Missoula. Mont. It straddles the Continental Divide and is contiguous to the southeastern boundary of the existing 950.000acre Bob Marshall Wilderness. This area was not a part of an existing Forest Service primitive area nor has it been managed as such by that agency. It does. however. meet all the criteria for wilderness designation and all the necessary reports by Forest Service and the mineral examination by the Department have been completed. This area. known generally as the LincolnScapegoat Back Country. is characterized by spectacular scenery. unique. and interesting geologic formations. unspoiled streams and small lakes. and broad expanses of alpine and subalpine country that display sparse vegetation as a result of long winters. deep snows. and steep and rocky terrain. Interspersed with these are broad mountain valleys with some heavy stands of timber. Wildlife is abundant and varied within the area. Deer. elk. mountain goat. mountain sheep. black and grizzly bear. moose. wolverine. and other smaller animals are known to exist. Wilderness designation will help preserve the rare grizzly bear. The committee adopted an amendment that excluded from wilderness designation some 5.870 acres in the vicinity of Benchmark. Mont.. which shows the impact of mans presence. With this exclusion the proposed Scapegoat Wilderness meets all standards and criteria for wilderness designation. I urge favorable action on H.R. 7295. as amended.",

The entire area lies within my congressional district. It is an area rich in scenery and wildlife including rare and endangered species such as the grizzly bear. The timber and mineral resources that could be developed are relatively limited. and clearly. Mr. Speaker. the best use of this land area is as wilderness. The history of the Lincoln Back Country legislation is crucial to this Chambers consideration. It was originally introduced several years ago by Jim Battin. now a Federal judge in Montana. Then Congressman from the Second District of Montana. Battin introduced the legislation for himself and other interested Montanans anxious to see one of the last truly wilderness areas preserved in its natural state. This legislation has been firmly supported by varied interests including the U.S. Forest Service. Feeling in my district. a district whose economic life depends in great part on logging and mining. is that the Lincoln Back Country should be designated a wilderness. For that reason. I have strongly supported this legislation since originally introducing the proposal to Congress nearly a year and a half ago. just after becoming a Member of Congress. and I today ask the Members of this body to concur in passage of this important and needed legislation.

This proposal has been pending before Congress for several years now and has been delayed because of the necessity for mineral surveys and other studies. As we pass the bill today. it represents a true team victory in the House not only for the present Montana congressional delegation but also for former Congressmen Jim Battin and Arnold Olsen who during the past years worked with Senators MANSFIELD and METCALF in its behalf. Thousands of Montana citizens. aware of the magnificence of this area. have actively worked for passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker. this legislation excludes from wilderness designation 5.800 acres in the Benchmark area for limited development day use because of its proximity to activities of a landing strip and summerhomes. It also directs the Forest Service to provide alternate motorbike and snowmobile trails in adjacent forest areas where they will not infringe on the wilderness area or disturb livestock or wildlife. This represents the first time that the Forest Service has received such instructions from Congress in connection with a wilderness area.

Let us let national television studios live up to their obligations to every political party running this year.",

This will simply open the door of this country to cheap. lowwage imports of beef. pork. and other meat products. For the first time in the modern history of our country. our farmers are beginning to receive a fair price for meat grown on the farm. Mr. Speaker. farmers are not the cause of the high cost of living. For instance. the farmer only receives 3 cents for the wheat in a loaf of bread costing the housewife 35 cents. Unrestricted imports of beef and pork will be a serious blow to the American farmer and will not curb inflation. It will be a serious setback to the growing cattle industry in the South where we have been encouraged to restrict row cropping and go into cattle raising which conserves our soil and water resources. Mr. Speaker. these cheap. lowwage imports of beef cannot possibly be processed with the same health standards and protection provided for the American people through our own industry and high standards. Some years ago. I recall that tons of kangaroo meat were sold in this country from a foreign nation and sold as hamburger. We must protect the American people from such an outrage. I greatly fear that the door is now open for the importation of meat products from Communist countries that operate with a slave economy.

Boating accidents often involve a chain of avoidable circumstances which include the boatman. the boat and its equipment. and the environment in which the boat operates. Operator fault is most often considered as the principal cause of boating accidents. since the boatman is the last person who can avoid an accident. But by breaking the chain of contributing events. accidents can be avoided and their consequences reduced. A major part of a balanced program is education. The boatman must know safety rules and his responsibility to others for safe operation. Once he knows these responsibilities. effective enforcement is necessary to assure his continued awareness. Good engineering safety standards for his boat and its equipment will reduce the contribution of his boat to accidents. Finally. uptodate and pertinent environmental and weather information will help him to avoid circumstances which are dangerous. Taken together. these four points offer a balanced and effective boating safety program. This bill provides incentives for greatly increased state enforcement and education programs. and broad authority to establish required engineering safety standards. I urge your support.",

Conn.. in which 28 of 31 persons were killed. According to newspaper accounts. the minimum operating ceiling of the New Haven airport was 380 feet. The aircraft attempted a landing with a ceiling at 200 feet or less. This accident is presently under investigation. and I do not attempt to prejudge the results. An instrument or mechanical failure may have been at fault. but in all probability. the investigation will disclose the pilot was attempting a belowminimum landing. The statements which appeared in the press indicated that perhaps this accident would not have occurred if an instrument landing system had been installed. and this further disturibs me. This gives the impression that by merely spending millions of dollars at airports around the country these horrible accidents could be eliminated. Unfortunately this is not the case. As long as pilots continue to disregard minimum requirements and as long as they attempt landings below these requirements. these tragic accidents will continue to occur. I recently wrote to the Department of Transportation concerning this matter. and have now received a reply from Mr. Shaffer. the Administrator of Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is hard at work on this problem and should be congratulated on the development of a system which will expose the pilot who disregards the rules. thereby bringing about greater safety to the general commercial air traveling public. Also I commend this Agency for further integrating into the air traffic control system military operations whenever possible. Mr. Speaker. I hereby include Mr. Shaffers letter with my remarks:",

Most of the legislation introduced to date has had a broad scope. targeted at national and local elections. for President. Senators. and Congressmen. It is my opinion that my colleagues and I. as Members of the House of Representatives. should set our own spending and disclosure policies. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I have introduced H.R. 7299. the \"Campaign Expenditure Disclosure Act of 1971.\" a bill designed specifically for campaign spending disclosure and limitation in the House of Representatives. This act. presently being considered by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. of which I am a member. has three parts. I will mention them briefly today and discuss them fully in subsequent weeks.First and most importantly. my bill provides for full and complete disclosure of any campaign contributionspublic or privatein the amount of over $10. There will be two reporting dates10 days before the election and 28 days after the election. This will insure each candidate sufficient time to assemble and submit complete and thorough reports. Second. my bill would place a limit of $100.000 on the amount any candidate may spend in a general election. There is to be no stipulation on how this money is to be spent. Finally my bill provides for the establishment of a Registry of Election Finance. attached to the General Accounting Office. to be responsible for keeping financial records of elections and making them available to the public on demand. Further. the bill provides for each candidate to designate one bank within his State as the campaign depository to hold. register. and record all campaign funds. My bill also includes stiff penalties for failure to comply with any of the above provisions. Mr. Speaker. it is important that the House act as swiftly as possible to enact campaign spending limitations. We all know too well how expensive the last two elections have been to all parties involved. and how expensive future elections will be if we do not act promptly. Mr. Speaker. I earnestly believe that if the House of Representatives passes a campaign spending bill. responsive to its own particular characteristics and needs. it will set a strong and positive example to the Nation. proving that Government is a servant of the Nation. capable of honorably policing its own affairs.",

In the supplement to the Review. the New Press Critics. there appeared an interesting article by Frank Keane of Journalists Newsletters. originally published in. April 1970. The article tells of a story in the Providence Journal describing a reorganization of a subsidiary company of the Providence Journal Co. In my review. the article illustrates that actual news management is more the prerogative and practice of publishers and owners rather than editors. In light of the Pentagon Papers case. it seems to me that some publishers ought to leave the job of editing to the editors and not involve themselves in the dubious practice of tailoring the news to fit their views.

Many segments of the media. Mr. Speaker. apparently purposefutlly neglect to treat the issue of merchandising stolen property and elect to ride the matter of the first amendment suggesting that the only issue involved is freedom of the press and the right of people to know. The position of the Times. Post. and so forth. has been strengthened measurably by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. which incidentally was pretty well confined to the substantive matter of whether or not the security of the United States was endangered by the revelations. The Court decision. in my opinion. did not reach the gut issue. One cannot help but wonder just how far the champions of these freedoms might go when they suggest \"the public has a right to know.\" Do they really feel that all classified Government information. no matter how obtained. should be publicized? If so. would they suggest that those who deal in stolen goods might start stealing the income tax returns of persons connected with the Times. like Arthur Sulzberger. Rosenthal. and so forth. and publishing this information on the basis of the \"peoples right to know\"? Woujd they go a step further and suggest that newspapermen no longer can hide behind the faceless nebulous informants such as \"an authoritative source\" or \"it is reliably reported\" or \"a high Government official suggests\"?

There have been only three bills cleared. and the press is making note that funds to operate Congress is one of them. Since 1964 there have been 86 major money bills passed by the Congress. Only six of them have made it before the start of the fiscal year. This. of course. breeds inefficiency and uncertainty in the operation of government. Some bills are not passed until the following session of Congress. which promotes panic spending during the last fiscal quarter by agencies attempting to dispose of funds they could not adequately plan for. It is time that we give serious consideration to changing our f.scal year. The pattern is clearwith the huge budgets we are considering. the midyear fiscal year termination places an unfair burden on us. and is creating chaos at the local level where budgets are built around Federal grants. Many localities borrow money to tide them over. This adds to costs. They delay projects. This adds to costs. I have introduced legislation to change from the fiscal to the calendar year. We should be able to read the fiscal handwriting on the wall and take steps to bring Congress into the 1970s budgetwise. A full year to pass the appropriations would give us more time to take a closer look at what is being requested. and would benefit not only Federal fiscal procedure. but the thousands of local governments left holding the bag when we are unable to meet the fiscal year budget deadline.

The House should reject the charge for several reasons. First. there mulst be a clear and compelling national interest which cannot be served by any other alternative before a congressional subcommittee can demand to see a reporters notes. Certainly there is not such national interest involved in \"The Selling of the Pentagon.\" This principle was reaffirmed last yeas in the decision on Caldwell against United States. Second. the grounds cited by the subcomnittee are insufficient to support the charge of contempt of Congress. In support of its subpena. the subcommittee contends that although a reporters notes cannot be reached by subpena. as stated in Caldwell against United States. unused film outtakes can. since they \"pertain to actual events\" and are \"not the private thoughts of the reporter.\" However. outtakes are in fact televisions counterpart to a reporters notes. A film interview is constitutionally undistinguishable from an interview in which a reporter makes his own written notes or uses a recording device. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the first amendment prohibits compulsory disclosure of confidential associations and private communications obtained in a context analogous to a newsmans situation. These decisions have placed the broadcast and print journalists on precisely the same footing. Whatever the test applied. the general rule is that the first amendment protects a newsmans sources and notes from compulsory disclosure by a court. Congress or any other investigating agency. The first amendment provides broadcasters with the same protection as other forms of the press. And this protection is sufficient grounds to reject the charge of contempt and withdraw the subpena.",

It concerns New York Citys decision to change over completely to the use of recycled paper for all its paper requirements. Beginning soon. the New York City commissioner of purchase will specify minimum percentages of recycled fiber that will have to be in every paper item the city buys. This step follows the tremendous success of the citys purchases of recycled paper to date. In the words of the commissioner of purchase: The partially recycled paper was every bit as good. but cheaper than our previous purchases of virgin paper. It seems that Congress could take a lesson from New York City. Senators are still unable to receive recycled paper in their regular paper allotment. I buy my own. Not a single Federal agency can use recycled paper. although several have told me they were interested. Why? Because the Government Printing Office has not made up its mind: The matter is under study. Well. I submit that the study has gone on long enough. The unambiguous evidence is in. not only from New York. but from every other user of recycled paper. Recycled paper is every bit as good. but cheaper than virgin paper. With the speed of its studies. I am surprised that the Government Printing Office has moved up from papyrus. How long must this charade go on? When will Federal specifications be rewritten to permit. let alone require. the use of recycled paper? When will action be forthcoming on the various bills. including my own. to require some use of recycled paper by the Government? I ask that we move promptly on these matters. for time is of the essence. Every day more trees are cut down needlessly to fill our virgin paper requirements.

The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota to require the issuance of such a receipt was roundly defeated by arguments such as these: The taxpayers do not want -the information. we would be filling the taxpayers mailboxes with junk mail. the scheme would be subject to a computer error. there would probably be a taxpayers revolt if they were informed how their money is being spent. the services would cost too muchabout onethird the price of an F14 airplane. I am surprised to hear the distinguished Senator from Louisiana . chairman of the Finance Committee. report that he has never in 23 years had a request for any information of this kind.

New towns could represent the best of planning. technology. and social involvement. The development of new towns was spurred by the Housing Act of 1968. In this legislation. four kinds of new towns became eligible for government aid: First. the free standing town. second. the satellite city. third. the add onbuilt around an existing small town. and fourth. the new townin towna new town within the core part of an already existing city. We in Minnesota were proud to be the first State that won a loan guarantee commitment from HUD for the new town of Jonathan. The planning of Jonathan places emphasis on the orderly growth and the preservation of open space. This year Minnesota will have another new town developmentCedarRiverside. less than a mile from the heart of Minneapolis. CedarRiverside is an example of a new townin town. Additional legislation in 1970 has opened frontiers for the development of new towns. Under title VII of the Housing and Urban Development Act. interest differential payments were made available for both public and new conmunity developers. However. I have discovered that the Nixon administration is not paying the interest differential for new public new community developers. I have introduced Senate Joint Resolution 141 that would require the payment of this differential. I would hope that Congress will act on that resolution. The importance of new towns to private developers has been clear to many of us for years. Recently. however. this importance is being noticed in such business oriented magazines as Fortune. In an article published in the September issue of Fortune. Eleanore Carruth examines the whole new towns picture. Her conclusion is worth noting: It is much too early to tell how new towns will work out. of course on a number of countsbut they could in themselves be at least a partial solution. By their very existence. moreover. in the standards they set for all other developments. they could lift the level of living for millions of Americans. And. surely that would make the new town experiment worth the undertaking. I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \"Big Move to New Towns\" be printed in the RECORD.",

On that date. in Atlantic Citys Convention Hall. nearly 30.000 individuals from all 50 States and from 36 other countries will convene for an annual meeting and the packing/converting exposition. presented by Packaging Machinery Manufacturing Institute.

I refer to the question of cheese imports. Senators will remember that in 1969. quotas were established for certain categories of cheese. but those costing over 47 cents a pound were exempted. This exemption was designed to facilitate the importation of highprice specialty cheeses not directly competitive with American products. What has happened in practice. however. is that a considerable amount of directly competitive cheese has found its way into the over 47cent category. In other words. the intended effect of the original quotas is not being fulfilled. As I wrote to the Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission last While I am not an expert in this field. I have received a considerable amount of correspondence from Missouri dairy farmers who state. on the basis of solid. factual information. that the original intent of the 470 provision has been effectively nullifled because producers who export to the United States have simply raised their prices with the result that almost 40 % of our cheese imports last year were valued at more than 47t. Dairy farmers recognize the delicacy of our trade relations with the EEC and other dairy countries and have. I believe. cooperated very well with the trade agreements we have made in the past. Continued confidence in these agreements depends upon their effectiveness in achieving their original purposes. On March 12. the President had requested the Tariff Commission to make recommendations dealing with these over 47cent imports. The Tariff Commission. on July 28. sensibly recommended that the 47cent price cut off simply be abolished and that quotas be established for all types of cheese. regardless of price. This seems to me to have been a fair and equitable recommendation. fully consistent with the intent of the original cheese quotas. It is now up to the President to act on the Tariff Commissions findings. Almost 4 months have passed. I now urge the White House to act on this matter in the interests of equity. consistency. and maintaining confidence in the efficacy of our Government.",

By now my arguments in favor of this legislation have become wellknown. I only regret that we have not been able to move the bill quickly through Congress. The whole question of promotional fares has become controversial as of late and the Civil Aeronautics Board. I understand. has the entire matter under consideration. While I do not want to interfere with the CABs decision I want to state once again my belief that reduced fares for the elderly would have a positive effect on airline economies by raising load factors and airline revenues. Promotional fares in this instance would bring into the marketplace people who do not presently fly. The principal reason the elderly do not fly. of course. is the cost of this form of transportation. Seniors could make ready use of travel on offpeak hours. I believe there are many reasons why my bill should be passed. even in these turbulent times. Certainly it enjoys the unanimous support of senior citizen organizations and organized labor. It is noteworthy that several airlines have tried to institute such a reduced fare program for seniors and have been blocked in doing so by the CAB. At the same time International Airlines which recently cut rates dramatically enabling thousands of young people to travel abroad have now begun to take notice of the over65 market.

I feel that this proposal is worthy of our most serious consideration. The reserve components are a vital part of our national defense. It is in our national interest to maintain their high level of proficiency. The reserves will be making difficult and complex decisions concerning manpower problems in the near future. In recent years. with the compulsory draft. the reserve units have experienced little difficulty in maintaining their manpower levels. However. with the pending proposal for an allvolunteer army and the present draft quotas dropping. the reserve units will not be utilized as an alternative method for a young man to fulfill his military obligation. Furthermore. the reserve components have been extremely concerned with their difficulties in maintaining personnel on a longterm basis. Most individuals do not continue to serve after their 6 years of obligated service. The reserve units need to be able to retain these welltrained and experienced men if it is to continue to offer competent leadership. S. 2767 is one means of making the reserve components capable of attracting new recruits and retaining its present leadership. Furthermore. this system of optional retirement dates is a more equitable method of administering retirement benefits. It will not cost the taxpayer additional moneys.

It would establish a base entitlement for post secondary education for those of our Nations children who wish to pursue such a course and are capable of absorbing the education. It upgrades the post of Commissioner of Education to a challenging and stimulating one. establishes a new National Institution of Education and a National Foundation for Post Secondary Education. and simplifies the very complicated higher education legislation already on the books. The House has also passed a higher education bill which. while it emphasizes aid to institutions rather than to students. contains many of the same provisions that are in the Senate proposal. The House. because of obvious political exigencies. attached to the higher education bill. their version of the emergency school aid bill. which the Senate had passed soam 6 months ago as a separate bill. Attachment of the emergency school aid bill to S. 659 causes very real problems for the enactment of far more important higher education legislation. For again the issue of civil rights and elementary and secondary school desegregation have been injected into straightforward education legislation. And these concerns will cause even greater problems here in the Senate. I would plead with my colleagues to let educational measures rest on their own merits. As chairman of the Education Subcommittee. I see education legislation used time and time again for matters extraneous to their intent. This was the case with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of last year and may be the case with the higher education bill of this year. The primary thrust of S. 659 is to enlarge and improve higher education and make it available to more of our youngsters. It is not viewed as a vehicle for civil rights legislation.

In this particular case. it will have grave consequences to American interests in Latin America and throughout the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the supplemental appropriations bill under consideration today contains funds for many important domestic programs. One of the most important is the Neighborhood Youth Corps summer jobs program. The committee has recommended a $100 million supplemental for this project. The money is urgently needed. and I call on all my colleagues to support the committee recommendation. At present only $164 million is budgeted for the Neighborhood Youth Corps. This is $18.6 million less than last year. though at the present time teenage unemployment is averaging 18.8 percentabout three times the national average. The supplemental appropriation will go far toward relieving this situation. Although the U.S. Conference of Mayors recommends an appropriation of $308.6 million for the Neighborhood Youth Corps. I think that the $264 million which will be available upon passage of this bill is a good start toward an adequate summer jobs program. At the $164 million level. the program would provide 414.000 jobs. The supplemental. however. will provide about 200.000 additional vitally needed jobs for our youth during the coming vacation period. To point up the needs. one has but to look at the situation in my own State of Connecticut. Presently. only 3.814 summer job slots have been allocated to the entire State. A conservative estimate of the need is 10.000 jobsand this is a bare minimum. If the supplemental appropriation is accepted. Connecticut could receive an additional 1.800 positions. assuming the existing allocation formula is used. There would then be a total of roughly 5.600 jobs for some 10.000 applicants. I am sure the situation is similar in other urban areas. I -The magnitude of the problem is clear. Certainly a larger share of the Nations resources should be used to solve our pressing domestic problems. However. considering existing budgetary constraints. I think the committee has done a commendable job in marking up this bill. and should be fully supported.",

This assistance has been exceptionally helpful to Americas cities in developing sorely needed employment. educational. and recreational opportunities for our Nations disadvantaged youth. It is my firm belief that the dollar amount requested by the President to fund this program this year was woefully inadequate in light of the urgent summer recreation needs of our Nations cities. For this reason. Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend the members of the Appropriations Committee and the members of the Labor. HEW Appropriations Subcommittee in particular. for their decision to increase the appropriation for summer youth programs from a requested $64.3 million to a more meaningful $100 million. I am quite sure that this action will not go unnoticed by the many Americans who are truly concerned about the welfare of the underprivileged youth in our country.",

Treatment. and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. This act. when passed last year. was hailed in this body as a significant step forward in the fight against this terrible disease. It is totally inconsistent and. in fact. deceptive to not provide the funds to carry out this farreaching program. Like drug addiction. alcoholism has only lately been recognized as a medical problem. Up until recently the alcoholic was tossed in a cell for a period of time only to be returned to the streets to drink more alcohol and then land back in jail. During my 23 years on the New York police force. I recall many regulars at the stationhouses I worked in whose appearance on drunk charges was as regular as clockwork. This inandout pattern does little for the court and criminal justice system and absolutely nothing for the alcoholic. Alcoholics Anonymous made the first initial strides In rehabilitating the alcoholic. but their resources even today are limited and cannot begin to match the overwhelming proportions of the problem nationally. Congress has committed itself in word to the cure of alcoholism and the prevention of alcohol abuse. now is the time to translate those words into action. This amendment for $10 million would have been a definite step in that direction and it is disappointing that a majority of my colleagues did not see fit to support it.",

This recommendation is based on the 1972 budget amendment of $2.000.000 requested in House Document 9293 received on April 20. The $1.000.000 is made available until expended to be used principally for contracts and grants to qualified research organizations. Corn blight struck much of the cornproducing areas last summer and poses a serious threat to our basic feed supply and the cost of food to the consumer.

The House version of this legislation was approved as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the Senatepassed bill. Basically. the legislation agreed upon by the conferees follows the form of the House amendment. however a few revisions have been made which seem to be a reasonable compromise of the principal differences between the two versions. First. the conferees recommended that the language requiring the State lands to be donated be revised so that they can be acquired by either donation or exchange. Since the lands involved are State school sections which cannot be conveyed except by public sale. it was agreed that the Secretary should have the authority to acquire them by exchange if they are needed for the purposes of the monument. Second. there was a difference on the language involving grazing within the monument boundaries. The House language was restrictive in that It required all grazing to be phased out within 10 years. but the Senate language allowed this activity to continue for 30 years and left open the possibility for its further extension. The conference committee recommends fhat the Secretary be permitted to continue existing grazing uses for a period of 10 years. and for an additional 10year period. if he finds that this use is not incompatible with the purposes for which the monument was created. Third. there was a difference on the amount authorized to be appropriated. The Senate bill placed no ceiling on land acquisition appropriations. The House language on this point was adopted by the Conference Committee so that the bill. in this respect. is identical with the measure originally approved by the House. Mr. Speaker. there were a few other technical and minor differences which have been resolved. but which require no lengthy explanation. I feel that the compromise reached by the managers on the part of the House represents a reasonable solution of the differences and that the conference report should be adopted.

It is not a complex measure as bills go. it simply provides for an increase in the authorization ceiling for land acquisition at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in the States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The recreation area involved in this legislation was authorized by the Congress in 1965. At that time. it was agreed that the total area should include 47.675 acres of land adjacent to the area being set aside for the thenauthorized Tocks Island Dam project. It is an outstanding natural area which is within easy reach of the millions of people living near the Delaware River Valley. At the time of its authorization. it was estimated that all of the lands involved could be acquired for the amount authorized-$37.412.000. however. actual acquisition costs have far exceeded the original estimates. All of the authorized moneys have been appropriated and expended or obligated. but some 21.806 acres remain to be acquired. Mr. Speaker. the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area remains a good. sound outdoor recreation project. A tremendous investment has been made. but a viable administrative unit does not presently exist. because the land acquisition program has not been completed. The only question before the House at this time is whether or not we want to complete the work which we began when we authorized this recreation area in 1965. If we doand I think that we shouldthen this bill must be enacted and the earlier it is done the less it will ultimately cost the American people. Mr. Speaker. H. R. 13396 increases the authorization for land acquisition from $37.412.000 to $68.812.000. According to testimony before the Subcommittee on National Parks and Recreation presented by witnesses for the Department of the Interior. this amount should cover all of the remaining costs involved.

He knows how to set up committee meetings so that the best results can be obtained in the least amount of time. He is fair. providing an opportunity for all parties interested in a bill before his committee to be heard. He feels that the best and fairest bill is one that is refined through the filtering process of vigorous pro and con exchange. He is cordial. always displaying courtesy with witnesses who appear before the committee and always friendly with committee members. He is quick to give recognition to the fine work performed by committee staff members. and finds it easy to extend compliments for a job well done. Most important of all. he is a warm personality that has gained the admiration and affection of all those who associate with him. He has won respect not only because he has earned it. but because he has freely given it. EDDIE GARMATZ departure from the Congress will leave a great vacuum. As he leaves this legislative body in which he served so long and well. I sincerely wish that his harvest of contentment Is proportionate to the contribution he has made to his constituents. his committee. the House of Representatives. and his country.

One of our most precious fishery resources. the North Atlantic salmon is now the target of unthinking. unfeeling fishermen from foreign nations greatly more interested in immediate profits than in insuring the longrun survival of fine species of fish. The North Atlantic salmon is an economic necessity to commercial fishermen and a delight to sports fishermen and gourmets as well. The Congress has previously recognized the salmons importance by authorizing conservation programs to protect the fish when they ascend our streams to spawn. Unfortunately. however. these salmon spend most of their lives at sea. All conservation measures that protect them while they are in coastal and fresh waters are meaningless if. during the years they are at sea. they are ruthlessly harvested by greedy exploiters. In many cases. foreign fishermen are reflecting the policy of their own government against adherence to any semblance of sound and effective conservation procedures. Our natural resources would not last long if all nations ignored the need to act in the best interests of both the present and future generations. The United States. recognizing this problem. must establish its national policy to take whatever steps are required to insure that this vulnerable species is not desecrated further. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation that will permit U.S. sanctions against foreign nations who. in the judgment of the Secretary of Commerce. are failing to honor reasonable conservation practices in fishing for the North Atlantic salmon and are therefore causing severe harm to these fish. This legislation will close the vast American marketplace to the food and agricultural products of nations whose fishermen are permitted to disregard conservation practices in their fishing. Since we cannot take direct action to insure that these fish are protected on the high seas. we must take whatever effective steps are available. The bill makes it unlawful for anyone to bring into the United States the food and agricultural products of any nation certified by the Secretary of Commerce as endangering conservation programs for the North Atlantic salmon. A penalty of not more than $10.000 for the first offense and $25.000 for any subsequent offense is provided. It is important that the Congress act quickly on this issue. The damage is",

Two generations of American children have been born and cared for in hospitals which might not have existed without HillBurton support. Thus. as intended by the Congress.

To do everything practicable to make military service attractive in order to encourage enlistments and reenlistments. b. To fill the deficit by an equitable Selective Service system in being. 4.

We have in the United States of America five automobile manufacturers and last year they manufactured 6.550.203 automobiles and three of them manufactured 6.300.000 of those automobiles. We made less than 9.000 planes in all of America last year. but we used 20 manufacturers to do it. We are not short of airframe producers in America. We are short of aircraft engine producers in America. We have 20 companies making airframes while there are only two companies in the United States of America who make the big engines which we need to drive the planes. We have Pratt & Whitney and we have General Electric. So. what this bill does is it bails out another airframe manufacturer. of which we have a surplus coming out of our ears. It sends all of the money for the engines on the L1011 over to a competitor in England. We are not helping America where America is weak and that is the aircraft engine manufacturing process. We are helping America where we have a surplus and a capability coming out of our ears. Mr. Chairman. as to this particular amendment. what concerns me about it is what we are saying. We are saying we are going to save the biggest one. Well. if we have this surplus aircraft manufacturing capability which I see in America. if we save the big one today. the next to the biggest one is going to be in next year and then the smaller ones are going to be in the year after that. because what we are doing is preserving something for which there is not an adequate demand at the present time. What we are saying by this amendment is that we are favoring the very biggest and we are going to save it. but if you are anything less than that. we are going to let you go down the drain.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Congress is in the midst of debating whether to provide emergency loan guarantees for corporations on the skids. The focus and principal cause of the controversy is Lockheed Aircraft. a major producer of civilian and military airplanes. Lockheed officials contend that unless the company can borrow $250 million immediately. it will go bankrupt. But Lockheed is so widely known as a poor credit risk that no bank or consortium of banks will lend the money unless the Federal Government guarantees the loan. It is widely acknowledged by just about everyone in the business community--except Lockheed officialsthat bad management is the source of the companys troubles. Bankrolling Lockheed would amount to subsidizing sloppiness and rewarding inefficiency and waste in the private sector with public funds. The administration supports the measure because it does not want to see a major defense contractor go under. and because it wants to avoid the possibility of throwing 60.000 people out of work. If Lockheed declared bankruptcy. however. its creditors would probably take over management of the company rather than liquidating it. and a new and healthier enterprise might emerge. Regardless of the fate of this one company. however. the Government should not get into the business of subsidizing the mistakes of private corporations. If we wish to preserve even a vestige of the free enterprise system. which is the source of this Nations strength. we should insist that private businessmen take the consequences of their own errors without looking to Uncle Sam to bail them out. Entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks in order to make profits must also be willing to accept losses. Lockheeds managers certainly do not come to us asking to share their profitsin fact. this company has been one of the prime offenders in giant cost overrunsso why should we absorb their losses? The Lockheed proposition. moreover. could have limitless ramifications. Many big companies could argue that their continued prosperity affects the national interest. If we rescue Lockheed from the consequences of its own bad management. why not countless others? What incentive will faltering companies have to compete effectively in the marketplace if they can always fall back on Federal aid? The American taxpayer already bears far too many burdens to assume what is rightfully the responsibility of private enterprise.",

What I am trying to do here is to place this loan upon a parallel basis with the loan that is made under the SBA to small business. I addressed the House briefly earlier today on the rule and pointed out I had wrestled with this problem in my own conscience for the last several weeks trying to make up my mind whether it was to the interests of the country or not to have this loan made. I reluctantly came to the conclusion that it was to the best interests of the country. for the reasons that have already been adduced here this afternoon and which I do not have time to reiterate. I find it very difficult to understand how some of the people who call themselves \"liberals\" can oppose this bill when the people whom they are most interested in are the people who would be the greatest beneficiaries of this loanthe working people. But I come back to the proposition and reiterate what I said earlier. that I do not believe big business within itself is bad business. I believe under our system of government little business and big business should be treated alike. Under the SBAI believe it is section 7 of that billthe Government guarantees 90 percent of the loan and the bank guarantees 10 percent. So what this amendment would do. in just a word. is to say that in addition to the liabilitiesand I recognize thatwhich the banks already have. of some $400 million. because of the great stake they have In the Government coming to their rescue here. they ought to be willing to participate for an additional 10 percentof the risks involved in this new loan. That is all there is to it. I have not counted any heads around here. and I do not know what chances you have of passing this bill or what chance you have of losing it. but I say it would make it much more palatable to a lot of us who have had trouble making up our minds if this amendment were adopted.",

I think one of the points that ought to be made here is that they have a rather curious arrangement under the present loans of $400 million. and I assume the requirement of 20 percent being maintained in the lending institutions as compensating balances will continue for this added $250 million. Now. they have the use of about $80 million as compensating balances under their present $400 million of loans. They are going to be placed in a more favorable position with this new $650 million package. I might point out that not the Government of the United States. but these lending institutions which are going to subordinate their loans are going to be placed in a more favorable position because of this. because the Government of the United States is doing 90- to 95percent of the business with Lockheed. and in the event of bankruptcy. under the situation existing at this moment. has a prior claim over all the creditors.

I use the description carefully. alarmists who characterize every major problem as a crisis fool us into believing that we can treat all such problems equally. that one is no more important than the other. But the crisis in welfare is real and is so out of control that the number of welfare recipients in the United States has doubled from 7.2 million in 1961 to about 14.4 million today. During 1970 alone. welfare recipients grew by 2.3 million. Another 26 million Americans receive social security benefits. Welfare. including our social security system. isafter the general state of our economy and international securitythe most pervasive and important influence on our pocketbooks. on our morale. and on the future of our Nation as a strong. independent Union. But every crisis has both a challenge and an opportunity. Our challenge is: To support all of the truly needy throughout our Nation adequately while equitably distributing the financial burden for that support. To encourage the work system and family system by providing strict requirements and strong incentives which are fairly and uniformly enforced. To separate those who are potentially selfdependent from the truly needy and restrict direct public payments only to the truly needy. Our opportunity is: To take advantage of the general public support for welfare reform which now Is widespread throughout the Nation. To build on the good features of reform measures already proposed. I offer today an alternative to welfare reform which responds directly to our threefold challenge by combining new ideas with the best features of reform plans already under consideration. In support of my bill. today I want to: Define the nature of the welfare crisis so that we can react intelligently to its causes and characteristics. Discuss the history of major welfare programs. Outline recent major reform proposals and their responses to each of the causes and characteristics of the current welfare crisis. Offer an alternative plan which builds on the good features of some recent proposals and sets forth ways to respond positively to the causes and characteristics of the welfare crisis which are not adequately treated by the other major reform proposals.

    "speech": "Before the major economic dislocations suffered by the United States during the 1930s. care of the needy was solely the responsibility of State and local governments. Widely varying customs and social attitudes of local communities toward relief and its recipients. and differing fiscal capacities and administrative organizations. created multiple systems of State and local welfare programs. The absence at that time of widespread rapid communications and transportation systems which we regard as so common today meant that people were much less mobile and that their general standards of living conformed more to local economic conditions than to national expectations. But the 1930s changed our lives. A national economic depression affected everyone. The multiple State and local relief systems were unable to provide fol the costs of relief on the massive scale required during the 1930s. At the same time. farms were closing down and people were moving to the cities. Increased mobility meant that local standards no longer were satisfactory. The financial resources of the cities. already as strained as individual finances. became even more burdened by the inmigration of increasing numbers of jobless citizens. Previous methods no longer were adequate. A new system was needed to alleviate the risks of old age. unemployment. death. and certain types of disabilities. The Social Security Act. passed in 1935. sought to meet these new needs. Under the oldage and survivors insurance and unemployment insurance titles of the Social Security Act. the Federal Government provided certain social insurance benefits. financed through payroll taxes and available in cases where a loss of earnings could be assumed to indicate a need for public income maintenance payments. An excerpt from \"Social Security Programs in the United States.\" published in 1968 by the Social Security Administration. outlines the development of Federal assistance programs up to and since the Social Security Act of 1935.

I regret that the heavy voting schedule here in the Senate made it Impossible for me to accept an invitation to address the convention. The Kansas Farm Bureau. of course. is an outstanding organization and their annual meeting constitutes an important and impressive gathering of Kansas farmers. I particularly regret not being able to be with the Kansas Farm Bureau members on Tuesday evening. but at that time the Senate was debating my rural job development tax credit amendment. The Farm Bureau members were meeting to pay tribute to Clarence Rupp who is retiring after serving 25 years as director of research for the Kansas Farm Bureau. I do not suppose there is anyone in the State of Kansas who knows more about Kansas agriculture and the Kansas State egislative process. I. personally. have known Clarence for a good number of years. He is a most unusual man. a man of great integrity and conviction. And he has served the Kansas agriculture community over these many years with great distinction. His active service on behalf of Kansas agriculture will be sorely missed. I would have preferred to have been on hand to personally salute Clarence Rupp. but I want to take this opportunity to do so now from the Senate floor. and also bring Clarence Rupps outstanding record of contributions to the attention of my colleagues.",

The Senators lucid analysis comes at a time when our relations with Japan have plummeted to the lowest point in at least a decade. In rapid succession the United States confronted the Japanese first with an abrupt and spectacular change in its policy toward mainland China and then with an abrupt shift in international economic policy. These actions have been taken in apparent disregard of their disruptive effects on Japan andother allies. Mr. President. we cannot have it both ways. If we want other nations to share our global responsibilities. we cannot treat them as poor cousins whose needs and views have no effect on the formulation of our policy. I hope that the administration will heed Senator HUMPHREYS wise counsel before more damage is done. and I ask unanimous consent that his article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on November 8. I was privileged to be in Bartow. Fla.. to Join with the family and friends of Spessard Holland in a final tribute to Floridas great Senator. The simple dignity of .that ceremony was a reflection of the man himself. And all of us there were moved by the honor the people of Florida chose to bestow on their distinguished elder statesman. Spessard Hollands life began in a small Florida community. but the impact. of what he did was felt all across America.. As someone who served with him for 18 years In the Senate. I knew him as a truly unique man. He was a scholar who received the highest honors of his university. and his scholarship was reflected in the broad historical perspective he brought to major public issues. He was a courageous soldier who received the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I. and his courage was reflected in his determination to defend the principles he knew to be right. He was a brilliant lawyer. and his legal craftsmanship was reflected in the farreaching statutes he helped write. And because he was all these things. the people of Florida chose him as a prosecuting attorney. a county judge and as a State senatorand then as their Governor and U.S. Senator. I remember how he envisioned a greater United States by being an early supporter of statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. I remember how he fought to extend the franchise to all Americans. so that the 24th amendment to our Constitution became a monument to his perseverance in a cause he knew to be right. So Spessard Holland combined the virtues of a scholar. a soldier. and a statesman. and made himself one of the most respected U.S. Senators of our time. He never tried to be one of the loudest voicesbut his voice was heard simply because it was a voice of knowledge. of understanding. of reason. When he spoke in the Senate. his colleagues listened. And we all profited. personally and collectively. from his thoughtful counsel. Spessard Holland created a tradition of excellence in Florida politics. That is his legacy to the people of his State. This tradition will live on. I am sure. as people remember Spessard Holland with admiration and respect and gratitude for his service to his State and his country.",

The necessity of meeting these problems head on. with bold and corrective solutions. can hardly be overstated. for the condition and health of tomorrows cities. environment. and population depend almost entirely upon the action which we take today. For too long. remedial and halfhearted measures have sufficed in dealing with the growing problems of our cities and urban development. The creation of new cities. with a major emphasis on unity of design. integration of functions. and anticipation for the future. offers a significant opportunity for understanding and reversing the problems of urban development. I am proud to say that the State of Minnesota has taken a bold initiative in analyzing and implementing models of new city development. The idea of the experimental city originated at the University of Minnesota in the mid1960s. and this year the Minnesota State Legislature created and funded an Experimental City Authority. The experiment is presently entering its second phase. concerned with the elaboration of its planning framework and the design of a planning process to permit implementation. On September 23. 1971. Otto A. Silha. publisher of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune. spoke before the National Board of Directors meeting of the American Institute of Architects. Mr. Silha. who is also presently serving as chairman of the Minnesota Experimental City project. spoke of Minnesotas experimental city and its role in the Nations future urban development.

House Resolution 930 provides an open rule with 1 hour of general debate for the consideration of H.R. 13034 authorizing appropriations for the Fire Research and Safety Act and the Standard Reference Data Act. In addition to authorizing appropriations to carry out the purposes of those acts. the bill amends the Organic Act of the Bureau of Standards. The National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control. recently appointed by the President. was established by the Fire Research and Safety Act to make a study and investigation of the causes of fire and to make recommendations thereon. None of the funds authorized by H.R. 13034 are to be used by the Commission. The standard reference data system within the Department of Commerce. which is administered by the Bureau of Standards. collects. compiles. evaluates. publishes. and disseminates information to be made available to scientists. engineers. and the general public. The authorization is a continuing one with no specific amounts set forth. The funds requested for the purposes of the Fire and Research Safety Act for fiscal year 1973 are $4.928.000. Funds requested for the Standard Reference Data Act for fiscal year 1973 are $2.795.000.

I would also like to praise my distinguished colleague from Georgia on his remarks and on his exhaustive efforts as chairman of the Subcommittee on Science. Research. and Development. This legislation was unanimously reported by the Science and Astronautics Committee. It is my firm belief that the Fire Research and Safety Act represents a vehicle by which it is possible to greatly reduce the loss of human life and the destruction of property resulting from fire. It is estimated that each year 12.000 American citizens perish and over $2 billion of property is damaged or destroyed due to fire. The funds approved by the committee will enable the National Bureau of Standards to initiate fire research in areas not currently being carried out by private organizations or governmental agencies. Presently. the vast majority of fire research is either product or mission oriented. Not enough attention has been directed to basic research in the area of fire prevention. It is the design of this bill to remedy this inadequacy. The standard reference data program is one of the National Bureau of Standards most refined projects. Specifically. this program is one that makes critically evaluated reference data available to the scientists. engineers. and the general public. The acceleration of scientific technology in the past decade together with the anticipated achievements in the future highlights the need for the continuation of this program. The standard reference data system functions and will continue to function to keep this voluminous output manageable. Mr. Chairman. I impress upon my colleagues the vital services provided by both of these programs and ask that they give their full support to the bill before US. Mr. Chairman.

This legislation has enormous potential for improving our defenses against the ravages of fire. through funding of research and other fire prevention activities by the National Bureau of Standards. I rise at this point so that the record April 25. .1972 will show the concern that exists in many quarters over our failure thus far to standardize the threads and couplings used in fire hoses. A major conflagration at best is an unpleasant affair. when firefighting equipment cannot be used because it will not fit together. the results can be tragic. Robert Ely. a veteran official of the San Diego Fire Department. has labored tirelessly for standardization of this gear. even to the point of designing a special power thread cutting machine that permits homogenizing of threads without removing couplings from the hose. But Bob Ely. who has also served for the past 13 years as chairman of the committee on standardization of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. cannot achieve this necessary uniformity of equipment by himself. Unfortunately. when he has turned to government agencies for help. he has usually been told that while his goals are laudable. there is not enough money on hand to achieve them. H.R. 13034 should make a difference. in this regard. I am encouraged by the estimate of the Committee on Science and Astronautics that $4.9 million should be made available for the fire research and safety program. under the Bureau of Standards. over each of the next 5 years. Chief Elys power tools for standardizing firehose threads can be reproducedbut at a cost. of course. Already these machines have been successfully employed in California. Alaska. Washington and by the U.S. Forest Service. Could not the funds which H.R. 13034 authorizes be used to help facilitate the distribution of these tools wherever they are needed in the United States? At this point. Mr. Chairman. I include the text of a recent letter by Mr. Ely to President Nixon. summarizing the need for standardization.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the environmental concern of our friend and colleague. the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin has been translated into many thoughtful and prescient legislative initiatives during the 8 years he has been in the U.S. Senate. In the case of controlling detergent pollution. Senator NELSONs awareness of the problem and efforts to develop a coordinated. comprehensive program to provide safe nonpolluting detergent ingredients stems from his experiences and Governor of Wisconsin. In his first year as a Senator. in 1963. Senator NELSON joined me and four other Senator in the 88th Congress in sponsoring S. 1183. the first legislative proposal in this body which focused on the national problem of detergent pollution. In each of the succeeding four Congresses. as this issue has persisted unresolved and unabated. the Senator from Wisconsin has responded legislatively and enunciated a Federal program to bring an orderly institutional response to the ongoing question of detergents. environment. and health. Last week Senator NELSON testified before the Commerce Committees Environmental Subcommittee on the persistent problem of detergent pollution. In his testimony. Senator NELSON concluded: It is time that we take the experimentation on the safety and environmental impact of detergents out of the marketplace and put it in the laboratory. The Wisconsin Senator went on to articulate a \"First Time Safe\" philosophy for all detergents sold in this country. This \"First Time Safe\" concept for detergents would be specifically implemented by a Federal detergent program containing these three elements: First. a limitation for the present time on phosphate content in detergents with a clear mandate for their eventual total removal. second. establishment of test protocols. standards. and regulations for all detergent ingredients. and third. an intensified Federal program for the development of substitutes for phosphates in detergents which are safe to health and will not harm the environment. This program would in no way diminish efforts to institute the control of all nutrients at the municipal treatment stage. but would complement it. Mr. President. so that the Senator from Wisconsins long experience with this issue and his suggestion on how to legislatively implement a reasonable detergent pollution control program can be brought to the attention of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that his tesimony of October 15. 1971. be printed in the RECORD.",

I am fearful that the haphazard manner in which we are approaching this problem could produce that disastrous result. As I advocated last week. I think it would behoove us to pass a continuing resolution to fund our foreign aid program at the fiscal 1971 levels to provide us with the necessary time to come up with a restructuring of this program which would be the outgrowth of our best thinking. In this mornings Washington Post. an editorial entitled \"Foreign Aid Reform\" scored a legitimate point thatThe case for slowing down the paceby putting off big reforms and simply passing a resolution continuing the program near current levels for. say. three or four monthstherefore becomes very strong. John Hannah. Administrator of the Agency for International Development. also had some very pertinent comments in his article appearing in the same edition of the Post. Hannah builds a very rational case warning of the dangers inherent in recommendations already arrived at by the Foreign Relations Committee. Here again. the haphazard manner in which we are attempting to achieve foreign aid reform has certainly been detrimental to the development of a truly workable and realistic program.

Instead. they said. they would deliver to management offices. to central receptacles. and to centralized clusters with a minimum of 20 users at all newly developed mobile home parks. I was concerned that this policy discriminated against people who have chosen mobile homes as an alternative to highcost permanent dwellings and who want to live in individual housing. Lowcost. comfortable. and decent housing continues to be in major shortage in our country. Mobile homes are playing a larger and larger role in the solution to this problem. In several letters to Postmaster General Winton Blount. I wrote that the type of new mobile homes found in California in no way fits the description of \"concentrated housing areasthe rationale behind the Post Office action. In meetings between post officials and members of my staff. I urged that the Post Office reconsider this policy. I am pleased to announce that the Postmaster Generals office today advised me that a policy change has at last been made. Under the new regulations each local postmaster will have the authority to choose among four alternative plans for mobile home park mail delivery in his area. The plans are: Delivery to the management offices. Delivery to central receptacles such as those found in apartment buildings. Delivery to cluster boxes of two or more. Curbside delivery to each mobile home with the boxes placed between every two mobile homes on a shared pillar. I commend and thank the U.S. Postal Service for the flexibility and fairness they have displayed in this matter. At the same time. I urge residents. management. and developers of new mobile home parks to contact their local postmasters requesting that the fourth alternative of curbside delivery to each residence be implemented in their mobile home parks.",

The Congress said that this was a new field for legislation. The power could not have been taken from the States because it was never there to begin with. The same point holds true with the Genocide Convention. The treaty creates a new field for legislation. and it defines a new crime. Therefore it does not take from the power of the States. The several States still retain their powers with respect to the crime of homicide. Nothing is proposed which would infringe on that power.

I have taken the occasion to discuss this with the distinguished Senator from Maryland who sponsored the primary resolution on the calendar. As this is a question of timing. and the provision in the bill refers to repeal of the resolution after the adjournment of the first session of Congress. I see no reason. if we are going to put it off. not to make it the effective date of the bill and why we cannot do so until June 30 or some period into next year where the President could call upon Congress. because Congress will be in session. if anything occurs.

I merely wish to say that this morning the Senator from New Hampshire consulted the Parliamentarian and was advised. under the unanimousconsent agreement. that any amendments had to be offered to the second supplemental appropriation bill before 3 oclock this afternoon or they would be barred. Because of that. I advised the Senator from New York to call up his amendment. because I knew that he had one. and he offered It and then. under unanimous consent. I got agreement to offer my amendment to his amendment. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate in that regard. I merely want to make It clear that the Senator from New Hampshire finds himself representing not only the minority of the Appropriations Committee but also the minority of the Senate. due to the absence of the distinguished minority leader and the distinguished assistant minority leader and. under those circumstances. would not wish to take the responsibility of expressing the agreement of the minority. But it has to be settled. It is inconceivable to me that. under any circumstances. the Senate would deprive any Senator who is absent from the privilege of offering an amendment to a bill. even though the unanimousconsent agreement did not specifically provide therefor. I can foresee that a Senator could be offering several amendments and there could be requests for 2 minutes on each side to explain the amendments. So far as I am concerned. I would not object even to that. if it were requested to offer those amendments. As we know. without the opportunity to explain an amendment. that is a blind way to legislate. So far as the unanimousconsent request is concerned. namely. that any Senator can offer amendments to the second supplemental appropriation bill on Wednesday night. after the other votes. without the opportunity to explain them. unless the Senate sees fit to grant them that opportunity by unanimous consent. that seems to me to be eminently fair and I therefore am going to take the liberty of agreeing to it.",

Thus. we should not rule out the right of Senators to offer amendments in this instance. I understand that the senior Senator from Massachusetts wants to offer an amendment on Wednesday. We do not want to preclude him or other Senators from the right to the opportunity to offer an amendment. but such a Senator would notunder the agreementhave time to debate it. This agreement. may I say to the Senator from Mississippi. has reference only to Wednesday.

Increased urbanization as well as the economic and social complexities of contemporary society have swelled court workloads to such an extent that few States and cities have escaped the resultant adverse consequences. More than 30 years ago. Roscoe Pound indicated his concern with this trend when he observed that an appellate judge in the 1920s was faced with a workload five times as great as that of his counterpart a hundred years before. In 1971. the problem of congestion and delay in our court systems has become far more widespread and acute. Our society has placed an everheavier responsibility on the courts for aiding in solving the vital problems of our day. and yet the judicial system throughout the Nation is encumbered in fulfilling this increased responsibility by insufficient manpower. faulty facilities and poorly organized court structures. As a result. the quality of American justice has been strained. This situation calls for immediate attention. Procedural reform. structural reorganization and additional personnel are common needs of the Judiciary throughout the country. The status of the judicial system of my own city of Philadelphia is no less acute than that generally existing. An article treating this vital problem in terms of the need for additional judicial manpower for Philadelphia. recently appeared In the Shingle. the monthly publication of the Philadelphia Bar Association. Feeling that this excellent study. \"Requirements on Additional Judges for the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.\" would be of interest and benefit to my colleagues.

If this is ever done we will have no one to blame but ourselves. as we have no one to blame but ourselves for Senate dilution and diminution of power which we have handed over voluntarily to the executive branch since the early days of the Roosevelt administration. If this ever becomes a law the next best thing to do would be to abolish Congress entirely because all the power would be down there and we would be contravening the constitutional power of appropriation which is the strongest weapon this Government has. and which the Constitution provides rests in the hands of Congress and specifically in the hands of the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I believe It is profoundly wrong to children and concerned parents across America to twist complex and serious problems of education in our Nation Into slogans and emotional appeals offering the deception of simple answers to the difficult auestlon of schoolbusing. The people of America expect their elected leaders and representatives to. in fact. demonstrate the conscience and hard thinking demanded of leadership in addressing these vital issues. rather than pander to public opinion of the moment. The real concern of our people is that all of our children be guaranteed the opportunity to obtain a quality education. School busing. where properly intended to provide this opportunity to millions of children who have suffered under racial and economic segregation. addresses this concern only in part. For other millions of children. this opportunity has been increasingly threatened by tlghtqning school budgets in countless communities where traditional revenue collection measures have reached the saturation point in the face of rising public service costs. The provision of the best possible education for all our children constitutes an absolutely essential national resource. It is for the protection and strengthening of this national resource that the people of America are now calling the President and Congress to account. I wish to undertake this accounting now. first. by clarifying the problem of schoolbusing to identify the real issues at stake in the Federal Governments response. and second. by proposing a legislative program of action by this Congress to provide critical Federal financial relief and incentives to our States and communities endeavoring to define and establish equal opportunity to quality education for all our children.",

I have made that assessment myself: Those who are blocking a vote on a legislative remedy in this session may well rue the day. because I foresee that. as this threat and reality of busing spreads throughout the country. in the next session of Congress there will be an overwhelming demand not for legislative remedies but for a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately. and I say unfortunately because it is unfortunate. people are losing faith in the courtsat least insofar as this particular issue is concerned. The Broomfield amendment was passed and the courts. through use of semantic differences. ignored the intent of Congress. even though it was very clearly stated in both Houses of Congress. and even though I am the sponsor of a constitutional amendment I have said on other occasions I would much rather deal with this problem legislatively. I do not want to clutter up the Constitution with additional amendments. But if we are going to be extended to the point that it will be necessary to get a twothirds vote in order to have a vote on the merits of a legislative proposal. which is the situation we are in. we might just as well adopt the constitutional amendment. which is a surefire way to deal with It. and then we do not have to be concerned about whether the court is going to hold it to be constitutional. I agree with the Senator from Georgia. I think that in the next session of Congress there will be even more Senators. as a result of the election. who will want to do something about this problem. and they will want to do something that is effective. If we are going to be required to marshal and muster a twothirds vote. we are very likely to have a constitutional amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the late Dag Hammerskjold stated: Among all the achievements of the past century. including those discoveries and developments that have transformed the lives of men. and altered the very meaning of time and space. It may be doubted whether any is so profoundly significant and in the long run beneficial as the emancipation of women. Progress can occur only if women consciously and constructively share in the making of effective decisions. No one can deny the positive contribution women have made to the political. social. economic. and religious life of our Nation. The Convention on the Political Rights of Women is primarily concerned with political rights such as suffrage -and the right to hold public office. It will insure to women those political rights men have held for years. The United States. as we all well know. granted women suffrage in 1920. Yet we have failed. to ratify a Human Rights Convenant of the United Nations which hopes to guarantee on an international scale what we. and most other countries. have guaranteed domestically. In failing to become a party to the Convention on the Political Rights of Women. our moral posture abroad is weakened with regard to the political status of women. Recently. an editorial published in the Washington Post discussed the recent vote in the principality of Liechtenstein defeating a womens suffrage amendment. For the proponents of womens political rights. this was a step backward. Unfortunately. the United States cannot feel superior to Liechtenstein in this respect precisely because of our failure to ratify the Convention on the Political Rights of Women. The matter of womens political rights is not a subject we can simply dismiss as a domestic matter. What happens in Liechtenstein. though perhaps not as important as what happens in Moscow or London. certainly should concern us. If our pledge to uphold the Charter of the United Nations means anything. we must be concerned with the status of human rights abroad. as well as in our own Nation. The political rights of women are an international concern. If we are to succeed in bringing about changes in the domestic affairs of nations. I can see no better method than by ratifying and adopting the Human Rights Convenants including the Convention on the Political Rights of Women.

As executive director of the National Urban League. he made a unique contribution to American leadership in difficult times. He has been taken away before his time. but the millions who loved and respected him can be consoled by the knowledge that he lived his allotted years with a singular grace and dignity. Whitney Youngs distinction derived in part from his ability to make distinctions. He was clearheaded in an age of muddled thinking about effective political action. Whitney Young always distinguished between moral exhibitionism and real moral concern. He distinguished between rhetoric and a real revolution in living conditions. He distinguished between political posturing and real political achievement. Most important. Whitney Young distinguished between the chimeric promise of vague revolutionary fevers. and the real promise inherent in the American Nations responsiveness to determined pressure on behalf of a just cause. Whitney Young had an enormous talent for practical action in the politics of our pluralistic republic. He mastered the art of getting things done. The black community benefited frolh this directly. and the rest of the American community benefited almost as directly because all Americans benefit from an expansion of .justice.\" Whitney Youiig Understood. that the most solid. substantial hope for the improvement of the condition of American blacks lay in the opportunities offered by the openness of the American political system. By making that system work on behalf of the millions he represented. Whitney Young rendered his greatest service. He demonstrated the efficacy Of determined resourceful leadership. His life stands as a living reproach to all those who despair of effecting intelligent change in a civilized manner. And his life stands as an inspiration to all Americans who know that there is no conflict between the traditions of civility and the need for dynamic and progressive leadership.

I understand that among -the over 60 million tons of dredge spoils. sludge. solid waste. chemicals. and radioactive materials that are dumped into the odean every year. are more than 800 tons of arsenic. one of the most dangerous substances known to man. Arsenic. either as an element or in one of its various compounds. has definitely been shown to be toxic to marine organisms in most levels of the aquatic food chain. Yet every month for at least 2 years. .an Italian vessel carrying several hundred canisters of arsenic has embarked from Philadelphia. trakeled down the Delaware River. and emptied its cargo into the coastal waters just off the New .Jersey shoreline. The exact distance is not known. since the U.S. Coast Guard. which alerted the administration to the latest dumping. is reportedly skeptical as to how far out in the ocean the deadly cargo is being alhinped. What is even more alarming than the fact that this arsenic is being discarded by a chemical company in an apparently unsafe fashion is the report that the Presidents Council on Environmcntal Quality is helpless to prevent these dumpings. including the one scheduled for this Saturday. Dr. Gordon McDonald o. the President. Council has rcportedly said that only congressional action can stop it. . Mr. President. I have already initiated an attempt to halt this continued dumping.

This is one area of doubt that we should quickly act to eliminate.

Mr. President. and that fact is simply this: Mr. Nixon inherited a whitehot inflationary economy and. without thrusting the country into the depths of depression. has succeeded in cooling It off to a degree. The benefits to Americas housing industry alone are immense. Said the Associated Press: The continuing slide. was expected to result in a further lowering of interest charges on home mortgages and personal loans. This is good news to all Americans. It means that commitment to a game plan. meticulously drawn up and carefully executed. brings concrete results. And to slow a runaway economy without falling into depression while at the same time converting the entire Nation from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. is nothing short of miraculous. A number of other major banks followed Chase Manhattans lead and reduced their prime rates. most to 512 percent. New York banks.that trimmed their prime rate to 51/2 percent included Manufacturers Hanover. Chemical. and Irving Trust.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the many problems as a result of living in rural Alaska is the difficult and hazardous transportation situation. Because so many villages are in remote and isolated areas of the State. the only means of transportation is by air. As you can well imagine. the severe weather conditions as well as the scarcity of airport safety controls makes flying throughout the State relatively dangerous. In many areas in Alaska. airports are not equipped with sufficient lighting and service facilities to insure efficient and safe carrier service. Often an emergency might arise requiring people or an individual to be evacuated immediately. Since situations may occur which require a landing or a takeoff at night and airport facilities do not include equipment to make the arrival or departure safe. provisions should be made for securing nighttime landing equipment. The Village Council of Quanhagak on the Kuskokwim River has forwarded to me a resolution that requests runway lights be installed at the earliest possible date. I have traveled to Quanhagak many times. and I know of the severe needs of the area. I am including a copy of the resolution which I am sure my colleagues will find most informative:",

It is clear that this is not the case in todays job market. nor is it likely to be the case in the future. With such factors as the rapid changes in industrial technology. the increasing complexity of international trade. and the impact of changes in government spending. it is likely that persons finishing school today will have to pursue more than one career during their lifetime. As the job market changes. the person may have to periodically intersperse his working years with periods of further education and skill acquisition. Obviously. what we are talking about is the expanded concept of career education. One of the foremost proponents of career education is Dr. Sidney P. Marland. Jr.. the distinguished U.S. Commissioner of Education. In a particularly forceful address on this subject recently in Pittsburgh. Dr. Marland pointed out that schools are now being asked to perform much more challenging functions. Parents and other taxpayers are assuming. quite justifiably. that their schools provide their students not only with selfconfidence. love of learning. and social awareness. but selfsustaining career skills that will enable almost all young people to become economically selfsufficient participants in our system. I highly recommend Dr. Marlands speech to my colleagues and to all persons concerned with the responsiveness of education to the needs of the future:",

I fully and enthusiastically support the continuation of Federal assistance for day care centers to assist working mothers and to respond to other proven needs of many lowincome families. I have made many personal visits to the federally financed day care centers. in my district and have been impressed by the quality of service and the outstanding work of so many of those teachers and aides working in this vital field. I support appropriate growth of day care centers to render service in cases of need. but this growth must follow responsible procedures. We can ruin the program or seriously cripple its proper growth and public image if we flood it beyond its capacity or present public acceptance. if .we improperly invade the home. or if we deliver the service in an inefficient and inappropriate manner. For that reason I believe it was proper for the President to request the Congress to pass a better bill than the one we recently acted upon and which I voted against. Meanwhile. present day care centers will continue to operate under Federal appropriations. The Presidents veto of the bill has been alternately praised and damned by newspapers across the country. usually according to a pattern of whether the newspaper was conservative or liberal. The Salt Lake Tribune does not fall into either category. The Tribune is essentially objective with a healthy respect for facts and evidence. I therefore believe the Tribunes editorial of December 11 is significant to our evaluation of legislation pertaining to day care centers. The editorial follows: [From the Salt Lake Tribune.

These addicts pay over $400 million each year for the right to shoot this drug into their bloodstream. They pay to be slowly alienated from and outlawed from society. The cost of heroin is not restricted to terms of human suffering for the addict and his loved ones. It reaches out and touches each one of us no matter how remote or distant. Crimes which are caused or related to the need to purchase drugs cost our society as much as $33/2 billion annually. Mr. Speaker. these growing figures demonstrate Conclusively that heroin addiction is truly a problem of national dimensions. President Nixon recognized this only last June when he declared this situation to be a national emergency. I share these sentiments and therefore stand to introduce today legislation to promote research and development of a cure for addiction to heroin. This bill would allocate $50 million toward this goal. By way of contrast. Mr. Speaker. let me point out that at present a mere $2 million is being spent by the Federal Government toward this end.

For those who. like myself. have stood on both the Heights of Golan and on the farmlands below. it is painfully obvious that the pre1967 border cannot be tolerated there. Anyone who has looked at the map and noted that the Straits of Tiran at Sharm el Sheikh are only a few hundred yards wide. knows instantly that geographical guarantees are needed to keep this vital seaway life line open. International guarantees have provided no security in the past. Tiran and Golan are the most obvious examples of the difficulties involved In returning to old borders. Jerusalem is another example. Those borders invited a continuous. systematic program of violence and terrorism against the people of Israel. actually carried out by guerrillas. but encouraged. protected and financed by Israels Arab neighbors. Part of the difficulties in achieving a complete Middle East settlement is that negotiations are being conducted through a third party. Mr. Jarring of the United Nations. I have asked for facetoface negotiations for over a year. Until U.S. policy recognizes this fact. progress will be painfully slow.

Fortunately. Embassy employees intervened to save the doctor from the clutches of the Soviets. but his wife and their two young daughters aged 5 and 9 were dragged away screaming by the Russian policemen. Incidents like this are a grim reminder of what life under Communist rule is like. a grim reminder of the fact that the personal freedoms and liberties we enjoy and sometimes take so lightly are beyond the reach of millions of less fortunate human beings. Mr. Speaker. I have sent a letter of protest to the Russian Ambassador to the United States. According to the explicit terms of the Consular Convention and Protocol of 1968 which we entered into with Russia. the Embassy grounds of each country are inviolate. Accordingly. the Russian police clearly had no authority to enter our Embassy grounds uninvited and violently drag away Dr. Nikitenkovs wife and children.

They are two distinct matters. both of which should have been voted on separately according to their respective merits. I think that the attachment of nongermaine items is an objectionable and unfair practice. it only serves to tie the hands of the Members of this body. Because of such tactics. for example. Members could not offer opposition to the debt ceiling bill without opposing the much needed increases for social security recipients. In the future.

In 1965 when the House passed H.R. 416. minimal funds were set aside enabling each Member to employ one summer intern. I took advantage of this opportunity last summer and found the summer internship program a welcome addition to my office. My only regret was that more adequate funds were unavailable to offer this opportunity to the many other young people interested in participating in the congressional process and learning how the Government operates. I am sure that other colleagues have found congressional interns as helpful as I have. Interns have supplemented regular staff and in many cases provided muchneeded manpower. Most importantly. spending productive time in Washington affords a young person an opportunity to learn about his Government firsthand. It has been widely publicized that many young people are disenchanted with this Government and regard it with some distrust. In view of this I think it is a very good thing to allow some of our young people to work within the Government and to learn about the process through individual participation. Our young people need adequate funding support if any viable internship opportunity is to be offered. I therefore propose extending the minimal funding for interns to cover an additional two summer interns. The total additional appropriation would be small and well worth the ensuing advantages to both the interns and to the congressional office.",

H.R. 16724. as set forth in House Report 921502. states the findings of the Congress and its purposes for meeting the present transportation emergency in the Washington National Capital Area. embracing the District of Columbia and adjacent parts of the States of Maryland and Virginia. To achieve the implementation of the stated purposes. the bill. as amended. provides for the enactment of amendments (already approved by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia) to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact (D.C. Code. Title I. Sec. 1431. et seq.) which authorize the acquisition of local bus companies by use of condemnation powers. if necessary. Additionally. the bill provides a procedure of funding the acquisition costs. for a temporary period. thus permitting each of the three compact jurisdictions a reasonable time to raise their respective shares of the matching funds to match the Federal grants. Finally. the Comptroller General of the United States is to exercise a comprehensive audit function in connection with the acquisition proceedings by the Transit Authority and a continuing audit of the Transit Authority. Because of the duties of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Transportation relating to the Federal guarantee of bonds to be issued by the Transit Authority and the approval of grants under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. it is expected that these Departments will exercise their statutory authority as may best serve the interests of the local jurisdictions and the nation. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is designated as the local public body for the receipt of grants toward the acquisition costs. The bus companies to be acquired are the D.C. Transit System Inc.. the Washington. Virginia and Maryland Coach Co.: the Alexandria. Barcroft and Washington Transit Co.. and the WMA Transit Co. The Transit Authority will merge the facilities of these four companies and rearrange routes to establish a more efficient operation and a more suitable service to the public within the National Capital Area.",

As a member of the State legislature in Annapolis I had the privilege of helping to draft the original amendments providing for Marylands role as a signator to the Interstate Compact establishing the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority. This is another milestone for WMATA in that it will be enabled to tie Metro facilities together and guarantee that the citizens of the metropolitan area are going to have the type of bus transportation to which they are entitled. The committee has made a careful and conscientious effort in considering and amending H.R. 16724 to protect the public interest. and now at this juncture the public interest and the citizens of the metropolitan area are best served by passage rather than any delay. In particular. I commend Mr. CABELL. chairman. for his great job on this bill. Bus service in this area has simply not provided residents with the quality of transportation so urgently needed. As a matter of fact it is deteriorating. But. of immediate and very real concern is the fact that. without this legislation. it is a very real possibility that area residents will be facing a total collapse of bus servicethe only form of public transportation currently available. I would hope that this measure will be approved for the sake of literally millions of people who either reside in the area or who annually visit our Nations Capital. Traffic. congestion. and air pollution are bad now. Without any type of mass transportation. I would hesitate to even guess how truly miserable life could become in the area. Ownership and operation of the bus system by WMATA will accomplish several important goals. Of immediate concern. it will assure not only continuation of bus service in the area. but also many improvements in that system. including better equipment and improved service. But of equal importance in the long run. it will permit bus service designed to compliment the Metro subway system. by using buses on feeder routes to Metro. in turn increasing both bus ridership and subway usage. This will certainly be of great benefit to the economic viability of both modes. Again. I urge your support for this urgent legislation.",

But where is our concern for the thousands of jobs that would be abruptly abolished by this legislation?

Too often we in Congress are guilty of restricted. narrow vision. and do not take the time to subject our actions to the test of a .panoramic view of total impact. This Nation is great today because it is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. One of its most valuable resources is coal. But that coal must be claimed from the earth. Bituminous coal accounts for 44 percent of all electricity generated in the Nation. and threefourths of the coal shipped to electric utility companies comes from surface mines. The legislation we are considering here today would shut down 65 percent of surface coal mining in my district of Virginia alone. The Commonwealth of Virginia has an effective reclamation law. The regulation of surface coal mining. and the conservation and reclamation of surface areas affected by coal mining activities should remain within the jurisdiction of the States affected by it. That is where the need. the knowledge and the knowhow is concentrated. Reclaimed land in Virginia is even now being constructively used for farming. for recreational facilities. for housing and for industry. contributing to progress in the Appalachian region.

I cannot understand how we can operate the Olympics or anything else of this kind if anyone who receives any food. board. lodging or transportation would have to be subject to the minimum wage law. A lot of people are anxious and willing to help in every affair of this kind. A lot of the services are gratuitous. The services are offered by the people out of a spirit of community action. Now that the Senator from New Jersey has had the opportunity to look at the amendment. I would like to have the opinion of the Senator on this amendment. I would have to resist the amendment as it is now proposed.",

If they work 14 hours a day. as many of them do. could they then deduct the overtime value for the excess time put in. assuming that the value would be the same as if it had been paid in wages or salaries?

There are unemployed people in Colorado. there are some chicanos. some blacks. some American Indians. some working class people of this community. some working class white people who need jobs. If we are going to take taxpayer money for these winter games. then let us be sure there are some jobs available. and that not just a few real estate operators and others will make money. the concessionaires and hotel people.

It leaves the matter entirely in limbo and does not permit the State of Colorado or the city of Denver or even the Federal Government to plan intelligently on the future. The point has been raised that there are no definite cost figures. That is true. although I must say that these figures have been gone over by one of the most prominent engineering firms in the United States. StearnsRoger of Denver. and they think those are reasonably accurate. The committee discussed this matter and went into it thoroughly. The committee was satisfied that the figure should be $15.5 million and not $1.5 million. The third point I make and I make it very strongly is that the Office of Management and Budget. as well as the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. feels that the matter should be handled in full at this time. and that the full authorization be made. We are trying to comply with the department of Government. no one of which will have to administer all these funds. We have already provided for their supervision and audit. That Is taken care of. Last. I would like to say that we are following the precedent entirely in doing this. Since 1960 all of these matters have been funded or authorized in full in one authorization.

The bill is identical to that introduced this summer by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on LaborHEW. the gentleman from Washington . who has provided such outstanding leadership in the health and child welfare field. Mr. Speaker. few dimensions of the national health crisis are more acute than those affecting our children. Childhood illnesses affect many millions of American families each year. and. aside from the tragedy of human suffering involved. the spiraling costs of medical care and treatment of afflicted children pose a catastrophic economic burden on all but a handful of such families. As one example of the impact of such catastrophic childhood illnesses. a recent survey revealed that birth defects alone currently affect some 2.5 million Americans under the age of 20. Of this total. there are 1.170.000 suffering from mental retardation of prenatal origin. 300.000 suffer from congenital blindness and lesser visual impairment. and another 300.000 suffer from congenital deafness and lesser hearing impairment. Still another 300.000 suffer from genitourinary malformations. some 200.000 have muscular dystrophy. and another 200.000 have congenital heart and other circulatory disease. Other types of birth defects included in the 2.5 million total include clubfoot. cleft lip/palate. diabetes. malformations of digestive system. speech disturbances of prenatal origin. cystic fibrosis. and many others. Mr. Speaker. the \"Childrens Catastrophic Health Care Act of 1971\" would become a new title V of the Social Security Act. replacing the present title VMaternal and Child Health and Crippled Childrens Services. It would significantly expand present crippled childrens programs and also be maternal and infant care program authorized under the present language of title V. It would also continue other title V programs that are important in the health care field.

During the ensuing unequal struggle. the fate of the Hungarian freedom fighters. and that of the Hungarian people. was sealed in spite of the fact they fought like heroes who earned the veneration and respect of all mankind. And so it was that still another page in the bloody history of Communist savagery and aggression was turned while the free world looked on in sympathy. but helpless. The real heroes are. indeed. those who have given their very lives for their fellow man in the unshaken belief that freedom cannot survive by the mere paying of lipservice or the demagoguery that is spawned in a society lured into a complacency that it is invulnerable to invasion by alien powers. Although perhaps of some inspiration to the people who have escaped the chains of Communist suppression that still bind their countrymen. I feel it is vitally important to Instill in our own people that these repetitious commemorations of the demise of once free nations are painfully realistic examples of the fate that awaits those who take their freedoms for granted and abuse them with impunity.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this week the Cannikin nuclear explosion will occur on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian Island chain despite the protestations of environmentalists across the country. President Nixon. in approving the blast last week. has ignored the warnings of ecologyminded citizens and individuals. The dangers to fish and wildlife on Amchitka Island and in the surrounding waters have been well defined by groups such as the Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club. yet these imminent dangers have been dism~ssed by the Atomic Energy Commission. The justification offered by the Atomic Energy Commission for the Cannikin test. is. at best. questionable. To state that the explosion of a 5megaton warhead is necessary to convince the Soviet Union of the desirability of serious negotiations with the United States at the SALT talks seems to be contradictory to the very purpose of the SALT talks themselves. While both the Soviet Union and the United States have expressed interest in reaching an agreement banning all underground nuclear blasts. neither country seems to be committed to the actual implementation of such a ban. Certainly the Cannikin test this week and the future underground tests planned in Nevada call into question the sincerity of the United States desire to stop all nuclear testing. I have joined with several other Members of Congress in a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to try to prevent the Amchitka test. I was certainly disheartened when this suit was not litigated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. I do not consider the senseless destruction of fish in the Aleutian waters to in any way justify the minimal informational gains which the Atomic Energy Commission purports will be made from the Cannikin explosion. The decision on the part of the Nixon administration to go ahead with the test on Amchitka Island is one further example of the mistaken priorities of this administration. Many of my constituents have taken the time to write to me regarding their distress at the Cannikin test. I applaud these constituents for their very justified concern. Below are the names of those constituents who most recently sent me a petition deploring the Amchitka test. I join with the following residents of my district in condemning the Cannikin explosion:",

Consequently it is with satisfaction that I bring to the attention of the House the unanimous resolution adopted by the 23d Saipan Legislature on September 22nd requesting the U.S. Government to bring Pan American World Airways services to the island of Saipan. This is a demonstration of the foresight. the determination. and the spirit of initiative characteristic of the residents of Saipan. Copies of the resolution. signed by the Honorable Vicente T. Camacho. speaker. and Daniel T. Muna. legislative clerk. have been forwarded to President Nixon. the Secretary of the Department of the Interior. the Secretary of State. the chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. and Pan American World Airways.

The legislatures resolution points out the need for improving the economy of Saipan by actively promoting tourism and recites that the Government of Guam in March of this year formally recognized Pan Am as the carrier who had done most in promoting travel to Guam. Basically. what the people of Saipan want is for a U.S. carrier to provide jet air service to Saipan. This is something that should have been provided long ago. As a matter of fact. Pan Am now overflies Saipan over once a day in each direction on its TokyoGuam route. Pan Am has asked to be permitted to provide this badly needed service for Saipan. As one who has long taken a deep interest in the problems and achievements of the good people of Saipan and the other islands of the Trust Territories.

Most of us in this body are old enough to remember the brutal and abrupt manner in which Russia seized Lithuania and the neighboring Latvia and Estonia in Many people. and many nations. preferred at that time not to notice. or not* to acknowledge. the implication of the Russian action. After all. the Baltic nations were small nations and virtually powerless. The Western world was then in a precarious position for France was about to fall and Great Britain was entering its most critical days against the might of the German onslaught. Among those Americans who knew of the obliteration of freedom in Lithuania. there was either a sense of helplessness. or in some cases. a reluctance to speak harshly of the actions of the Soviet Union. The plight of Lithuania still suffers from insufficient public attention. This is a particularly bitter fact as we observe new nation after new nation being admitted to the United Nations while having but a fraction of Lithuanian history and culture. As I have observed in previous years. Lithuania is no makebelieve nation. It has a long and distinguished history dating back to 1009 A.D. It was the first nation in Eastern Europe to embrace Christianity. Lithuania has suffered under Russian occupation before only to emerge as a free and independent state. Thus. while the present situation seems bleak. the Lithuanian people do not forget their history and their hopes for salvation. The continuing oppression of the Baltic States is forever a reminder of Soviet perfidy and a wound on the conscience of mankind. The United States of America is at its best when it proclaims and supports the concept of selfdetermination. It is to the credit of the Congress of our Nation. then. that we draw attention to Lithuanian Independence Day and express our hope that the Lithuanian people will ultimately gain national independence and personal liberty.",

Ark.. just a decade. but whose interest in his county of Craighead and the State of Arkansas is well documented by his record of public service.

This exemption of the most important item on any familys budget must end. The administration must overcome its fear of giant agribusiness and begin protecting the consumer. Another way it can do this is by permitting increased meat imports. The high cost of the meat is not a result of consumer bidding prices up. as Agriculture Secretary Butz would have us believe. that argument is just another example of the probusiness. anticonsumer bias of the Nixon administration.

They are set by consumers.\" The theory that the consumer or customer is always wrong Is unquestionably popular In some areas of the Nixon Administration and Butz is circulating it freely on his fencemending visits to the farm states. It is a fact that meat is increasingly in demand and that supply is lagging. It is also true that the costs of middlemenpackagers and processorshave been going up. But that does not constitute evidence of consumer responsibility for higher meat pricesespecially not when Butz is simultaneously predicting a $2 billion increase In farmers receipts from livestock sales this year. Many informed Americans think that one practical shortterm solution would be to increase meat imports. but Butz considers that a \"negligble\" kind of price relief. How can he be so sure? Last year. imports ran 30 million pounds below established quotas. In the meantime. domestic beef raisers are continuing to fatten stock in the hope of further fattening profits. The essential objectives of Butz blitz are clearly 1) to forestall price controls on raw agricultural productshowever much they may appeal to Washingtons price stabilizersand 2) to round up as many cattlemens votes as possible at a time when many seem inclined to stray.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the shooting of Governor Wallace earlier this week has made many people aware of the desperate need for strict handgun control in this country. Newspaper and radio and television editorials and the mail coming into my office all share the same tone. They all want to know why Congress has done nothing about the unconscionable traffic in handguns that threatens to destroy the big cities of this country. In the city of Chicago alone. 456 people were killed last year. The Chicago Police Department annually picks up 14.000 handguns. but with close to 2 million new handguns flooding the country every year it is a losing battle. There is a direct relationship between the number of handguns and their easy availability and the steadily climbing rate of crime in urban America. The mayors of our big citieslike Mayor Daley of Chicago and Mayor Lindsey of New Yorkhave recognized that. and so have the police chiefs. According to national opinion polls. most of the people in this country want strict handgun control too. But somehow. the message has not gotten through to the Members of this Congress. All we seem to hear is the anguished complaints of a few who think they will be \"inconvenienced\" because handgun control will complicate their lives as target shooters. As a result there has been little support for hearings on handgun control. Yesterday. under the leadership of Senator BAYH of Indiana and Senator KENEDY of Massachusetts. the Senate took some courageous action. Senator BAYHS Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency passed a bill without dissent that would stop the sale and manufacture of \"Saturday Night Specials.\" That legislation faces a difficult fight in the Senate. but at least that body has made a start. This vital issue deserves a hearing in the House of Representatives. too. The need for such hearings is one thing that both the proponents and the opponents of handgun control legislation should be able to agree upon. There are several comprehensive. progressive handgun control bills now before the House. I have proposed one and so has the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman EMANUEL\" CELLER of New York . Given the magnitude of the problem and the publics concern. they should have a hearing. As a member of the Judiciary Committee. I hope we can give these proposals and others the attention that the problem deserves.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Presidents trip to Russia comes at an opportune time. I had misgivings about his trip to Communist China. I felt that we were making too many concessions too soon and receiving little if anything in return. However. it is possible that the trip may have helped to avoid a confrontation on the US. bombing policy in Hanoi and Haiphong. Regardless of this. I am convinced that the trip to Russia is sound. that Russia is interested in a better understanding with the U.S. and in a degree of control on armaments. They are now enjoying an excellent military posture. They are as strong in most respects as we are. stronger in some. It is to their advantage to hold things as they are while they make domestic and economic gains at home and bolster their world trade picture. This means we may reach some understanding with Russia during the Presidents trip which will lessen world tension. It certainly is to be hoped that this is the case. I can foresee additional competition in diplomatic and trade channels instead of military competition. But if this occurs America should welcome the change. It is doubtful that the Presidents trip will have any appreciable effect on the war in Vietnam. at least in the immediate future. but at least the Russians are talking instead of reacting in force. This is a very important difference. I applaud the President for his efforts.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I join the distinguished gentleman from Florida in commemorating this Cuban Independence Day. Mr. Speaker. May 20 marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Republic of Cuba. but it also. unfortunately. marks another year during which the residents of Cuba have not been permitted to know freedom. We can join with the many thousands of Cubans who have fled to this country and who can truly celebrate Cuban Independence Day in freedom. but we must also share their sorrow at being unable to celebrate with their 81/2 million fellow countrymen and relatives who are virtually held captive in their native country. It is our mutual and prayerful hope that they will all be united in liberty one day. Notwithstanding the struggle which is going on today within Cuba in the quest for true freedom. the United States and those Cubans who now live within our borders can commemorate that day when Cubans threw off the yoke of Spanish ruleending nearly 400 years of domination. As Americans we can be proud of the small role we played during those last crucial years in the fight for independence. We can also continue to recognize the heroism and courage which kept alive the drive to attain independence in past years and which are still alive today in the hearts of Cubans who yearn to be free. This great desire for freedom and the spirit which burned in those earlier Cuban citizens has not dimmed and it offers hope for those who are today ruled by the despotic government of Fidel Castro. The people within Cuba today have known freedom. For 50 years. from 1902 until 1952. they were free to determine their own destinies and free to help build for the future of their country and for the hemisphere. They created a land where human dignity and rights were recognized. Since that time. however. they have suffered under the tyranny first of Batista and now of Fidel Castro. But I believe. Mr. Speaker. that this thrust for freedom will prevail and will result one day in a true and lasting liberation of all the people of the Republic of Cuba.",

We all know that in the last century there was a long struggle for freedom from colonialism. We know the part that our country played at the turn of the century in helping to gain this freedom. It seems both tragic and ironic that in the 20th century. right at our front door. freedom should be so completely lost to the point that an agent of another tremendous power. expansive since World War II and militantly antiAmelican. should. as this agent does. pose a real. a present and a serious threat to the stability of the Western Hemisphere in general and to the safety and wellbeing of the United States in particular.

Despite all of the pronouncements and promises that were made. the fact is that economically. politically. and otherwise. it is really a closed shop. To that extent the great flow of hope and freedom that really lies in the hearts and bodies of the Cuban people equally as it does in ours has been betrayed. Therefore. on this day we could take a little time to commemorate the great struggle of the Cuban people in an earlier day to achieve their independence and freedom and to hope that they will have the opportunity. with the hopes and the prayers of many people around the world. to do it once again.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the schedule for next week indicates that the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972. the socalled revenuesharing bill. may be the subject of consideration by the House if a rule is granted in the meantime. Some Members have expressed concern about various aspects of this legislation and I want to put forth some of the points which make my support extremely doubtful. To begin with. this bill purports to be a sharing of revenues. but the fact is that with a deficit last year of $23 billion and one projected for the 1972 fiscal year of $38.8 billion. it is quite clear that any provisions of revenues in excess of current appropriations will cause a further deficit or require new sources of revenue. In addition to this proposed deficit financing. I am concerned that the legislation makes funds available to local units of government without proper control. Naturally. the local administrators favor any measure which purports to give them more money but this eagerness for revenue is no guarantee that the purpose for which it will be spent will be sound. The experiences of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. a prototype of revenue sharing. has amply and disastrously demonstrated the waste. inefficiency and illegality which can come from funding without adequate control. It is about time in my judgment that the local administrators whose expenditures have skyrocketed in recent years should begin to look toward putting a ceiling upon expenditures rather than urging measures which will lead to a greater tax burden. The budget of my own city is seven times what it was when I was mayor and it is clear that this type of increase cannot continue without financial collapse. Perhaps the current bill will provide a good time to bring all these questions to the surface.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we have entered an era in which there seems to be no limit to the need for more capital in homebuilding and other areas of great public interest. This naturally moves into the mainstream of tax policy discussionsthe whole question of how taxes affect the supply of capital. One question raised is whether pure capital gains actually belong in the income tax base. The best way to open up a subject is to present a model for discussion. and this is the prpose of a bill which I am introducing today. It has been prepared through the collaboration of some outstanding tax people. This bill wouldEstablish a system. associated with the estate and gift taxes. to tax as transfers of capital the pure capital gains of individuals. Moderate the rates of tax on such gains. Provide a reasonable exemption from the tax. Provide a credit of these taxes paid during life against estate taxes due at death. and End the levy of a Federal tax on gains realized from the sales of homes. It should be noted that the proposed credit of lifetime taxes on capital transfers against the estate tax due at death will solve a problem which is scheduled for consideration in the review of estate and gift taxes to which the Ways and Means Committee is committed. In the past. the problem of equalizing at death the tax treatment of gains has been considered in connection with income tax revisions. When our committee reached the subject during our 1969 reform hearings. however. we decided to hold it over for consideration during our review of the estate and gift taxes. The proposal for a creditinstead of an additional taxis an option which has not been previously explored during official studies of the problem. In completely severing the connection with the income tax base. the bill would take the affected gains of individuals out of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. which relates to income taxes. and place them under subtitle B. which now relates only to estate and gift taxes. The new provisions would appear as \"Chapter 13Taxes on capital transfers by individuals\" under the subtitle reentitled to read \"Subtitle BEstate. gift and capital transfer taxes.\" The term \"chapter 13 net capital gain\" is used to describe gains which would be taxable under these provisions.",

In this particular case a special hardship would have occurred in the State of New Hampshire. The State of New Hampshire has had a law charging air carriers a fee based upon the number of passengers enplaned long before enactment of the Airport and Airway Development Act on May 21. 1970. The New Hampshire law was first enacted in October 1959. and it was revised in August 1969 (chapter 391 of 1969 Laws of New Hampshire. amending N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. sections 422:3. 43. 45). It has been sustained as constitutional by the New Hampshire Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States. My amendment unfortunately will not exempt New Hampshire indefinitely from this bills prohibition on the head charge. It will do so only until July 1. 1973. Now. New Hampshire happens to be in the unique situation where the fate of its air service depends entirely on the Civil Aeronautics Boards decisions as to whether it is going to require certificated air carrier service to our northern area which comprises about threefourths of the entire State. Presently. some of our airports either have no service or such minimal service that they have no income. and would have to close down now. or very shortly. if this bill passed without my amendment providing a grace period for the State of New Hampshire with respect to prohibiting its tax. My amendment simply provides a reprieve since after July 1. 1973. New Hampshire. too. will be prohibited from levying this particular charge. as are other States. I am very grateful to the Senator from Nevada for agreeing to my amendment. which was a compromise since I wanted more for the people of my State. Mr. President.

It is unreasonable for train riders to have to travel all the way to Minneapolis to board a train. especially when many of them. such as college students and elderly persons. are without automobiles. Amtrak claims that operating the St. Paul terminal is an expensive proposition. I hardly think this is justification for bypassing the city entirely. Until terminal problems are solved. the least Amtrak could do is stop its trains at a designated railroad crossing to service this city of 308.000 people.

We should stop pretending that Pakistan must be treated as an \"ally\" because of its SEATO and CENTO membership. Pakistans participation over the last 10 years has been no more than ritualistic.

Second. we should reject the Pakistani military governments contention that the slaughter of elected leaders and repression of the majority of its population in the east is not a proper matter of concern for the international community.

In 1970 our deficit was a whopping $10 billion. and this year it is moving even higher. Since the dollar is the major reserve currency of central banksand they are committed to support its value by the rules of the International Monetary Fundthe result of this cumulative deficit is to flood foreign central banks and money markets with more dollars than they want or can use. The German central bank. with $20 billion already in its reserves. has been forced to swallow fresh dollars at a rate which on May 5 reached $1 billion in the first hour. On that day it stopped accepting dollars althogether. and the four lesser countries followed suit. Mr. President. those countries are Holland. Belgium. Switzerland. and Austria.

I introduce a bill today to amend the National Security Act of 1947. which would bar the Central Intelligence Agency from organizing. supervising. or conducting any military or paramilitary operation abroad. This bill is identical to one introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. BADILLO. In introducing his measure on May 31. 1971. the Congressman explained that the bill would close a loophole in the National Security Act which now permits the CIA to undertake such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as may be directed by the National Security Council. It is this provision which apparently is the justification for the presence of the CIA in Laos--not to gather intelligence. but to train. finance. and lead tribal guerrillas and even the Royal Laotian Army as a covert adjunct to U.S. combat operations. It is reliably reported that the CIA has more than 300 men in Laos. supplying and training government guerrillas and leading commando and reconnaissance teams. In addition. the CIA is mainly responsible for planning of the massive air bombardment of Laos. which has made a wasteland of this tiny nation and turned its people into refugees in their own land. By its use of the CIA in this manner. our Government has developed a new and cynical formula for running a war. out of sight of the Congress and the American people. I fear that unless legislation such as the bill I offer today is enacted. we will find the CIA running military operations in Indochina long after other American combat forces have been brought home. If enacted. this bill would restore the CIA to the role Congress originally intended it to play. which was to gather data pertinent to the Nations security. not to conduct secret wars in distant lands.

The article noted: The press furor about the news embargo at the start of the Laotian operations has become as ridiculous as it is bitter and distorted. A key point the article makes is that reporters are not automatically entitled to have access to classified information on pending operations when the consequences possibly could be measured in terms of American or allied lives. It further shows that the squawk over Laos was a result of the unusual circumstances of this unusual war that has set a pattern where \"American and other newsmen operating in Vietnam. have enjoyed an unprecedented freedom to report news that would have seemed paradisical to their older colleagues of World War II.\" Another pertinent statement is this one in the article: To the American forces involved in the war. there seemed to be a journalistic contest to be first with the worst.

Mr. President. it is in the highest American tradition to make these people welcome in our country. America has always been a haven for those who were religiously oppressed. more importantly.

SecondJobs are to be desired. too. but there must be more useful ways to provide them. ThirdUnderstandably enough. the major SST contractors. Boeing and General Electric. are less than enthusiastic. In summary. the Journal observes that we would be much better off waiting until the commercial prospects for the SST brightened. And at that time. I am convinced that private capital will need no prodding to back this venture. And the Government can stay clear of this commercial venture. as it should have all along. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial entitled \"The Missing SST Ingredient\" from Mondays Wall Street Journal be printed in the RECORD.",

I also know that the States and municipalities. through the enactment and enforcement of laws and ordinances. can make a far better contribution to the elimination of noise than they have in the past. This bill calls for the expenditure of $26 million with which to spoon feed a new layer of bureaucrats and I am as convinced as I am that I am standing here that these payrollers will duplicate and overlap the functions of the environmentalists and others who are already spending millions upon millions of dollars.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House. I presently and for many years have represented the district which encompasses the busiest airport in the world. OHare International. It has operations every 37 seconds. I think I would be remiss if I did not at this time make as a matter of record my comment with regard to the pending amendment of my good friend from Illinois. This problem of establishing curfews and going to the FAA seeking regulations which provide for relief from the noise problem in the area is nothing new. I served on the Aviation Subcommittee 15 years ago when we were dealing with this very problem. But I think we ought to get one thing straight: We have a curfew at Washington National Airport because Washington National Airport and Dulles are in a totally unique position. They are not municipally operated but instead under control of the Federal Government. OHare International Airport is operated by the Chicago Municipal Airport Authority. There would be not one plane going in or out of OHare field after 11 oclock at night if the local airport authoiity did not approve it. So it is well and good to suggest bringing the complaints to Washington and have the FAA do the job when in reality the responsibility presently exists with the local airport authority. So let us not beat around the bush here. If we want this job done. I suggest that if you have an interest in providing this relief. you should go to the Chicago Airport Authority. which is an arm of the city administration of Chicago. get relief at the source. They have the power to stop any flights after 11 oclock if. in fact. we want a curfew. I think that ought to be made eminently clear. and I hope we have done so today.",

I have had to wrestle with the problem of air jet noise as it affects the average citizen perhaps more over the years than any other Member of this body. I realize. however. that many of my colleagues with districts adjacent to busy commercial airports can appreciate the deep concern and the aggravation of their residents in this regard. I am not seeking to make any major changes. and in fact I laud the committee for what I think is a sound and sensible approach to this problem. but I do think that my amendment would accomplish one thing: I think that. if nothing else. the residents in an area adjacent to an airport should be apprised of any construction that is likely to increase the impact of noise upon their everyday lives. What my amendment does is to say that where any commercial airport installation engages in an expansion. an extension of runways. or anything that would basically change the impact of the noise on the people in the area. they should at least be entitled to advance notice that this construction is going to be taking place. through a public hearing where they would at least have their day in court. This becomes essential because we have on two different occasions experienced situations in my area where construction was commenced with no knowledge on the part of the local officials. no knowledge on the part of the people living in the area. They subsequently engaged in litigation seeking to get an injunction. but they failed. So this merely says that where an airport installation does expand. where they make changes. then have them give advance notice. 30 days before they commence work. and to notify the local officials so the people can at least come in. find out what is going to happen to them. and have their say in public hearings. That is all it does. I hope that this body would see my amendment as a sensible amendment. and one that they could support. Thank you.",

I know he does know the problems of these airports. He does an outstanding job for his constituents whom he is trying to protect. But I would say. Mr. Chairman. that this is a noise control bill. I believe the proper place for this amendment is when we take up the airport construction bill again. This is an airport construction matter. So far as I know. in my part of the country. everybody is advised when a new airport is to start. I can recall one instance in which they notified all the people and the courthouse was filled. There was so much opposition at that time to an airport being constructed at a certain place that the FAA gave it up and said that they would not construct it there and that they would have to select a better place. Well. when they came up with another place. another hearing was held in the courthouse and everybody had their say. There were a few who were opposed to it there. but the majority were for it. Now I would say to the gentleman from Illinois that this committee when we have any other airport bill. certainly I would be very willing to put the gentlemans amendment on such a bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to propose an amendment to require the installation of noise suppression devices on jet aircraft. The provisions in this bill are too weak. They are designed solely to give the industry the time to retire all aircraft with excessively noisy engines. In the meantime. the people who live in the vicinity of airports and under flight path approaches to airports will continue to suffer near unbearable levels of noise. Congress passed the Noise Abatement Control Act in 1968 authorizing the FAA to set noise limits and require the installation of jet noise suppressors on existing aircraft. In November of 1970almost 2 years after receiving the authoritythe FAA issued an announcement of proposed rulemaking to require installation of noise suppression devices on existing jets. At the time. I lauded this action as a definite step forward in reducing noise pollution in metropolitan areas such as New York. Had the FAA continued on its plan of action at that time. a rule could have been formulated by now and citizens could have looked forward to less noise in a few years. But no. the FAA buckled down under the pressure of the airlines industry and in the spring of this year announced an 18month delay in the rulemaking procedure. I can only presume that this Agency intends to wait until such a rule is no longer needed. The present bill would only grant authority once again to reduce jet noiseauthority already granted in the 1968 bill. What we must set up is a deadline for the installation of jet noise suppressors. This is clearly necessary after almost 4 years of delay and procrastination by the FAA. My amendment would establish a 3year deadline from the date of enactment. Earlier this year Congress authorized $2.5 billion in loans to bail out corporations supposedly operating in the national interest. All it did was bail out the directors of these corporations and preserve annual dividends for the wealthy stockholders. My amendment would mean a little peace and quiet for Americans living near LaGuardia. JFK. as well as other jet airports throughout the Nation.",

I would like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of my colleagues legislation of major significance to the older population of our country and to those who will soon join their ranks. Mr. Speaker. let me note that the total population of middleaged and older persons combined came in 1970 to 61.8 million. or 31.5 percent of all Americans. almost a third. Almost 100 years ago. in 1890. of a total population of almost 40 million. only 1.2 million. or 2.9 percent. were 65 or over. In 1970 the proportion of the 203.2 million residents of the United States in this age range had reached 9.9 percent. The number of older persons in this country had increased to 20 million. When we consider also the middleaged population. those between the ages of 45 and 64. which rose from 4.6 million. or 11.6 percent. to 41.8 million. or 20.6 percent. we can see that nearly a hundred years of growth have produced a total population five times as large. a middleaged population nine times as large. and an older population an unprecedented 17 times as large. Mr. Speaker. we cannot afford either to neglect the problems of this growing proportion of our population or to fail to utilize their skills and abilities. We must also recognize and respond to the fact that 4.7 million Americans over 65 live in households below the poverty line. The income and service needs of this group must be met.

Listen. if you will. to the words of some of the great men of our time who were not privileged to membership in the American Legion. John Edgar Hoover said. and this is a great tribute to the men of World War I: Had it not been for The American Legion. subversive forces within would have destroyed our country while the flower of her youth was fighting for her preservation on foreign battlefields. The late Bernard Baruch. a great statesman who was not given to wild and rash statements. said: Within the American Legion thrives the greatest corps of Americanism alive anywhere in the world today. The American Legion may take pride in the splendid chain of Veterans Administration hospitals that ring our land. and for which the organization is primarily responsible. The Legions youth programs. designed to instill in our leaders of tomorrow a sense of appreciation of the rich heritage they enjoy under a representative form of government. Is also a matter of great pride. The AmerIcan Legion has unremittedly supported that immortal document known as our Constitution. the greatest experiment ever devised by man for the governing of itself. along with the Bill of Rights which builds fences around individual liberties which governments may wish to take away. The American Legion has consistently remained public enemy No. 1 on the list of the Kremlin because of its relentless fight against international atheistic communism. I am proud that the Legion is now sponsoring a religious emphasis program designed to bring all our people close to the Creator who has blessed us all so bountifully. The accomplishments of the American Legion are recorded history. and a proud history it Is.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this is a hybrid proposition when we talk about going to a volunteer army. I have not heard anyone in a position of authority and responsibility estimate that we can do all of this within 1 year. I said \"in. a position of authority.\" The Gates Commission recommended it could be done. but that is a milestone in this history. long since passed. It is far back down the road. It has been voted on directly here twice and repudiated each time I do not like to use the word \"repudiated\" but the White House turned it down because they did not think it would work. not that fast. and that it was not practical. Therefore. we are at the jumping off place. We can stretch this matter farther. There has been made a decision. in effect. to give the volunteer army a chance. and now to come in and cut the lifeblood of the plan to furnish the manpower for the period until the socalled volunteer army can walk with its own strength. would be to doom it to double failure and certain death. I think we have to make the hard choice here. as I said before. The Senate has been facing up to hard choices and down the line has been taking the hard way because they thought it was the necessary way. I believe that is what will happen here this afternoon. As attractive as it may be to vote for less than 2 years. or as desirable as it may be on the part of some people who have not had a chance to fully know the facts. we are going to have to face up to this matter and sustain this position because the facts overwhelming sustain it and the circumstances demand it.",

We would not want to entrust one of these ICBMs in anyway to a man unless he is 24carat gold. He must have integrity. intelligence. reliability. responsibility. and dedication unquestioned. There are hundreds and thousands of them. There are more than I realized that have been brought in through the Selective Service System. The primary supporting study of qualitative requirements of the Armed Forces points out that there is good evidence to support the proposition that both in years of schoolingAnd I am quoting nowAnd in comparative test scores. draftees score higher than volunteers. And then on and on and on. So I submit here we have one of the gravest questions that we are going to decide in this entire bill. We have had many already. but. having made these other decisions. are we going to supply the machinery? Are we going to give a niggardly 1year provision here that does not have a chance to meet the needs and demands? We will regret that day. and we will pay for it by its costing us more in money. in manpower. in lost time. and in every other way. The worst way we will have to pay for it. thoughlet us be frank about itis that we will downgrade the quality. on the average. of the men in our services. and leave us with not enough of the keymen I have described in detail.

The basic reason right now forcontinuing the draft is our involvement in Indochina. our involvement inwhich has been debated hereand our continuing our forces in Europe. As a result. we are discussing the national policies of the country in relation to our total manpower needs. The extension of the draft does not question the manpower needs. it simply shortens the span of time so that we may reconsider the matter at an earlier date. I think that is very important. I think it is very important that we have an opportunity again next year to review this matter. In my opinion. there Is absolutely no logical reason for extending the draft for 2 years when we will have a full opportunity for a fullblown review next year. and see whether any contingencies have arisen during that period of time. when this body and the House will certainly have every opportunity to consider these contingencies.

He and the other gentleman from California had a great number of these type cases of which Mr. CORMAN has spoken. People who sustained heavy damages by the earthquake did not always receive adequate remuneration for the kind of losses that were caused by the 1971 disaster. whereas there were whole neighborhoods of people who came in and took unfair advantage of the socalled forgiveness clause. Then various groups and the news media pressured their Representatives and the Small Business Administration to give faster and faster service. Now in this current situation rather than really looking carefully at this legislation. as I think we should have done in our Committee on Banking and Currency. The whole House has rushed through authorizing legislation to help the people damaged by Hurricane Agnes. We have again. in my opinion. not adequately considered some of the objections that the gentleman from California has properly raised. I think it is too bad that we tend to wait until a disaster occurs and then hurry up and rush illconceived legislative bills through because nobody in this body wants to be against people in distress. The Committee on Appropriations feels the pressure on them to try to do their part in appropriating the actual funds. I think the gentleman is to be complimented for raising these issues once again and hopefully we will legislate more responsibly very soon. We must take a hard look at the socalled forgiveness clause which encourages. as I think the gentleman said. \"outright fraud.\" I compliment him for his remark.",

The widespread devastation caused by Agnes affected the lives of thousands of our fellow Americans and caused millions of dollars of property damage. Many communities are still engaged in the tedious job of digging out. Only through a fortuitous change of course by the storm was my own State of Connecticut spared the massive destruction which several of our sister States suffered. although our coastal municipalities received the full force of the storm with 7 inches of rain falling in a short period of time. This legislation will help these cities along the road to recovery. The people of Connecticut are fully aware of the damage which can suddenly be caused by normally docile. meandering streams and rivers breaking over their banks and spreading havoc throughout the surrounding area. We saw this in August and October of 1955 during the floods in which many lives were lost and millions of dollars of damage caused. In the aftermath of those fateful months. people from other areas of the country came to the aid of Connecticut. Funds for emergency assistance were made available and since that time funds have been appropriated for dams. retaining walls. levees. and similar flood control structures which now protect our State from a recurrence of that devastation of 1955. On Thursday of this week the culmination of the Naugatuck Valley flood control project is taking place with the dedication of the AnsoniaDerby link of this vital investment in the protection of the property and lives of the people of Connecticut. I have been assured by the Army Engineers that \"the Naugatuck Valley now enjoys the highest degree of protection of any watershed of its size in the country\" against storms such as Agnes and that if tropical storm Agnes had hit Connecticut with its full fury little. If any. flood damage would have occurred in the Naugatuck Valley. The people of Connecticut fully appreciate what has been done for them and I take this opportunity to lend my support to the legislation which is before us today.",

This is an unusually good report which demonstrates the concern for reducing the numbers of injuries and the numbers of accidents. One has to drive only halfway across the Nation to understand why that is happening. namely. car production and probably unlicensed and incapable drivers who are driving longer cars faster than we can build the roads to accommodate them. I am not sure we can legislate that out of existence. but I am very appreciative of the action and the function of the committee. and I certainly want to compliment the committee for continuing their effort. all of which has been funded for the amount appropriated and authorized in recent years with the exception of a very few tens of thousands of dollars. in the research and development necessary. Still they have not gone for the openended funding and runaway inflation characteristic of so many of the ideologists and \"bleeding hearts.\" This is the epitome of responsible oversight and surveillance on the part of a standing committee of the legislative branch of our Government. I believe the committee has quite properly taken a firm stance. and again I compliment the committee on its action. I intend to vote for this bill.",

This fine group of people have dedicated themselves to the difficult task of improving the sad. indeed. often tragic. condition of mentally retarded children. Recently. in their efforts to find ways to help adjust retarded children to social life. and perhaps more importantly. to help society adjust to the presence of. and responsibility to the mentally disabled. they have proposed two projects. One. the infant stimulation program. is designed to determine the best methods of raising retarded children through new educational approaches involving increased parental participation. the second. the citizen advocacy program. is to organize concerned citizens to attract public and governmental attention to the plight of the mentally retarded with the goal of protecting their rights and establishing new programs. After careful study. and because of my knowledge of the fine past perfornance of the Exceptional Childrens Foundation. I wholeheartedly support these programs. Application is currently before the Office of Child Development for funds for these two worthy projects. The combined total requested is $97.300but this by no means represents their total value. Over 200 children will directly benefit from these programs. Many. many more. however. will benefit from the active interest. methods developed. and still more will benefit from the new educational methods developed. protection. and support of the citizens advocacy program. I urge all my colleagues to join with me in support of these efforts.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. concerned as all Americans are with the problems which plague Southeast Asia. few ever take the necessary time or thought to develop a concrete plan of possible action which would help to alleviate the perplexities of the existing situation. Dr. Edward W. Mill. chairman of the Chevalier Program in Diplomacy and World Affairs at Occidental College. has taken the time and thought upon many occasions to contribute to our understanding of the Southeast Asian dilemma. He has also suggested various programs which might allow the United States to assist in the peaceful development of this region. Recently. Dr. Mill published an article entitled \"Southeast Asia: Trends and Portents in the 1970s.\" In it he concerns himself with some of the problems faced by the countries which make up Southeast Asia. Also in this document. Dr. Mill presents a 10point program. the elements of which should be considered as possibilities for future U.S. policy and action. The 10 points of this program are designed to assist the Southeast Asian nations. without our becoming involved militarily. in the full development of their individual growth as well as to promote regional cooperation. One of the most difficult questions faced by the United States at the moment is what will be the course of future diplomatic relations between the United States and the Republic of China on Taiwan. Dr. Mill provides us with what he feels is one possible path to pursue with his proposal to create a Council on United StatesTaiwan Relations. This would be a council composed of an equal number of members from each nation. serving without compensation. to further aid the economic. cultural. and educational relations between the aforementioned countries. The benefits of the success of such a program would be twofold: First. to further the friendship already enjoyed by the Republic of China and the United States. and second. to demonstrate that mutual cooperation between countries in a nonpolitical and nonmilitaristic manner can provide profits for both parties. The possibiilty of achieving such success should be cause alone for serious consideration of Dr. Mills proposal. At this time I include in the RECORD portions of Dr. Mills article. \"Southeast Asia: Trends and Portents in the 1970\"s\" and his proposal to create the council on United StatesRepublic of China Relations:",

In the committees efforts toward achieving meaningful tax reform for small business. it has enlisted the aid of 170 Members of this body who have either introduced. cosponsored. or supported tax reform for small business. Moreover. 28 Members of the U.S. Senate have so acted during this Congress. I am proud to say that I. too. have sponsored legislation which will assist in preserving a competitive place in our free enterprise system for the small businessman. Mr. Speaker. many have discussed the underprivileged of this country during numerous hours of committee and floor time. However. small businessmen are in numbers alone the largest group of underprivileged in the United States who have suffered a neglect which appears to be almost by design. Who are they. these secondclass citizens? By our own official record they areTen out of every 20 firms in the United States. American small business11 million of them. They employ almost 50 percent of the private work force. Ninetyseven percent of them have less than 100 employees. Small businessmen. their employees. and their families equal 50 percentonehalf of our total population. They have had no favorable tax legislation since 1958. Who are they? They are the ones who cannot accumulate capital. cannot adequately expand. have been plagued by concentration in industry after industry. have seen their profits decline over 50 percent in less than 20 years. These are the underprivileged and secondclass citizens who have had no tax equalization or legislation in 14 years. Because of the treatment small businessmen have received. profits for manufacturing corporations with assets under $1 million declined 44.8 percent between 1969 and 1970. and there was an additional decline of 3.9 percent between 1970 and 1971. Yet. manufacturing corporations with assets over $1 billion declined only 7.2 percent between 1969 and 1970. then increased 14.3 percent between 1970 and 1971. The small business community has been further relegated to a secondclass position by virtue of consolidation. amalgamation. and power. Witness: The 500 largest corporations account for 66 percent of all industrial sales. 75 percent of all Industrial profits. 75 percent of all industrial employment. yet. over 189.000 small industrial firms account for less than 2 percent of industrial sales.",

I was shocked beyond belief this morning to find that on yesterday. the President of the United States issued an Executive Order or decree No. 11677 vesting in himself authority to limit exports of nonstrategic materials and imposing a fine of up to $10.000 upon those who violate his own decree. In this case. the President is acting as a legislator establishing a law. he is the Executive enforcing the law. and he acts as the judge to determine who violated the law. The administration has limited exports of hides under a law wlhich expired Tuesday night. The Commerce Department estimates that the production of cattle hides this year will be more than double the domestic demand. Article 1. section 9 of the U.S. Constitution forbids export taxes even under a law passed by Congress. A limitation on exports of a material like hides. the supply of which exceeds our demand by more than 100 percent. is even more severe than a tax. Yet. the President is by decree doing what is even questionable that the Congress can do by law. I know the President is a busy man and I want to believe that he did not realize the consequences of this action. It is a far reaching violation of our concept of government and I hope President Nixon will immediately call to task those who laid his order before him and I hope the Congress will look into this matter quickly and before government by decree in the United States goes any further. if that is possible. This. in my opinion. is the most outrageous extensions of Executive power that I have ever seen and I think It is a matter which rates top attention both by the Congress and by individuals who are interested in preserving individual rights in this country.",

For 50 years one of my constituents. a former Pennsylvania Railroad employee. made payments averaging $3.08 monthly to the Pennsylvania Railroad Voluntary Relief Departmentaltogether $1.542for a $1.250 life insurance policy. On July 20. he received a letter informing him that. effective immediately. neither he nor his daughters would receive any benefits. and giving as the reason \"the serious financial situation\" of the voluntary relief department and of the Penn Central. They will not refund his $1.542. He is 72. He has no other insurance. He is among about 500 people being cut off from the death benefits. to save about $100.000. Penn Central is a company with assets of many billions of dollars. A few years ago financial adventurers took over the companypaid themselves salaries of up to $225.000 a year. squandered company reserves. and invested pension funds in enterprises owned by their chief financial officer. his relatives and friendsand ran the company into bankruptcy. Eighteen months ago Congress gave Penn Central a $100 million loan guaranteewhich a Congressman aptly described as a \"handwringing operation\"-one which I am glad to say I voted against. I am asking for a congressional investigation into the gypping of 500 old people. Five questions should be asked: First. Why did the trustees in the bankruptcy. including Willard Wirtz. approve this heartless act? Second. Why were these insurance funds not kept actuarially sound so that they would not be dragged down by the bankruptcy? Third. Why were pension funds allowed to be invested by the chief financial officer in enterprises controlled by his family. his relatives. and his friends? Fourth. Why should Congress not withhold further Federal subsidies to the Penn Central Railroad until justice is done for these 500 old people? Fifth. Why was this cancellation announced in such a barbaric manner? Monthly payments were still being collected from Mr. Miller. my constituent. just days before the letter was sent out announcing his death benefits would be cut offnot even a refund of his $3.75.",

Ind.. from the office of the Adjutant General tend to answer this question. DEAR MRS. WARD: This is in further response to your letter of 8 October 1970 addressed to President Nixon regarding the death of your brotherinlaw. Sergeant Jim A. Wray. It is indeed thoughtful that you should seek comfort for your sister and you may be assured that the President deeply regrets the loss of each of our servicemen. He is keenly aware of the contribution and sacrifices of all those who serve in Vietnam but because of the many demands placed upon him. he is unable to extend personal condolences to the next of kin of all personnel who die on active duty. It is my understanding that President Nixon sends letters of condolence to the next of kin only in combat or combatassociated deaths. Sergeant Wray died on 2 July 1969 in Vietnam as the result of injuries received while on a military operation when supporting artillery impacted in the area. He was reported as a nonhostile casualty. The nearest regional Veterans Administration office will assist Mrs. Wray in initiating a request for the memorial certificate you mention. My deepest sympathy is with Mrs. Wray and her daughter.

Mr. David Callahan. president of West Coast Commodity Exchange. Inc.. has advised me that over 500 people took part in todays trading. with 271 gold futures contracts being negotiated at a gross dollar value of over $3 million. He further advised be that this is one of the largest records for any new commodity on opening day in U.S. commodityexchange history. The most important statistic conveyed to me by Mr. Callahan was that gold prices opened at $59.50 per ounce. closed at $59. with a low of $58. This is almost double the existing value of gold set by the U.S: Treasury at $35 per ounce. The most significant aspect of this act is that it frees this country from the last vestige of financial allegiance to Great Britain. Previously. gold prices had been established only in London. by a combine of five private companiesthe London Gold Marketwho meet twice daily for the purpose of fixing the world price of gold. Furthermore. this act is historically important because it faces reality by overcoming the myth that we are still on the gold standard. therefore. there is. in the face of this reality. no valid reason for our Government to prohibit private ownership of gold. The present ideas concerning the necessity for Government ownership and control of gold linger from the depression. Todays event. in the face of objection from the Treasury Department. has forced us to realize the absurdity of continuing to deny ownership of gold to American citizens. This openmarket trading of gold futures has brought us out of the dark ages and into the reality and light of our present economic situation. It is an act that should be applauded and imitated throughout our country. Our people should have the right to own gold. instead of allowing our gold reserves to be depleted by foreigners who demand gold as payment for our paper money and obligations. This is why I have introduced legislation to permit Americans to own gold at every session of Congress.

My contention is that Americans should have the right to buy gold. as they do to buy any other commodity. \"Great Britain and the United States are the only major countries in the free world to prohibit ownership of gold.\"",

It is estimated that most crime is committed by recidiviststhose who have previously served time in penal institutions. Despite the liberal rhetoric of prison administrators. our penal system is oriented to punishment. not rehabilitation. There are many reasons for this. certainly one is our national reluctance to spend the money that would be necessary for programs which would actually rehabilitate. In most cases. too. the exconvict finds no job available to him when he regains his freedom. even if he has a marketable skill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the administration has long been in favor of spinning off operating programs of the Office of Economic Opportunity to other executive departments. leaving OEO as merely a poverty research and evaluation organization. This spinoff concept causes considerable concern in the Congress and in the Nation at large insofar as it abandons the concept of an active advocacy agency for the poor within the Federal Government. There is ample reason to fear that other executive agencies will not operate transferred programs with the same attitudes. expectations. and guidelines developed by OEO in the 1960s. For example. OEOs family planning projects. initiated as a result of an amendment which I sponsored to the Economic Opportunity Act in 1966. are being transferred to the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. OEO has operated its programs with a unique degree of citizen participation which may disappear under HEW administration. However. the following memorandum of understanding between OEO and HEW. listing the projects to be transferred. acknowledges all the major goals for family planning service delivery championed by OEO. It gives me some reason to hope that these projects will continue to be successfully implemented under HEW administration. but HEWs performance in the coming months will be the real measure of the success of the spinoff concept.

This announcement marked a significant contribution to cutting down the flow of heroin into this country and the Nixon administration is to be congratulated for the success of the negotiations which led the Turks to take this step. Now the administration must take the next step to build upon the policy adopted by the Turkish Government. First. the President should offer law enforcement aid and technical assistance to the Turks to guarantee the enforcement of the prohibition. Second. now that we are on the way to solving the problem of illegal opium production in Turkey. we must move immediately and forcefully to stop production in the region which supplies most of the worlds illegal opiumSoutheast Asia. Third. to accomplish these ends the President should appoint one individual to exercise determined leadership over all State Department activities in foreign drug controlin order to create a comprehensive integrated program to eliminate illicit opium production abroad. This individual should develop a wellconceived plan of attack for implementation by the international community which would be presented to the 24th session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in September. He should also take immediate steps to strengthen the United Nations Special Fund for Drug Abuse Control. Finally. the activities of this individual should be coordinated by an Office of Drug Abuse Control within the White House as proposed in the bills which I and a number of my colleagues have suggested. While I hope to see these new steps taken in the very near future. I want to compliment the administration for the first of what must be many successful efforts to cut off the international flow of illicit narcotic drugs. To that end.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. President Nixons nationwide television announcenient of last Thursday that he had accepted an invitation from Premier Chou Enlai to visit mainland China sometime before May 1972. seems to fit into the pattern which certain Members of Congress have been advocating in recent months--the early seating of the Peoples Republic of China in the United Nations and the adjustment of our own diplomatic relations in accordance with such United Nations recognition. Although it is true that Mr. Nixons announcement did not go beyond a general statement of plans to visit mainland China. it is not pure speculation to believe that the Presidents quest for \"normalization of relations\" with mainland China will definitely include an early recognition of the Peoples Republic of China and our consent to its admission to the United Nations. Closely related to the China question is the equally urgent problem of Taiwans independence. I use the word \"Taiwan\" in its most accurate sense. meaning not the Nationalist Chinese Government or any of the two million followers of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek who. with their leader. sought refuge on the island from mainland China more than 20 years ago. but referring to the 12 million native Taiwanese who. since the end of World War II. have been denied the right of genuine selfdetermination. This is clearly the next step that President Nixon ought to take: An announcement that the United States supports the holding of a UNsponsored plebiscite on Taiwan. Such a step will definitely be in accord with his announced peaceseeking motive that underlies his proposed visit to mainland China. Will he take it? Nowhere. in my opinion. has the case for an independent Taiwan been more clearly and effectively stated than in a speech delivered in Honolulu. Hawaii. on July 10. 1971. 5 days before President Nixons announcement. by one of our own distinguished colleagues. the Honorable SPARK M. MATSUNAGA. Believing that many of our colleagues and other will find the speech of the gentleman from Hawaii informative and helpful. I am submitting it for inclusion in the RECORD at this point. together with a Honolulu StarBulletin editorial of July 13. 1971 containing comments on the Matsunaga speech.",

The gentleman has touched on something that is extremely important. and in the very limited time I have left let me remind my colleagues in the Committee of the Whole that it has been only a few short days since Russian planes were found to be patrolling our coast out of bases in Cuba. That is something which requires our careful thought. We know Russian submarines have been active in Caribbean waters. Now their airplanes are operating out of Cuba. Yes. there is danger to Americas security in what is taking placeserious danger. Let me spell out what actually happened in the recent incident of Russian aircraft flying in close proximity to the eastern coast of the United States. We have long known about the threat from Russian submarines off our coast. Now there are Russian aircraft which constitute a threat of danger to our cities and our defense establishments. This situation certainly should alert us to the continuing need for an adequate air defense force and to weaknesses which will result from the SALT talks limitations. For the benefit of the House. let me relate the actual facts of the flights of Russian aircraft along our coast. On 5 and 6 September 1972. four Soviet TU95DBearlongrange reconnaissance aircraft arrived in Cuba. This type aircraft is assigned to Soviet Naval Aviation and cannot carry weapons. Their mission is primarily reconnaissance but with a capability to pass targeting data. They were picked up inbound by NORADs Greenland. Iceland. United Kingdom radar link. On 9 and 11 September 1972. two of these Bear D aircraft each flew round robin 12hour reconnaissance missions from Jose Marti International Airport at Havana. These aircraft were tracked by the radar site at Key West. Naval interceptors from the U.S.S. Forrestal intercepted and escorted them. Their proximity to the Atlantic coast was about 160 nautical miles east of Cape Hatteras. The aircraft undoubtedly made the long flight from Russian bases across the polar ice cap all the way to Cuba. Presumably without refueling. They have been serviced from a Cuban base and presumably this is the Jose Marti Air Base. The significant thing is that the Soviets now are practicing worldwide deployment of military aircraft and that the Soviets are placing special emphasis on Cuba and their plans both for bases for aircraft and for submarines.",

I direct attention to page 20 of the committee report on this bill. and a line item Indicating a transfer of Navy property ostensibly valued at $702.000 for property presently held by private owners. to assure a noise buffer zone adjoining Miramar Naval Air Station. in San Diego. I judge from the tabulation on page 20 that the committee feels it is approving a land swap in which the parcels to be exchanged are of equal value. If so. I refer the committee to a colloquy between myself and the gentleman from Texas when the authorizing bill was before us several weeks ago. I pointed out on that occasion that the prospective land deal was negotiated through the Naval Facilities Command in San Diego. rather than the Real Estate Division. as is normally done. It provides for exchange of 155 acres of Navy land for a total acreage of 230 owned by the Christiana Oil Corp.. 138 acres. the San Diego Unified School District. 69 acres. and the city of San Diego. 23 acres. Independent appraisals have shown the value of the private lands involved in the exchange to be about $760.000. rather than the $702.000 indicated in the committee report. Similar appraisal of the Navy land indicates a value of more than $2 milliontriple the amount being traded for. Clearly. if such a swap were consummated on a pretense of equal value. the Government would be dispensing windfall profits to commercial speculators. Christiana Oil Corp. is the owner of a housing development firm. Tierra Santa. A glance at maps of the area show that the developers would wind up owning all four corners of a future major freeway interchange less than 10 minutes from downtown San Diego.

Among the projects are two in particular which they consider to be of highest priority. These are navigator training aids facility for $815.000 at Mather Air Force Base. Calif.. and airmen dormitories for 288 men at DavisMonthan Air Force Base. Ariz.. at a cost of $1.294.00C. The first item is required to permit the design. fabrication. and maintenance of refined training devices at the Air Force Navigator Training Aids Center at Mather. At present this activity is being conducted in an old World War II wooden frame structure which is inadequate for the purpose. At DavisMonthan. the committee had deleted the airmen dormitories on the assumption that a Titan mission of the Strategic Air Command would be phasing out as a result of the strategic arms limitation agreement. The Air Force has informed us that their projections indicate longterm utilization of this facility In spite of the SALT limitation agreement. In view of the difficult housing situation in the Tucson area for military personnel. I feel that it is prudent to reinstate this project. I therefore offer an amendment to increase the funds allowed for military construction. Air Force to accommodate these two items.

I think those who have made the criticism of the report to which Mr. Schmidt refers have not read the Report as carefully as they should. If the recommendations of the Roport were likely to have. the effect of reducing the contribution of the basic scientists in cancer. this would be a grave deficiencyindeed. However. we have taken pains to point out that the type plan we have in mind would include not only programmatic research where that is appropriate. but also major segments of much more loosely coordinated research where plans cannot be definitively laid out nor longrange objectives clearly specified. Our recommendations are specific that a national plan for the conquest of cancer should provide for the generous use of grants. as well as contracts and other methods of funding. We urge that there be increased emphasis on the grants mechanism in order to stimulate continued Independent exploration. particularly in those areas where knowledge is not sufficiently mature for a coordinated program aimed at reaching defined objectives. We also specifically pointed out that a coordinated national program plan should to the greatest possible extent. be generated by the voluntary productive interaction and joint planning of the scientists who will be responsible for doing the work. The program should not be the result. as it is today. of the happenstance of a multitude of random decisions independently arrived at. but should be an integrated and coherent plan resulting from the joint effort of representative scientists who will be responsible for its execution. This is fundamentally different from the hierarchical Imposition or direction of a research program from above. However. the effective use of collective planning does not mean that centralized administration or management of resources should be sacrificed. I can assure you that if there were anything in the thrust of our Report that deprived this effort of the contribution of the best of our basic scientists in cell biology and the other life sciences relevant to cancer. I would not have subscribed to the Report. However. I and the other basic scientists on the Committee support fully the findings and recommendations which have been made.",

The Committee estimates that a coordinated national program aimed at conquering cancer at the earliest possible time as envisaged by the Resolution of the Congress would require an appropriation In fiscal 1972 of approximately $400 million. This is slightly less than a doubling of the fiscal 71 appropriation. Thereafter. the cost of the program would increase at the rate of approximately $100 to $150 million per year. reaching a level of $800 million to $1 billion in 1976. We believe that a program of the type recommended is so important to the American people and to the world that the amounts called for should be provided even if it necessitates the raising of additional revenues. However. we also feel that it is of the utmost importance that the financing of this program not result in cutbacks in other health programs.",

The Panel of Consultants has limited itself to recommending nonmiraculous measures which we know can be backed up by scientific evidence or which can be pursued by scientific inquiry. but we need no miracles to anticipate progress. Some cancers are already being prevented. and surgery. radiotherapy and chemotherapy are already effective in curing some cancers. I concur with Dr. Farber that a broad wave of new insights. new understandings and new approaches has put within our reach a much higher plateau of achievement. It is realistic to believe that intensification of the assault on cancer at this time will produce acceleration of progress which can be measured in cancers prevented. cancers cured and lives saved. The longterm eventual reduction of the economic impact of cancer on our society is also a worthy goal. One by one the diseases which we identify as cancer will yield. It is not pie in the sky to point toward the day when preventive measures attain reduction of cancer attack rates from the one in four of us. who with todays knowledge will develop cancer. to a goal closer to one in ten. It is reasonable to hope that most cancers will be entirely curable using local. regional. and systemic therapies. This reasoned hope implies that eventually mortality would drop for the composite of all cancers from 65% to about 10%. I hold the view that a national program for the conquest of cancer is timely. now. It should be promptly initiated. effectively sustained. and relentlessly pursued.",

Wyomings secretary of state. is a very thoughtful and objective appraisal of the current status of the womens rights movement in the United States. Mrs. Thomson and I were both elected to public office in Wyoming in 1962. When I was Governor. we worked closely together because Mrs. Thomsons duties include serving as acting Governor of Wyoming when the Governor is absent from the State. Many of my colleagues have had the opportunity to know her because her husband. Keith Thomson. served 6 years in the Congress. All Members of Congress can gain a better understanding of the status of womens rights in this Nation by reading the analysis prepared by Thyra Thomson. She points out many of the reasons why women find themselves in lower paying jobs and emphasizes. as she has for years. the need for women to get as much education as possible before marriage and to update their skills whenever possible. In addition. Thyra Thomson does not overlook the very real need for women tobe different from men. As she says: I wish we could see equality as something we share with men instead of trying to be the same as men. Wyoming is known as the Equality State. Wyoming was the first territory and the first State to grant women equal rights. including the right to vote. Wyoming elected the first woman Governor in the United States.

The amendment does not propose to grant to postal employees something which was surrendered in collective bargaining.

It is difficult for me to conceive that the Congress. intent upon improving the economic status of postal employees through the Postal Reorganization Act. meant to deny them the fruits of any statutory liberalization of the health benefits programunless expressly varied. added to. or substituted for by those employees bargaining agents. However. I do conceive that intent of section 1005(f) of that act to provide that the benefits referred to therein would continue to apply to postal workers until such time as the negotiating parties agree to abandon or modify them. that is. that unless the parties expressly agree to changes. the referenced statutory provisions shall continue to apply to the Postal Service and to its officers and employees. Notwithstanding this view. the issue raised by the pending amendment is whether the Congress shall now. if not confirm. at least clarify its previous intent. by resolving the question of the applicability of this bill to the Postal Service. or whether it should leave that resolution to arbitration or to the courts.

They want to start.their negotiations where the other employees leave off. That is exactly what this amounts to. Let me point out to you the advantages that our friends have been able to obtain by collective bargaining. They negotiated for and obtained far reaching advantages and benefits which no other Federal employees can presently obtain. Let me list some of those advantages and benefits. and these are advantages that no other Federal employee has--not one of them. In the contract these are the advantages: First. no layoffs for the duration of the agreement. Second. retraining or new job locations for employees displaced by mechanized change. Third. a minimum of 4 hours pay for callin work. as compared with 2 hours in other agencies. and Fourth. disputes are subject to final and binding arbitration. There is not another single Federal employee who has those advantages. Then listen to this: They agreed to their contract in return for a more direct remuneration for their members totaling approximately $1.550 per individual. This included an immediate $300 bonus. plus salary increases of $1.200 for a 2year period. The postal employee has. thus. a $200 to $500 advantage over his equivalent fellow Government employee. So.

    "speech": "I am aware of a very recent affidavit by Mr. Bernard Cushman. the extremely able chief negotiator for the national postal unions. The substance of Mr. Cushmans affidavit is that. on July 20. after the parties reached agreement. he asked me whether. in view of the reference to \"current contribution level\" in the health benefits provision of the agreement. any changes which might be made in the law would apply. and that I answered \"yes.\" I do not remember this exchange. I have. however. great respect for Mr. Cushman and I do not doubt that he is sincere in his recollection. But any statement of mine could not have meant that a change in the Federal employees health benefits law which covers Federal employees generally but is not specifically made applicable to the Postal Service would nevertheless apply. Certainly. I would not. and could not. have agreed to such a change in the clear meaning of the written words of the agreement. on an issue of such magnitude. simply on the basis of incidental conversation after the agreement was concluded. What I did say. on many occasions. is that we would. of course. abide by any legislation enacted by the Congress which is applicable to the Postal Service. But this is entirely different from an open ended \"blank check\" commitment to casually add what could turn out to be hundreds of millions of dollars of additional costs to an already costly hardbargained settlement. In conclusion. Mr. Chairman. let me remind the subcommittee that the Postal Service is still in its formative early years and that what we do now casts a long shadow over the ways in which the Postal Service will develop. In this context. it is hard to imagine a more damaging legislative precedent than a law that grants either to postal management or to postal labor very substantial advantages that it failed to gainand agreed to forego In exchange for other gainsat the bargaining table. If such a law is enacted. the co:lective bargaining process would be severely impaired and the essential basis for successful employee relations in the Postal Service would be gravely undermined. This concludes my prepared statement and I will be glad to respond to questions.",

Mr. Cox. the thing that we are interested in is the understanding of the parties at the time of the collective bargaining agreement as to what items in fringe benefits were. in fact. negotiable items and as to which items the Congress maintains jurisdiction to improve over and above and beyond the collective bargaining agreement. In that regard. I would like to ask you. Mr. Cox. what your understanding is of the language contained in section 1005. subsection (d) of the Postal Reorganization Act. relative to retirement benefits as compared to a different language contained in that same section under subsection (f) as having application to health benefits? What distinction do you believe exists between those two fringe benefits and the manner in which they are to be handled both by the Postal Service and employee unions and the Congress. if there is any difference? Mr. Cox. Mr. Chairman. I think there is indeed a very sharp difference and I think that the fact that retirement benefits is treated in a subsection of section 1005. title 39. which is quite different from the subsection in which health benefits and unemployment insurance and life insurance and other fringes are treated in itself makes clear that there is intended to be a difference. I think the difference was most clearly delineated on the floor of the House in the middle of June of 1970. when Congressman Udall was explaining the whole question of what the bill that was then before the Houseand in respect to the matters that we are discussing here this morning. it was. I think. identical with what was finally enactedentailed. If it would be appropriate. I would be glad to hand up copies of a couple of pages from the Congressional Record.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on behalf of myself and 16 California colleagues from all parts of our State and both sides of the aisle. I am pleased to introduce legislation today to create the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The bill introduced is H.R. 10310. The purpose of this legislation is threefold. We want to protect the ecology of one of the last remaining natural salt marshes in southern California. We also want to assure that the important activities at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station can be continued. And we want to block construction of the proposed Pacific Coast Freeway right through the marsh and weapons station. where it has no business going. Today. nearly 70 percent of Californias prime coastal wetlands have already been dredged. filled. or otherwise lost to the fish and wildlife resources. Many waterfowl. shorebirds. and other waterassociated birds are dependent upon these coastal wetlands for their continued survival. especially during migration and wintering periods. The salt marshes we propose to include within the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge are contained within the boundaries of the naval weapons station. The Navy and the wildlife have lived in harmony at Seal Beach since the station was constructed in 1944. We want to keep it that way. This area now supports the largest known population of lightfooted clapper rails in California. estimated at 50 birds.. This rail is now in danger of becoming extinct due to the loss of its salt marsh habitat. Furthermore. the least tern and the brown pelican also utilize the area. All three species have been classified by the U.S. Department of Interior and the California Fish and Game Commission as \"endangered.\" Assigning refuge status to this area would offer additional protection over and above that provided under existing environmental protection laws.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Pan American Airways 747 accident on Friday. July 30. 1971. at San Francisco. Calif.. has again brought the problem of aircraft safety to the attention of the Congress. While the crew and passengers involved in this 747 accident apparently did not have emergency egress problems. the incident reminds us that there may be the possibility of a survivability accident in a 747type aircraft. In the past. many people have died in accidents simply because they could not evacuate the aircraft due to doors and exits being jammed closed by the impact. The cause of death in almost every case was fire and asphyxiation. What is appalling is the number of people who may be involved in an accident in one of our new generation jet aircraft that carry as many as 300 or more people. On June 6. 1971. an Allegheny Airlines Convair 440 crashed at New Haven. Conn.. and of the 31 passengers and crew involved. 28 died. A major portion of these deaths can be attributed to jammed doors. We cannot imagine the horrible consequences of a 747type aircraft. fully loaded. crashing and killing a major portion of the passengers and crew only because of jammed doors and exits. A new high energypyrotechnic and explosivesystem has been developed which can be utilized to open doors and exits in milliseconds during any postcrash situation. Variations of the same system have been proven in missiles. fighter/bomber aircraft. and in manned spacecraft such as Mercury. Gemini. and Apollo. The systems have been available for over 2 years. are said to be 100 percent reliable. quite inexpensive. and very safe in operation. However. these systems are not being used in either commercial air carriers or in military transport aircraft. It is my opinion that serious and immediate attention should be given this problem of emergency egress by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the military services. The development has been accomplished. the record is proven. and such systems should be applied as quickly as possible to our aircraft. A more detailed description of the egress system is described in the attached remarks which were given to the Committee on Science and Astronautics on July 22. 1971. by Mr. Hubert I. Bennett. president of Teledyne McCormick Selph:",

Senior citizens are hampered by lack of transportation. inadequate health care. high taxes. limited incomes which are depleted by inflation and many other problems that do not affect younger citizens and thereby escape their recognition.

My reason for reading this is to point out that the matter is under consideration. I do not know if the administration has reached a decision on it. I favor the idea suggested by the amendment. but whom are we going to let in there? There should be some limit. at least. to full membership. The states the Senator mentions do not address the issue fully.

Yet. when we look at the conditions in Greece and realize the retrogression that has taken place in that country. when we see the total cessation of the development of ideas and freedom in that nation. then. I think we realize that the best way to help the Greek people is to help move their country back toward the democracy she had before the present junta took over that nation. We must also consider the role of Greece in NATO. She is very valuable to us as a member on NATOs southern perimeter. and is one of the southern anchors of the alliance.

As the direct result of this refusal. the implacement of SAM missile sites along the Suez Canal went unnoticed for several weeks by United States and Israeli intelligence sources. In addition. I would like to bring some Interesting economic facts to the attention of the Senate. These are facts that have taken place in Greece since the military took over. This information can be verified through international agencies and from the Bank of Greece itself. Totalitarian governments sometimes seek to justify the denial of freedom by pointing to their material accomplishments. The Greek junta has tried this too. but its chief accomplishment has been to bring Greece to the verge of bankruptcy. In the first 4 years of the juntas rule. Greeces balance of payments deficit on current account came to about $11/3 billion. for 1970 alone it came to over $410 million. And. in the first 6 months of this year it came to over $275 million-$31 million more than last years deficit for the same period. Each year the junta has achieved new record deficits. This years will be the biggest yet. it may reach $700 million. To meet this deficit. the junta has borrowed huge sums in supplies credits and other forms of shortterm loans at high rates of interest. Annual interest payments onthe Greek foreign debt tripled between 1966. the last full year before the coup. and 1970.",

It is the peoples and not the NATO treaty on which we must place reliance. If we are to start tailoring our foreign aid to the internal politics of the recipient countries. and if we are to use as our standard New England variety town hall democracy. then we ought to extend the restrictive language in the bill to include such countries as Argentina. Brazil. Haiti. Nicaragua. Iran. Iraq. Syria. Turkey. Burma. Ethiopia. Ghana. Sudan. and Tunisia. to name just a few. But I think we should extend our aid to those peoples who are in needand Lord knows the Greek people are in needand also to nations where it serves our defense interest to aid those nations. I know. as the Senator from Indiana has mentioned. that we were denied the use of bases in Greece recently for the use of certain aircraft. but certainly the French and the Italians have denied us the use of their bases at a time when Israel was in critical need. while Greece did not deny us. I feel that we should be consistent in our policies and that we should not be punitive in the application of our policies.

It is assistance to the Greek people and here we are being called upon to give a gratuitous slap in the face to the people of Greece by providing that no economic or military assistance should be given by the United States to Greece. Certainly it would seem to me that if. as has been stated. the desire of those who would prohibit aid to Greece is to serve notice on the people of Greece that the people of the United States and those who are Members of the Senate and House of Representatives do not favor the junta in Greece. why do we not level an attack against other nations who do not have what we would consider to be a democratic government? Mr. President. there are four pages of names of countries who are to be the recipients of military and economic assistance under the bill. I daresay we could not find a dozen governments in the whole list on the four pages of the names of the countries that have a democracy as we would define or term it here in the United States. What about the Government of Portugal. which is the recipient of aid? What about the Government of Spain? When did they last have an election in Spain? I should like to inquire. what about Jordan. which is a large recipient of our aid? What about Saudi Arabia. that immensely wealthy country with all the oil wells that it has? What about Syria. a recipient listed here? What about Turkey. a beneficiary to the extent of $328 million last year? When did they last have an election in Turkey? Yet we single out Greece. There is another country. Pakistan. which is near civil war between East and West Pakistan. There is a little item in here of a quarter of a billion dollars for relief for refugees in Pakistan.

I wish to call attention to the fact that what the Senator said may be true with respect to other States. but the State I represent has been without a State income tax. The one reason they never have had It is that in the State constitution there is a provision that all taxes must be equal and proportional. which has been interpreted as meaning that if the State had an income tax. all persons would have to pay the same rate. If a mans income were $5.000 he would have to pay the same rate that another man pays on his $100.000. Repeatedly attempts have been made to amend the constitution. So in this instance you have a State where the hands of the officials are tied because it cannot secure enough of the popular vote to amend the constitution and an income tax would be most unjust in the present circumstances. While I am on my feet. If the Senator will be patient with me for 2 minutes. this Senator has found the situation extremely difficult. In fact. if the amendment had not been adopted this morning on the limitation of moneys for social services this Senator might have voted against the entire bill because I have great trouble with the theory of this bill that puts a penalty on frugality in a State and puts a premium on profligacy. It is nice to say we still take care of the States in the proportion they are disposed to take care of themselves. That sounds good. but it is a pressure from the Federal Government and the State that gouges its citizens the most gets the most money from the Federal Government. For that reason. I have been extremely unhappy about this bill. As I said. I was in doubt until the time we added the amendment that was agreed to this morning as to what I would do about this bill. But in the case of New Hampshire. it is unjust to penalize the State where it is unable because of its State constitution. which was adopted shortly after the Revolutionary War. to have a progressive income tax.",

There is one differencewe will have removed the last vestige of local government. New Hampshire. every State. and every city of this Union becomes a vassal of the Federal Government. In fact. they are almost that already. That is what they are complaining about. Every city is complaining that it does not have money to provide the services. enough money to do what is needed. And they say. \"Give us stringsunattached Federal money.\" But let us not forget that \"stringsunattached Federal money\" comes from income tax dollars collected from everybody paying income taxes. I do not like to talk about fiscal irresponsibility. because I think that is a phrase which means absolutely nothing. I am talking about two things. I am talking about the bankruptcy of the United States of America. I am talking about the real problem of devaluing the dollar. We have had a devaluation of the dollar once. This administration is going to try not to have it devalued again before the election. but before next year ends. that dollar will be devalued substantially. The run on It is so great that it is almost beyond control. I have been in New Hampshire. It has great communities. The committee bill will destroy the town meetings and the towns will have to give up. There will be no local responsibility. Every dollar of their taxes will come from the Federal Government. If we follow the Hartke tax credit scheme. if one paid $200 in local income taxes he could take a credit of $100. which means against this Federal tax liability.

As I read the colloquy which the Senator from Mississippi had with the Senator from Arkansas . it really does not exactly meet the point. as he phrased the question. I think it is important to see whether the legislative history could be made crystal clear that no implication can or should be read into the passage of the Selective Service Act which could represent an implied congressional authorization of the Vietnam war. The colloquy had 2 parts. One was the view of the Senator from Mississippi thatBecause this is a manpower bill for all our forces. as the Senator knows. we are not proceeding with anything except -the rendering of services particularly in this sudden transition unless we could pass the bill. That is one quote. The other is. in response to a question from the Senator from Arkansas Is that the equivalent of the Senators saying the Court was wrong in the -way -it interpreted the matter?",

If I had written this opinion as a lawyer. I think I would have rejected that concept. I agree with the Senator from Mississippi. I think the courts were wrong. They are very distinguished judges.

In other words. the decision was made to have the convention in San Diego on the 23d of July. and still on some date in September you felt it was necessary to inform the Attorney General of the efforts being made to have the convention located in San Diego? Mr. RErNEcKE. Yes. sir. So on the record there is a flat contradiction between the former Attorney General and the Lieutenant Governor of California about whether Mitchell knew anything about the ITTSheraton offer or the convention. And then. there is the matter of the dramatic change of stories which Lieutenant Governor Reinecke and his aide Edgar Gillenwaters suddenly produced on March 3. 1972. after the hearings had begun and the reason for that change. Mr. Mitchell told us he had nothing to do with Reineckes change in his story. I read again from the testimony of the hearings: Now I am curious to know. did you on March 3 of this year discuss with Mr. Reinecke on the telephone his meetings with you?",

January 26. the President of the United States submitted to the Congress a message covering what was termed the \"unfinished business\" of the 91st Congress. In listing these items the President requested that they be made the first order of business for the 92d Congress. It should be noted that some of these proposals had been acted upon by the Senate. Some were passed in the form in which they were submitted. Others were modified to meet legitimate concerns. It is my understanding that all but a very few of them received a full degree of consideration. At this time I wish to report that the Presidents message has been referred and the various committees involved have been appropriately notified. Draft proposals on the various items mentioned by the President in this message are beginning to be received from the administration. As they are referred to the committees. the majority leadership is fully confident that they shall receive the appropriate priority fitting for a Presidential request. The full attention of the committees is thus requested. including necessary hearings. reports. studies. investigations. and all other actions involved in according any matter full consideration. To be sure. changes will be made in some of the proposals to meet various impairments that will become apparent during consideration. I do think. however. that as the majority party in the Senate. we are obliged to pledge our full cooperation in considering each of the Presidents requests. Therefore. the program outlined in this message will be disposed of with the same degree of diligence and high regard that is accorded any proposal that is submitted to the Congress as a request of the President of the United States. Finally. Mr. President. I have directed that a compilation of items based on the Presidents message of January 26 be prepared. This compilation identifies the measure very briefly. and indicates the date on which any supporting draft proposal was forwarded.

Fifteen countries have limits of 4 to 10 miles. 40 others have a 12mile limit. and 11 have limits ranging all the way up to 200 miles. The United States proposed late last year at a meeting of the U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of the Seabed in Geneva. that 12 miles be set as a standard limit on a nations territorial waters. There would be recognition of the right of transit through straits used for international navigation between one part of the high seas and another. At that meeting. the United States also proposed the establishment of international bodies to regulate fisheries and to insure conservation of the oceans resources.

At a minimum. the Agency for International Development should have surveyed the Vietnamese situation and determined what kind of foods would be acceptable to the Vietnamese. Instead. the United States chose to send bulgur which. while acceptable to Western palates. is considered livestock feed by the South Vietnamese. In addition. the memorandum reveals that Ambassador Bunker is seeking the approval of officials in Washington to provide 7.000 tons of additional bulgur during 1972. Supposedly the additional bulgur will be used to assist Montagnard tribesmen in rice deficient areas and to provide processed wheat to Vietnamese and government institutions. I have asked Director Hannah to assure the Congress and the American people that the shipment of 7.000 tons of wheat will feed hungry human beings. not pigs and cattle. The concept of the food for peace program is to provide assistance to hungry refugees and war victims. It is a sound concept. But the reality of Vietnam and the terrible conflict there has perverted our food for peace program into a corrupt system that provides money for merchants. feed for pigs. and not enough help for the innocent victims of the Indochina war.

Ambassador Bunker writes: \"Many recipients . . . were given this unfamiliar commodity with little or no knowledge of Its food value and method of preparation.

It was the ultimate act of stupidity to send $28.7 million worth of wheat to South Vietnam without determining whether it would be used to feed hungry people or pigs. One would have to assume that the Agency for International Development would have the foresight to investigate whether American food would be used to feed the hungry or the livestock. Ambassador Bunker. in his cablegram. also indicates that the South Vietnamese are requesting an additional 7.000 tons of processed wheat for 1972. Supposedly the additional 7.000 tons would be used to assist Montagnard tribesmen and Vietnamese government institutions. I can hope that you can assure the Congress and the American people that the new shipment of 7.000 tons of wheat will feed hungry human beings. not pigs and cattle. All of us would agree that needy Vietnamese refugees. orphans and war victims should be given assistance. I presume in the future your agency plans to help the hungry rather than supply grain meal for livestock. I hope that you will give this matter your immediate attention. Sincerely.",

I dislike taking a position opposite to my distinguished and beloved friend. chairman of the committee that does have the responsibility for financing measures passed by the House. but I think this whole thing should be put in perspective. The leadership of the House is for the bill and encouraged the Committee on Banking and Currency. which has jurisdiction in this area. to bring this bill out. It has been said we have done this twice before. or words to that effect. that we did it in the revenuesharing bill. I suppose I have had as many mayors come to my office as anybody in the Congress. My understanding from them is what they need that money mainly for services. money they generally would use if they had revenues available from their own resources. Now. the Public Works bill. would provide for sewage treatment plants. That is important. It is one thing to clean up. it is another thing to deliver. Cities and towns all over the United States need water lines and sewer lines. I have had more petitions for this kind of service than for any kind of service that has been brought to my attention by the mayors and civic leaders of this country. This is what we are seeking to do here. It is true that it complements the other measures. but it also brings immediate relief to communities all over the country. I do not believe any programs that the Congress has ever passed have been more popular than the various community facilities programs we have had. We need all these things. We need to balance our resources among all of them. We should not do twothirds of the job. we should do the whole job and pass this bill.",

I listened to the argument of the gentleman from Texas. our distinguished colleague. about the amount of money involved here. Well. there is a lot of money involved here. But I happened to attend a meeting at the White House. a bipartisan meeting at the beginning of this session of the Congress. when Mr. Shultz. who is now the Secretary of the Treasury. he was then in some kind of an economic zone. He had a chart showing proposed spending. He said that the administration would embrace deficit spending in order to pull us out of the recession. This. in fact. embraces what Mr. Shultz himself recommended as an economic measure to help the country reduce unemployment and end the recession which is still with us.

Mr. Chairman. let me say very clearly that if the Congress was not going to pass general revenue sharing. and if the Congress was not going to pass a good water quality act. then I think there might be some justification for this bill.

We have passed. and the other body has passed. and it is now in conference. a water quality act that calls over a 3year period for almost $19 billion in Federal expenditures for clean water. And there is inevitable duplication between that bill and the bill before us today. Let me quote from the bill. H.R. 11896. the socalled Blatnik bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act on page 264. section 212. under the title \"Definitions\" it says. in section (2) (A)and I read this to you. because it proves beyond a question of a doubt that the bill we have before us today is a duplication of what we passed a few weeks ago: The term \"treatment works\" means any devices and systems used in the storage. treatment. recycling. and reclamation of municipal sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid nature to Implement section 201 of this Act. or necessary to recycle or reuse water at the most economical cost over the estimated life of the works. including intercepting sewers. outfall sewers. sewage collection systems. pumping. power. and other equipment. and their appurtenances ... Now how many times do we have tc scrub our ecology image at the cost ol the taxpayers? We have done it with general revenue sharing. We will do it witi the Water Quality Act.

While it is true that Asian Americans have surmounted legal. economic. political. educational. and social barriers. the facts indicate that. in all too many instances. the remnants of prejudice and bigotry still pervade our society and that the Federal Government should be aware of the problems confronting the Asian American community. Thanks largely to the efforts of Chairman HOLIFIELD and Congressman MATSUNAGA. many Americans were made aware of the tragic history of the incarceration of the Japanese Americans during World War II. We have done much to repudiate the over 500 Federal. State. and local laws and ordinances directed against JapaneseAmericans in 1941. We have done much to repudiate the philosophy which allowed the evacuation of 110.000 JapaneseAmericans and allowed their imprisonment in refugee camps. But. what do we know about the prejudice that occurred after the war? What do we know about the effect of imprisonment on JapaneseAmerican culture? We know that as a percentage of the population. more JapaneseAmericans served in combat in World War II than any other American nationality. But despite their heroic efforts in defense of their adopted country. hatred still existed. They returned to their homes and farms to find that they had been confiscated. They returned. not to a welldeserved heros welcome. but rather to find that JapaneseAmerican names had been stricken from communitysponsored plaques and monuments that were placed to honor American war dead. They returned to find that camp life had broken down the heretofore greatest strength of the JapaneseAmerican groupfamily unity. They found that family discipline. the keystone of JapaneseAmerican social control. was eliminated by the communal living imposed by evacuation. The culminating effect of evacuation was the devastation of JapaneseAmerican family life and social control. History has not only been unjust to the JapaneseAmerican. but it has also unjustly treated other Asian American groups.",

Ways and Means Chairman WILBUR MILLS was a featured star of the well attended function in Pueblo and in Denver in behalf of my colleague FRANK EVANS and the Democratic Party of Colorado. On Saturday. December 11. Chairman MILLS came to my State of Wyoming for a press conference regarding his Presidential bid. and a fruitful meeting with the Democratic Party members of my State. That evening at Cheyennes famous Hitching Post WILBUR MILLS was the honored speaker at a banquet attended by more than 560 persons. an outstanding turnout for any political affair in any State. let alone for the State of Wyoming so justly famous for its high altitudes but low multitudes. WILBUR MILLS fielded numerous questions for well over 45 minutes on a wide range of relevant issues on which next years presidential election will be based Even the usually reserved elements of our Democratic Party. our progressive and labor leaders of Western States. came away from these meetings with a newly discovered appreciation of the WILBUR MILLS appeal to the people of America. Said several of Wyomings outstanding leaders: I am favorably reassessing this great man and the impact he can have on a victorious Democratic ticket next year. Mr. Speaker. I do not know what Chairman WILBUR MILLS intentions may be regarding those States with Democratic presidential primaries. but I do know that in States such as in Colorado and Wyoming where delegate selection will be left to the people of the party. WILBUR MILLS is making great strides. His calm. judicious. knowledgeable strength appeals to the people of the party. I believe his trip to the Rocky Mountain States of Colorado and Wyoming this weekend will assure WILBUR MILLS delegate support in those States and in the remaining eight States of the Rocky Mountain region.",

Mr. ST GERMAIN further states that he hopes that \"if this be the case that the taxpayers will be repaid for the sums that have been spent for this before these fat profits are made by certain mints in this country.\" I want to state that Mr. ST GERMAIN is in error. The ARBC has no contracts with any mints in this country and no mint is producing anything for the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission. Therefore. there are no taxpayer dollars involved and there are no taxpayer dollars that will. therefore. have to be repaid. I believe that what has confused Mr. ST GERMAIN iS the fact that some State bicentennial commissions. including the Rhode Island Bicentennial Commission. have contracted with a private mint to produce sets of commemorative medals for the State bicentennial commissions. These medals have been sold. to the general public and the bulk of the profits have accrued to the various State bicentennial commissions. However. even in these transactions. taxpayer dollars were not involved. Rather. the State bicentennial commissions have actually saved taxpayer dollars by using the profits from the sale of the. commemorative medals to run their commissions. otherwise. the necessary funds would have necessitated appropriations from the various State legislatures.",

I believe. impossible to justify the sacrifice of even a portion of our historic individual freedom for a purpose such as this.

The Railroad Passenger Corporation could contract with the railroads to pull the passenger cars in areas where.there \ufffdiS not sufficient passenger revenue to suppbrt:.a Separate passenger train. - The railfoads thus would retain a cer= tain responsibility for maintaining passenger service. instead of chucking it entirely and making it theresponsibility of a Governmentrun corporation. Some of the mail could continue to. move by train: to remote areas of the country where airline service is poor or nonexistent. For my own State of Nebraska. this would mean the retention of passenger service\" along the Union Pacific line from Omaha .west through such comminities as Fremont. Columbus. Grand Island. Kearney. Lexington. North Platte. Ogallala. Sidney. and Kimball. For Senators HANSEN and MCGEE of .Wyoming. and for Senators MANSFIELD and METCALF of Montana. it would save railroad passenger service. It is simple. it is reasonable. and it will work. Mr. President. It ought to be tried.",

Although we have expanded our efforts to attack this problem in the past several years to include a very modest level of addict rehabilitation and drug abuse education programs. we still rely largely upon law enforcement at our borders to prevent the entry of illegal narcotics.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last year more than 120.000 civilian employees of the Department of Defense were involuntarily released from service as the result of reductions authorized by Congress and personnel reductions ordered by the administration. The Civil Service Commission estimates that reductions will continue to occur in Federal agencies through at least fiscal year 1972. with the major impact being felt in defense and space programs. The continuing nature of these reductions makes the need for congressional action urgent. Legislation should be passed before the next round of layoffs in order to ease the impact of Job loss upon individuals who are separated. and on the operations of the agency undergoing the reduction. Therefore. I am introducing a bill to permit the early retirement of Federal employees during major reductions in force by a Federal department or agency. In view of the need to ease as much as possible the personnel dislocation caused by changing Federal priorities. this bill would permit Federal employees who are at least age 50 and have 20 years service. or who have 25 years service regardless of age. to retire early during major reductions in force. even though their specific jobs are not abolished by the cutback. The bill requires the Civil Service Commission to determine when a reduction in force is major and to fix the time within which employees could exercise the option to retire. While the Civil Service Commission permitted early retirements at some defense installations last year. this was done administratively on a limited basis. My bill would write the authority into the Civil Service Retirement Act and would make it applicable Governmentwide. The bill in no way diminishes the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission or the agency to insure that an early optional retirement is the result of the employees voluntary action. In other words. it is not to be used by an agency to get rid of certain employees. Also. the bill does not change the agencys responsibility to help employees involuntarily separated to try to find other Federal employment if they wish to continue to work. The bill has been endorsed by the Civil Service Commission. the Department of Defense. and the White House. In light of the gravity of the current unemployment situation. I hope the House and Senate will give prompt attention to the measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the Welfare Department frantically announces unprecedented increases in the number of welfare recipients. now being added at a rate of approximately 3.4 million persons per year. figures on the population growth and identification of the additions to the rolls provide an interesting analysis. The greatest increase of welfare recipients is in the category of ADC or aid to families with dependent children. For the most part this is tax money going to unwed mothers to support illegitimate childrenfederally subsidized immorality and illegitimacy. The 1970 census figures indicate that the Negro population has increased 20 percent over the last 10 years while the white population increased by 12 percent. If this is the equal status desired by the social scientists. that is. to have racially balanced population of black to white. all taxpayers must agree this is one Federal subsidy which is on target. Contrary to the fatalistic philosophy advocated by the population explosion crowd. the welfare growth figures would seem but to reemphasize a crying need for the teaching of morality to our young and more rigid enforcement of the illegitimacy laws by our States. These figures could well be interpreted to show with dramatic import the human cost to our society by the removal of prayer from schools and replacement with such promiscuity inducing innova. tions as sex education. birth control sensitivity training and abortion.

Just now. the Treasury Department is publishing its annual summary of \"Federal Aid to States.\" covering fiscal year 1970. which ended last June. After more than 8 months. I have finally secured a handwritten copy of this valuable report. And though the Treasuryj warns that the statistics are subject to final review prior to release in printed form. I have found this information most interesting. I note with interest. for example. that the total of Federal grantinaid payments to State and local governments in fiscal year 1970 increased by nearly $4 billion to a figure of $24.194.090.576. As background information for my colleagues in Congress. particularly in light of our consideration of the various programs to share Federal revenues with State and local governments. I have prepared a comparison table of the 1969 and 1970 fiscal year distribution of grantsinaid. A detailed breakdown of the 1969 fiscal year grantsinaid payments is available in the Treasury Departments 23page booklet entitled \"Federal Aid to States.\" I am advised that a similar booklet to cover 1970 fiscal year grants is forthcoming soon.

His efforts to get better acquainted with the Red Chinese have a potential for furthering improved international relations and world peace and I support those efforts. Let me take this opportunity. however. to remind the President of our longstanding commitment to the Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan. still recognized by the United States as the legitimate Government of China. Last summer I had the opportunity to visit Taiwan when I was invited to participate in the Nationalist Chinese observance of Captive Nations Week. Visiting with the Chinese living in Taiwan. I was reminded. as I now remind the President. that the Chinese Communists have forced thousands of people to leave their homeland and to live in exile rather than live under Communist domination. As the President meets with Chou Enlai. I hope that he will bear in mind that Chou recently stated that the primary objective of the Red Chinese is still the takeover of Taiwan. The Nationalist Chinese are our old friends. and the Communist Chinese tell their people that the United States is their enemy. While our best wishes for a successful journey will be with the President when he departs tomorrow. at the same time I join in expressing my own belief that improved international relations can never result from neglecting old allies. I hope the President shares this bclief and that we will continue our mutually beneficial relationship with the Nationalist Chinese for many years to come.",

That such a trip could even occur makes the mission a success. and demonstrates the progress that has been made in striving for better international relations and world peace. We have progressed from mutual distrust and constant fear. past the nowfamous \"pingpong diplomacy\" which helped to break the ice. and now we are able to look beyond old verbal assaults in favor of the rational exchanges of ideas. I commend the President for journeying along the path that has led to these landmark discussions. And I share his hope that the groundwork for future cooperation is being established with this trip. To envision the scope of this occasion and its total meaning for the United States is a very difficult task. I am sure that most of us applaud this effort to foster peaceful discussion and understanding. The Presidents journey will surely have a big impact. Many issues will be discussed. including basic questions affecting Nationalist China. With this in mind. I would like to voice my concern for our ally on Taiwan. Newsweek magazine. February 21. 1972. reported that. on Taiwan. applications for passports have jumped to a record 5.000 a month. The Taiwanese are seemingly afraid that we will become estranged because of our recent friendliness with mainland China. We have been assured by the President. however. that he will not lose sight of our ally. and that we will continue to honor our friendship with. and defense commitments to Taiwan. It is unfortunate Nationalist China has been cast into the background. especially after its ouster from the United Nations. This leaves a nation of over 16 million people who are not represented in this world body. I hope that this situation will be speedily remedied. Our talks with Peking must not be construed as dissolving our relationship with Taiwan. We must recognize that no predetermined strategy has been negotiated with China. except for the fact that we are trying to normalize our relationship. This can be done without shortchanging Chiang Kaishek. The necessity for constructive consultation between countries is all too obvious. Consultation encourages understanding. Understanding leads to cooperation which insures peace. Mr. Speaker. I would like to express my best wishes to the President. knowing that he has the interests of world peace at heart.",

Since the text of this convention was unanimously approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. 75 countries have ratified it.

Apparently the Navy has paid at least $25 million in provisional payments to Avondale Shipbuilding. Avondale. La.. after the civilian claims board totally rejected a $73.5 million claim by Avondale. Even though the civilian claims board rejected the claim. the Navy is trying to quietly sneak this $25 million payment through. This is like spanking a bad boy with one hand while giving him candy with the other. Avondale attempted to settle its claim with $73.5 million in July. The chairman of the civilian claims board. Mr. Gordon Rule. rejected the claim. Subsequently. Mr. Rule was removed from the board as its chairman and the board was abolished. In January. upon the directive of the Chief of Naval Material. an all military board was assigned the task of making final judgment on claims. Before it was revealed in the press that Gordon Rule had been in effect transferred from his job as chairman of the claims board. the Navy was prepared to announce Monday that the $25 million had been made to Avondale. Strangely. the news was held up because of news reports that Mr. Rule had been transferred and his board eliminated. Now claims are in the hands of the military. Military controls means a bonanza for shipbuilders and it looks like the boondoggle has already begun with the $25 million claim to Avondale. The Navy apparently told reporters that it plans to adhere to Rules original decision on the Avondale claims. The payment of $25 million surely calls this into question. Now that Mr. Rule and other civilians have been pushed aside. the Navy apparently believes provisional paymentswhich undoubtedly will become permanent settlementscan be made.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. of the many inequities which must be eliminated in our social security system. one which is particularly disturbing cries out for immediate rectification. A number of my senior citizen constituents who are widows or widowers have complained that the present provision in the social security laws terminating or reducing widows or widowers benefits upon remarriage has the effect of chilling. for financial reasons. their desires to remarry. Let me explain what they mean. Under present law a widow receives 71.5 percent of her husbands benefits upon reaching the age of 60 and receives 82.5 percent of these benefits at the age of 62. and the widower receives 82.5 percent of his wifes benefits at the age of 62. Once the widow or widower remarries. however. these benefits are reduced to 50 percent. provided he or she is over 60. If the widow or widower is under age 60 upon remarriage. the benefit eligibility is terminated entirely. Thus. in effect. these laws compel them either to live lives of loneliness or to have relationships without the benefit of marriage. For many such persons. and particularly for those with strong religious and moral beliefs. this poses a terrible dilemma. What my bill would do would be to eliminate those provisions in the social security laws whose effect is to terminate or reduce widows or widowers benefits upon remarriage. Our older citizens are experiencing a very difficult time meeting their everyday minimum financial needs. and they are especially hardhit by inflationary food prices. escalating medical costs. and rising rents. Is it not outrageous for the Government to penalize those who would remarry by reducing their social security benefits upon such remarriage? Surely it is ironic that a society which often criticizes the lifestyle and permissive attitudes of the young at the same time encourages outofwedlock relationships among its older citizens.",

For more than half a century. Dorothy Kenyon was in the forefront of the fight for womens rights and social reform. Her life was marked by compassion. dedication. and an untiring effort to make this a more just world. A graduate of Smith College and New York University Law School. Judge Kenyon was appointed by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to a judgeship on the New York City Municipal Court in 1939. Following her service on the bench. she served as a member of the League of Nations Committee on the Status of Women. She continued this work with the United Nations. championing the fight for greater participation of women in that organization and its agencies. and spearheading a drive to establish equal rights for women under an international treaty. Judge Kenyon was one of the earliest directors of the American Civil Liberties Union. was past president of the Consumers League of New York. and served on the National Board of Americans for Democratic Action. A stanch believer in political reform. Judge Kenyon was an early leader in the New York Reform Democratic movement. which was founded in the late 1950s by Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert H. Lehman. among others. She was a guiding spirit in her neighborhood Reform Clubthe New Chelsea Club for Democrats. It was a privilege for me to know her and work with her in the fight to democratize the New York Democratic Party. Not one to allow the passing years to slow her down.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was shocked at recent statements attributed to our former colleague. Donald Rumsfeld. who. in his capacity as Director of the Cost of Living Council. expressed concern about rising livestock prices and said consideration was being given to increasing meat import quotas. It is inconceivable to me that anyone would even consider beating down livestock prices which have just now reached the level of 20 years ago. The livestock producer cannot be accused of receiving Government subsidy. Traditionally. cattle producers have abhorred any Government tampering with the free market system. Rather. they are subsidizing the housewives of America. If American consumers were spending the same percentage of their takehome pay for food as they did 20 years ago. they would be spending in the range of 40 percent more-$40 billion morefor farmproduced food per year than they do now. Between 1969 and 1970. the typical American family paid $47 more for its yearly \"market basket\" of foodand the farmers share of that went down $4. Who is subsidizing whom? I would suggest that the administration look elsewhere than at the farmer or livestock producer in its attempts to control grocery price increases. Many of us who represent rural areas felt the Meat Import Control Act with its annual 10percent escalator in authorized imports of beef. veal. and mutton was very generous. We now import well over a billion pounds of meat each year. principally from Australia and New Zealand. Although realized net income from farming is expected to be about $1 billion higher in 1972 as compared with last year. the farmer still has only about threefourths as much per capita disposable income as do nonfarm people. American consumers spend only 15.5 percent of their disposable income on food. It is the best bargain in the world. It would make no sense to penalize the farmer and livestock producer for that type of efficiency by increasing his foreign competition just after we have experienced the largest trade deficit in our history. If. indeed. serious consideration is being given to increased meat import quotas. I urge that move be abandoned without delay. It is the wrong way to go.",

Our trade with South Africa is $700 million and their trade with us. is $43 million. The United States has already acted. and has as its declared policy a prohibition upon any army equipment. ammunition. or materiel going to South Africa. Why? Because our country wanted to show its disfavor with South Africas policy of apartheid. We know that there is discrimination all over the world. We might even include Rhodesia. but I do not know of any other country which has officially and governmentally made discrimination its national policy. Not only has it made discrimination a policy both economically and socially. but it has passed laws to prevent the courts from adjudicating or giving due process to all its citizens. What we are talking about today is official policy toward South Africa because of its apartheid policy and not toward private enterprise or private trade. I think the least we can do as a congressional body in disapproval of apartheid is to show in this respect of a sugar quota that we do not have to give to South Africa access to a public program of the U.S. Government.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this legislation extends for 3 years the system of pricefixing. quotas. and subsidies for domestic sugar producers. In order to assure the 28.000 U.S. sugar producers of high prices and profits. the Sugar Act imposes a large but hidden tax on 200 million American consumers and hundreds of thousands of U.S. food processors. The continuation of this subsidy flies in the face of sound international economic policy and contains inflexible new expropriation procedures which could cause major foreign policy complications. I cannot vote for a bill which retains benefits for South Africa and Haiti. but which refuses to guarantee housing and fair representation for 150.000 overworked and underpaid sugar workers. The sugar worker protection amendment which I offered would have mitigated the negative effects of the Sugar Act by spreading the benefits of the subsidy to those who need it most. I recognize that if the Sugar Act were to be abolished today. these innocent farmworkers would suffer. For that reason. I voted for a 1year extension which would have afforded ample time for the Government to come to grips with the problem of job loss. but I cannot justify the longterm continuation of inflationary subsidies which this bill calls for. I also recognize that the artificially high U.S. price of sugar works to the disadvantage of U.S. confectioners and food processors. causing them to lose business and jobs to foreign competitors who pay the free market price for sugar. They should be freed from the competitive disadvantages imposed on them by the sugar subsidy. The victory which the sugar lobby will undoubtedly win today is won at the expense of American consumers and farmworkers and grocers and food processors. I hope it is its last victory.",

The House approved a total authorization of $3.433.080.000. The Senate in its action on the authorization bill amended H.R. 7109. approving a total of $3.280.850.000. an amount $152.230.000 less than that voted by the House. The conferees are recommending a total authorization of $3.354.950.000. an amount $83.600.000 above the NASA request. $78.130.000 below the House bill. and $74.100.000 above the amount approved by the Senate. Mr. President. in adjusting the difference between the Senate- and Housepassed versions of H.R. 7109. the conferees agreed upon $2.603.200.000 for the 12 programs in the research and development section of the bill. The Senate had authorized $2.543.200 for these programs. an amount $124.400.000 less than the House. The conference agreement therefore is $64.4 million less than provided by the House and $60 million more than provided by the Senate. For the construction of facilities the conferees agreed to an authorization of $58.400.000. an amount $2.1 million above the NASA request and that approved by the Senate. The final agreement is $230.000 below the amount approved by the House. and adopts the identification of each facility authorized as set forth in the Senate amendment. For research and program management the NASA requested $697.350.000. The House authorized $706.850.000 and the Senate approved $681.350.000 with a limitation of $517.916.000 on the amounts that could be spent for personnel and related costs. The conferees agreed to $693.350.000. an amount $4 million below the NASA request. $13.5 million below the House bill. and $12 million above the amount approved by the Senate. The limitation on personnel and related costs was retained by the conferees at $529.916.000. an amount $12 million above the amount included in the Senate amendment to H.R. 7109.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I shall support the conference report. I think it is significant that as Apollo XV is on its way to the moon. we in the U.S. Senate are passing an authorization act for 1 more year of activity for the space program. Several things in this bill are worth noting. One is an improvement in the authorization language over what it has been in the past. I refer particularly to the construction. Heretofore. we have authorized. in rather block manner. construction at a certain location. In this bill. the Senate provided for naming specific facilities to be built. modified. or improved. That view prevailed in the conference. and I believe it is a gain toward good Government and more efficient Government. When we stop to consider that in 1966 the space program was spending almost $6 billion and that it is down now to a little more than $3 billion. we can see the benefits of annual authorizations. I regret very much that our authorization bill is not completed each year before the appropriation bill starts on its way through the House of Representatives and the Senate. because in many instances the action of the legislative committees. in a sense. is predetermined by action already taken by the appropriations committees or the House or the Senate as a whole.

Each year over 1.500 new cases are discovered. and more than 5.000 victims require hospitalization. The facts are grim. The prognosis is uncertain.

For many long years. we have done little or nothing to deal with the pain and suffering caused by this disease. Until very recently. sickle cell anemia has been one of the most neglected of all deadly diseases. It is estimated that over 2 million Americans carry the sickle cell trait. Although data is incomplete. the disease appears to have been concentrated primarily among blacks. Approximately one out of every 500 black births produces a child affected with the disease. Of these. over half die before the age of 20. This is an incidence far greater. than other severe childhood diseases. such as leukemia. cystic fibrosis. and muscular dystrophy. There is no known cure for sickle cell anemia. And we have been making very little concerted effort to find one. Our neglect of this disease is a disgrace. Government and private expenditures have been inadequate. its victims have been neglected. This is what S. 2676 attempts to correct. This legislation is not the final answer. but it is a first- step. It is a significant first step because we finally have recognized that sickle cell anemia is a national health problema problem that requires a strong national commitment.

I do that as one who has been an early and strong supporter of child development legislation and one who applauds the sincere and constructive efforts of all of those on both sides of this question to bring to this floor the kind of child development bill that could generate the broad support that would assure continued and adequate funding of one of the mcst important and needed programs in the area of education that can come before this Congress. The need still is for the kind of a bill which will provide the legislative framework which can mobilize and organize and direct the resources and manpower and collective concerns of this country and apply them toward the obvious needs of young children. The bill which was originally introducedand indeed the bill as it emerged from the subcommitteestill offered a real hope for providing that kind of leadership and that kind of impetus. It was a good bipartisan bill. But that is not the bill before us today. The bill before us today has been significantly redirected to the point that there is no real hope for generating the kind of meaningful State participationparticipation of the whole partnership of States and communities. the private sector and the Federal Governmentthat is essential for success. If our goal is. as I believe it should be. to help young children. to develop the kinds of services that will identify and respond to the needs of young children. then this bill will not do it. The early childhood services that are so urgently needed are too .important to be launched by legislation that is so hopelessly defective. Because of my strong conviction that we can write a much better bill. I urge the defeat of the conference report.",

I rise in support of it with the full knowledge that many of my colleagues on the committee and in the House are troubled by various aspects of the bill. primarily the legal services and the child development aspects. I served on this committee. as many of us did. and worked with it and attended the hearings. and I believe a reliable appraisal of the good and the bad in the conference report shows that there is more good than there is bad and that it is more helpful than it is harmful. Therefore it ought to be supported. I know that the child development portions will be discussed. so I would like to turn my attention for a moment to the Neighborhood Youth Corps provisions in the conference report. I believe the Neighborhood Youth Corps is a very important part of this conference report and a very important part of the Office of Economic Opportunity bill. The Neighborhood Youth Corps impresses me as one of the programs in my district in Louisville. Ky.. which has had and has provided help to the 16- and 17year old dropouts and those kids who do not have a chance in this world. This project is designed to prepare enrollees to return to school or for admission to community colleges. and it prepares them to take their place in society. I hope as we look at this bill and evaluate the conference report we keep in mind that this is an up or down vote. We cannot excise from this conference report any portion that we disagree with. We must vote it up or down. I think. ladies and gentlemen. we have reached the point where we make a value judgment. We have to take this thing on balance.

So often in the 7 years of experience that I have had before this body dealing with programs that benefit children we are merely asked to take into consideration compensatory education programs to help alleviate the problems that children encounter after they have reached school age or have become teenagers. These compensatory programs have not by and large been entirely successful. because we are trying to reach these children too late with too little money. We have been faced by enormous research documentation and reports which indicate that where we have failed in American education is by not according attention and concern to the very young child. This is precisely what the early childhood education bill does. It provides funding at the time the children are impressionable. where their educational opportunities will produce the dividends which we are seeking when they enter into formal education. There are 5 million young children today who could benefit from a program such as is conceived under our early childhood education amendment in this comprehensive legislation. These young children will be given an opportunity not only for educational adventures at an early age. but also for a comprehensive approach toward their social and behavioral attitudes which are crucial in the development of these children as they begin their formal education. There are many millions of young children who are today in day care centers that provide no educational content at all. They are merely being provided custodial services.. This program will allow us to extend this program and provide them with these educational services. Mr. Speaker. I hope the House will support this legislation.",

I would ask them when the last time was they saw so many people come to the well of the House who obviously. on the horns of a moral dilemma and a legislative dilemma. referred to the fact that there probably was more good in the bill than bad. who alluded on so many occasions to the fact that this was not a perfect piece of legislation and who. in effect. gave so much faint praise to an issue that has been brought before us. I would suggest. as I listened. that in the 11 years I have been in this body I have never heard so much negative talk about any one piece of legislation. What we see is a great uneasiness on this conference report. and I say rightly so. First of all. we are talking about a budget time bomb. Money has not been discussed here. We are talking about a program that will be several hundreds of millions of dollars at the inception and will clearly pass into the lower billions of dollars within 1 or 2 years. It will be one of the basic budget busters of the future if we adopt this conference report. So. you are voting right now for a bill which in the next few years will be a budget buster. Second. I think there is a great cause for concern over the operation of the poverty program. the legal services program. but particularly over the innovative childdevelopment program. Mr. Speaker.

First is an article by Doral Chenoweth in the New York Times detailing the slow and painful demise which strip mining is bringing to the little village of Hendrysburg in Ohio. I know Hendrysburg and some of its residents. and have watched its gradual strangulation as the land around it has been first stripped clear. then dynamited and chewed up by the huge jaws of one of the worlds largest power shovels. Undoubtedly. the village itself will before long be literally wiped off the map. and its people will join the thousands of my fellow Ohioans who. in a tragedy reminiscent of the Grapes of Wrath. have been driven from their beautiful countryside by the spreading desert of the strip miners. The cost to these good people. in human terms. is beyond calculation. Second is a series of three articles from the Cleveland Plain Dealer by Richard Ellers. Ellers describes the activities of one Ohio strip miner who also happens to be a State senator serving on the Senate committee charged with strengthening Ohios strip mining law. The story dramatically illustrates one reason why effective State regulation of strip mining is so rareand why prompt and drastic Federal legislation is essential. The Plain Dealer articles also bring out some aspects of the cost of strip mining in economic terms. especially the spreading circle of damage to farmland surrounding stripped areas. Getting down to actual dollars and cents. the State of Ohio is spending $885.000 to rebuild a milelong stretch of road damaged by one strippers activities. Another shocking aspect brought out by these articles is the fact that much of the actual stripping has taken place on land owned by the National Forest Service. How the inevitable devastation of the land brought about by strip mining can be reconciled with conservation. which is supposedly the mission of the National Forest Service. is beyond my comprehension. Moreover. as the article points out. since the strip mining operations are being conducted on Federal lands. the Federal Government must bear ultimate responsibility for the havoc being wrought to the surrounding property.

He worked his way through Medical School at Syracuse University. and after his internship in New York City. he returned to open a practice in Syracuse. During his career he served on the staffs of three Syracuse hospitals. and as an associate professor at his alma mater. Dr. Schoenwald also found time to contribute many hours of service at the old Syracuse Dispensary. It would be impossible to estimate the number of babies he has delivered. So long has Dr. Schoenwald been serving Syracuse families. and so faithful have his patients been. that he has delivered many grandchildren of those who he originally delivered years ago. Even though he had to raise his two sons alone after his wifes death. the doctor never refused a call from a patient. no matter what the time or circumstance. Such devotion and compassion has endeared him to the whole community. Dr. Schoenwald is held in high esteem by the people of Syracuse because he is the kind of man who has. in a quiet and responsible way. helped make his city a better place in which to live. A naturalized citizen. Dr. Schoenwald has given much to his adopted community and his Nation. Although Dr. Schoenwald will work on a parttime basis for the Onondaga County Health Department. it is only fitting that we mark his retirement from his private practice. His services as a fulltime physician will be greatly missed. and we can only offer him our respect and our gratitude for his long and distinguished service.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have introduced a bill. H.R. 839. which would require the Executive Protection Service to guard the foreign missions and consulates throughout the country. In New York City there are. in addition to the United Nations headquarters. over 200 consulates. most of which are in my congressional district. The cost to New York City of having the local police protect these consulates exceeds $2 million per year. but the cost cannot be measured in dollars alone. With street crime a constantly growing menace for my constituents. it is incomprehensible to them and to me why local police officers should be taken off their patrols and assigned to guarding foreign missions. The true cost of such an unfair policy was revealed by a tragic incident that occurred during the congressional recess. On the evening of January 6. 1972. Peter Detmold was stabbed to death in the lobby of his building. on East 48th Street. Peters murder has been a profound shock to the community in which he lived. Turtle Bay. for Peter was no ordinary citizen. He was one of the most active and able community leaders. My office worked closely with him on many local issues. and. in fact. several weeks ago. Peter called my office to say he was organizing a letterwriting campaign within the Turtle Bay community in support of H.R. 839. As of this date the police have made no statements indicating they have any clues in this case. Of course. I cannot say that Peters brutal death could have been avoided if the local police were relieved of their consulate duty. but it must be woefully said that Peters death is symptomatic of the growing violence in New York City streets. and in light of this fact. there is urgent reason for every available New York City police officer to be patrolling the streets of Manhattans East Side. Turtle Bay will be a lonelier place with Peters death. New Yorkers cannot afford more losses of such a tragic. senseless sort. H.R. 839 is one small step that could be taken against such an occurrence in the future. Mr. Speaker. I urge prompt and favorable action on this bill and am placing in the RECORD the editorial support for H.R. 839 of WOR--TV and WNBC radio.",

Militarily speaking. the Soviet Union leads from strength in Eastern Europe. Morally speaking. it leads from weakness. Recent events in Poland and the 1968 events in Czechoslovakia remind us that there may be satellite states. but as Seymour Fried in observed in his \"Forgotten People:\" The people are not satellites. Today marks the 53d anniversary of the declaration of Lithuanian Independence. In observing this day. we remind ourselves that Lithuania is not a makebelieve country. On the contrary. Lithuania has had a long and honorable history dating back to 1009 A.D.. which was nearly 500 years before the discovery of America. Admittedly. the heavy boot of Russian oppression. and reliance on tactics of intimidation. deportation. and colonization. makes difficult Lithuanias survival as a people. Nevertheless. Lithuania. which emerged from the ashes of hopelessness in 1918 after 120 years of Russian occupation. continues to see manifestations of Lithuanian resistance and ethnic solidarity. In the long term. we cannot predict an early end to Communist control of the Baltic States. but we can and we must take note of individual acts which reflect a national impulse toward Lithuanian independence. I am pleased to Join my colleagues in expressing our sympathy with the Lithuanian people and to express our hope for their deliverance to the ranks of free men.",

During this month they will commemorate the 720th anniversary of the formation of the Lithuanian State when Mindaguas the Great unified Lithuania in 1251 and. second. they will commemorate on February 16. the 53d anniversary of the establishment of the modern Republic of Lithuania. Though it is an important month for the Lithuanians. it is a month without celebration. The Lithuanian nation will remember its past in silence. sorrow. and with a somber reserve for a nation that has lost its independence and exists today as a captive nation. In another speech at another time I said: If the common desire of all men today is to be free it is because oppression and injustice have most often sprung up when one nation has been oppressed by another. It is this desire and this spirit that is a distinguishing factor of Lithuanians today. No Iron Curtain can crush an identity because a fiercely proud and productive Lithuanian people will refuse to allow that identity to wilt or die. The entire history of the Lithuanian people mitigates against this happening. From the Teutonic invasions. to the Kremlin invasions a peaceful people has found itself challenged and threatenedbut the independence of mind and culture remains as strong as ever. Our Government. from Presidents Roosevelt to Nixon. has steadfastly pursued a policy of nonrecognition of the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviets. We have time and time again deplored the subjugation of one people by another. This Congress has adopted House Concurrent Resolution 416 which calls for the freedom of Lithuania and the other two Baltic republicsLatvia and Estonia. We should bring this issue to the attention of the United Nations. We must continue to pursue a policy of freedom throughout the world. We must use the force of our moral authority and our powers of persuasion to change the world. To deny freedom to the Lithuanian people is intolerable.",

This is so because Lithuania has lost its independence and today survives only as a captive nation behind the Iron Curtain. After the Nazis and the Soviets had brutally smashed Poland in September of 1939. the Soviet Russian troops moved into Lithuanian and annexed this republic in June of 1940. Prom the very beginning the Lithuanian people have waged an intensive fight to be free of Russian occupation. The events of June 1941 make clear the views and desires of the Lithuanian people for it was at that time that they successfully rose in revolt against the Soviet Union and established a free government. Unfortunately. the Nazi armies moved into Lithuania some 6 weeks later and suppressed the activities of the free government. The Nazis were in turn replaced by the Russians who continue to this day to dominate Lithuania.

The 720th anniversary of the consolidation of the Lithuanian state and the 53d anniversary of the establishment of the Republic of Lithuania are commemorated this week. Recalling these great events in Lithuanias struggle for freedom serves a twofold purpose. First. it rekindles the patriotism which reaffirms the commitment to freedom in the hearts of both Lithuanians and Americans. Second. it encourages placing before the United Nations the plea of the captive Baltic nations for a Soviet withdrawal from Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. For too long too many people have been apathetic to what really happened in Lithuania. Contrary to most popular belief. the Communist regime did not come to power in those lands by legal or democratic means. Russia occupied Lithuania in June 1940. and has held a stranglehold on the country ever since. Yet. the fight for freedom continued. Late in June 1941 the Lithuanian people succeeded in ridding their country of the Communist regime. Although this free government lasted only 6 weeks. the passion for liberty did not die. Guerrilla resistance until 1952 and now passive resistance reminds her oppressors of Lithuanias thirst for freedom. The example of Lithuanian exiles in America is a vivid demonstration that their desire of freedom for their homeland has not diminished. In Lithuania itself. recent attempts by the Soviets to discourage freedom have proved futile. The longing for freedom in the hearts of the captive Balkan people grows stronger. It is. therefore. fitting that we pause today in our legislative business to pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Lithuanian people. Their history is filled with courageous deeds in defense of their independence. It is equally fitting to commend the Lithuanian American Council and the Americans for Congressional Action To Free the Baltic States for their determined efforts to promote the freedom Lithuania knew prior to those fateful June days. However. the commemoration of these anniversaries contains no note of joy. no jubilant tone of achievement or victory. This observance is somber. sorrowful. and underlined with the grim accent of tragedy. Because we share their love for freedom. we join all Lithuanians in hoping for a brighter tomorrow when Lithuaniaand the worldcan once again enjoy peace and freedom.",

Thus. it is appropriate that we mark the occasion in this body and recognize the long fight for freedom by the people of Lithuania. As the world knows. Lithuania was invaded by the U.S.S.R. in June of 1940. While there was a brief period of independence. brought about by their own heroic efforts. Lithuanians since that time have lived as a captive people under Soviet domination.

About this socalled invasion in Laos. if we search the records today we will find that in 1966 under President Johnson we had no fewer than 5.000 soldiers of fortune or mercenaries in Laos. If such an impeachment procedure were necessary. then it should have been taken at the time we had these troops in Laos in July of 1966. I asked the acting Ambassador of Thailand if this was not true. that we had 5.000 troops and he said that the answer to that question was \"No.\" A little later. however. as I left the room and he told me or confirmed that we actually had 5.000 troops there in Laos and that that was correct. So. actually. today we have fewer people in Laos than we had at that time. Of course. Mr. Speaker. many became excited about the incursion into Cambodia. I was upset about it at that time. but based upon the facts which have been developed later as to what has been accomplished as a result of that incursion. this was the most successful military operation of the war and was prosecuted in the most successful manner. Our casualty rate has dropped 50 percent and more. Mr. Speaker. it is my feeling that we should continue to support the President in his attempt to withdraw our troops from South Vietnam. Certainly. I wish to commend the President again upon his removal of 200.000 men from South Vietnam. In this instance. if he feels that by cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail it will bring that goal nearer of the removal of all of our troops. then I would say to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail.",

I think the case of the intrusion into Laos to Interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail is far more reasonable argued as an action by the President to save American lives than was the January intrusion into Cambodia. because at the end of the Ho Chi Minh Trail are forces that can threaten the American Forces in Vietnam. With respect to the intrusion into Cambodia and the close air support to open the Pich Nil Pass last month. however. I do not believe it can be rationally argued that assisting Cambodian troops to open their own highway between their own seaport and their capital represents a saving of American lives. Certainly by doing this we do not interdict Communist supply lines which might pose a threat to American troops in South Vietnam. I am reminded of the Presidents express statement on June 3 of last year when he said that future Cambodian air action would be limited to interdiction of enemy supply lines that might endanger American Forces in South Vietnam. The use of close air support to assist the Cambodians to open the Pich Nil Pass cannot be considered except as an action to hurt the North Vietnamese who were trying to block the road. I cannot conceive of any rational military theory that would say that the Pich Nil Pass action represented an attempt to interdict North Vietnamese supply lines. This is the reason that when those two cases are taken into context and read together. the inability to justify the Cambodian close air support effort in January as an interdiction of enemy supply lines casts some doubt on what the Presidents real intention is with respect to the interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. I agree with the gentleman that the present incursion into Laos could otherwise be considered a possible effort to protect American lives.",

In that way the highway might have a certain importance so far as maintaining the integrity of the countrys defense is concerned and if all the defenses fell entirely. the country then again might become a sanctuary from which the enemy might launch operations against South Vietnam and the remaining American troops in South Vietnam. It seems to me you can at least make that argumentand maybe we are elasticising the meaning of the word \"interdiction\" and torturing it beyond its usual meaning.

Before us was the task of reconciling the dlffereices which appeared in the measures adopted by the House and Senate. I am happy to point out there were very few differences. With the exception of the structure of the bill. very few additions were necessary and these will be outlined by my colleague. Congressman OHARA of Michigan. In order to secure complete agreement among the attending conferees. only two meetings were required. On March 7. the 15 members of the conference committee. with only 1 abstention. endorsed the provisions of the legislation now before us. I believe there are very few occasions when such general accord has been shown by the Members of Congress. The desperate need of the unemployed workers. the underemployed farmers. and our inadequately trained youth throughout the Nation has been recognized as the No. 1 problem on our homefront. -8598 The Senate. displaying Its awareness of the seriousness of the present unemployment problem. passedby a voice vote -this report now beforeus the day after our conference committee reported it out.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Unemployment and the Impact of Automation. I would like to especially express my appreciation to the members of the House committee who served as conferees. We have gone through quite a bit togetherfrom our original open hearings to this presentation of the final legislationand I believe I can truthfully say that our convictions for the need of it have grown with each passing day. With the overwhelming support of this legislation. already a matter of record by the vote of the House Members on February 28.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the following article by Dr. James D. Atkinson appeared in the February 11. 1972 edition of the Washington Report. Dr. Atkinson briefly reviews Soviet expansionist efforts in the subcontinent of India. their espionage apparatus in Great Britain which came to light with the defection of the chief of the Soviet sabotage and assassination section for the British Isles. and the Communist shipment of armaments to fuel the conflict in Ireland. He notes that the scope and boldness of Soviet political warfare efforts has increased as their strategic military power has grown. and that unless the United States makes some effort to rebuild its own strategic forces we can expect more of the same throughout the 1970s. As Soviet strategic military strength in relation to that of the United States continues to grow. so does the area in which they have freedom of action. They no longer are particularly worried about out strategic power when targeting areas outside of the continental United States. It is apparent that our capability to extend our strategic umbrella of protection to distant parts of the world is steadily lessening. The present administration has no plans even to regain strategic parity with the Soviet Union. much less bring us back to a position of clear superiority. The \"sufficiency\" criterion which currently governs our strategic force posture is not based on \"simply adding up the relative size or capabilities of Soviet and American strategic forces\" but on \"broader underlying questions.\" according to the last State of the World Message. Perhaps this is because it is becoming so embarassing to add them up. Whatever the case may be. Soviet efforts to increase their existing strategic superiority indicate that they are not as yet basing their strategic force posture on the \"broader underlying questions.\" The heightening scope and intensity of their efforts to bring additional areas of the world into the world into the Communist camp might even lead us to believe that they are assessing the strategic balance. or rather imbalance. in the oldfashioned way. It obviously has not yet dawned on them that. \"paradoxically.\" strategic superiority no longer confers a decided advantage. They have not reached the level of sophistication necessary to confuse paradoxes with some essential insight into the nature of things. Until they do we are in trouble. as the following article by Dr. Atkinson makes clear.",

It is with profound respect and admiration that I offer my congratulations to AHEPA on this most exciting of occasions. It was with great honor and pride that I participated in their banquet last night. both as a member of the order and as a U.S. Congressman. AHEPA. in hosting this banquet for the Congress. carries on a tradition that reaches back to ancient Greece. where the worlds cherished principles of democracy and representative government first flourished. Americas culture as well is greatly indebted to the genius of these great people. Greek civilization produced some of the worlds greatest architects. playwrights. philosophers. artists. and historians. What student can be said to be truly educated without having studied major Greek figures in these areas? America has recognized her cultural debt to Greece and. I am proud to say. our two peoples have maintained a strong and enduring friendship because of it. AHEPA has served an important function in strengthening these ties and in furthering the goals of democracy by encouraging its 46.000 members to participate in the governmental process. by instilling in them a respect for the privileges of citizenship and a loyalty to the United States. by developing a strong commitment to morality and an aversion to political corruption and all forms of political and social tyranny. and by promoting the goals and aspirations of Hellenic culture and Hellenism. AHEPA expects its members not to be passive objects in society. but to be active and socially responsible citizens. These goals. of course. are consistent with AHEPAs Greek heritage as well as its American heritage. AHEPA is active in the fields of education. charity. and civic improvement. The contributions of Greek Americans to the culture and strength of this great country are indeed significant and their impact immeasurable. Mr. Speaker. I again congratulate the order of AHEPA. I am proud to be a member of this organization which stands as a beacon. a model for all civicminded groups. It has a proud tradition. an impressive history. and a bright future. I hope the years ahead bring success and fulfillment to all members of AHEPA.",

The Golden Bull is one of the earliest assertions of the type of human rights which the Founding Fathers deemed so inherent to freedom and democracy in America. Serving as the cornerstone of the Hungarian Constitution. the Golden Bull gave broad constitutional protection to the population of Hungary. Today we pay tribute to the architects of the Golden Bull and to all of the people of Hungary. However. our praise today is not limited solely to the promulgation of the Golden Bull in 1222. The principles embodied in the Golden Bull are principles which are very much alive and enforced in our own Nation today. The Golden Bull provides clear authorization for the protection of the rights of the lower classes of Hungary. Our own \"Golden Bull.\" the Bill of Rights. guarantees similar safeguards for the protection of all Americans. . The Golden Bull provides for severe degradation of any lordlieutenant who abuses his office. Our own laws similarly protect the American people from abuse of powers and authority by our elected leaders and representatives. It imposes safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Our own Constitution protects American citizens from similar treatment. The Golden Bull embodies the same constitutional limitations which the Founding Fathers incorporated into our own system of government. . In todays world of protest and dissent. we sometimes lose track of the great safeguards the American system contains to protect the rights of her people. These fredomswhich each of us consider inherent to a democratic societyhas threads which czn be traced to the Golden Bull. Tcday is a day of celebration and rejoicing to be shared not only by all Hungarians. Mr. Speaker. but by all of the peoples of the world who cherish individual freedom in a democratic society.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am happy to join my colleagues today in commemoration of the 750th anniversary of the \"Bulla Aurea.\" the Golden Bull. known as the Hungarian Magna Carta. The quest for freedom marked by insistence for human rights has been a mark of Hungary as a nation since its inception. The Golden Bull. enacted in 12227 years after the Magna Carta was granted in 1215. is one of Hungarys monumental contributions to mans continuous struggle for -freedom. It became another step toward our modern democratic institutions. and free men everywhere shall be forever indebted to the vision and courage of those men who drafted. enacted. and enforced the Golden Bull. So great was its influence that feudalism did not thrive in Hungary as it did in other areas of Europe. The tenets contained in the Golden Bull served to protect not only the aristocracy from the King but also to protect the poor and the middle classes from the aristocracy. In short. the document became a constitutional limitation of powera limitation to keep a balance between economic and political forces. Unheard of in its day was the provision contained in the Golden Bull which extended to prelates. barons. and nobles the \"ius resistendi.\" the right to resist the King should he violate the charter. This right has continued to burn brightly in the hearts of Hungarians from that time to the present as evidenced by the inspiring resistence of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters in 1956. The freedom we know today is taken far too lightly. We enjoy it only because it was born in the minds of enlightened men centuries ago. because it *was won through personal sacrifice by valiant men on the fields of battle. because it was continually defended at enormous costs when necessary. and because it has been jealousy guarded in legislative bodies such as our own. Consequently. Mr. Speaker. any glimmer of freedom from whatever its source and every particular act of freedom wherever committed is part and parcel of our rich heritage.",

The Sears congressional internship program provides a unique opportunity for outstanding journalism students from all regions of America to study firsthand the legislative process and enrich their college studies of communication and political science with practical experience. Since 1970. 60 students have been placed in the offices of Members of the House and Senate. where they have been able to observe the workings of a congressional office. while assisting staff members with various projects. These students. who have shown an Interest in pursuing careers in political reporting. have been permitted to return to their studies with an increased understanding of the problems and responsibilities of the legislator. and have seen the interaction of the lawmakers with their constituents and their colleagues. Their internships have helped them prepare to report and analyze events. as future leaders of the communications media. This spring. Theresa C.

In this day and age of people urging \"involvement.\" I can think of no better way for young people to get involved in the processes of Government. Similarly.

I was fortunate to have an intern on my staff during the 1971 program and I will happily vouch for the quality of students who participate in the program. Miss Suzanne Dean. a graduate of the University of Utah. finished graduate school at Columbia University after completing her internship on my staff and she will begin work on the staff of the Washington Post this summer. Miss Dean was a valuable addition to my staff during her internship and I am confident she will have a bright future in her journalism career. Something I learned from Miss Dean. and I am sure my colleagues learned from their interns. is that young reporters are very concerned with fair and accurate reporting and that many of them are disturbed by the numerous criticisms of the news media. I think their distress is justifiable. As they prepare to enter the field of professional journalism. they can see before them a news media which is rapidly losing much of its credibility. and hence much of its value to a free society. Hopefully. their own dedication and hard work during their college years and the experience which they gain during their internship will be not only of benefit to them in their careers. but to the news media itself. If the news media is to effectively play its important role as \"watchdog of government.\" it must enjoy the trust of its readers and viewers. And in order to win that trust. it must be honest. objective and perhaps most of all. aware of the responsibility which the public has given it. Fortunately. the participants in the Sears congressional internship program for journalism students appear to have these qualities.
