I believe that if the obligation to bargain collectively by management and labor had been placed in the law from its inception. we might not have drifted into the situation into which we now find ourselves. As I said a moment ago. I believe that what has given rise to the Industrywide bargaining contracts is the power which was wielded by one big union to the exclusion of all independent unions. All that the affiliated unions had to do was to say to the Board: \"Just a minute. This union has been and therefore still is a companydominated union. It is not an independent union.\" If affiliated unions could prove that the now independent union was charged of being company dominated 4 or 5 or 6 years ago. that union was disestablished and was prohibited forever from bargaining again with its former employer. In other words an independent union could never wash itself of sin if it was once company dominated. The Senator knows that to be so. I believe that by giving to independent unions more leeway in permitting them to organize throughout the country it will in a large degree encroach upon the rights and prerogatives of the larger affiliated organizations which have been able to \"go to town.\" as it were.",

I wish to say further that the prediction which was made by those of us who took that position came from the \ufffd fact that the percentagewise increase in the cost of the commodities was almost equal to the percentage of increase in wages. That was because the productivity per man had fallen from 20 to 23 percent. and the wage scale had been increased about 37 percent above the prewar scale. I may be in error about the percentage increase in wages. but as I recall it was such a figure as I indicated. I took the position that with a decrease in productivity and a rise in wages. it was impossible for a manufacturer to sell his product at the prewar price. which was the contention. in effect. of Mr. Reuther. When he presented his figures to show that General Motors could have paid the 30cent increase in wages without increasing the prices of cars. what facts did he advance in support of his contention? He showed the profits made on war contracts. rather than the condition that prevailed before 1941. when this. country was about to enter the war.",

    "speech": "Yes. Unless a concern can be mechanized so as to increase the productivity of the workers.. whenever wages are increased the cost of the commodity must be increased. Otherwise. it is not possible to increase productivity by raising wages. Thus every increase in wages merely adds to the cost of the commodity sold. That goes without saying. It is true that before the war It was possible in some industries for an employer to increase wages and lower prices. That was because productivity had so increased per man that the cost was lessened considerably. Consequently a little of the added profits could be placed in the wage earners envelope and the consumer could be given a little cheaper price. But it was only because productivity kept pace with the wage structure and in a measure surpassed it. Mr. President. another evil that has grown up in recent years has been that of giving legal protection to the organization of supervisory employees. When the Wagner Act was placed on the statute books. supervisory employees were not considered to be employees as such. They were thought to represent management. Because of that. for 7 or 8 years. no effort was made by unions to obtain supervisory employees as members. The early decisions by the Board had been against unionization. Subsequently. the attitude of the Board changed. Soon afterward. when the ouestion was submitted to the new Board. the former holding was reversed. As I recall. it was only recently that the Supreme Court. in the Packard case. noted that the Board made no distinction in the classification of employees. as defined by the Wagner Act. The Court went so far as to say that even the vice presidents working for a large corporation were admitted to membership in a union. under the Boards interpretation of the act. they could compel their employer to recognize them. It said. further. that the Court was powerless to act. and that it was a matter to be decided by Congress. In reporting the pending bill the committee stated in effect that supervisory employees were not to be considered as employees having bargaining rights under the Wagner Act.",

Although thc foremens association had claimed that having such a contract would cause the foremen to feel themselves a part of management. the activities of the union had been such as to compel the foremen to be dominated in a manner adverse to the company. From the recordit appears that in other Detroit plants no action was taken by the foremens association with respect Lo a strike. without first consulting leaders of the union supervised by them. In other words. the foremens association is subservient to and collaborates with rankandfile unions. Another abuse is the strike in violation of contract.

There is one other very important change. The veterans cooperative measure passed by this body in the closing days of the last session provided guaranteed loans to veterans cooperatives. Apparently. because of an oversight. there was no change made In .the old room limitation. The room limitation was $1.350. Obviously such a limitation cannot be applied at this time. Originally we had increased that to an $8.100 per unit limitation. However. the commissioner of housing of New York. through the office of the Senator from New York . and with the Senator. called our attention to a very sizable project which is under construction in New York by the United Veterans Mutual Housing Co.. Inc.. known as Bell Park Gardens. If I am incorrect in my statements. I hope the Senator from New York will correct me. I understand that much planning has gone into that particular project.

Some 600 veterans have made down payments averaging $1.000. almost $600.000 being now on deposit. One of the largest New York banks made a $7.250.000 mortgage commitment at 31/2 percent. an interest rate no longer available. An option on the 40 acres of land was obtained at the very reasonable price of $8.000 per acre. Anyone who is familiar with that section of New York knows that that is a very reasonable price. A reputable contracting firm agreed to construct the project at. figures which have since increased. All of this was based on the $1.800 per room mortgage then available under section 608. and the good faith. and prestige of the State of New Yorkits word to some 600 Individual veterans who are willing to help themselves by personally financing their own apartments without one cent of public funds as a means of obtaining badly needed housing within the privateenterprise systemnow hang in the balance.

We know that if we take the formula the PHA uses in setting rents on section 608 projects. and compare that with the formula used in setting rents under the yield insurance plan. there will be a saving of 20 percent. I think it is. at any rate. it is a substantial saving. These are not my figures. they are figures from the Deparment. and I have used them in the RECORD heretofore. Let me briefly explain. In setting the rental on the section 608 projects. in view of the fact that the builder must borrow the money and pay interest on it. and pay insurance. they must set a higher return than as though he were using his own money. The return is roughly 6 or 6V2 percent. according to the formula used. Actually if one will sit down and take his pencil he will find it is 9 or 9 percent. In other words. in the section 608 projects rental units are being produced in which the rents are set to yield an 8 or 9 percent return. If we can get investors to come in under this yield insurance section of the bill. we will have rental units on which the return will be only 3 or 3 percent. and it will produce units that will rent for less money.",

I do not have them all at hand now. I know the Congress has not been altogether satisfied with the findings and with the actions of the Interstate Commerce Commission. When the Transportation Act of 1940 was enactedI think it was in 1940the Congress set up a special Board that was independent of the Interstate Commerce Commission. and directed that Board to do what the Commission should have done many years before. namely. investigate the question of the cost of transportation. and also to go into the whole problem of the freight structure of the Nation. to ascertain whether or not certain sections of the country were being discriminated against for the benefit of other sections of the country.

Those rights are of course based on Federal laws. The enforcement of the criminal sanctions of these acts has been entrusted exclusively to the Federal Government. See Georgia v. Evans. supra. page 162. But when it came to other sanctons Congress followed a different course and authorized civil suits not only by the United States but by other persons as well..

But I may say to the Senator that by the very force of the circumstances and the environment in which we have operated we must view this matter from a different position. The Senator from New Jersey has not been so unfortunate as to have felt and have seen the blighting effect of a discriminatory freight rate such as I have felt and have seen in my section of the country for a great many years. I could cite on this floor. for the next few days. Illustration after illustration of discrimination against my section of the country in respect to freight rates. as compared with others which obtain within and to official territory. in which the Senator from New Jersey lives. I could show him that in the case of a specific commodity it costs almost twice as much to ship it from Georgia to a place in the West as it costs to ship it from New Jersey or elsewhere in official territory to the same place in the West. We have protested this discrimination and have sought to correct it for many years. I do not wish to be put in the position of saying that the Interstate Commerce Commission for any ulterior or venal reasons has denied us relief for all these years. but we do know that when. after about 30 or 40 years. we did obtain a slight bit of relief In the class rate cases which were decided a short time ago efforts to set it aside have been made by those who have benefited from the official territory rates.",

When the bill came to the committee. paragraph (5) of the House bill. which now is our paragralph (6) was not sufficiently strong in regard to the matter of independent action. Here is the way the Senate committee wrote that paragraph: (6) The Commission shall not approve under this section any agreement which establishes a procedure for the determination of any matter through Joint consideration unless it finds or by condition requires that under the agreement there is or shall be accorded to each party the free and unrestrained right to act contrary to and independently of the initial determination or report. or any subsequent determination or report. arrived at through such procedure. and unless it finds or by condition requires that all carriers of the same class (as defined in paragraph (4) of this section) within the territorial and organizational scope of such agreement shall be eligible to become and remain parties to the agreement upon application and payment of charges applicable to other parties of the same class. That is what I was interested in calling to the attention of the Senator from New Jersey. and perhaps to the attention of the Senator from Georgia. The bill also provides thatNothing In this section and no approval of any agreement by the Commission under this section shall be so construed as in any manner to remove from the purview of the antitrust laws any restraint upon the right of independent action by means of boycott. duress. or intimidation. Any carrier or any party who engages in such practices- is. by this exception. still subject to the antitrust laws.",

That the President shall have determined. upon recommendation of the United States High Commissioner for Austria. that supplies furnished to Austria hereunder are being distributed under control systems embodied in agreements between the High Commissioner and the other occupying authorities or the Austrian Government which assure compliance with the objectives of the occupation and with the provisions of this act which are consistent therewith. There are two points in the bill that I have read. to which I respectfully direct the attention of the Senator. In the first place. it seems to me that under the language I have quoted. and particularly that which appears in lines 18. 19. 20. and 21. on page 7. whether or not the provisions with respect to supervision. control. or observation by the United States are to be applicable. is. under the language as written. not possible of determination until after supplies have been distributed in Austria without such supervision by the United States. I do not think that was the intention of the draftsman. and it would seem to me that It would probably be cleared by striking out. in line 20. the words \"are being\" and substituting the words \"will be.\" Obviously it is not intended that there shall be a determination of whether goods can be distributed without supervision by the United States. but that there can be no determination that that until after there shall already have been a distribution without such determination.

The point I make Is that under the language I have read. a determination that the United States is entitled to supervision of distribution cannot be made until the President shall have first determined that supplies are then being distributed free from such supervision.

I submit respectfully that it is advisable that if supervision by the United States is not to occur and not to be required. the control systems embodied in the agreement shall assure compliance with all provisions of the act regardless of whether they are consistent with the objectives of the occupation or not. The effect of the language of the bill. as I see it. is to make unnecessary in any such control agreements. compliance with any such provisions of the act as are not inconsistent with the objectives of the occupation. I think we want in the bill a provision that if the United States is not to supervise. the control arrangements or control systems shall be such as are consistent with the agreement. regardless of whether they are consistent with the occupation. and that if any provision shall not be consistent with the agreement. we shall have the right of supervision.

Any Senator reaching that favored milestone of threescore years and ten receives our unbounded felicitations. but it is especially significant when that event happens to one whose long years of active and continuous service in this august body finds him robust and vigorous in all his burdensome and important legislative duties. This thought was ably portrayed in an editorial of the Washington Post. a part of which follows: There will be much satisfaction. too. that. while he is far past the bounds of freakish youth. he is nevertheless strong for service still. and unimpaired.

On October 4 last. the Washington Post reported that up until June 1 of this year there were six times as many Soviet citizens in the United States as there are American citizens in Russia.

To even achieve thisminimum air protection. we need a supplemental appropriation for the Air Force of $500.000.000 to be used during the current fiscal year. and. beginning with the next fiscal year. we should appropriate $6.OC.0G0.000 annually for the Air Force alone. Even with these appropriations. 4 years. which is the time the Marshall plan is to run. will be required before the 70group program becomes a reality. It is utterly ridiculous to talk about the achievement and maintenance of air supremacy on a $3.054.000.000 budget. which is the amount proposed in the Presidents budget for the Air Force for the next fiscal year.",

The answer to the question is contained in section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act. Public Law 264. of the Seventyninth Congress. The President Is authorized under that act to negotiate agreements with the Security Council concerning armed forces to be made available to the Security Council for maintaining international peace and security. But that section also provides that all such agreements \"shall be subject to the approval of the Congress by appropriate act or joint resolution.\" Mr. Speaker. it is therefore obvious that the President must come to the Congress for authority to use our armed services in Palestine.",

Let us look at this thing a moment. and you will see the difference between the SEC regulations. the National Labor Relations Board regulations and sections 13 and 14 of this bill. Here we must examine section 13. the registration section. and then section 14. the judicial review section. You must read those sections in connection with section 4. because an administrative finding is made pursuant to section 13. and then a review pursuant to section 14. that finding becomes a predetermined issue of fact in a criminal case. That finding pursuant to section 13 and then determined after review under section 14 becomes an executive finding of fact in a criminal trial not subject to consideration by a jury. Under section4 a person is indicted for being a member of a Communist political organization. Again I take the gentleman back to the original proposition: Membership in a Communist political organization has been determined to be membership in an organization whose activity is a violation of section 4. This follows as a result of the finding by the Attorney General and the legislative finding in subsection 6 of section 2 of the bill. In other words. a court or a judge cannot submit that question to the jury. It is a question of fact which has been determined before trial. It should be a question of fact. It should be determined. but by whom? By the jury.

If the substantial evidence rule were permitted to remain in the bill as it originally was. an Attorney General could. after an insufficient investigation and hearing. make a decision that a certain organization was a Communist front. Now. he could do that using even the weaker evidence. He could make a mistake and he could make a bad mistake. and it could go up to the court on appeal. the Appellate Court. and if there was substantial evidence there. even though it would be weaker evidence. then this organization is branded as a Communist organization or Communist front. and every individual aligned therewith would be also so branded. As one of Shakespeares great characters said. \"Who steals my purse steals trash.\" - His reputation is as valuable to him as is life itself. Under this amendment the court on appeal must determine the greater weight of the evidence. the evidence must preponderate. I believe that is the only fair rule when you are dealing with the reputations of American citizens. The evidence should preponderate that the organization is a Communist front or a Communist political organization. So I support the amendment requiring \"the proponderance\" as a safeguard against the administrative procedure that could otherwise affect the reputation of citizens upon insufficient evidence. This measure is an intelligent approach to handling the Communist conspiracy. It cuts the foreign ties of American Communists and forces them into the open where the American people can see them. If the American Communist Party withers and dies as thus cut off it will be because tyranny does not grow on free American soil unless it have .secret nurture from abroad.",

We are subsidizing housing now to the tune of $1.000.000.000 in lowincome groups under legislation that was passed several years ago. The total subsidy is over $1.000.000.000. There is no reason I can see. from the record of the past. why we should not make it possible for one of these young men who wanted to secure a place in the country. to make his living that way. to have it. Why do I say that? Because $20.000.000 is not one farm per county. I have 22 veterans In Langlade County. and I have their names and addresses. who want to acquire farms. You say. \"Well. they should not buy them. The price is too high.\" And a hundred other reasons. But they are not going to buy them if the price is too high. Those people in the country know their business. Now. that has been the history of all loans that have been made to farmers. During the depression years $400.000.000 was loaned under the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation. The last time I checked there was about a million dollars left to collect. The rural people and the veteran rural youth will repay this Government every cent. These boys who want to acquire a little piece of America are entitled to it. and they have not been obtaining it. The testimony before your committee yesterday showed that loans have been made to business. and to others. but so far as rural veterans are concerned a comparatively small number of farms had been acquired under the GI bill of rights.",

It is also mentioned as a sort of preparation bill. not for immediate emergency but in the event of an emergency later on. You also refer to it as an Army bill. My understanding is that you are putting these men in training for a year. or 2 years. we do not know what decision will be finally made. The House. by a definite decision. has said by its vote it should be 1 year. You may overrule the decisior of the House and bring back a bill for 2 years service.

I was about to say that the State of Florida did not send to Washington the representatives of only one county of the State. but I think every county of the State of Florida sent its representatives to Washington during the early part of my term of office as a Member of this body. From the very beginning of my service in the Committee on the Judiciary. that committee had to do with this matter. The representatives of the State of Florida came before me and before my subcommittee and before the full committee. pleading for the Municipal Bankruptcy Act. because they said the State of Florida and its municipalities were bankrupt. and that unless we did something. they did not know what would happen down there in respect to the financial condition. So we went on. What I have to relate now is a followup of what we did then. It will be recalled that many public officials of Florida. prominent private individuals. civic bodies. and other representative groups endorsed and actively urged the Congress to enact the original act. In fact. the act. as originally passed was introduced by a Member of Congress from Florida. The subsequent reenactment was vigorously urged by the congressional delegation from Florida. and although delegations from other States displayed an Interest in the passage of the measure. it has always been generally understood that the acute municipal debt problems of Florida taxing units presented the primary necessity for congressional assistance. The amendment of 1940. extending the life of the act and enlarging its scope to embrace financially distressed counties. was likewise urged by the Florida delegation in Congress and by substantial Florida interests. Hence. the Municipal Bankruptcy Act. as amended. which now constitutes a permanent part of the Federal bankruptcy laws. is the result. to a great extent. of the insistence by. as well as the need of. the taxing units of Florida. The reasons prompting governing authorities of Floridas political subdivisions. taxpayers. civic groups. and others to request Federal assistance in the form of the Municipal Bankruptcy Act and the amendment thereto. were made clear to the original subcommittee during its study and investigation.",

His whole life in the public service of the State and the Nation was devoted unselfishly and loyally for the welfare of all. He was a man of great courage. of most unusual vision in State. national. and international affairs. During the many years I served with him here at the Capitol. he was always a loyal unfailing friend in time of need. Many times I consulted with him and his wisdom and loyalty never failed. His development of our great Navy during the years he served on the Senate Naval Affairs Committee was of untold value not only to America. but to the entire world. His fight for the institutions of our country and his efforts to preserve them will go down In history as one of the great accomplishments of our times. Massachusetts and the Nation in the passing of Hon. David I. Walsh mourn the loss of a man of fine Christian character. a most devout Catholic. a statesman of great accomplishments In State and Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it was with profound sorrow and a keen sense of personal loss that I received the news of the passing of a dear friend. neighbor and advisor. one of Massachusetts outstanding citizens. the late Senator David Ignatius Walsh. Senator Walsh typified everything that is dear to the hearts of every real American. An inspiration to the youth of this country. in that his life portrays the opportunities available. under our form of government. for any one who has the will. the industry. and the ambition to be successful in any field of endeavor. Senator Walsh was one of a large family of poor. immigrant parents. but as a result of his untiring efforts and hard work. he entered Holy Cross College. Worcester. Mass.. from which he graduated in 1893. later graduating from Boston University School of Law. in 1897. he became one of Massachusetts ablest lawyers. twice elected its governor. and its distinguished Senator for the past 26 years. Today the people of Massachusetts and this Nation mourn the passing of a great statesman who gave the greater part of his life in public service to his fellow men. It has never been more truly said of any man that he \"laid down his life for his friends.\" During the recent critical war years. he labored unceasingly with his unsurpassed energy. experience and wisdom on behalf of his beloved country. The contribution that he would have made in this reconstruction period will be sorely missed. I know that we could make no better resolve in his memory today than to pledge ourselves to carry out our Representative responsibilities in the spirit and sacrifice of the late Senator David I. Walsh. who did. indeed. give his life to the service of his people. I am honored to have called him friend. I am proud to accept his inspiration. Although his presence will be missed among us. his record of devotion to public duty will remain forever. and to us. his friends. the memory of his estimable character will remain a treasured asset.",

However. I am sorry to say that the difference. though relatively small. is pretty important. Let me make a brief statement to the Senate. Perhaps I should preface my statement by once more underscoring the fact that I agree with everything the Senator from Illinois has said about the necessity for preserving maximum economic autonomy for the economic administrator under this act. I think I can prove by the text of the bill that the Senator from Michigan is rendering something more than lip service to that idealto use the words of the Senator from Illinoisbecause every possible effort has been made to. emphasize the necessity for the economic autonomy of the Administrator. The difficulty with which the Senator from Illinois and I collide at this moment is the fact that. in spite of all the emphasis upon the indispensable economic independence of the Administrator. despite that economic necessity. there is another contact inevitably involved in this enterprise if we are to hope to succeed with it. namely. the creation of a new governmental coordination in Europe. which is not a matter of economics at the top. even though it is at the bottom. Therefore the top representative abroad must not only be economically sufficient unto the occasion. but he must also be in a position to deal at the top level with the heads of government in the 16 CEEC nations if we are successfully to pursue our desire to create constantly expanding contacts between them. and to create. so far as possible. what Mr. Bevin has called a Western Union or something comparable. In evolving those contacts. Mr. Presldent. it is absolutely necessary that this top representative abroad should have maximum diplomatic status for the exercise of that particular function. He must be an ambassador in rank. on a par with every other diplomatic representative with whom he must deal. He cannot enter the toplevel government of France. for instance. to discuss a customs union successfully. if all that he is called is simply agent general of the Administrator.\"",

I think it requires no evidence to demonstrate that when a diplomatic representative of the United States is engaged upon an important mission. he must have a protocol status comparable with the importance of his mission. Certainly he would have no protocol status whatever if he were simply to be called the agent general of the Administrator. However. all that is superficial. There are two or three things in this amendment which are perfectly sound. The objective to which the Senator from Illinois addresses himself. aside from the first question to which I have adverted. I amj quite willing to consent to. But. so far as the right of the President of the United States to speak to the heads of governments in the CEEC countries is concerned. so far as concerns the possibility of having the President speak adequately to the heads of other governments. in diplomatic contact. he is entitled to have what protocol always has required. still requires. and undoubtedly always will require. unless the whole world is sovietized. namely. an ambassador representing the President of the United States in that particular aspect. The point I am trying to make is that that aspect of the job to be done by this representative is minor. in respect to the larger aspect which the Senator from Illinois emphasizes. and I am about to demonstrate that I think it is entirely possible still to permit this representative tomeet. in terms of protocol. on a level with other high representatives of government in respect to these contacts involving governmental coordination. I think it is entirely possible to do that without changing the title. and I am sure the title will have no effect upon the net result. if I continue with my discussion to indicate the points on which I agree with the Senator from Illinois.",

The first is to change the title. I think we already have put entirely too much emphasis on the question of title. I wish to make it plain that although we feel that the title is essential.

I deny it. not because the ingredients for approaching disaster are not present. for they are. but because I think we have within our own spiritual. mental and physical resources the power to attain peace and opportunity for America and the United Nations. I look to another one who had been Prime Minister of Great Britain for words and a philosophy to guide my thinking in perilous days like the present.

Title II requires a 20percent down payment. you may say. with limited insurance at 80 percent of the value. Title VI authorizes insurance at not to exceed 90 percent of the current cost. as amended here to value. In title II there is a provision that the interest is within the discretion of the Administrator and shall not exceed 6 percent. In what is known as 603that is. title VI. section 603which has to do with the insurance of projects having not more than four family units. we froze the interest rate at 4 percent. but in section 608. under which most of the large projects of over four families are constructed we allow this latitude up to 5 percent. The prevailing interest rate under section 608 insurance is 41/2 percent. We were confronted with this situation: Because of the inducements held out by nontaxable securities. principally municipals. the banks have shied away from these title VI. 4percent mortgages. In other words. the market is such that we felt some discretion should be left in the Administrator as was formerly provided by law to meet changes in the money market and the credit .market. So if it is necessary. under strict control. of course. to increase the rate onesixteenth. oneeighth. or onefourth. or In very extreme cases which we do not anticipate. up to not to exceed 5 percent. he may do so in order to provide for the marketability of this paper so that we would effectuate the purposes of the act which are to continue the momentum of housing that exceeded all of our expectations last year. It makes the act more flexible in many respects. and it gives reasonable assurance that there will be no lack of financing during the current year for home construction.",

Last year we wrote into this legislation section 609. Unfortunately the legal limitations were such that it was impossible for the Administrator to extend any substantial assistance to the prefabrication industry.

But title 6 of the National Housing Act expires on the 31st of this month. It has certainly served the most useful purpose. particularly in these times of emergency. It has stimulated home building In a way that I am sure we have all desired by insuring private enterprise. I think wherever the Government has gone into the insurance business. it has not invaded the field of private enterprise but has rendered services that otherwise could not have been obtained. We have seen that in the case of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation. the War Damage Corporation. the Crop Insurance Corporation. and the Federal Housing Administration. This is another field where private enterprise was not invaded by the Government. and where the results have been advantageous to everyone. I hope the bill will be passed unanimously by the House. It would be a tragedy to see title 6 at this time discontinued. The $2.000.000.000 of insurance authorized will be rapidly applied to insuring mortgages for home construction. probably the greatest national need at the present time. More than that.

Mr. Speaker. the saddest thing about the Marshall plan is that it does not put emphasis upon military assistance rather than upon economic aid. Dollars alone will not stop Russia. Force can only be stopped by greater force. By this measure we are simply undertaking to throw up a dike against the flood of communism that threatens to inundate the world.

Today this bill is described as a method of action to stop Russian domination of Europe.

The bill has been considered by the Finance Committee and. has been favorably reported. At the present time there are 111.700 Veterans of the SpanishAmerican War and there are 90 veterans of the Civil War. The average age of the SpanishAmerican War veterans is 72 years. The average age of the Civil War veterans is 100 years. The cost. on account of the SpanishAmerican War veterans and their dependentsand this also includes the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine Insurrectionwould be $27.450.000 for the first year. The cost for the Civil War veterans would be $21.600 the first year for the veterans. and $1.488.600 the first year for their dependents. The total overall cost for the first year is $28.938.600. The mortality rate of these veterans is very high. The mortality- rate of the dependents. especially the wives of the veterans. is higi.. We can expect that this will be a rapidly diminishing cost to the Treasury. The main justification for the increase of 20 percent is the increased cost of living. As I said before. the average age of the SpanishAmerican War veteran is 72 years. The average of the Civil War veteran is 100 years. The latter. of course. are not able to help themselves in the way of securing employment opportunities. Many of the SpanishAmerican War veterans have no way of adding to their income.

Under the present limitations of section 3 of Senate Joint Resolution 111. which prescribes a maximum toll of $1.25 per ton. there is no prospect that the amount which the United States is expected to liquidate by tolls every year can be met. This is true even if we use the lower figure of $17.000.000 as the annual charges to be liquidated. Certainly $20.000.000 could not be liquidated. and I am going to try to show that $17.000.000 could not be liquidated. Everything hinges on the crucial figure of expected tonnage to pass over the seaway. This is the estimation upon which proponents and opponents differ sharply. In 1941. the United States Department of Commerce completed a sevenvolume study entitled \"The St. Lawrence Survey.\" of which part VII. the socalled summary report. contained a discussion pertinent to the allimportant question of the expected volume of traffic over the seaway. Without any \"ifs.\" \"ands.\" or \"buts.\" it was stated in this report that in addition to the 9.000.000 tons of Canadian and United States traffic then using the existing 14foot channel. there was a potential new capacity of 16.000.000 tons. So we have $17.000.000 to liquidate. and further we have 9.000.000 tons of CanadianUnited States traffic. and a new capacity of 16.000.000 tons. Of this new tonnage of 16.000.000 tons. it was calculated that 6.000.000 tons would be Canadian and 10.000.000 tons would be United States traffic. The 16.000.000 tons is an important figure. and it appears in the report in different connections. three separate times. Mr. President. I ask that these excerpts. which are unrelated. be printed at this point in the RECORD.

I would appreciate your furnishing me a concise statement. in easily understandable language. of just what the Marshall doctrine is. Particularly I would like to know: 1. When and by what authority was the proposal made? 2. What does it propose to do? 3. What obligations have already been made under it? 4. If adopted. what further obligations will this country be expected to assume? 5. What control will this Government have as to commitments which would become a charge against American taxpayers? 6. When will our Government cease to be financially responsible for the program (a) as to any one of the participating countries? (b) as to all European countries covered by the program? An early response will be appreciated. One would expect an immediate reply if a plan had really existed. Three weeks passed before I had any response. Mr. Speaker. you can see for yourself a surprising statement which confirmed the idea many had of the nonexistence of any plan. for the Secretary said: \"It is neither a doctrine nor a plan.\" It Is to be noted that the Secretary. in the last paragraph of his letter. quoted below. calls attention to the fact that theythe European nationswere then talking in terms of a 4year program:",

I feel sorry for you folks in the East who are cold. I feel sorry for such people wherever they are when they are cold or hungry. It is interesting to note that my colleagues who are complaining so bitterly about the lack of oil have been speaking for the Marshall plan anda in the past have supported these handouts. Do you realize that the Marshall plan calls for the shipment out of this country of huge quantities of coal and oil? Do you know that? Do you know that at the present time all our exports are about $1.000.000.000 more per month than our imports? How long do you think that we can continue shipping vital supplies out of this country which are needed at home and not get in trouble ourselves. especially when we do not have a promise of a fair return for what we export? Think that over. If you are cold in the East and need oil. think about not only oil but the lumber. steel. grains. and other vital products being exported. We need those materials at homeinflation is more money than goods. the cure is more goods than moneyits simple but true. I just cannot have too much sympathy for you who are crying about being cold and who are still going to vote for the Marshall plan.

Prompt action is necessary. Mr. Abbott contended. to prevent another \"boom and bust\" situation such as that after the First World War. when prices skyrocketed and then collapsed because of the absence of an orderly decontrol program. The elephant always remembers. but the Republicans always forget. And I predict that 2 years from now millions of Americans will say \"Amen\" to the late lamented Republican slogan. \"Had enough?\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in these critical times we must look to national defense. and one of the best means of doing so is to encourage the mining industry so far as strategic and critical minerals and metals are concerned. There is legislation now pending. which will come to our attention. having the effect of continuing the premium price payment on certain strategic metals. I call this to the attention of the Congress now and will expand on it somewhat later. In view of the fact that a few days ago we passed the socalled Patterson bill which suspends the collection of the 4 cents per pound excise duty on copper for a period of 2 years. as the bill passed the House. we must now take counterbalancing steps to encourage the mining industry in this country.. In expressing my determined opposition on March 12 to the Patterson bill which provided for suspension of the 4centperpound excise duty on foreign copper I did so because I thought such a move to be adverse to our national security. Of course. I was pleased that day that the original Patterson bill providing for outright repeal of those duties. was not reported to the House. Also I was pleased that the bill which was reported to the House. providing for suspension of duties for a 3year period was amended to suspend duties only for a 2year period. Nevertheless. I think the bill passed by the House on March 12 is in the long run dangerous to natiwnal security. It would have been far better had the Congress given more consideration to encouraging domestic production of copper instead of being chiefly concerned with getting cheaper raw copper for domestic manufactures. Of course. I want postwar demand supplied adequately but I am more anxious to see an industry encouraged on which our national security rests so completely.",

Upon his graduation. he entered Yale University. receiving his law degree from that school In 1907. His schooling complete. he began a career which was as diversified as it was distinguished. Farmer. lawyer. and businesman. he. nevertheless. found time to serve his State and Nation well when duty called. He served ably on the staff of the Governor of Wisconsin in 1928 and he received a signal national honor when he was named president of Kiwanis International in 1933. His publicservice career was climaxed when he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1938 and returned again in 1940.

Twice a month about 35 or 40 of us met regularly down in the Speakers dining room in a little Kiwanis session.

It became more or less necessary to abandon the idea of clearing slums altogether and replace them with decent housing. Notwithstanding the fact that the Public Housing Act of 1937 was originally passed in order to provide housing for lowincome groups. Congress voted to permit lowrent housing projects to be used for war workers with high Incomes. Such a measure was necessary to relieve the then exceedingly acute housing shortage. It is anticipated that by increasing the number of public housing units to 500.000. under the pending bill. we would be able to revert to the original intent of the 1937 act. that is. to level slums and replace them with decent housing for lowincome groups.

Nevertheless. we will help you clear your slums and try your own method of dealing with the problem.\" It seems to me that the two problems. the matter of getting rid of slums and providing for lowrental housing. are tied together. A city may proceed to tear down its slums. but unless lowrental housing is provided in their place nothing is really accomplished. Those who occupy the slums will move to other sections and the property to which they move will deteriorate and slums will again appear. If slums are to be abolished it is necessary that some lowrent subsidy housing be constructed in connection with the elimination of slums. That is the theory of title VI. The other title simply says that if a community decides to proceed with slum clearance and take a chance on what happens. we will help it do that also.",

The gentleman from Massachusetts says his proposal is a compromise. He proposes to let the ducks continue to use section 6 and to evict them from sections 1.2. 3. 4. and 5. That. truly. is a generous compromise. especially in view of the information presented by the gentleman from North Carolina to the effect that area 6 is little more than a sand bar. This bill. Mr. Speaker. would have been acceptable if it had left within the refuge areas 4. 5. and 6. In his remarks the gentleman from Massachusetts indicated that valuable farm land has been taken over in the refuge. According to my information. there certainly is none in area 6. and the only semblance of habitation in areas 4 and 5 consists of three camper shacks. Mr. Speaker. I urge that this bill be defeated.",

Mr. Spector. who was appointed as Assistant Solicitor by the Department of the Interior to go up to Massachusetts last year and to find out something about this controversial matter. It has not been taken over completely as a refuge. It is only in the making. It was only started in 1940. I understand the attorneys are still searching the titles on this property.

Calif. I went through a considerable number of these homes during recent months and I believe that they are well built and well adapted to the best standard of American living. This particular builder is constructing four types of homes and I give you here the average figures for this construction: Proposed selling price submitted to FHA --------------------$9.417.14 Allowed selling price by FHA --- 9.206.25 Actual selling price ------------- 8.987.50 Gross profit allowed by FHA per home ------------------------- 686.63 Actual apparent gross profit ------ 257.44 Certainly one must appreciate that the builder found means of affecting economies under the submitted estimates in order to permit him to reduce his allowed profits so substantially. and it is apparent that he passed these savings on to the purchaser. The payroll analysis of this same builder shows that labor costs. including all skills. but without supervision. were $2.23 per hour. or $17.84 per 8hour day. Including supervision these costs went to $2.296 per hour. or $18.37 per day.

As a result of the Presidents request. the powers of the Maritime Commission were extended by Congress for the purpose of easing the situation. and in the closing days of July this House passed a resolution to require the Secretary of Commerce to certify that on any exports of petroleum products they were not required for the defense of the United States. or for the needs of the citizens of America. but despite that. shipments are still going to Russia.",

We adopted that section almost in toto. except that where an increase in loan guarantee was granted all up and down the line. we have restricted it largely to cheapercost homes. on the theory that we should not artificially channelize any scarce building material into more expensive homes. We felt that a man who wants to build a $15.000 or $16.000 home should be able to get credit through channels other than the Government. Section 7 dealt with yield insurance. While on the surface the changes may appear to be relatively unimportant. they actually are very important. For example. with only one exception representatives of insurance companies testified that they would not be able to take advantage of the yieldinsurance provision in the TEW bill. If true. that meant that the yield insurance provision in that bill was meaningless. We asked Professor Jones. of Columbia University. to take over the job of making a thorough and complete study of that subject. He did so. He spent months upon it. He found that the principal objection on the part of the insurance companies to the yieldinsurance provision of the TaftEllenderWagner bill was not the 23/-percent guaranty. They had no objection to the 23%-percent guaranty in the TaftEllenderWagner bill. They had very little objection to the 31/4percent yield which would be allowed in setting rents. I do not quite know how to describe the situation so that it will be clear in the RECORD. but in the TaftEllenderWagner bill it was provided that all the profit above 31/4 percent could be considered as profit. but could not all go on the insurance companies books as profit.",

In the secondary market provision as drawn. and as it Is in my amendment. a secondary market Is provided for title I. class 3. loans. Such a loan is one upon the lower cost house. the house which will not qualify for a section 603 or section 203 loan. the type which normally would be built perhaps where the streets are not Improved. where there may not be all the facilities required for the section 203 or section 603 loans. I have provided in my amendment for a secondary market for that type of loan. and I think that Is where the secondary market is most needed. If we provide a secondary market for other FHA and VA loans. and eliminate the title I. class 3. loans. that will make the situation even worse than it was before. Even now they are all on a par. and bankers are reluctant to take title I. class 3. loans. If we provide a secondary market for all the VA and FHA loans. I cannot see that a banker would ever take a title I. class 3 loan. which would work a serious hardship on the young man who wants to build a cheaper home. That is especially true in some semirural areas In the South. The Senator from Alabama and I heartily agree that instead of giving less consideration to that particular group. we should give more consideration to it. I have not discussed this matter with the Senator from Alabama. but we have discussed the absolute necessity of doing something toward making those particular loans more marketable. I notice. in reading the Senators bill. that he eliminates them from the secondary market entirely. and I wonder If he will tell me why.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H. R. 4790. and I shall vote for this legislation. The terms of the present bill are particularly pleasing to me as I do not believe that the same yardstick should be used in measuring a fair tax relief to taxpayers in all brackets. Ir my opinion. a percentage reduction. although helpful. is not sufficient relief to those in the lowerincome grcups. Neither do I believe that increased exemptions are sufficient relief to those in upperincome brackets. I firmly believe the total amount of taxes should be cut. not shifted. and exemptions should be increased for all. and that a percentage should be cut from all tax payments. In February 1947. I introduced H. R. 2171. to increase exemptions to $700 and cut all payments 10 percent. The present bill substantially follows these principles. All exemptions are increased to $600. relieving those of the lowerincome groups. in particular. All taxes are cut from 30 to 10 percent. relieving the burden in the upper brackets. in particular. and thereby fostering venture capital. increased production. and additional jobs. The bill also provides additional $600 exemptions for those over 65 years of age and for the blind. Married people are also permitted to split their income for tax purposes as provided in the communityproperty States. Seventytwo percent of the tax relief in this bill goes to those having net incomes. after exemptions. of less than $4.000. Due largely to the economy of the Eightieth Congress. we are approaching a sound fiscal policy. We have been cutting Federal expenditures. Incidentally. we have not cut deep enough. in my opinion. It is sound economy to make substantial payments on our national debt and it is sound economy to relieve the wartime tax burdens of our people. The time is at hand to legislate and execute all three of these basic principles. Continuing the economy measures of the Eightieth Congress. it may be conservatively estimated that the Federal surplus for the fiscal year 1948 will be $8.800.000.000. and for the fiscal year 1949 a surplus of $10.000.000.000 is probable. The present bill would reduce Federal revenue by $7.100.000.000 in fiscal 1949. It follows. therefore. that we could have an actual tax reduction this year by passing H. R. 4790 and also pay approximately $10.000.000.000 toward our national debt during the fiscal years of 1948 and 1949.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we. as citizens and taxpayers. must be honest and realistic in our approach to the problem of national financing. We must fully realize that we cannot cut our national revenues by a large arbitrary figure and still request and obtain full appropriations for western reclamation and power projects. adequate Federal aid to our public schools which are in great need of funds at this time. and adequate funds for construction of necessary public buildings which many of our communities need desperately. Last year I voted for the taxreduction bill. A new issue has arisen this year. however. which completely changes our national financial picture. I refer. of course. to the need to adequately finance necessary features of the Marshall plan in order that we may lay the grcunad woik for a lasting peace throughout the world. I feel that we should make every honest effort to determine the exact cost of our domestic and foreign proarams before we arbitrarily cut our national revenues. And there is another matter which distu:bs me greatly. We ta::payers are paying a yearly interest. largely to private financial institutions. of $5.225.000.000 on our public debt. Think how much more good an expenditure of this size could bring if it were channeled in the direction of aid to our schools and development of our resources. It is sound economic practice that we use every possible surplus of Government revenue to retire our huge national debt and eliminate. therefore. this tremendous yearly interest charge. I strongly favor higher exemptions than H. R. 4790 provides for lowincome groups and those living on annuities such as pensions and blind benefits. Equitable taxation reforms which are not included in H. R. 4790 are needed for partnerships and small businesses. The percentage cut on surtaxes should be made more equitable than that presently advocated in H. R. 4790 so that in terms of dollars the increased purchasing power will be placed in the hands of those who need it most. namely. the lowincome groups. The incometax reduction of $4.000.000.000 as proposed by several Republican Senators is more realistic than the $6.000.000.000 reduction proposed by II. R. 4790. It would be realistic. also. from the standpoint of vetoproof legislation. I shall support a more equitable and workable taxreduction bill which undoubtedly will result from the HouseSenate compromise. and which actually could be made law.",

Every speaker seems to have acknowledged that taxes are too high for every segment of our population. They are too high for the employee trying to support his family in a decent way in the face of the high cost of living. They are too high for the small businessman. and the junior executive who is trying to set up a competence to protect his family. They are too high for the welltodo. There is no reason to be especially sorry for this group. but confiscatory taxes destroy their historical function which is to supply capital to expand business and thus provide more wages. It has been estimated that it takes from seven to ten thousand dollars of capital to provide one job in industry. This must come from some source. If individuals cannot supply it the only recourse is the Government itself. and you have socialism and all that it implies. If we are going to take the attitude that it just cannot be done. it is most discouraging for I doubt that we can continue the dynamic economy which has built up our country with a Federal expenditure of $40.000.000.000 a year. Present taxation is a millstone around the neck of anyone who is trying to get ahead. and cannot help but lower our American standard of living of which we are so proud. But I am glad that the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from New York have brought out the fact that the key to reasonable taxes is a reduction in Government spending.

Because Congress has failed to pass the Federal aid to education bill. I admit that this is not the way education should be financially assistedby the Federal Government. But when the various States cannot. or will not provide the necessary facilities. then the rederal Government remains the sole benefactor for these children by offering grants to the several States on a matching basis. Illiteracy is increasing at an alarming rate in the country. Obviously this cannot. or must not. be permitted to continue. Illiteracy is a national weakness. and if we are to continue to be a strong virile people. this trend must be reversed. Congress must do something soon. It cannot escape its duty here. This problem of education has become a national issue. Congress should have taken some action before this. Another year will only intensify the problem. and every year of postponement will intensify it further. It would not take long until we would become the most illiterate nation among the socalled civilized nations of the earth. Do we wish to be labeled thus? Many States and sections of States are far in arrears on proper school buildings. equipment. and teachers. All backward States should be brought up to the average of the best States. This will take time and the longer we defer aid the longer will be the road to a satisfactory status. There is the kreat problem of national subsidy with the necessary taxes but there is no alternative if we are to avoid a high rate of illiteracy. Every child has a right to an education. and it has now. distasteful as it is. become the duty of our National Government to assist by grants to States. The grave danger of the Federal Government assuming some control of education in the States must be avoided. This situation cannot be tolerated.

During the current year I have worked very diligently in an effort to obtain an amendment to the Railroad Retirement Act. which amendment would increase the amount of the retirement benefits due the individual persons receiving these benefits. This increase has long since been due. The present bill will grant an increase of these benefits by approximately 20 percent. and this Increase can be given without impairing the retirement fund upon which so many faithful persons must depend. The figures show that the present balance in the railroad retirement fund is well over $1.000.000.000 and that a fund of $450.000.000 will be ample for the purposes of the Retirement -Act. In the event the fund Is reduced below $450.000.000. the contributions to the fund automatically Increase so as to guarantee it shall not sink beneath $250.000.000. I am therefore heartily in favor of this legislation. In fact. I would have supported legislation increasing benefits beyond the 20 percent indicated by this bill but for the fact that persons in whose judgment I have utter confidence felt that we should not test the soundness of the railroad retirement fund at the present time. I am therefore complying with the judgment of those who feel that the present bill is a proper one at this time. The cost of living has greatly increased during the last few years. It has reached the point where some increase in retirement benefits to the railroad people is imperative if they are to live in decency and selfrespect. My earnest hope is that this increase will go far to alleviating some of the suffering which these people have sustained during these inflationary years and will give them some degree of comfort and satisfaction.

During this Eightieth Congress. a number of bills have been introduced to amend the )?ailroad Retirement Act so as to increase retirement benefits. to restore the lumpsum deathrbenefit pensions that were removed in 1946. and to make these pensions available to railroad men who are already retired. as well as those who will retire. I understand that it was difficult to get agreemient from labor and management on most- of the recommended changes and therefore no bills were reported out by the committee. However. a bill has been introduced by the chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce the gentleman from New Jersey [M. WOLVERTON]. which includes many of the desired changes and which I understand is agreeable to both labor and management. There are a large number of railroad men living in my congressional district and I am personally acquainted with many of them. These railroad men have long been the backbone of our Nation. They\" .are solid. highly respected. loyal citizens. Through their labor they have made a tremendous contribution to the successful operation of our great transpbrtation system and the economy of the Nation. which depends on this transportation system. When the present Railroad Retirement Act was adopted. it gave the railroad men a fair pension upon the completion of their lifes work. However. at todays high cost of living. this pension is woefully inadequate. It will buy about half of what it bought prior to 1940. This is certainly not a fair return to the railroad man for his years of faithful service to the American public. These men are not receiving the benefits which Congress intended them to have when it passed the Railroad Retirement Act: H. R. 6766. which is scheduled to come before the House today is an attempt to correct this condition. It does not grant as much of an increase in retirement benefits as the railroad men deserve. but it is a step in the right direction. and I believe the best legislation that can be gotten before the adjournment of this Congress. Therefore. I strongly urge the Members of the House to approve this bill by an overwhelming majority.",

In times past the House of Representatives and its Members have been criticized for acting in what some have described as too hasty a manner on such legislation. At the moment there is some criticism In certain places now that action is not quite as hasty as it should be. My observation is that the rightthinking. fairminded people of the country understand and appreciate the careful. considerate. and painstaking and yet expeditious way in which the gentleman and the members of his committee are working. I want the country. as far as I am concerned. to understand my feelings about what the gentlemans committee is doing. Of course. I am hopeful that the labor of the gentlemans committee may soon be concluded so action on the bill to be reported may be had here in the House.",

The cost of living since OPA was destroyed has gone up in the last 6 months over 50 percent. and the papers today say it may go up much higher. I wonder. in view of these many resolutions that have been introduced and reported and will be passed here. whether we should not have a resolution to investigate the cause for the unjustifiable increase in cost of living. I think that will interest all of the people of our country. and it should be done. because I fear that if the cost of living should continue to go up 50 percent every 6 months. as it has in the last 6 months. the wage earner of this country will not be able to exist upon the pay which he now receives.",

On the 3d day of January. into the hopper went a resolution to amend the Reorganization Act. section 134 (a). by adding the words. \"the House of Representatives\" after the words \"the Senate.\" the purpose being to give to every standing committee of the Houseas has every standing committee of the Senatethe right to subpena witnesses. Leadership thought that resolution was too broad and suggested that we bring ina different resolutionone which gave the right of subpena and investigation to the Committee on Expenditures and to some others. That was done and that resolution was passed. Then along came this resolution and several others. all carrying the right to hold hearings. subpena witnesses. and make hearings. I do not have the slightest objection to this or any other resolution granting the power of subpena to any committee of the House. if it wants to follow that course. The gentleman from New Jersey who is chairman of the Committee on Labor which is holding hearings at the present time. seemed to be surprised at the terms of the contract which he produced and from which he read. The terms of that contract are no surprise to me. because as long ago as 1937. and I think before that. the Department of Agriculture put out a contract which required a man who borrowed money from his own Government to promise not to say anything against the Department of Agriculture so long as he owed anything on the principal or the interest. Now. think of that. You could not talk politics after you signed one of those contracts and borrowed some of your own money which you had paid to the Government through the tax collector. So. perhaps. some of these labor leaders caught on to the idea of some of those New Dealers when they were loaning Federal money and trying to deprive the citizen of his right to a free speech. These labor leaders are just following that method and seek to deprive these people of the right to do business. What happened on Dock Street is nothing new.",

As the bill was passed by the House. it provided for appropriations of $339.186.869. After the bill was passed by the House. it came to the Senate. On July 17. 1947. the President sent to Congress a communication recommending that the Congress appropriate. for flood control in the Mississippi River Basin. $250.000.000. Of that amount. $237.000.000 is included in this particular appropriation bill. After the bill was referred to the committee. the committee saw fit to include in the bill not only appropriations for flood control in the Mississippi Valley or Mississippi River Basin. but appropriations for flood control elsewhere in the United States.

I am in agreement with the Senator from Louisiana that flood control is a very essential and important activity of the Federal Government. I am not in opposition to the program at this time. but I merely want to point out that if we are economizing in other activities of the Government. then surely there is little justification now to say that there should be no economy in the Federal floodcontrol program during 1948.

If the Senator himself did not make that argument. I am sure it was made on behalf of the proponents of the. bill.

There has been no change in those areas. I am fully in accord with the floodcontrol program. and believe it should be carried on in a systematic manner.

If you go through this bill. you find that practically half of the new obligational availability is directly due to the need for restoration of amounts previously claimed as economies. In other words. this committee has ever since the beginning of the Eightieth Congress been operating in many instances on the installment plan. The departments come before the committee and demonstrate the need of definite funds and the committee arbitrarily cuts the appropriation below the amount on which the department can operate. arid then tells the country that we have made a saving. And when the money fallsshort of the requirements of the department the committee brings in a deficiency or supplemental appropriation which absorbs or more than absorbs the socalled economies. The last deficiency bill passed here in the House was made up principally of such restitutions. And a large part of this bill is made up of such items. These appropriations by installments do not save a thin dime. On the contrary. they involve additional and unwarranted cost to the Government. Additional work is shouldered on the Federal agencies and the Congress in the repeated processing * of these \"come back\" estimates. Budget staffs are burdened unnecessarily with additional work and the committees and the two Houses must .without profit devote valuable time and energy to these repetitious proceedings.

The amount appropriated so far is $1.605.934.000. And the pending supplemental estimate is $141.319.000. of which about $75.000.000 Is to replace cuts.

On the Atomic Energy Commission item. the original and supplemental estimates were for a total of $250.000.000. Of this the committee recommended and Congress appropriated $175.000.000. leaving a deficit of $75.000.000. The Budget Bureau says: These figures exclude $250.000.000 in contract authorizations requested by the President. approved and enacted.

The hearings show very clearly that the materials are becoming much more accessible than they have heretofore been.

The REA has dribbled this money along throughout the fiscal year in order not to run short of funds. feeling they were acting under the mandate of Congress. They could have wisely exPended or obligated all of this money. After all. this is but a loan which is later repaid the Treasury. The REA held back the program. It had to. They kept down the applications and they denied people the REA services which the people were seeking to get because they wanted to make thiz money last throughout the entire year. They could have obligated it much earlier.",

In other words. these men had had these applications on file for months waiting and waiting for this service. which every farmer is entitled to. and this $175.000.000 will. as the gentleman says. permit the cooperatives to make contracts and allocations and make it possible for these farmers. after a 6- or 12month wait. to get the service which they are entitled to.

I want to say to the Senator from Washingtonhe has been kind enough to allude to it. so that I may say it in all sincerity--that the people of the East are aware of the problems of the West. We are immediately interested in them. and we believe that these selfliquidating projects are worthy subjects of attention and appropriations at the hands of the Congress. I may say. too. that we are interested. in the first place. because. from our past history. we know the hardships of farming. although in the West it is conducted on an entirely different basis and scale.

From all the reports. 131 miners were trapped at the bottom of the shaft. 9 of them have been removed and are alive. 1 was removed dead. and 14 accounted for as dead. It is feared that the others may perish. If they do it will be the worst mining tragedy in the United States in 19 years. This mine was under the operation of the Federal Government. through the Secretary of the Interior. It has been stated that there were many violations. not only of the Federal safety rules. but of the rules for mine safety laid down by the State of Illinois. The resolution I have submitted provides that the Committee on Public Lands. or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof. is authorized and directed to make a full and complete investigation of the mine explosion which occurred at Centralia Coal Co. Mine No. 5. at Wamack. Ill.. on March 25. 1947. with a view to determining the cause of such explosion. and whether adequate inspection was being maintained. The committee shall report its findings to the Senate as soon as possible. including its findings as to the negligence. if any. of any agency or official of the United States in connection with the explosion.",

But when some of us try to obtain a small appropriation in order to hire inspectors to inspect the mines of New Mexico. Colorado. Wyoming. Nebraska. or West Virginia. Congress appears to get into an economical mood. and individual Members of Congress seem to suffer because of the tremendous Federal expenditures which would be involved in such an appropriation. Mr. President. I hope this tragic accident in Illinois will bea lesson to us all. I hope in the future it will not require a tragedy to make Members of Congress think about the miners. Only 2 or 3 months ago we were condemning the coal miners. at least some persons were condemning them. simply because they dared to express their rights as Americans. Then how our hearts bleed for them after they die in the guts of the earth.

Last year I introduced a mine safety bill which carried an appropria*pn of $5.000.000. The purpose was to aro e the industries of the United States to the need for reducing the accidents. The Committee on Education and Labor unanimously reported that bill. It came to the Senate floor. Objection was made to it on the floor. and it was never allowed to be voted upon in the Senate.

Mr. President. I say it is about time for us to forget partisan politics and to begin to get down to work for the people of America. There are tremendous issues pending before Congress.

I refer to rule XVI of the Rules of the Senate. as amended by the Reorganization Act: All general appropriation bills shall be referred to the Committee on Appropriations.and no amendments shall be received to any general appropriation bill the effect of which will be to increase an appropriation already contained in the bill. or to add a new item of appropriation. unless it be made to carry out the provisions of some existing law. or treaty stipulation. or act. or resolution previously passed by the Senate during that sessionAnd so forth. The usual practice. as I have said. has been. first. to pass an authorization act. and then to make the appropriation. But that is a minor matter. What I am pointing out to the Senate is that the new bureaucratic agency which is being established asa substitute for service already being performed in the Department of Labor is broader. more complete. and more expensive than the service which is now available. and is an evidence of the broadening central power of the Government of the United States. Either we want to extend the power of the Government or we want to decentralize. I read from subsection (c) of section 202: The principal office of the Service shall be in the District of Columbia. but the Director may establish regional offices convenient to localities in which labor controversies are likely to arise. Observe that sentence. The Director is given the authoritynot his panel. not the President. not any other executive officer. but the Director. He has the authority to establish regional offices wherever he may desire to establish them. anywhere in the United States. Naturally that will involve expenditures. and every time the Director of the Service acts to establish a new regional office he lays upon the Appropriations Committee the moral obligation to appropriate whatever sums may be necessary to meet the obligations which the Director incurs. Why are we talking about economy? Why are we talking about cutting down the expenditures of the Federal Government? Why are we talking about reducing the taxes to the taxpayers of the United States. if. in the same breath. we are trying to expand the personnel and the bureaus of the Federal Government?",

Mr. Chairman. I secured this time largely for the purpose of directing some questions to the very able chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from Iowa . We have certain very disturbing questions in my State at the present time in connection with the administration of funds in the road program. not only the primary funds but the urban funds. My State has an eightman highway commission. One member from each of the respective congressional districts in the State. The people of my State. by a public referendum. set up the present eightman commission and under implementing legislation our Governor appointed. with the approval of the senate. the present membership on the commission. They are outstanding business and professional men of my State. The commission. after consultation with the people ifi the various sections of the State. prepared an overall program of projects and submitted the same to the bureau of public roads. these projects not only related to the roads that are constructed by Federalaid funds but also urban road funds. Now. one of the questions in dispute In Oklahoma is the application of the socalled urban funds. It is my understanding that the Congress. when it wrote the program to construct roads for urban sections of the country. set up as a yardstick as to just what cities these urban funds would apply to. by writing into the law that cities or towns which had a population of 5.000 or more would be eligible for urban funds.

I feel privileged to be able to add my comments in support of the FederalAid Highway Act of 1948. which. when enacted into law. will provide invaluable assistance to the several States and their respective roadbuilding programs. This act will continue for another 3 years the authorizations of funds at the rate of $500.000.000 a year with the money to be granted to the States as provided in the FederalAid Highway Act of 1944. Most of us have seen the results of the previous highway program throughout the Nation. The money previously authorized will be exhausted this year and therefore this present authorization is vitally necessary in order that the various State highway programs might be completed and expanded. The Inadequacies of our farm roads were demonstrated during the recent severe weather of the past winter. The FederalAid Highway Act of 1948 will provide for a Federal grant of $150.000.000 per year for 3 years for projects which include farmtomarket roads. rural freedelivery mail. and publicschool bus routes. This type of construction is most urgently needed today. In recent weeks I have corresponded with. all of the county judges and commissioners In the Sixth Texas District regarding the use of previous authorizations of Federal funds for their road program. I was very gratified to have their reports as they indicated the necessity of receiving additional assistance to complete their highway systems. The Texas State Highway Department determines the new road construction or the roads to be improved in cooperation with the county officials. Testimony offered at the hearings on the FederalAid Highway Act of 1948 indicated that the program provided in this bill is a conservative one when measured against the urgent needs. for highway improvement. Mr. D. C. Greer. State highway engineer for Texas. has discussed the highway needs of Texas with me and expressed the approval of his department for the enactment of this legislation. The allotment for Texas frori these yearly grants will amount to $28.433.000. with approximately $10.000.000 of this amount earmarked for secondary roads or farmtomarket roads. Mr. Chairman. I sincerely believe that the Nation as well as the several States will benefit immeasurably from this legislation which will result in an improved highway system.",

I call your attention to a pamphlet prepared and released by the United States Department of Commerce from the sixteenth census of the United States in 1940. which shows that the value of nonalcoholic. carbonated. and still beverages. manufactured in the District of Columbia in 1939 totaled $2.905.160. Accurate estimates of the proportion of these beverages sold in cartons or cases amounting to more than 14 cents each in value. show the total of such sales to be approximately $871.000 retail value. The tax on that sum would be Inconsequential. amounting at the 2percent rate to $17.420. This exemption therefore will have no serious effect upon the revenue to be pioduced by the act. Soft drinks constitute a common groceryfood item. They logically should be placed in the food classification. and I urge the adoption of this amendment.",

The amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota is expected to do away with the tax on soft drinks. but even though they say it is a 2percent sales tax. the people could very easily be forced to pay a sales tax of 4 or 5 percent. because on every purchase from 14 cents to 50 cents there is a tax of 1 cent. To the housewife going from store to store downtown. making small purchases here and there. this tax could very easily add up to a 4- or 5percent sales tax. The amendment that I have offered would simply mean that it would be a 1percent sales tax. and there would be no tax on any articles that did not cost at least $1. That would help to take care of the children that we.

It is much easier to object and to criticize something that a committee has worked over for months and months than it is to do something constructive about it yourself. That has been our experience in trying to bring about proper tax legislation for the District. Last year we did just what these gentlemen have been suggesting. We tried to get away from the sales tax. We had to balance the budget in the District df Columbia by raising revenue from other sources. We brought in an incometax bill. The House adopted it. It was feared that that bill might tax somebody that somebody did not want to tax around here. so we were defeated. We went out and left an unbalanced budget. This joint committee has worked over this matter. We have invited everybody in Washington and every Member of Congress who wanted to be heard to come before the committee. We heard them. The committee is practically unanimous on it. and if we are going to write a tax bill. you have to just accept the bill devised by the committee. That is the experience we have had in bills which come from the Committee on Ways and Means. As a matter of fact. all bills coming from the Committee on Ways and Means with reference to taxation come before us under a closed rule. because we all realize the impracticability of writing any kind of tax bill on the floor of the House. This matter of legislating for the District of Columbia is not an easy task. It is not a task that men get very much thanks for. Something has to be done to raise the necessary revenues to operate the Capital of the Government of the United States. This is the only method we have been able to devise as yet.",

Their own economic systems have to be wound up and started all over again. Obviously It cannot be done in a year. I shall never delude anybody about that. On yesterday. when I stood in the well of this House. I envisioned aprogram that might go even further than 1952. But. the corpse is on the back of Europe. and unless the corpse is removed. unless economic machinery is set in motion once more. how long will these supplications for relief come to this country?

If Europe can be rehabilitated. however. the investment our taxpayers are making in this bill will be returned manyfold in productive and sound world trade.

There is a moral commitment in this billto do our part for the next 4 years if the European nations in CEEC do theirs. Curtailment of this moral undertaking to 1 year means that there simply will not be a program. Remember. we can stop our aid at any time. Congress must authorize money for this program every year. If sound. economic rehabilitation is being achieved as a result of mutual cooperation between the countries of Europe and ourselves. we will want to continue our aid. It is sound business to do so. We are committed to this program only if it is a success. We are not committed to a failure. The objective of the European recovery program as originally envisaged was to be the recovery of Europe. If we cut this to 1 year we have tied ourselves down so that we cannot adequately plan or act to Insure the supposed objectivethe recovery of Europe.

Then comes this strange language. which will be something new under the sun if we have that sort of language in any bill. Let me read it: Although the bill recites later dates. it is the sense of this Congress that such aid will be extended only if the recipient countries are doing all they can to aid themselves. and if such further aid is Justified by the then economic and financial condition in the United States. That thought is already written in precise and forceful language in the bill. Let me read from page 49. lines 7 to 14: * Provided. That no assiftance to the participating countries herein contemplated shall seriously impairthe economic stability of the United States. It is further declared to be the policy of the United States that continuity of assistance provided by the United States should. at all times. be dependent upon continuity of cooperation among countries participating in- the program. Let me read also from page 82: Nothing in this title is intended nor shall it be construed as an express or implied commitment to provide any .specific assistance. whether of funds. commodities. or services. to any country or countries. -Let me read further: The authorization in this title is limited to the period of 12 months in order that subsequent Congresses may pass on any subsequent authorization. It is thus made crystal clear we are reviewing this year by year. that we are not legally committed to authorize or appropriate a thin dime to any country. But we certainly do not want to attempt to write into lawan express prohibition of a moral obligation that a United States citizen or a Member of Congress might feel compelled to follow.",

It seems to me that the gentleman from South Dakota has very clearly called to the attention of the Committee of the Whole the main obJections to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California. There are other objections which have been referred to but certainly we would not want to take the chance of placing in the Economic Administrator such broad powers as this amendment undoubtedly would give him. It seems to me that the Committee has very carefully considered this question. The language in paragraph (c) page 82 of the bill is very clear and specific. The one thing that it does do. which I think is very important. is that when the next fiscal year comes around. if it is necessary to extend the provisions of this bill through the medium of additional appropriations. that authorization has to be obtained. and that means it will come before the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In that way a regular standing committee of the House will have original jurisdiction. whereas if that language that the Committee has carefully worked out is not in the bill. only the Committee on Appropriations of the House would have original jurisdiction. I think on such a tremendous undertaking of this kind. all of us want to have the powers of cur country used effectively. whether one is for the bill or against it. Nobodys patriotism in this body can be imlugned. We may have an honest disagreement as to judgment. but whatever bill goes through. all of us want to see the results of the bill used effectively in order to bring about peace and to meet the challenge that atheistic communism is giving to the rest of the world. and in the first instance to those countries who are a part of the western civilization. It seems to me that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has considered this particular question well. The one important thing that addresses itself to me. looking into the future. into the next fiscal year. is that when additional appropriations are sought. that first there has to be an authorization. That means that the Committee on Foreign Affairs. in addition to the Committee on Appra.priations. will retain original jurisdiction over the hearings. the consideration. and the reporting of necessary legislation to the House.",

I would like to serve notice that we will continue unremittingly in our efforts to enact into -law the socalled hotly disputed issues which. nevertheless. found favor with the majority of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. These are the titles on governmentally aided housing research. slum clearance. and urban redevelopment. federally assisted lowrent housing. and rural housing. Veterans and other citizens regard the TaftEllenderWagner bill passed by the Senate. S. 866. as the key to whether or not Congress will authorize a comprehensive attack on the drastic housing shortage. The country will take our action on the bill before us now as being a refusal to make such a comprehensive attack. This may be unjustified. but it is the fact. The confidence of the people concerned with the need for housing would have been immediately established by passage of S. 866 in the House. This confidence would itself have done much to stimulate the broadest housing program for all classes of the population. The real difficulty is one of costs. Although there are likely to be over 900.000 home units built this year. both for rental and for sale. they are generally way out of reach in price of the veteran of modest income and of the ordinary citizen whom the housing shortage hurts the most. In fact. the gravest danger of this construction is that it will flood the market with highpriced housing and bring on a housingmarket debacle interfering with all construction. The passage of S. 866 would have given us a balanced housing program and preserved an active and prosperous housing market for years. as indeed the economic conditions require that it should be preserved. There is little question that the House will pass the bill before us. but to those who have worked so long and so hard for the TEW bill I say that they are right. and the work must continue. as before long the whole Congress will see that what it has done is not enough and that a general housing program by the enactment of the omitted titles of the TEW bill is essential if we are to lick the housing shortage.

Before any such legislation is reported to the House or enacted. the American plywood industry should have the right to state its case.

Mr. Chairman. a number of years ago the Congress of the United States laid down a policy by passing a law which In substance permitted the children of nonresident persons who are employed in the District of Columbia to send their children to schools in the District of Columbia without the payment of any charge. I think there Is justification for that law. But before discussing the justification for it. when a law Is upon the books. is it not bad policy for the Congress by a rider to an appropriation bill to repeal the existing law and the established policy? If the majority of the Congress feels that these children should not come to the District of Columbia schools. then a bill should be reported by the District of Columbia -Committee so that the Congress may vote on the question. But today this policy that was established by law Is on the books. and this rider on the appropriation bill would. in effect. nullify the existing statute. As the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has just said. $15.000.000 of Federal money is given to the District of Columbia. I think it is rightfully given to the District because this is the Capital of the Nation. There are many people here who claim residence all over the United States where taxpayers contribute to this fund who are affected by this rider. Not just the children of Virginia and Maryland. but the children of the Carolinas and the far West. New York. and Pennsylvania. whose parents are employed by the Federal Government and who retain their legal residences for reasons of their own in their respective States. States whose taxpayers contribute to the $15.000.000 grant to the District of Columbia. All that my distinguished colleague from western Maryland and I are asking is that as long as that money Is given to the District of Columbia by all of the taxpayers of the country. and as long as there is a law on the statute books permitting these children to come to the District of Columbia schools. that the Congress not nullify a previous action of the House of Representatives by a rider on an appropriation bill.",

Mr. Chairman. none of us can blame the gentleman from Maryland and the gentleman from Maryland In pressing for the adoption of this amendment. Both represent their districts ably In this House. and if any of us had the responsibility of representing districts on the borders of the District of Columbia. we perhaps would endeavor to the best of our ability to relieve our own taxpayers from burdensome expenses. In the first place. the gentleman from Maryland knows that the Federal contribution for the District of Columbia is not $15.000.000. it is $12.000.000. He also knows that this law he so ably discussed Is a permissive law. Let us read you the decision of Justice Letts on this subject. In his opinion. issued in the case of Wirth against Corning. Justice Letts made the following statement: Free instruction of children residing outside of the District as provided In title XXI. section 303. of the District of Columbia Code. is a gratuity and all legal rights flowing from the enactment are subject to the will of Congress. Congress may withdraw the privilege of free instruction at any time or may at its will place limitations upon it. Mr. Chairman. this Is not a new problem for us. In the 14 years that I have represented my district in the House of Representatives amendments to eliminate free tuition of pupils living outside the District have been matters of debate in this House when the bill making appropriations for the District of Columbia came up. It is no new matter. If you want to save the people of the District approximately half a million dollars they should not be required to pay for free tuition of children living outside of the District of Columbia. I suggest that you vote down this amendment.",

All last summer and all fall we shipped oil in great quantities to Russia. The President has all but declared war on the Russians. and yet we continue to supply them.

Those representatives were highpressured by topflight Government officials in the executive department. by prominent citizens.- and by some Members of Congress. The decision to recommend partition was a tragic mistake. Mr. Speaker. on last Friday that mistake was corrected. Mr. Warren Austin on that day served notice on the Security Council that the United States has abandoned its suppoft of partition and has requested suspension of any further action in that direction. On last Saturday Secretary of State George Marshall assumed full responsibility for this change in policy. Mr. Speaker. it takes courage and vision for men to correct their own mistakes. The President and the Secretary. however. must have weighed their decision and concluded that enforcement of partition was against the vital interests of the United States in the present crisis. I here want to commend them for placing the Interest of this Nation above their own personal political fortunes. Every American should congratulate them. Mr. Speaker. press reports last week indicated that the prevailing attitude in Congress was against rescission of partition. This obviouslyis In error. I have consistently opposed partition. as have other Members of this body. The CONGRESSIONAL RECORD tells the story. There never has been any moral or legal justification for partition. Those who have pressed for implementation have ignored our vital national interests and in addition their actions would lead this country to war and the Jews in Palestine to slaughter. Thank God. President Truman and George Marshall were big enough to correct a very bad decision.",

If we ever bring into being the 70group Army Air Force program of 20.541 planes and develop a 14.500plane Navy. *we must appropriate at once the necessary money so that the services can let the contracts and the aircraft industry can begin to produce the planes. I have introduced three appropriation bills forthispurpose. The first provides a supplemental appropriation of $500.006.000 to be used by the Air Force during the current fiscal year. The second provides for an appropriation of $6.000.000.000 for the Air Force during the fiscal year 1949. The budget asks for only $3.054.000.000. The third provides for an appropriation of $4.800.000.000 for the Navy for the fiscal year 1949. The budget sets the figure at $4.071.000.000. My bills constitute a total increase over budgetary provisions amounting to $4.175.000.000 to be spent on the Army Air Force and the Navy before June 30. 1949. This $4.175.000.000 will be only the start of the beginning of the development of the 20.541plane Air Force program and the 14.500plane Navy.

We must be ready to take every wise and necessary step to carry out this great purpose. Later in this same speech he said: Each of us here in this Chamber today has a special responsibility.

It has come directly to me that it would mean a layoff of persons not only in Madison. Wis.. but also in forest products utilization stations in Philadelphia. Asheville. New Orleans. Columbus. Missoula. Portland. and Berkeley. So it will be seen that it is almost a mortal blow. and involves serious damage to the great institution which expresses the national spirit of discovery and invention. Recently we learned that Donald Nelson. whom we all knew during the war. had gone to New York heading an organization which. through discovery of the utilization of either electric energy or some type of atomic energy. has devised a process whereby foods can be preserved without refrigeration and a flower can be preserved so that it will remain intact for years to come. It is possible to put a piece of steak through the process. then place it on a desk in an ordinary room and let it remain for 6 months. Afterward. when it is opened. it will be found as fresh as it was when it was first cut. I am no expert on the subject. but it is an indication of the wonderful age in which we are living. A few years ago General Smuts. of South Africa. said: We are living in an age in which I cannot see beyond the horizon. but I can sense the gleam of a new and wonderful era. If that be true. we do not want to reduce small appropriations such as the one in question. We do not want to spend billions for other purposes and fail to see that this is the thing which will make the future come alight in the present. So. Mr. President. I should like to ask the Senator from Illinois to agree to a reconsideration of the action taken by the Senate on this committeee amendment item. in order that I may move an amendment that the appropriation be increased by $125.000.",

Plans are now under way for investigations because of the great challenge in the matter of heat production units. coal. and so forth. There is the question of investigating the utilization of refuse. There have been reports from laboratories on the utilization of southern pine. which a few years ago could not be used for paper. but now it is being made into paper. Permitting private enterprise to contribute in my mind seems very questionable when the institution is a public institution. but I have not gone into that. The major portion of the results achieved by the laboratory have gone directly to the benefit of the public. and in cases where new industries have gotten ideas. the public has received tax revenue. which has returned a hundredfold every dollar invested. That is the situation as we find it. The suggestion is no reflection on the committee. A few moments ago the committee accepted a recommendation for the appropriation of millions of dollars more for school lunches. Yesterday it was overridden in relation to another project involving $50.000.000. In my opinion it is only common sense that the committee should accept the proposal of $125.000. and strive for it in conference. because it would be furthering the national welfare. not simply working for a little industry in my State.",

Let us take the welfare case. the crippled. the disabled. the veterans with large families and small incomes. A priority could be given in such cases without in any way affecting the number of units proposed. Instead of starting with the nonwelfare class. let us start right at the bottom.

As of today. we say we will help the poor fellow at the bottom. but if he is at the bottom of the social scale he is ndt entitled to a decent place in which to live.

As I understand. the present language provides that TVA pays the amount allocated to power back over a period of 40 years. and that this payment should be divided into four equal installments at the end of each 10 years and there is no provision for a definite yearly payment.",

As it comes from the conference. the 40year amortization remains In. the 10yearperiods provision requiring 25 percent to be cumulatively paid in each period remains in. but the requirement to pay 40 percent of the net revenue from power resources is out. That has a liberalizing effect in that it meets the argument. as I remember it. that the gentleman made in the House originally that there might be extreme years in which they would be hard pressed for operating expenses against their revenues. and it would be difficult for them to make any substantial payments. Of course. the 40 percent allowed that to fluctuate. Nevertheless. this eliminates the requirement of a 40percent payment.

This limitation will result in an increase in the administrative funds and a very materially increased one. and it will not cause the smaller growers to receive any more. because the tenants. who are by far in the majority will submit programs. and many more applications will be made. and the administrative costs will be increased. and the result will be. that if anything. the smaller growers will get a smaller amount than he is getting now. whereas. in my judgment. the larger grower will have spent a great deal more than he will get and the smaller grower will get less than he spends. and therefore the smaller grower. intended to be aided here. will not receive any more. in my judgment.",

The Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee has worked with extreme diligence and patience for many months to bring before the House a workable. practical. and humane measure. and during that period of time I have on many occasions consulted with the members of the subcommittee and have cooperated with them to the best of my limited ability. and when time permitted. Personally. I would like to have a measure somewhat more liberal in its terms. but I realize that insurmountable obstacles might have arisen to any measure extremely liberal in its terms. and thus the displaced persons would have been denied any relief whatever. I have no fear of the capacity of the United States to absorb without any difficulty 200.000 immigrants. In fact. I believe we could very easily absorb twice that number. It is my conviction that the passage of this bill by the House will help immeasurably toward relieving a sad situation. and I am proud to vote for this humanitarian cause. believing as I do that immigration has been of invaluable assistance in making the United States the great democracy it has become. Immigrants to this country have helped to make the United States the leading nation in production and in finance. as well as the mightiest Nation ever to exist in war. as well as in peace. Of course. many other nations have already done much to help relieve the distressful displaced persons situation. and for this all of us should be. and are. duly grateful. I hope no crippling amendments. such as the Vorys amendment. will be accepted by the House. and that the bill will pass with a resounding majority.",

If adherence by 15 nations is a prerequisite to its becoming effective. then it would surely follow that if only 14 nations have adhered then the Organization has not been legally put together. Section 2 of the bill defines who are eligible to be considered under this bill. There are two categories of persons that may be entitled to consideration under the bill. One group is set out in subsection (a). another group is set out in subsection (b). It is to this group that I wish to refer. This group. however large the number may be. must be registered by the IRO. That assumes that the International Refugee Organization shall have been put together legally and in full compliance with the law. It now develops that it has not been put together legally. Then it naturally follows that any action taken by an organization that has not been put together legally cannot function legally. Therefore. it would seem to me that without this amendment any thing that is done by this organization could be successfully contested in the courts as to its legality. How can this organization make any selections? Mr. Chairman. I again repeat. this bill should not be passed because this is not the proper way and I also say that the acts of the International Refugee Organization will not be legal because it has not been legally constituted.

It estimates that it will need. in round figures. $12.700.000 to pay terminal leave. and liquidation charges. That would leave. $2.000.000 available for current and future expenses. to which there is added. in round numbers. $8.-* 000.000. making a total of $10.000.000. exclusive of liquidation costs and terminalleave costs. with which the OPA can continue in operation until the 30th day of Juneor $2.000.000 a month.

But speaking directly to my able friend from New Hampshire. for whom I have great affection. I say that just so surely as this amendment shall be agreed to. we will find on April 30 that there will be no rent control whatever in this country. One office after another will be completely closed. or at least will have working only a skeleton force which will not be worth talking about so far as any real enforcement is concerned. Just so surely as rent control is broken down during May and June. then when an attempt is made to restablish it. the situation will be reminiscent of what happened last year. Senators recall. no doubt. what happened last year in the case of OPA after we took off the controls and then attempted to reestablish them. It just did not work. and this will not work either.

In both the first and second conferences with the Senate. with the Senate hearings and report and amendments before the conference. he knew exactly. or he could have known exactly what was required and why it was required. There were no imponderables then. But he was determined to deny these socialsecurity agencies the bare appropriations required to keep them alive and functioning. and he continued that opposition as long as it was tenable. There is nothing new in the gentlemans obstinate opposition to adequate funds for these two socialsecurity services. We have but to go back to the genesis of socialservice legislation to understand the gentlemans attitude. Under the terrible depressions which scourged the country prior to 1933. regardless of how industriously men laboredor how well they managedthere were many who were able to lay aside a competence for retirement. There was no place for indigent old age but the poorhouse. and periodically industries shut down and turned millions of men out on the streets who tramped the highways and \"rode the rails\" looking for work. any kind of work. at any wage. to support their families. But there was no recourse except ineffective public charity or crime. \ufffd And nothing was done about it. President Hoover was appealed to but neither he nor his Congress exhibited any interest while the situation grew steadily worse. It was left for President Roosevelt and his Congresses to enact the Social Security Act which. for the first time. provided oldage assistance for the superannuated. unemployment compensation for those unable to find jobs and aid for dependent children and for the blind and unfortunate. When the bill was finally reported to the House. the entire Republican membership on the Ways and Means Committee unanimously joined In filing a minority report bitterly opposing it. insisting it was unconstitutional. and predictIng it would increase unemployment. and they continued to oppose expanded activities and increased appropriations as vigorously and as uncompromisingly as the gentleman from Wisconsin opposed them in the conferences on the deficiency bill.",

He makes a frank confession. He concedes that he knew all about the bill and that no one else knew anything about It. That is all the greater condemnation of his determined opposition to a minimum appropriation to keep socialsecurities activities functioning. The criticism of members of the minority for signing the conference report and voting for the bill or the report are absurd. They had no voice in the matter.

As a matter of fact. he cannot deny that he knew of the facts on which the Senate had based Its amendments and he knew of them before the first conference. He cannot dodge that. The Senate hearings and report were simultaneously available with the Senate amendments. He cannot disguise the fact that he was opposed to the efficient administration of the socialsecurity law as evidenced by his refusal to agree with the Senate conferees after long and exhaustive argument with them in the first conference. He was just traditionally opposed to the whole idea. He knew at that time that failure to make the appropriation would require the discharge in the State of New York alone of over 900 employees and make it impossible adequately to administer the program. He knew at that time that in the State of Michigan. for example. they would have to close numbers of employment offices immediately. making it impossible to attempt adequately. to administer the program. And still he refused even to compromise with the Senate conferees. He would not agree to a penny. The remarks of the gentleman from Wisconsin are enlightening in another respect. His discussion betrays a familiarity with political aspirations In my Congressional district.

This measure proposes amendment of the United States Code in order to facilitate the importation of copper at the present time. This measure is emergency legislation and because the Members of the House have been tied up pretty much in their committee work it may be that all will not be thoroughly familar with the urgent need for immediate passage of this measure. I sincerely hope my colleagues will take a few minutes during the next day or two to familiarize themselves with this measureand what it proposes to doso that there will be unanimous approval of H. R. 1626 when the House is asked to act. Many factories and shops are faced with suspension of operations because of the very serious shortage of copper. Many branches of the copper industry will have to curtail operations drastically because there is not sufficient copper available to meet present demands. The lack of domestic copper has been made up for. to some extent. during the last year by releases of Governmentowned stockpile copper. This stock pile is down to the vanishing point. Imported copper has shrunk to a negligible quantity because of the 4cent tariff. Most manufacturers have already been Informed by the suppliers of copper and copperalloy materials that their shipments are to be drastically reduced. starting immediately. due to the fact that there is an insufficient amount of domestic copper available for processing. This means the closing of some shops and a drastic reduction in personnel and working hours in others. The measure introduced by the gentleman from Connecticut will alleviate the harsh results of such a serious situation. If this measure ir: approved. the tariff on imported copper will be suspended until such time as the domestic sources are able to produce sufficient copper for the needs of the copper industry in this country. In view of the seriousness of the situa. tion. I appeal for the favorable consideration of all the Members of the House.",

Secretary Chase was a member of Lincolns Cabinet. during the War Between the States. and it is said of him that he was a far more brilliant man than the President. had more dignity. and a more prepossessing appearance but Chase is hardly remembered today while Abraham Lincoln is remembered as one of the greatest men of all time. We are told that the sole reason for this is that Abraham Lincoln had intellectual humility and a sense of humor. Such qualities as these are sometimes the difference that makes one man great and the others just ordinary men. We have a man in the White House today as President of the United States who is modest. who is humble. who springs from the American pcople. and one who has the same type of intellectual humility. I wish to take this opportunity to commend President Harry S. Truman for his great battle last fall in behalf of all the American people rather than certain pressure groups. I am glad that the Supreme Court of this Nation in its decision last week saw fit to back up this noble stand by a typical American. Also. this is. my first opportunity to publicly commend Harry S. Truman for his great work in the closing days of World War 11. Many of us who were en route from the European theater to.the Pacific will always believe that the patience of President Truman in dealing with the Japanese envoys in the Pacific. who somehow never arrived in time. resulted in an early unconditional surrender of the Japs and saved thousands of American lives. Harry S. Truman is growing. developing every hour. with the job. the burden and the duty that is his. and in his efforts to save our country in this hour of crises. he needs the support of loyal Americans of all parties and all faiths on a nonpartisan level.",

I am sure the gentleman from Illinois will agree with me that it takes more time to examine a budget carefully and to find the places where items can be cut without interfering with any essential function of Government than it does to just rubber stamp the executive request. As the gentleman ably pointed out. the Republicans of this Congress have been cutting the budget and they have been cutting it over the stubborn. unrelenting resistance of Mr. Truman. his administration. and his satellites here in the House of Representatives.",

The Government still has not lost its capacity to deal with an emergent situation. The difference is. of course. that we used to have an emergency every 24 hours. years ago. Now we get one only at the end of the fiscal year. and perhaps one other in the course of a whole fiscal year. SO we have the capacity to deal with it and that is precisely what we are doing today. We are doing it because the House has a deep and abiding conviction as to the reductions that have been made in the appropriation bills. We do not propose. therefore. to relent even slightly in that conviction because these economies are in the interest of the people of the United States of America. So. I am not concerned about the capacity of Republican representative Government to deal with any crisis that may come along. This will enable us. of course. to give a great accounting of our economical stewardship to the people of the United States. If you want an examplewe were taking testimony on the appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture for seven long weeks. There were 413 witnesses. It took nearly 3 months to start with a bill and finally get it to the floor of the House. There you have to scrutinize and explore the appropriation of every dollar. That is one of the reasons why with some pride. and with humility. we can say that economies totaling hundreds of millions of dollars were finally effectuated. If we ever expect to eliminate duplication. lack of efficiency. and waste from Government. it will be only In proportion as we take every dollar that the humble. hornyhanded. hardfisted citizens of the country contribute to the Treasury of the United States of America. lift it up. turn it over twice. then lay it down and determine what to do with it. That. of course. is a technique somewhat unknown to our friends on the other side during their stewardship of the last 14 years.",

We have been through a troublesome time. a troublesome time with the departments representing the only New Deal since George Washington. We have had to set up an investigatorial staff. and it has been a staff of the greatest accountants. analysts. and Government specialists in the United States. and the service they have rendered is something of which we and they may well be proud. In one agency alone the Governments position was bettered as a result of their operation to the tune of $750.000.000. and in many other agencies the foundation was laid for the recovery of enormous sums of money this year. and next year. and years after. No member of the Republican majority has offered a motion to recommit an appropriation bill restoring practically all the cuts that were made in the agri- . culture appropriation bill and some of the other bills. as some of our friends on the minority side of the aisle have done. The gentleman from Missouri upon the roll call on the adoption of the legislative budgetand I have it here in front of me on page 60 of the general committee reportwas among the 22 \"noes\" who voted against the adoption of that report calling for a $6.000.000.000 cut. I remember occasions when he voted against the $6.000.000.000 over in the committee. and then against the $4.500.000.000. but let me indicate this so that we may have the picture completely. There were a couple of bills that my friend from Illinois left out of his account. bills that were left over after July 1 of last year.

Since that time I have obtained a copy of the platform which I shall read. As to Hawaii it says: Hawaii. which shares the Nations obligations equally with the several States. is entitled to the fullest measure of home rule looking toward statehood. That is what some people have been construing as a plan of immediate action at this session. Bear with me further a moment. Precisely the same language is used in connection with Alaska: Alaska is entitled to the fullest measure of home rule looking toward statehood. So. Alaska and Hawaii. as .far as the Republican platform is concerned. are Siamese twins. completely identical. There is one further Territory now. Puerto Rico: Statehood is a logical aspiration of the people of Puerto Rico. and legislation should be in harmony with the realization of that aspiration. / Now. Mr. Chairman. can there be any longer doubt that we are confronted in this bill with a problem concerning all the territorial possessions of the United States? What we do on this bill is bound to call the turn. and set the precedent for Alaska. Puerto Rico. and such other insular territory as we may now or later possess. They are one for all practical purposes. They are so treated in the Presidents annual- message of 1946. They are treated by the Republican platform as one in identical fashion. So. I say. Mr. Chairman. in considering the position we take on this bill. we must consider all three of those *dependencies and determine whether or not we are to admit them to statehood with the two Senators that go with statehood. and the resultant further distortion of popular representation in the Congress.",

Therefore. the people of Nebraska. speaking through their Republican Party organization. assume a natural responsibility for leadership in the expression of Republican policy and opinion. For this reason.

The Republican Party of Nebraska in preprimary delegate convention assembled in Omaha. Nebr.. February 17. 1948. makes public this declaration of its principles and policies: 1. The major issue in America today Is whether or not we shall preserve and maintain our republican form of government guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States. The socialistic and dictatorial trends which are permeating our political life clearly present the Issue. There is no place in our Nation for those who would overthrow our traditional liberties and impose upon us a police state. or for those who are disloyal to the United States of America. We reaffirm our faith in our constitutional form of government. Under it our country has maintained Its powerful position and influence among the nations of the world.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. more than 2.000 years ago Demosthenes addressed these words to the men of Athens: For I gave warnings and solemnly protested at all times. both in your midst and wherever I was sent. But the Greek states were rotten. the men who were engaged in public life and action taking bribes and sacrificing their principles for money. while the majority of private citizens either had no foresight or were caught by the bait of daily ease and leisure. and all alike suffered from some delusion as this. each community fancying that the danger would come against all except themselves. and that at others risks they might safely secure their own interests when they pleased. In this way. I fancy. it has come about that the masses. in return for their excessive and unseasonable indifference. have lost their liberty. while their leading men. who fancied they were bartering away everything but themselves. discovered they had sold themselves first. for. instead of friends and guestfriends. as they used to be called at the moment when they were taking bribes. they are now saluted as parasites and apostates and by all other welldeserved titles. For no one. men of Athens. spends money in pursuit of the interest of the betrayer. nor when he is master of his purchase continues to consult the traitor about the future: otherwise nothing would be more fortunate than the traitor. But this is not sohow could it be? Very far from it. Rather. when the aspirant for power is established as master of the situation. he is also lord over those who sold him his position. and. knowing their villainy. thenif not beforehe hates them and distrusts them and treats them with contumely. Only look at the facts: for If the right time for action has gone by. the right time. at any rate. to learn lessons of this sort is always present to the prudent.",

The matter. which the committee initially -investigated from the standpoint of its effect on relieving the blackmarket situation. has now developed to a point where it is felt that the interest of national safety demands immediate action to obtain this scrap and thus eliminate the possibility of its being lost to us forever. In the deliberation on ERP. it is strongly urged that consideration be given to the advisability of obtaining this allimportant scrap on some quid pro quo basis. For the reasons just stated. the immediate urgency becomes more apparent when we consider that our steel production. in the event of a national emergency. would be cut to approximately 50 percent within 5 weeks because of the lack of this vital ingredient.

Thus. the bill is not one of first impression in this legislative body. If the principle in this legislation could be found objectionable by Members here. certainly the form in which it is here presented is as little subject to criticism as any of such bills hitherto receiving our approval. Because by the committee amendment. the only matter upon which the railroads may agree is the matter of rates. Not schedules or servicesbut onlk rates. And such agreements are always to be under the control and supervision of the ICC. In addition. this bill actually legitimizes procedures which have been carried on between the roads under the auspices and direction of the ICC. The legislation removes *a paradox or dilemma which has been a part of our in\"terstatecommerce law for a long time. On the one hand. the Commerce Commission is required to have the railroads to agree upon through and connecting rates. Such rates have been developed through rate conferences under the direct supervision of the ICC. At the very same time. the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department had taken the position that all such agreements are illegal as in restraint of trade. andviolative of the Sherman antitrust law. So there Is illustrated the confusion and contradiction existing in this important segment of our transportation industry. I sincerely hope and believe that this bill will have the overwhelming support of this legislative body. as it has on two previous votes.",

R. 221. deals with the application of the antitrust laws to railroads subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It does not grant railroads immunity from antitrust laws or relieve them from the application thereof. It seeks to dispel the uncertainty and confusion which has arisen during recent years in the application of the antitrust laws to regulated transportation. and to provide a practical method for reconciling two great policies of Congress. namely. the National Transportation Act and the policy of the antitrust laws so that the objective of both can be obtained. This legislation provides a means of drawing a line of demarcation between collaboration and collective action between carriers which is permissible and that which is not. I understand it is Identical to a bill passed by the House In the Seventyninth Congress. and that the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee reported it favorably. but that the bill was lost in the legislative jam in the closing days of the session of the Seventyninth Congress. I understand this bill has the approval of railroads. truck and bus interests. and water carriers. as well as the United States Chamber of Commerce. and chambers of commerce throughout the country. and numerous associations of farmers and livestock growers including the National Grange and the Farm Bureau Federation. The Connecticut Public Utilities Commission passed a resolution in 1945 recommending the passage of this legislation. No opposition has been presented to me by anyone to this proposed legislation except by one or two chronic objectors. This legislation is not going to increase the burden of the taxpayers. nor will it prejudice their rights. This legislation is important to railroads and other common carriers. and everyone fully realizes that they are Important to the welfare of the country.",

Governor Arnall of Georgia fought a hard fight before the Supreme Court of the United States to determine the right. and he did establish the right of States to protest in the courts of their country against rank discrimination against them. Since that suit was determined by our Supreme Court. the Interstate Commerce Commission at long last got around to compelling a partial correction of rates that for years have tended to keep certain sections of our country. including my own. in economic slavery. This bill we are to vote on would cut out from under the courts the right to determine and forbid discrimination which allows a differential in rates in one direction as. against another or in favor of one section as against another in reaching certain markets of our country.

It Is understood that a certain amount of expansion was required during the emergency and during the war period. I think it is time for Congress to look the situation over and determine whether some of these corporations may be reduced. or if found unnecessary. be eliminated.

It went up to approximately 1.000.000 tons during the war. and the normal capacity to produce now is approximately 900.000 tons. When the pipe lines are filled and when business gets to going again we are very well satisfied that the American mines can produce the copper necessary for the country. On the other hand. there is an available production abroad amounting to approximately 2.000.000 tons. and from what can be learned with reference to the European demand they cannot absorb that amount. so that there will be somewhere from onehalf million to 750.000 tons of copper available for importation to this country.

The State Department of Agriculture is very much concerned about the establishment of a laboratory within the continental confines of the United States. This virus is so infectious that if it should spread from a place which was not properly segregated it might cause untold loss to the livestock industry and dairy industry of the Nation. I was wondering whether the Senator would have any objecticn to an amtndment which would limit the establishment of such a laboratory to an offshore island.",

But if th import controls on fats and oils. the import controls on rice. and a good many other controls which are contained in this particular act are carefully examined by the committee and if we put off final action until somewhere near the end of the session so we can see whether or not certain controls can be eliminated.

I think it can fairly be stated that the committee was unanimous in concluding that the evidence revealed the complete inadequacy of command by mutual cooperation where decisive action is of the essence. Both the Army and Navy commanders in Hawaii failed to coordinate and integrate their combined facilities of defense in the crucial days between November 27 and December 7. 1941. While they had been able over a period of time to conceive admirable plans for the defense of the Hawaiian coast. with the system of mutual cooperation. when the time came for the implementation of these plans. they remained hollow and empty contracts that were never executed. The tendency of let George do it and to assume that the other fellow will take care of the situation is an inseparable part of command by mutual cooperation. The conduct of operations in which a state of joint oblivion was clearly manifest was possible in a command by mutual cooperation. None of these faults and unwarranted assumptions clearly described in the testimony could have happened under the unity of command. Under the latter system. a single commander would have been charged with complete responsibility. All of the warnings and orders would have been his to interpret. estimate. and implement. In a command by mutual cooperation there is the unfailing likelihood of conflicting and overlapping prerogatives.

As Members who preceded me have so well pointed out. we learned. more than a quarter of a century ago. the absolute necessity of a single command in the field. That was demonstrated even more dramatically in the last war than In World War I. To Ignore this obvious fact and to do nothing toward correcting our old system would be a tragic mistake. I served for 8 years. from 1939 until the beginning of this Congress. on the House Committee on Military Affairs. I went through that period with the committee when we were preparing for the late war and while we were fighting. I saw something of the heartbreaking waste. duplication. and extravagance resulting from the inadequacy or total absence of coordination of the armed services. As merely one among hundreds of examples of duplication and waste. we have had all during and since the war two air transport organizations. in many instances paralleling each other. the Army Air Transport Command running all over the world. and the Naval Air Transport Service. as I said. in many instances paralleling the Army Air Transport Command. That is a senseless waste of equipment. manpower. and taxpayers money. This proposed unification will put an end to such things as happened in the Pacific. where the Army had control of one side of an island and the Navy the other side. and neither service could borrow or use equipment and supplies of the other. This plan will bring about a better relationship between the Army. the Navy. and the Air Forces.

There has been much objection to the establishment of an air force separate from and independent of the regular land and sea forces. Such objections spring. in my opinion. from the outmoded conception of air power as a minor auxiliary of the land and sea forces. In strategic and tactical importance. as well as in actual size. the air arm in the recent war proved its right to the status this plan proposes for it. There simply is no arguing the fact that warfare has moved into a third dimension. There is. in fact. no sound reason that I can conceive to doubt that air power will be a more decisive element in any future war than in the last. It has been argued that instead of unifying two services. this plan complicates the problem by splitting two services into three. That might be true if each service were permitted to go its separate and independent way. as in the past. But the spirit and entire purpose of this proposal is a close coordination of all elements of our Military Establishment. There is no good reason to believe that three coequal forces cannot be closely coordinated just as well as effectively as two.

I can recall that for many years past many of our leaders of military thought in this country were unalterably opposed to a merger bill. I recall that the Secretary of the Navy was opposed to it very strenuously in principle. and I do not think that the principles have changed very much. But. the time came when the leaders. of our military organizations in this country. came into agreement. and they decided that they were going to split up the military organization of this country into three parts. and they sat down and they wrote a bill. The first bill. I believe. was written by an admiral and a general. very able men. and they wrote H. R. 2319. and they brought this bill into the Congress and they said. \"Gentlemen. here is our agreement. This is a sacred document. You cannot change a single word in this document.\" The balance of the agreement was so delicate that they said. \"This must not be touched.\" But the Senate of the United States had other ideas on the subject. They thought that perhaps Congress had a right and duty to write its own legislation. so they took the structure which was set forth in the agreement and they wrote Senate bill 758. and they passed that bill. and it came over to the House and the House took a passing look at the original bill written by the military. and then they discarded it and started to work from the Senate bill. and they improved that measure very greatly. The bill the Senate wrote was a vast improvement over the measure which the military wrote. and the bill which the House committee has reported out is. in my humble opinion. a vast improvement over the bill which the Senate wrote. I hope that today. in the normal course of the democratic legislative process. that this bill will be further improved. Now. there is much good that is provided in this bill: The National Security Council. National Resources Board. Joint Chiefs of Staff. War Council. Munitions Board. and Central Intelligence.

It has been said that the new policy with Russia. which. let us say. is a policy of friendly firmnesswhich is an understatementcommenced with my speech on the floor of the Senate when I returned from the first General Assembly. and the address. 24 hours later. by the distinguished then Secretary of State. Mr. Byrnes. I think before the Foreign Policy Association. in New York. That was in February 1946. The negotiation of this treaty started in April 1946. Therefore. if the Senator from Nebraska bases his question on the calendar which I have indicated. I would say the answer is \"No.\" and that the policy with Russia to which he refers antedates even the beginning of the negotiation of this treaty. Furthermore. I add. in answering the final portion of the Senators question. that in the 213 days we sat across the table from Molotov. last year. I know of no single instance where the effort of the United States was not relentlessly pressed for the American point of view. in respect to what it believed to be justice in regard to this settlement. It would be absurd to say that we always won our point of view. but I think anyone familiar with the record would have to agree by way of verdict that we were amazingly successful in what I consider to be the appropriate approach to the Russian question. the appropriate approach being. not one of aggressive belligerence. but one of unyielding allegiance to certain fundamental essentials which shall be stated in a fashion which indicates that we mean what we say. and which shall be accepted. I hope sooner or later. on the basis that we say what we mean.",

The premise which the Senator now po~es depends upon American arms in Italy as a substitute for a treaty. and so far as I am concerned. I am not prepared to face the indefinite armed occupation of Italy. the indefinite armed defense of Italy against Russian and Yuogslavian claims. when there is an alternative available which at least sets a limitation upon the responsibilities which we confront. I say to the Senator again that I am unable to fathom how to make a separate treaty of peace respecting matters which inevitably involve multilateral decisions. Who is to decide what happens in Trieste? We cannot decide for ourselves. As a matter of fact. if we waited 6 months. as some Senators would -apparently like to have us do. before we even negotiated a treaty with Italy. I suspect we would find that by that time Trieste was so effectively infiltrated under the Hungarian formula that it would not make much difference whether we set up a free state and called it neutral or not. In other words. what I am saying to the Senator is that the answer to his question always requires an assessment of the alternative. I mqy be all wrong. and the Senator may be entirely correct. and if the Senator is right in his judgment. he certainly should vote against the ratification of this treaty. I do not press my view upon him at all. I merely say to him that my view is that the situation which he so fears will so infinitely deteriorate during the next 6 months without a treaty. and will so infinitely multiply the hazards and jeopardies for Italy. that the net result will be nothing short of tragic.

I am not so much worried about that. although. as was mentioned a while ago. he usually makes his decisions according to the initials that are on the transmittal papers as does the head of every other agency But in the long course of the travel of those papers many things have happened. not only to the man whose name is on the papers. but perhaps to dozens of men who did not get into such papers. and who kept out of them by yielding to things to which no American citizen should be called upon to yield. That was our history. that was too much Of our history in OPA. and I do not want to see a renaissance of that in connection with the dying gasps of rent control. Let us not do it now. We have the same remedies we always have had. and I think everyone will concede that enforcement has been better in rent control than in any other department of control. No case has been made. I respectfully suggest. for jumping to this new. radical. and offensive method -of penalizing an allegedly recalcitrant citizen. in this synthetic field of crime.",

In the first place. in the long history- of criminal procedure it has been demonstrated over and over again that the severity of the penalty is no deterrent whatsoever. and as a result. we have softened the penalty as we have come down through the years. It seems to me then to be a marked departure from that policy at this late date. as the distinguished Senator from Colorado has said. to embark upon an entirely new. a criminal method. of enforcement of this particular law. In the second place. I think it is extremely dangerous to have a law which makes it possible to have placed in the records of the criminal side of the district court an account of an arrest and a charge and a trial for a willful violation of the act. even though it might result in an acquittal. because there is a permanent record of a criminal charge such as could very well be lodged against many innocent people. which would last as long as time. and certainly as long as the records of the criminal court of the district may last.

With the criminal penalty section out. the situation is as follows: If the landlord overcharges or violates the act in some respect. the right to sue for treble damages rests with the tenant. but we know from experience that the tenant will not file the suit.

Senators will see by reading the report that it was most critical of Mr. Larson rather than praiseworthy. This is what the critical part was on page 7. I shall not take the time to read it all: A concern interested in purchasing surplus property is. of course. on notice of the foregoing special provisions for small business. It must reckon with the fact that the term \"small business\" is not defined in the act and is subject to interpretation by the disposal agency under regulation No. 10 (sec. 8310.1 (b) (7)). That is where he quit. Then I said. \"Well. read on. Mr. Larson.\" and this is what the report said: But it is entitled to have the discretion left by the act and the regulation to the disposal officer exercised with reason and with business fairness. And where the disposal officer. by establishing and publishing terms of disposition which include no provision for singling out a small business. represents that for a particular transaction the price bid. not the relative size of the bidders. is to be the basis for an award. the bidders should be entitled to rely on the representation in the absence of plain and unmistakable reasons under the law for not carrying out the representation.

I simply wish to make this summary: Hundreds of invitations for bids which were sent out In connection with surplus property had nothing to say about small business. Hundreds of contracts for surplus properties which were taken over by big business were awarded on bids made on invitations which had nothing to say about small business. For instance. the Big Inch pipe line comes to my mind. because the Armed Services Committee. of which I am a member. had to pass on that matter. among others. We rejected the original bid that was made. and got a higher one. In this case there was every reason to believe that either every bid would be rejected or negotiations would be continued with only the highest bidder. However. negotiations were continued with only the lowest bidder. There has never been anything in the testimony to show that the Columbia Metals Corp. said. \"We do not want the plant.\" The difference between the position of the Senator from Maryland and the position of the members of the committee is illustrated by a remark made by the able Senator from North Carolina . when I was testifying.before the committee: He said. \"Granted Mr. Larson made a mistake. but I do not think we should reject him on this one mistakegranted that he has made a mistake.\" I think that was the attitude of the committee. There is no question In my mind that the committee members think this whole transaction is regrettable and that it ought to have been handled more efficiently. Yet I say that if we had been one of the two companies making the highest bids. and had been rejected. it would not be so easy for us to take the detached position which Senators take when they have not been directly involved. It makes a big difference when you are the loser or the gainer. I think the Government of the United States should see to it that all its constituents. be they corporate or individual. are treated with exact fairness. and that its word is religiously adhered to in any transaction in which it may be engaged.",

It was repeated that the bill would remove all competition and enable railroad carriers to impose any sort of rates upon the commerce of the country that they desired. Over the last 40 years the ratebureau method of making rates has come to be standard. Since enactment of the Transportation Act of 1920 procedure of these bureaus has been uniform. Virtually all rail rates have been made by this method. From 1921 to 1946 the rates charged by railroads actually decreased nearly 24 percent per tonmile. The average tonmile earnings of the railroads on all traffic was 1.275 cents in 1921. in 1946 the figure was 0.978 cent. In other words. the railroad revenue per tonmile decreased 23.3 percent. How many other services or commodities can any Senator name the prices of which in 1946 were 76.7 percent of the charge 25 years ago? Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have Inserted. as part of my remarks. a table showing the average revenue per tonmile by years. through all years from 1921 to 1946. inclusive. also the average revenue per passengermile through this same period. the average hourly pay of employees. and a comparison of the unit price of railroad materials and supplies by years. from 1921 through 1946.

The 1946 passengermile charge is only 63.1 percent of what it was in 1921.

Opponents of the bill have always proceeded. either wilfully or ignorantly. upon an erroneous basis. If. as they claim. the railroads have complete control of rates imposed upon the traffic of the country. the roads have certainly neglected to use any such power. Every experienced traffic man knows that a majority of freightrate changes. whether made by a bureau or in some other method or manner. are decreased. Competition between railroads. pressure from shippers from a given area. and commercial competition between large cities and great producing areas have this effect. Consistently rates decrease from any level established by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The table which I have offered is conclusive proof of this fact. The Interstate Commerce Commission has made several Nationwide increases in rates during the 25year period I am discussing. Always. after a new level is established. attrition begins. Consistently rates go lower and lower until the next general increase is given. Some months ago the Interstate Commerce Commission granted an increase in rates. to become effective January 1. 1947. The average revenue per tonmile will be larger in 1947 than it was in 1946. The process of whittling at the rate level will then begin all over again. and. without any general increase or decrease through orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. the average per tonmile will be lower in 1950 than it will be in 1947. This has always been the case. I also offer for the RECORD and ask to have included in my remarks at this point a table entitled \"Comparative Freight ChargesPrincipal Countries.\"",

The United States and Canada have the lowest tonmile freight rate in the world. Canada is a fraction of a mill lower than the United States. The United States not only has the most efficient railroad transportation system in the world. but had in the test year. the lowest cost system with the exception of Canada. Japan is the only country having a lower tonmile revenue than the United States or Canada. In substance. all this bill does is bring rate bureaus. rate associations. and rate conferences under regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Up to 1942. they proceeded without any regulation. The propriety and legality of their operations had been unchallenged for 40 years. I repeat what I have said before. No common carrier may be legally paid for any service rendered. and no shipper may legally pay for such service unless there is a published tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. and/or the State commission. describing the service and setting out the charges. Without tariffs. shippers could not obtain service from the carrier. Without tran portation service the commerce of the country would stop. Chaos would result. Shipper opinion of the country was thrown into a panic in 1942. over the unexpected and wholly arbitrary action of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. In short. shippers immediately realized the farreaching implication of such action. That is why the shippers of the country have universally come to support this bill. In all my contacts with transportation regulations. which have covered the last quarter of a century. I have seen nothing approaching the unanimous support which the shippers of the country have given to this legislation now under consideration.

If that were the fact. this would be a very different question from what it is. The bill is not limited to that. The bill goes much further. because it grants the consent of Congress to the creation of organizations and associations of a kind which do not exist today. We have. Mr. President. for example. the Association of American Railroads. That is a voluntary. unofficial organization. created by the railroads of the United States by their own will. It has adopted its own rules and regulations. so to speak. for the administration of the functions It performs. It has adopted its own charter. But the association has no official existence.

My point. Mr. President. Is that it is absolutely impossible for any human mind to comprehend the combinations and permutations that would be possible once we grant the authority. So when we grant the authority we must be very careful.

It would provide. in effect. that the tenure of office of the President shall be 6 years. and 6 years only. with no right to be reelected. It would not have any effect upon the present incumbent of the White House. Mr. Truman. I think many Members on our side of the aisle believe that when you have the possibility of 8 years in the White House there is a tendency to squelch new leadership. when young men tend to get in front and have the klieg lights thrown on them they are tugged back by the incumbent in the White House. The incumbent is usually jealous of his power and discourages any heir apparent. That has been the practice for many. many years. not only when the Democrats were in power but when the Republicans were in power. Successors are not groomed. successors. are not encouraged. To my mind. a 6year term would change all that. I believe the country is hurt when you have a man serving one term of 4 years with an overweening ambition to serve a second term. because at the end of 3 years. just as the President reaches the highest point of efficiency. men in this House and men in the other body. and even men \ufffdand women outside the Congress. start to hunt and hound him. they seek to snipe at hin. and embarrass him. and thereby destroy his efficiency. I believe that 8 years in the White House is also bad for party welfare. Two terms as President makes the President. undoubted leader of his party. but his leadership becomes personal.. He becomes a great concentration of party power. It is well to repeat what a great Senator from New York.

No President. it matters not how wise or sagacious he may be. can adequately and successfully conduct a campaign for reelection and act for the welfare of his country as President of the United States. Just as oil will not mix with water. those two functions cannot properly mix. We know also that it is not very edifying for the President. to descend to the political arena and to indulge in the mud slinging and in the hurlyburly of a political campaign. The President should be above the rough and tumble of a campaign for reelection. The President would. therefore. do a better job because there would not be the hope of reelection. He would not have to cater to selfish groups. The amendment. I think. would make for more statesmanship. more courage in the Presidency because votes would not be in the balance. Under the twoterm rule. the last 18 months of the first term are primarily given over to the coming campaign. A President cannot do both and do both well. that is. conduct a successful campaign for reelection and at the same time conduct the affairs of the Chief Executive for the good of all. Six years may be too long for a mediocre President. Remember no plan is perfect. Six years. however. is long enough for even the best President.",

I happened to have been on the subcommittee which heard the evidence submitted at the hearings held on this particular piece of legislation. We had before us every theory which is here proposed. We had those who did not believe in any change or the submission of any kind of a proposal to the people. We had further the proposal providing for a 6year term without any right of reelection. Then we also had bills which proposed two terms of office of 4 years each. After hearing all of the evidence and hearing all of the statements of witnessesand may I say there were 16 or 18 of them who submitted their views upon these questionswe came to a conelusion. and I think that conclusion is borne out entirely by statements made by some of our forefathers in their observations with respect to the tenure of the office of President of the United States. We must remember that the people think in the term that a President is elected for 4 years. They have never thought in terms of a President being elected for 6 years and. as some of our forefathers saidGrover Cleveland. Woodrow Wilson. and others--if we get a bad man. under the theory of a 6year term. there is no way in the world you can get rid of him within a shorter term. But under the plan of two terms of 4 years each. at the end of 4 years the people have the right and they have the power at the ballot box to terminate the term of office of that official who has not measured up to the standards.",

I favor the passage of House Joint Resolution 27 proposing a submission to the people of the question whether there should be an amendment to the Constitution to limit the tenure of the President to two terms. and am opposed to the proposed amendment which has been offered to limit the term to one of 6 years. If we were legislating in a vacuum. there would be much force and logic behind the suggestion of the gentleman from Massachusetts. and others. that the voters should have a free and untramelled choice to name the same man to this high office as often as they might wish. Indeed. it is with some reluctance that I reach the conclusion in my own mind that the threat to our democratic processes from theabuses of autocracy and. therefore. the consummate evil in permitting complete freedom of choice to designate the same person for this office again and again and again transcends in importance and seriousness what I am also prepared to concede is an evil in limiting the freedom of choice of a free people. Therefore. I hold the view that some restraint upon the tenure of the President is desirable. It seems to me that the voters of this country are entitled to express their views as to who shall be its Chief Executive oftener than once in 6 years. The point is made that if a President is elected for 6 years. and knows that he can serve no longer. he will be entirely divorced from \"politics\" and will be able to serve his country without one eye cocked toward the next Presidential election. This argument is not without force. But it seems to me largely a question of the caliber of the man. not the length of his tenure which will determine whether he puts politics or the welfare of his country first.",

I have here his statement. He said that to prohibit a President from serving a third term. where he served two full terms. might be in the public interest. but that should not apply where he served only one term and a part of another. He was protecting himself. What have the people of America done to all of a sudden cause a majority party in Congress to say that it does not have confidence in the integrity and the wisdom of the people? The only thing they have done Is to elect Franklin Roosevelt for a third term. Yet. are you gentlemen going to contend that the people of 45 States were misled and ignorant. that they did not know what they were doing. and that they need your protection from ever again getting the services of a great leader in time of a crisis? You know It is a very strange thing that the majority party Is getting away from the idea of its founders. Alexander Hamilton made the strongest arguments against this amendment that I have ever read. He stated in a very straightforward way five good reasons why it should not be adopted. They have gotten away from the concepts of their leaders. James Wilson. Gouverneur Morris. Roger Sherman. and many other members of the Constitutional Convention had very strong ideas about it. They were opposed to a restriction of tenure. George Washington did not mention the matter once in the debate. He voted for the Constitution and later. in a letter to Lafayette. stated that he did not join those who stated that the nations should not be able to avail themselves of the services of any man no matter for how many terms.

I introduced the first bill limiting the President of the United States to two terms. I took this step 7 years ago because I thought the policy of serving only two terms. which was inaugurated by George Washington. our first President. ought to be set forth in the Constitution. I think so today. You will recall in 1940. the dictators of Europe were on the march. The war clouds hung low and the world was in turmoil. Abhorring as I always have. the centralization of power. I did not want anyone to assume such authority here in our own land. I therefore introduced. the following resolution which is almost identical to the measure which the committee has brought on the floor today. I urge the Congress to pass it so we can assure the American people that no one man can ever perpetuate himself in the White House forever. Our Constitution cannot be abided by with concentrated authority in the hands of the executive branch. The natural love for power that men in high places often have is increased the longer they remain at the helm. They tend to shape the destiny of a whole people according to their own single mind if allowed to go unchecked. For this reason. this Congress should take action now. Let us imit the length of time any President may serve. regardless of party. Let us guarantee America that dictatorship shall never place its yoke on this fair land. To make my record clear.

It is strange that this should be the second piece of business before this House. It Is evident to me that they are expressing their resentment for a man who has passed. They are permitting their feelings to override their judgment. One of the previous speakers gave as a point in favor of his argument that in 1936 the peoples money was used to win the election. At that time the late Franklin D. Roosevelt had been in office only 4 years. That argument could not be used as a substantial one to support this contention here today. I am not in favor of a 6year term. because if a man is not good for a second term why should he be elected for 6 years? It is better to have him go before the people at the end of 4 years and have him meet the public than it is to have him serve out a 6year term. Therefore. I shall vote against that particular amendment. Sooner or later it may be that the Republicans will have a President who will have served two full terms of 4 years each. and there might be a national emergency and the people of this country might want to call on that Rspublican to serve them for a third 4year term. If you put the people In the position of not being able to exercise that prerogative. it would be unfair to this democracy.

It is merely a proposal to express resentment because a particular party had not been able to overcome a certain leader in this country.

Mr. President. it Is with deep regret that I find the leaders of the Republicans in the Senate of the United States. meeting almost daily. conferring and pledging their Members to vote for a resolution that is squarely in the teeth of congressional reform as passed in the Senate last June. Mr. President. we are taking a step backward instead of going forward in the process of legislative reform if the counter resolution submitted by the Senator from Maryland and modified by the Senator from Georgia shall not be agreed to. We will endorse a policy which will start to whittle away the foundation stones of the Reorganization Acta program which will ultimately bring forward the meat ax for the purpose of destroying one of the most Important pieces of legislation. looking toward the perpetuity of free Government which has ever been enacted since we became a republic.

Clarence knew me well. and I knew him. and loved him even as I love his wife. A conversation which he and I had once down on a Florida beach when he and other members of a small group of this House were staying with my husband and me comes to me very vividly today. We were discussing life and death. the meaning of life. the possibilities in death. where did it come from. where does it go? I have always read much in the philosophies of the various races and nations of the world. We had looked up and discussed some of the passages that had meant much to me. The -passage which I want to read into the RECORD appealed to Clarence so very much that several times in the years afterward he would speak of it. When some of our close friends went on he would say. \"Frances. let me read that again. I hope you will always carry it in your purse.

It was a great shock to me when I heard of Clarence Hancocks passing. I cherished him as one of the finest friends that it was my opportunity to make. His was one of the finest associations I have had while I have been a Member of the House. I recall one summer when my daughter and I were visiting the northern part of my district. Clarence Hancocks summer residence is in Cazenovia. N. Y.. in Madison County. which is in my district. I had been a speaker at one of the meetings there and that evening we were entertained by the most gracious of hosts. Clarence and Mrs. Hancock. That visit will remain indelible upon my memory as long as I live. Even in the early years of my service in the House. Clarence E. Hancock was looked upon as one of the outstanding leaders of upstate New York and of this body. He was very well thought of throughout the southern tier and the people of Syracuse had enough faith and confidence in him to send him to Congress for 20 years. Any man who can remain in this body and serve as diligently and faithfully as long as he did possesses an intangible something which many of us yearn to possess but which escapes many of us. Few of us appreciate the good things of life while they are evident. and it is especially true of friendship. Often deaths door has to be closed before the real loss becomes apparent. In paying tribute to our former distinguished colleague. when a friend such as Clarence Hancock is taken away. we can use the words of the poet: For it so falls out that what we have we prize not to its worth while we enjoy it.

We all join in mourning his passing. and I. for one. feel a keen personal loss in the death of one of the best personal friends with whom I have ever served.

I have been strongly in favor of continuing the Sugar Control Act and the rationing of sugar. for I apprehend that too early an ending of it would cause tremendous confusion in this country. I am convinced. however. Mr. Pres-. ident. that since the majority of the Members of the Senate have seen fit to conclude the controls on sugar by the 31st of October of this year. thereby adopting the House date. that It would be much better to end the rationing at the end of this week. The proposed short extension in my opinion will cause a great deal of confusion and will lead to unusual profiteering on the part of some persons who will hold their sugar until the expiration date of the act and otherwise manipulate the supply. For that reason I shall vote against the measure. I do so despite the fact that I probably will have to explain to a number of my constituents. to whom I have written letters. that I favor sugar rationing. I had hoped that we could extend this sugar rationing until sometime next spring so that the controls might be removed without any lengthy knowledge to those who might speculate in sugar. If rationing is going to be concluded in October. I shall cast my vote against the measure and let it end now. Prices will go up whenever rationing ends. but in my opinion it will cause more profiteering and hoarding to fix the October date than to catch the speculators unaware and end it now.

As I explained this afternoon. that was one of the very bad features against the October 31 date. I can conceive of nothing worse so far as the housekeeper and home canner are concerned. With regard to the other part of the question. as to whether it was not more serious to decontrol now than next October. the Senator from Massachusetts was thinking largely in terms of the very large industrial consumption of sugar. As I understood. he expressed the fear that that very large industrial consumption of sugar might drain the household supplies at this time. Am I correct in that statement of the question?",

As has been explained. the hoarding which would take place in anticipation of that date would come during the canning season. The point has been raised that the Secretary does not necessarily decontrol at that date. The fact remains. however. that everyone knows that control is to be lifted at that time at the latest. and the hoarding will therefore start during the canning season unless the Secretary announces a date suddenly. well in advance of that time. The housewife and canners certainly are not served by the October 31 date. under any conceivable circumstances except those I last.mentioned. if the Secretary should suddenly announce a date well in advance of the canning season. That is what we are doing. in effect. if we vote \"nay\" on the joint resolution. Let me say to the Senator from Massachusetts that I cannot say what will happen to the household user as compared with the industrial user in the State of Massachusetts or any other region where the industrial demand is strong. We would be in the position of relinquishing controls. and something would happenheaven only knows what.

The Government is the owner of the Cuban crop and the Puerto Rican crop. and I am certain that with that sugar in the hands of the Federal Government and with controls applied until October 31 all will receive their just share and there will be no opportunity to hoard sugar. As I tried to point out this afternoon. if we select March 31. 1948. instead of October 31. 1947. as the date for the removal of controls. the scandal which has been mentioned will really occur. because the period of the greatest sugar production begins in November and continues through December and on until May in each year. and if we should make the mistake of having controls removed on March 31 there is no question in my mind that all the new sugar produced from November until early next year. up to March 31. would beretained.so that it could be sold on an uncontrolled market.",

I preface my question by the observation that because I felt that March was a better date I voted against the amendment providing for moving the date up to October 31. I think it is now obvious that the Senate made a mistake in the action which it took. But the joint resolution is now beyond consideration so far as amendments to the text are concerned. The question is now on the passage of the joint resolution. If we decline to pass it. all sugar control will end next Monday. The question I should like to ask the Senator from Missouri or the Senator from New Hampshire . or any other Senator who can answer it. is this: In view of the fact that it has long been known that sugar control will expire next Monday unless Congress extends it. if this measure is now defeated. as between the condition that will transpire following next Monday and that which will transpire following next October. would the country be worse off next Monday and following. or would it be worse off in October? I am not speaking of a possible sugar scandal. I presume that so far as it could be done there has already been hoarding of sugar. on the theory that Congress might not extend the law and that the price would. immediately rise after the laws expiration next Monday. Whether there will be greater hoarding between now and October I do not knew. but insofar as the equitable distribution of sugar among the consumers in this country is concerned. would the country be any worse off next October than it would be next week if Congress declined to extend control?",

Section 4 provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to attempt in any manner to establish a dictatorship. I have previously indicated that the words \"any manner\" must necessarily mean some manner other than the use of force or violence. This must necessarily be true for we have already have statutes on the books which prohibit the use of force and violence. What. then. would constitute \"any other manner\"? Well. the language of the bill itself gives us an indication of what these other methods may be. On page 17. section 2. subsection 6 there are listdd a number of subsections which characterize the activities other than force and violence. which are sought to be penalized by this bill.

It is clear. therefore. that one of the activities which is sought to be penalized here. as an activity \"other than force or violence.\" is the activity of striking. Let us proceed to subsection (B) : The inciting of economic. social. and racial -strife and conflict. What does the committee mean by that? Well. you have all heard the Congressman from Mississippi. Congressman RANKIN. He stood on this floor yesterday and again today and chanted that a bill which seeks to eliminate racial segregation constitutes incitement of racial strife. Are we then to conclude that any group which seeks to end segregation again comes under this section of the law? Subdivision (C) prohibits: \"The dissemination of propaganda calculated to undermine established government and institutions.\" What is the everyday language for that? It simply means opposition. criticism of certain policies of the Government. This section seeks to equate criticism with subversion and conformity with loyalty. Thus this section would penalize strikes and picketing and criticism of the administration and all attempts to end segregation. It is for that reason that we say that this bill is \"Rank in\" every respect. and we say \"Nix on\" this Mundtstrosity.",

There is nothing in section 4 that deals with any organization. international or local. except one which attempts to establish a \"totalitarian dictatorship system of government.\" We all know that is not the purpose of those organizations and hence they would not be affected in any way. I do not believe that being \"subject to foreign control\" is anywhere near as great an evil as an attempt to establish a \"totalitarian dictatorship.\" I do not think there is any evil dealt with in this bill which is as great as the evil of attempting to establish a totalitarian dictatorship in this country. The fundamental reason for the magnitude of such evil is that a totalitarian dictatorship would deny the fundamental. inalienable right of human beings to liberty. That is the broad moral basis for this proposal. Such moral law is over and above the Constitution of the United States. but it is recognized in the Constitution and in our Declaration of Independence. The inalienable rights that human beings possess transcends everything that the gentlemen from New York have referred to because the cases he mentioned did not involve cases where inalienable. rights were being protected.

In the course of that investigation it was insisted that there were Communists In the employ of that agency. The question arose as to whether or not Communists should serve in the executive branch of the Government. Those who believed that they should be permitted to -serve took the position that it did not make any difference What their political belief was. they ought to be entitled to employment by the Government. Possibly I am a little naive. but it has always been my belief that a man employed in the Government of the United States should be deeply interested in making that government work. That is his first responsibIlity. It has always seemed to me that you could not expect very good service for good government from a person in the employ of the Government who did not believe in this Government of ours but who. on the contrary. believed in some totalitarian form of government or some form of government that is diametrically opposed to our form of government under the Constitution and just laws fairly administered for all. As far as I am concerned I cannot see any similarity with any operations of Mr. Hitler. I think it is just a matter of common sense. important for preservation of our freedom. for national security. and in the interest of good government. that we expect that the people who serve us in the executive branch of. the Government of the United States hold the conviction that ours is the best kind of government and that they would rather have our kind of government than some totalitarian or any other alien form of government.

As long as that Federal control is continued the dairy farmers I talked to in my district are satisfied. Mr. Chairman. if this bill passes Federal control will be continued. We have the Pure Food and Drug Administration of the Federal Government which over the years has given us a good administration. It is one of the finest agencies of the Federal Government insofar as cooperation with the States is concerned. I talked with representatives of that department yesterday. I asked them. \"Will repeal of this tax make your task more difficult? Is there any more reason why you cannot police the oleomargarine situation the same as you do other food and drug products?\" They said. \"Absolutely not.\" When this tax was placed on oleomargarine we did not have the Pure Food and Drug Act on the books that we have today. We have just amended that act in the House. which bill is over in the Senate now and will be passed in a few days. That bill was based on a Supreme Court decision. In that act we say that Federal control of any commodity moving in interstate commerce shall follow through to the ultimate consumer. so that a pure food and drug inspector can seize oleomargarine at a grocery store. in a restaurant or anywhere he may find it. There is ample punishment provided in the law for those who would substitute oleomargarine for butter. We also have the False Labeling Act.",

If you want the best example of the extremity to which the dairy interests have gone in their efforts to supply good products. just drive out through the Washington milkshed and look at these farms. You will see a big barn that was built 30 or 40 years ago. which cost maybe $10.000. You will see it there standing vacant because sanitary regulations have been enforced. and the farmer had to build another $10.000 barn maybe right next to the old one. There he has to milk his cows. The old barn generally houses the feed. Maybe the silo is over there. too. In this new barn he could have his milk house. but regulations forbid. So he has had to build a milk house costing probably $3.000. 50 feet away from the barn. He must carry each cows milk as it is milked to the milk house and there strain it and put it in the cooler. The farmer has gone a long way to supply a good product and a healthy commodity. He has put his milk checks back into the preparation of a still better product all through the years. The two barns and milk house in many cases represent the worth of the farm. The farmer has put his dairy income back into the building of new buildings. which is made necessary by these new regulations.

I think there is some significance in the fact that everyone who has spoken in favor of this substitute voted against discharging the Committee on Agriculture from consideration of the oleomargarine taxes. I therefore have some question as to the solicitude of those gentlemen for the housewives who want colored margarine. Of course. the July dating of the substitute would mean there would be no taxfree colored margarine for a year or 2 years pending manufacture of the very elaborate machinery necessary to package margarine in triangular shapes. Of course. the worst feature of the substitute is the fact that it would raise the cost of margarine to the consumer. Many of us are favoring this legislation from the consumer angle. We want to keep the price of margarine low. Anything which would increase the price is therefore disadvantageous. Now coming down to thisquestion of the shape of the product. in order to protect the consumer against fraud. no law has ever required that a suit of clothes must carry a patch because it is not all wool. No law has ever required a pair of nylon stockings to carry a stripe because they are not all silk. Why were such requirements unnecessary? Because our misbranding laws are entirely adequate to protect consumers.",

For us to say that we are doing this simply as a matter of trade. simply as a matter of balancesheet economics. and simply to get back. to the level of 1938as so many advocates of this plan have saidis to me not enough.

Similarly. we helped Czechoslovakia. but only recently we have learned that the iron curtain has been rung down on Czechoslovakia.

In this bill there is no provision requiring the return of 1 cent. The Administrator is to be given the power to make certain deals. but there is no requirement as to that. Vast powers are given to the Administrator. by the bill. either to give away the aid or to make terms on a businesslike basis.

We have an agreement with other nations in regard to the matter. We cannot unilaterally decide that France or Belgium or Holland or Luxemburg or Norway or Denmark is not entitled to reparations.

They will use some of the money in their zone. There are millions more Germans In Germany than there were before the war. Their breadbasket has gone. If we allow them to come back only to the level of 1936 they still cannot meet their obligation and will not get off the backs of the American people. I desire to make one further observation.

The statement was that it was impossible to establish a rate of exchange between the satellite countries and Russia in trading among themselves except it be translated into terms of American dollars. For instance. if steel or machinery were to be allocated as between one country and another. it would be impossible for them to arrive at i rate of exchange.

My feeling is that in order to make that determination. if we are to translate it into tons of steel or millions of feet of lumber. or whatever commodity may be involved. it would have to be done by translating it into American dollars and then into the different commodities and values which the Administrator would interpret. regardless of the exchange rate on currency between France and England. Italy and England. or as between any other European countries. I attended a farm sale in France within the past year and a half and saw a 2yearold colt sell for 187.000 francs. In American money. at the then rate of exchange. it would amount to approximately $1.500. Under the terms of the definition. certainly the Administrator. if he should apply this rule. would require that the colts price should be based upon a realistic dollar. and that an artificial rate of exchange be not paid for the animal. If it can be done under the original wording. if it is broad enough to accomplish what is said will be done. that is an entirely different situation from the interpretation of the definition which I have gathered as to the valid rate of exchange.

According to the figures submitted. there would be 123 plants yet to be dismantled. to go from the United Kingdom zone. and 55 out of the American zone. if I correctly recall the figures. and to them should be added the plants which should go to France. I suppose. not including those to go to Russia and Poland. So to a great extent that letter almost bears out the figures he gave me.",

    "speech": "I wish to ask the Senator a question. and once again I desire to point out something which I have read in the report of the House Committee on Foreign Aid. This was set forth in detail. and they recommended as late as the beginning of this month that no further dismantling be made until we decide what we shall do under this foreignaid program. I think that is a good recommendation. So in view of the allocations of steel which are to bring the production of France and the United Kingdom up to certain levels. and in view of t~e fact that last year France obtained 90 percent of its production on the basis of the 1938 level. would it not be possible to discontinue the dismantling of these plants. or else figure them in the allocations of steel going to the recipient countries. so that under the foreignaid program we shall start with the allocations of new steel predicated upon the continuance of the dismantling. or else have no dismantling until we know what the industry level is going to be? It seems to me that to pull Germany down and to build France up to a level that goes far beyond the prewar level of 1938 is one thing. but in addition to that. more than 50 percent of the allocations of steel under the foreignaid bill goes to Great Britain and France. Are we to seek to build up those two countries to a level far beyond the 1938 level by adding to the reparations program and by insisting upon the additional allocation of steel. which today is so scarce in this country? I submit to the distinguished Senator. who is on the committee. this proposition: Would the Senator accept an amendment to the pending bill providing that no further dismantling shall be done under the levelingoff agreements until after there has been a determination of ERP legislation which the Senate is now considering?",

For several weeks the reports were that the nomination would never get out of committee. Then all of a sudden it was reported. with. I may say. somewhat suspicious haste. It is for a 7year term on the Federal Communications Commission. In my opinion that is a tremendously important Commission. I think it is up to the Senate to satisfy itselfand frankly I am not satisfied. I do not know about the wisdom of the nomination one way or the otherthat appointments to this Commission will really serve the best interests of the Nation. I myself have observed some rather disturbing things about the Federal Communications Commission. I have heard more disturbing reports since this nomination was reported. I have heard .a report. on what I consider reliable authorityand obviously in the past few days I have not had any opportunity to investigate it. I do not know whether it is true or notwhich indicates that certain interests. groups. who are greatly interested in this nomination. have a direct pipe line to the Federal Communications Commission. which we certainly would not want to have occur. What the score is I do not know. So far as I can determine. Miss Hennock is a lawyer from New York. and I might point out that the late President Roosevelt never appointed a member of the Federal Communications Commission from New York City. for the simple reason that New York City is the center of the radio industry. and he wanted to avoid any possibility of the industry itself having too much influence on the Commission. So far as I can discover. she has had no experience in radio rnatters. and from what I can learn of her background. frankly I do not think she is qualified for the job. and I want to be on record as opposed to her confirmation.",

As chairman of the subcommittee which investigated this nomination for the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. which reported it by a vote of 8 to 0. with another member voting \"present.\" I think the Senate should know what we have learned as to the circumstances. Miss Hennock has been a member of the New York bar for 20 or 25 years. I hesitate to estimate the age of a lady. but I should say she is between 40 and 50 years old. so she is reasonably mature. She has had quite a brilliant record at the bar. She is a member now. which is somewhat unusual for a woman. of the third largest law firm in New York City. one of the most highly respected and distinguished. one composed almost exclusively oi Republicans. She has had no experience in radio. as the Senator from Minnesota has said. which. it seemed to many of us. was perhaps most fortunate. because one who had been active in radio work. representing radio clients. would by that very fact come in under somewhat of a cloud. The committee took into consideration her breadth of experience and tFaining and recognized abilities. I may say that one of her most earnest sponsors was John W. Davis. of New York. who certainly is a leader of the New York bar. and who vouched most earnestly for her capacity and character. And from many other quarters there have come most earnest testimonials as tothe character and competency of this woman. Obviously only the future can tell how well she can fulfill these responsibilities. I can say that we in our committee. share the concern which the Senator from Minnesota has experienced concerning the functioning of the Federal Communications Commission. We think it needs new blood. and it was the consensus of those of us who became familiar with this matter through contact with many who were acquainted with her and through various representations. that she would be well qualified to fit into this position. and we believed her confirmation was warranted and wise.",

The housing bill passed yesterday will aid the veterans get more housing than ever before and last year we built the most houses ever built for veterans. The slumclearance feature of a bill at this time does not make. sense. if they tore down slums now it would increase cost of veterans houses because It would make materials more scarce and cause the price to be higher.

    "speech": "In answer to the statement of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. in which I think his able collaborationist from Maryland concurred. I want to say that they have neglected entirely the argument which one Great Lakes shipper was patriotic enough to advance. and which is also included in the final letter from the shippers that was Introduced yesterday by the Senator from Massachusetts . In one of the letters sent to the late Senator Bailey a Great Lakes shipper frankly says that it is in the interest of America to have the seaway developed. and that it would be well to do so. though it might result in hurting his own business. The point I want to make is that last season 50.000.000 tons of freight were carried through the MacArthur lock alone. Through the Soo locks over 100.000.000 tons of freight were carried in one season of 7 months. Some eastern Senators boast about what can be done on the east coast. Let me say to them that the Welland Canal can accommodate a considerable amount of freight. but at a certain point In the canal the cargo carried in the larger boats must be unloaded and reloaded into smaller boats. Stevedores are obliged to handle the cargo. If cargo Is destined to Montreal by way of the Welland Canal it must be transshippedit must be unloaded and reloaded. I call attention to the last letter introduced into the RECORD by the Senator from Massachusetts . in which it is pointed out that it is only common sense that the cost of transportation must be greater when there must be transshipment. when cargo must be unloaded from larger boats and placed In smaller boats. It is admitted that larger boats can handle cargo better than the small ones. and that if the shipment can be made through in larger boats it will result in a saving of at least 10 cents a bushel of grain for the farmer. Mr. President. it has been estimated by Julius Barnes that if the present condition in Europe continues. we will have to ship. not a hundred million bushels but 40.000.000 bushels from Canada and the *United States through the ports. and with such heavy traffic shipment by canal will be advantageous.",

He stated again that over 50.000.000 tons of freight had gone through the MacArthur lock in the past year. I would call to his attention a fact with respect to which I think I am correct. The MacArthur lock has two sets of locksone of which accommodates large vessels and one which accommodates small vessels. The Welland Canal. through which all kinds of vessels must go in order to make the proposed seaway selfliquidating. has only one set of locks. and those locks can be used either by tollfree ships of small cargo capacity or tollpaying ships of big cargo capacity. There we find a bottleneck. The Senator cannot rightly compare the traffic which may go through this seaway and the traffic which has gone through the MacArthur lock.",

Through the Soo locks last season were carried more than 100.000.000 tons of freight. Traffic going one way through the MacArthur lock amounted to nearly 50.000.000 tons. That is my answer with respect to the MacArthur lock. The MacArthur lock. and the lock in the Welland Canal. as I understand. and the locks contemplated to be built in connection with the St. Lawrence seaway will have 30 feet clearance. and the channel will have a clearance of 27 feet. If one lock at the Soo can accommodate 50.000.000 tons of traffic going only one wayit was not a twoway traffic. as it will be when the commerce of tomorrow utilizes this great lock systemSenators can imagine what will happen when ships come back loaded. On that basis. as was testified. it -is estimated that practically 70.000.000 or 80.000.000 tons of freight will be handled through the St. Lawrence seaway.",

The Department of Commerce was not in a position to make a study of the question. It says so in effect. It could not make a hurried report. and no one else could. Let me repeat: Whether or not tolls should actually be levied on the St. Lawrence seaway is a matter of national policy which requires careful study and analysis. * * * Furthermore. a consideration of tolls in any one case. such as the St. Lawrence seaway. necessitates an examination of the effect of such tolls on competitive routes.

The effect of a new schedule of toll charges upon existing traffic must certainly be studied very carefully. and the possibilities of discriminatory charges In order to preserve the relative position of industries and commerce established on a principle of free water transportation must be examined. This is particularly important since Canadian national policy in the St. Lawrence watershed. which is the Dominions economic life line. is based upon the principle of tollfree water transportation.",

It is a provision that has been carried in the appropriation bill for the Navy as well as the appropriation bill for the War Department for 30 years. It is a prohibition against a shopmanagement practice that is commonly known as the Taylor system. It prohibits the use of stop watches in estimating the time taken by an individual in a given operation. It was tried in some of the private concerns years ago. and management found that it created so much trouble. so much confusion. so much disagreement. In fact. so much opposition by labor that it was abandoned and is now considered an unfair labor practice by many employers as well as by workers. I am told that neither the War Department nor the Navy Department intend to use such a system on the men. in fact. they do not care to use the other phase of the Taylor system. that of paying a bonus to one of these socalled leaders or pace setters within the shop. The socalled leader is usually the man of greatest ability in the shop. His operations are clocked. and then his production record is considered to be the average. Now. you know and I know that many individual workmen are faster than others. and the faster man. with a smaller amount of effort. can produce more than another man who is not quite so skilled. not quite so facile at adjusting himself to the operation. but yet that slower man might be devoting a great deal more energy in accomplishing his task. This type of operation is bad. This legislation has beeti on the books since 1913. and I see no good reason why it should not be continued at this time. For that reason I respectfully ask the committee to accept the amendment. As part of my remarks and under permission already granted me. I include the following Senate Report No. 930. Sixtysecond Congress. second session. which was presented in the Senate by Senator Borah on July 17. 1912. together with the record cards used under the Taylor system.

I assume that is the staff about which he was speaking. Although I do not wish to be immodest or to violate a Presidential confidence. nevertheless let me state that when I reported to the President that I had been named to fill. insofar as possible. the shoes which he had occupied. he suggested that we had had a considerable training in that field and should know something of the problems which we would face. The emphasis on the word \"should\" is mine. Mr. President. So if it is not immodest. I would suggest that that suggestion be taken into account. along with our suggestion. Mr. President. it seems to me that the Senator from Maine took unfair advantage of the President by trying to make a courteous personal compliment appear as an endorsement by the President of special committees. If this practice of taking literally every compliment of our colleagues and capitalizing upon it becomes widespread. the Members of this body may become so cautious and cagey that we might well lose our hardearned reputation as the most courteous legislative body in the world. The newspapers headlined this incident as though President Truman had endorsed the continuance of these special committees. Yesterday I saw the President. and I asked hin if this were his sentiment. He said that he had intended no such expression. and that several years ago. when passing on the reins to Senator Mead. he had expfessed the opinion that the committee was strictly a wartime body whose functions should be wound up promptly after VJday. While everybody acclaims the Congressional Reorganization Act. few seem to have taken the trouble to read it. Here we have the spectacle of a group of Senate leaders proposing a committee to investigate wartime expenditures of funds. on the ground that no standing committee is equipped to do it. That statement may have been true in the Seventyninth Congress. It is not true today. because among our new standing committees is the bright and shiny new committee called Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments.

It makes no difference to me as a personal matter whether the job of investigation is done by the Special Committee To Investigate the National Defense Program or whether it be done by a standing committee of the Senate.

Certainly we as individual Senators have a grave obligation. should the Senate not continue the special investigating committee. to see to it that some committee of this body investigates the various matters which the special committee has uncovered. or with respect to which it has leads looking toward items which need investigation.

I have been listening to the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for some time. and there seems to be quite a difference of opinion among the learned lawyers who are testifying as to what should be done to untangle the condition that now exists. I have prepared two amendments which I believe. if enacted. would straighten this matter out. One amendment is to the Fair Labor Standards Act. It would simply make it plain. so that there would be no further misunderstanding in connection with portaltoportal pay rates. The other amendment which I intend to propose is an amendment to House bill 71. amending the Internal Revenue Act. This would effectively settle the portaltoportal dispute in case the bills which have been introduced should fail. The amendment which I intend to propose to the Internal Revenue Act simply provides that in cases in which suits are brought for the collection of portaltoportal pay. any moneys recovered through such suits shall be subject to a 100percent tax by the Federal Government. That might discourage the filing of such suits. Furthermore. the amendment would provide that anyone compelled to pay a claim on suits filed under this portaltoportal pay requirement would be entitled to deduct the amount he paid from the amount he owed the Government on his 1947 income tax. and to carry the balance. if any. over to future years. for 5 years. until he recovered all he had been forced to pay. Mr. President. this method of recovering windfall money was adopted by Congress when the processing tax was declared unconstitutional. The money left in the hands of processors for which they had rendered no service was taxed nearly 100 percent. I hope the method I am proposing will be adopted promptly. so that the burden and uncertainty of commerce may be relieved. Mr. President.

In the first place. the Boulder Canyon project. unlike any other project in the 17 Western States for reclamation. provides for the payment of $300.000 a year to the State of Nevada and $300.000 to the State of Arizona.

That authorization bill in the Seventyninth Congress. second session. last year passed the House and Senate and was vetoed by the President of the United States. After the President vetoed that legislation the committee thought it was jusifled in taking the legislation out of the appropriation in the regular supply bill. In justice and in fairness.

Mr. Speaker. the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Michigan has explained to us in detail this measure and why the necessity for it at this time. We are faced with a serious situation in carrying out the obligations of the medical department both in the Army and the Navy as to the medical services for the armed forces. The essential features of this bill in title I provide that commissioned medical and dental officers of the Army. Navy. and Public Health Service shall be given extra pay at the rate of $100 per month in addition to their base and longevity pay. There is a proviso that not more than $36.000 may be paid to any one officer during his lifetime under this authority. The increase applies to all grades uniformly. and affects all active Regular officers and all nonRegular officers now on voluntary active duty. or who hereafter come on voluntary active duty during the 5year period following the enactment of this section. When we sent the bill to the Senate we provided a 2year period. and I think probably it is wise procedure to change this to 5 years. because this is a matter of inducement. and I think this provision will probably induce more men to come in than it would if you just extended it over a 2year period.",

We thought it best to include all those officers. because the Public Health at the present time made practically the same claim that there is a scarcity of doctors and dentists. Title II permits the President. by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. to make original appointments to permanent commissioned grades not above that of colonel in the Medical and Dental Corps of the Army. and captain in the Medical and Dental Corps of the Navy. This. I think. Is a much better procedure. and I proposed putting this provision in when the House had the bill in subcommittee. but we failed to do so. It is a further incentive. because the young man at the present time in normal practice back home in the local community is faced with a situation of going into the Army and the Navy as first lieutenant. You are not going to get very many good young doctors today to go into the Army or Navy medical service. when the average income for the American doctor is $14.800 per year. so there is no incentive based on that. We can take these boys in and give them a captaincy in the Navy. if it is some specialized service we have to have. or we can take them in the Army as colonels if we have to have them. That will be discretionary. of course. with the personnel bureaus of the Army and Navy. After studying this subject. I personally think this is necessary. There was some objection at first in the committee as to proceeding on this basis of setting up one category and giving its members more money than those in other lines of the service. but I see no alternative.",

Other Members have told you of the vital need for the procurement of and the maintaining of the remaining physicians and surgeons the armed forces and the Public Health Service must have in order that we properly protect the health of the men within our armed forces. I cannot impress upon you too strongly the great and grave condition confronting the Surgeon General of the Navy. the Surgeon General of the Army. and the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service. I respectfully call to your attention the alarming and brief summary of the situation which confronts the Navy. the Army. and the Public Health Service. NAVY The actual appropriated strength of the Navy Dental Corps. as of July 1. 1947. is approximately 1.200 officers. while 1.320 are authorized. At present. there are about 500 regulars. The balance of the number needed. approximately 700. consists of Reserve officers who are held involuntarily and who must be released within the next year or two. The deficiency is estimated to become 22 percent by July 1. 1948. with a decline now each day by reason of resignation. but if the Corps is allowed to become demoralized by reason of a disparity in pay. a much larger deficiency percentage will undoubtedly result. The reserves are being lost steadily. All of them will be separated from active duty within the next year or two. ARMY An extremely critical situation exists In regard to the Army Dental Corps. which should likewise have attention now. On the basis of the latest estimate of troop strength. requirements for dental officers will range between 1.800 and 2.200 in 1947 and 1948. At present the Dental Corps is short 350 officers. The number of dental officers on active duty with the Army as of December 31. 1947. will be 1.500. making a shortage of from 500 to 700. Projecting the estimate of losses still further. the number on duty as of September 1948 will be 550. making a shortage of 1.200 to 1.500.",

And from the White House the country hears only continued silence. Actnow. Mr. President. Forthrightly and publicly call for Pauleys resignation. This scamp should be ousted from the inner circle of the Government. The Republican Congress is doing its utmost to expose the wrongdoers in the Truman administration. It Is high time.

We are all in favor of conservation. especially of food. in these. times of Truman inflation. There recently appeared across the Washington horizon a socalled food conserver named Charles Luckman. $300.000ayear head of a Britishowned soap company. When he bowed out of the Truman administration he gave himself and 100 subordinates a sumptuous feast. This is what the Luckman celebraters had as they were telling the American people to eat less so that Europe might have more: The dinner began with cocktails in generous supply. Then came shrimp cocktail. fried oysters. crab. shrimp and lobster gumbo. curried chicken. roast turkey. baked ham. roast beef. string beans au gratin. fried apple rings. pickled walnuts. celery. olives. pickles. mixed green salad. rye rolls. assorted ice creams. assorted finger rolls. coffee. Luckman picked up the check for the Belshazzar feast. The moral is obvious. Think of that kind of a feast by the Government preachers of conservation. when the President asks Congress for power to reestablish a more colossal OPA than we had even in wartime. The Amirican people know how OPA completely failed after the war. They knowthat if OPA comes back as the administration radicals demand. the people will get black markets. old bull meat. and short shirt tails.",

President Truman. the leading accuser of speculators. in a Nationwide radio address said. \"The cost of living in this country must not be a football kicked around by gamblers In grain.\" Mr. Pauley ought to resign and save further embarrassment to the administration and to himself. He is not particularly qualified for the job anyway. People of the country would feel better if he removed himself from this position. I am in accord with the statement by the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. HAaais3. who just left the floor. with respect to speculating in grain. There should be a complete investigation.

I congratulate the Committee on Appropriations. headed by the distinguished gentleman from New York for revealing to the Congress that part of the amount of $597.000.000 requested by the President is to go to some countries to repay their debts to other countries. when these debtor nations are getting along all right. Is not that a terrible thing for Mr. Truman. President of the United States to do? I think that is one of the most outlandish and absurd things that we can be asked to do. We should not do it under any circumstances. Let other countries take care of their own debts. If this country today. in the condition we are in and in the direction that we are headed. toward financial destruction. is going to assume all the obligations of all the other nations of the world when they are getting along all right. then there is something wrong with the Congress. You just have no brains. Let me show you just where we stand in the operation of our Government. As of December 11. last year. we had a credit of $265.000.000. This year we are in the red $316.000.000. That is just over $571.000.000 between last year and this year insofar as trying to have a balanced budget. It just does not make sense that we spend so much and in such manner to pay other countries debts in the guise of relief. If the Congress passes this bill today and adds to that the amount of money that the Committee on Appropriations cut out of the bill. then there is something wrong with the Members of Congress in paying others debts.

I do not find myself in agreement with this measure. but under the conditions existing at the present time in regard to the confirmation of this Commission. I feel it is in the best interest of the country to adopt this measure at this time. When the Commissioners took over this project from the War Department in 1946 under the present Atomic Energy Act the primary objective was from a military standpoint. The Commission has met this obligation in its entirety. The recent tests at Eniwetok have proven that this weapon is more powerful and much cheaper than heretofore produced. The research work which has been carried on under the direction cf the present Commission for the benefit of humanity is too numerous and much more extensive then I can explain to the Members of this body in the few minutes allotted to me. I have had the opportunity of visiting this operation which today is much larger than the United States Steel Corp. of America and feel that since the Commission has taken over this project that they have done an excellent job. By virtue of the imminent relationship between science and technology the problem is one of great importance to the national welfare. The future development of the physical and biological sciences will be. I hope. in the years to come for the benefit of mankind. In the meantime we must face the fact that we live in a world in which not much progress has yet been made toward achieving stable international relationship. This Commission which has been carrying on this project. in my opinion. carries a heavy responsibility to the American people and their appointments should be carried out under the terms of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. American scientists of which this Commission is composed have shown themselves to be conscientious and discreet In the case of the atomic bomb. I most emphatically say that it has been our good fortune thus far to have had such men to carry out the functions of this important operation.

In that colloquy Chairman JENSEN stated \"When we marked up the bill we meant to bring a certain portion of this money which we had approached in phase B for the Montana pumping item and also for the Lower Marias. to bring it out of phase B up into phase A. which is construction.\" The chairman stated then that he had conferred with other members of the committee and \"we now recommend that such part of the amount allowed for these projects as may be necessary shall be available for phase A. or. in other words. construction.\" Since- it is the understanding that the Bureau of Reclamation will follow the breakdown by projects of the amounts approved by the conferees under the Missouri Basin Item. it is suggested that the record should be clarified so as to transfer the item: \"Montana pumping. Montana. $210.000amount approved by conferees\" from phase B to phase A. The first subunit under the Missouri Basin pumping unit will be the NBarN ranch development which will be an important pilot Irrigation undertaking in this area. It Is hoped that the Bureau of Reclamation will press the construction of this subunit which will have an important bearing on guiding future developments in the Missouri River Basin. The conferees on the part of the House are to be congratulated on the excellence of their work in maintaining the major part of the results of their able and earnest efforts to advance reclamation along sound lines.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a member of the subcommittee which has brought in this report. may I say that as far as I am concerned this is not a dispute between two cities nor is it a question of economy.. I certainly am in favor of economy In this Government. I think the Members of the House know I have stood for economy on all occasions. To me. the question involved here is one of policy. and it involves a principle which is of the utmost Importance to this country. The Congress of the United States has approved an aviation program under which we propose to spend $500.000.000 over a period of 7 years. That is a lot of money. but that expenditure has been authorized by the Congress. The question we are facing today is whether we are going to spend that money in an orderly manner or are going to make the expenditure of the funds a political football to be kicked about here in the Congress of the United States. What we have done In the past is to entrust to an administrative agency the determination after a proper and orderly investigation and study of the question as to where we shall locate our airfields. where we shall construct towers. and what facilities we shall provide for those airfields. The question of this particular airport has been considered by the Civil Aeronautics Authority. We face the proposition today of setting aside their findings and substituting our own individual opinions. I ask those Members of the House who are on the floor how many of you feel that you have sufficient facts to enable you to determine whether there should or should not be an airport at Fort Worth? I am a member of this subcommittee which has considered the question and I say to you that I do not know. I am. therefore. following the Civil Aeronautics Authority. the duly constituted agency of the Government that has been charged with the duty of determining this matter.",

We have under General Clay in Germany one of the finest and most elaborate information organizations in the world doing practically the same thing that we are doing in OWL. They operate radio stations. they send out motion pictures. they set up libraries. they send out books and magazines. In fact. they do everything that you do with OIE and I refer to the organization which is composed of our own forces in the occupied areas. I want to assure you that organization is doing good Job in telling the real story about the United States of America. There is another organization coming in here for a great deal of money. now known as ECA. once known as the ERP organization. the Marshall plan program. It has an elaborate program of furnishing information and disseminating information about the Marshall plan and a lot of things in reference to the United States of America. So you see.

I realize it Is almost useless for me or anyone else to secure reductions in a bill after its terms have been agreed upon by a conference committee representing both Houses of Congress. I understand that it becomes necessary to make compromises in order to reach agreements on items that are in dispute. I am disappointed. however. that after the House Committee on Appropriations had given each item careful study. and had in my opinion been most liberal. that the other body should increase these items by the millions and then. in order to reach a settlement. our committee is required to raise the amount in a total of several million dollars. Some of these items are. in my opinion. unwarranted. There are some items. though comparatively small. that are. I think. a waste of money. When this bill was considered several weeks ago I tried to secure the adoption of an amendment to reduce an appropriation of $500.000 for what is described \"Representation allowances.\" It was conceded that most of the fund is spent for liquor to entertain foreigners abroad. Now. I find our committee comes back with an item. not for $500.000. but for $650.000. They say it Is a compromise and that the other body wanted to spend even a larger amount. Do not forget there are other items in this bill also spent for socalled entertainment. But let me remind you that there are thousands of dollars that are allocated for expenses of our diplomats and other representatives so they can entertain foreigners in a big way. Mr. Chairman. I just do not believe we need to spend $650.000 a year for highpowered liquor and the frills that go with it in order to get along with representatives of other countries. Surely our diplomacy has not fallen to such a low ebb as that. I believe $650.000 spent for food for the needy people of those countries would go a whole lot farther in cultivating a friendly feeling and better understanding with people of foreign countries. rather than to spend it for lavish parties for foreign diplomats. Do not. forget -$650.000 would go a long way in buying food for hungry children.",

Many authorities who have studied this bill -claim that once the 15percent lease is entered into that house is then forever decontrolled. In an effort to avoid evasion of the idea of this -15percent lease agreement by phony lease arrangements. thereby decontrolling that property or that apartment forever. this proviso merely spells out that if the lease does not run to its termination or as long as rent control is in effect. that if the lease is voided by mutual agreement of landlord and tenant. the property goes back to its previous ceiling. or. if the landlord and tenant wish to sign up a new lease. then it is at the 15percent provision above the former criginal ceiling. I would like to say that I cannot agree with many of my friends who have severely condemned the lease provision. I think that it is an effort to begin the renegotiations between landlord and tenant. that it will not provide a blanket. 15percent increase across the board. but will only provide for an increase where a tenant wishes to agree with his landlord for a 15percent increase in exchange for security after the end of price control. I think there are benefits that flow both ways. and I do not think you have to regard the landlord and tenant as mortal enemies and that the Government must always stand between them. I think they should be permitted to bargain on a lease arrangement. But I do want to make it crystal clear that if you provide for this 15percent increase that landlords not be permitted to make a lease and then void it to take their house out from under control of all rentals. I would like to see if the majority members of the committee would accept this provision. to clarify the section against such evasion.",

My point is this. that where a property has met the test of landlord and tenant. where two people have in an honorable way gotten together that this property is worth so much ir its present condition.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment attempts to remedy some of the obvious injustices of a legislative and economic maverick. A 10percent blanket increase has inequities. but it does represent a measure of Justice to the people who have their savings in rental property. MAY I There has been some loose talk about intellectual honesty on this bill. In the last 4 years we. as Members of Congress. have raised our pay 50 percent presumably because of increased costs. If there is someone who can explain to me how we can raise our own pay 50 percent. and yet say to the people who have their savings in property in this country. \"You are entitled to no relief because of increased costs.\" I hope they will come around to me after this session and explain it carefully. because I am afraid I will have a hard time understanding that kind of acrobatics. We had a great many witnesses before the committee. Perhaps the most valuable testimony we had was from the American Legion housing committee. An American Legion housing committee went all over America studying this problem. They came before us and favored a 10percent acrosstheboard increase on rents. Thus the American Legion went on record for a 10percent blanket increase. Let me show you the socialistic aspect of this situation- in the minute or so I have remaining. Over in Europe Communists come up to a little fellow who has invested his savings in a cow. They take his cow and may give him some kind of phony money. but they take his cow. They lead it away and his investment is gone. In this country under rent control the Government of the United States is saying by its actions to the small property owner. the frugal person who has put his life savings in a rental house. \"We will not conflscate your property outright. We will but take it away from you over a period of years by fixing rents under which you will lose your investment.\" That moves toward communism by the silkglove route. with -drawingroom finesse. It certainly has no place in a Congress that wants to give a square deal to the frugal people who have placed their savings in rental properties. I hope this amendment. a gesture of fairness to property investors. is passed.",

I do not feel that landlords generally have been doing so badly. They no longer have the vacancy problem for which they normally allow 10 percent of their gross. Again. interest rates have come down substantially in the last dozen years and property can be carried for very much less than formerly. Furthermore. the bill already provides that in the event of inequity the Administrator shall make appropriate adjustments. I feel that it is not a proper function of this Congress to contribute to the inflationary spiral by direct action. I hope the amendment will be defeated.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. what we want to do is to give justice to all groups. We have seen now the placing in this bill of a provision that those who build new houses from now on will not have any ceilings. nor will those who refused to give shelter in 1945 or 1946. nor is there any limit on ceilings to those who are able to increase the accommodation of the present building by erecting a little partition and making one more room. All these people are out from under the ceiling. and the sky is the limit. In addition to that we have all the hotels now out from under ceilings. Furthermore on a lot of apartment houses there will be no ceilings under this provision. those housing accommodations in any establishment which is commonly known as a hotel In the community in which it is located which are occupied by persons who are provided customary hotel service such. as maid service. furnishing linen. and so forth. telephone and desk service. will be exempted. Therefore it will leave a little helpless group for which we have done nothing. This 15percent amendment on which the landlord and tenant are supposed to agree will not be workable. They will never agree and you know it as well as I do. A 10percent acrosstheboard raise means something to that group of people. confined principally to the little fellow. not benefited by the bill. Certainly we want to make some gesture to this class. Practically all the witnesses who testified said that the increase in the cost of living. In taxes. and on building materials for repairs had gone up so much since the freeze date that certainly some raise should be given to these people who have practically nothing except a small home to rent. In view of the fact that almost half of the population will not be under a ceiling. It is nothinm but fair that we should raise the rent for the small fellow to help defray a part of this increased cost since the freeze date. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan should be adopted in order to give justice to a class of people. many of whom are receiving barely enough to repair their homes and pay the taxes imposed on them. .

It was suggested that we increase the rates horizontally 10 percent.

Inunits of 10 or less many have gotten adjustments. the same kind of adjustments which you seek to make here in order to correct an inequity. The thing you have to be careful of is that you do not create just as many hardships by this amendment as you seek to correct and if you do create a hardship by this amendment what machinery is there in the law for the expeditious review of a petition on the part of a tenant for relief of this hardship? None whatsoever. He cannot sue the landlord and he cannot sue the Government.

I talked to every boy in my own particular department. pointing out the great advantage and for him to start now making plans to take advantage of this legislation.

I would like to add to what the gentlewoman has said regarding the importance of this consideration the fact that veterans did not ask for help through the GI bill of rights when they were coming home. The Congress. out of the goodness of Its heart. passed the GI bill of rights. which I think is one of the finest pieces of legislation we have ever had. It will have farreaching effects upon the country even beyond the benefits they are getting now. Many of these boys had gone away without adequate education. They had never before had an opportunity to do the things in school that they might have wanted to do when they returned and found they did have this opportunity. But with the increased cost of living they have found that they have had to spend most of their savings to meet their added living costs. Now. beyond question. they need greater subsistence payments. It is true that the Government did not perhaps plan to finance their entire educational expense. but to pay the basic expense. But it is also true that costs have risen. have more than doubled since the time the GI bill was planned and passed. I believe we have a contract with these men that the Government should fulfill. As I said before. they are using up their savings in financing their living in addition to what they receive as subsistence. If we do not do that we are going to leave them a rather disillusioned group of young people. I discussed this matter rather at length earlier in the week in an extension of remarks in the RECORD. and I would like to have the people Interested in the matter read that extension to get my point of view. because I think that after having talked with a number of these young people that I have expressed rather clearly the things they feel and the things they expect of the Government.

I can fully appreciate that the members of this distinguished committee have a difficult economic and political problem to deal with. and that also goes for all of the other Members of the House as well as the other body. There are provisions in this bill with which I am not too friendly. I understand certain amendments will be offered which I expect to support. I cannot reconcile myself to the theory that we. as a Congress. should not take specific steps to categorically protect those owners of excess living unitsand by that I mean the man or the woman. or both. who have lived simple lives. exercised thrift. accumulated enough money to buy asmall shelter in excess of that which they need themselves. and wherein they have gone along and assumed the risk of ownership with respect to\" taxes. depreciation. insurance costs. decline in market value. and other hazards. the excess ownership in the form of an extra living unit Which someone can occupy as a tenant. and who does not want to take on the risk of ownership himself. There are a lot of these little folks. elderly men and women who invested their savings in excess housing facilities over and above their own needs which they have been renting to these .other people who are tenants. and who did not want to own a home but who are not perhaps willing to live as simply. who did not exercise the same amount of thrift and have no idea of exercising such thrift but who live and absorb under the .umbrella of OPA rent controls and in many instances take property away from the good. thrifty. elderly people along a line which. in my opinion. gets very close to taking property without due process of law. I think the bill should be made very clear in provisions that protect these little people who have no money in the first place. and in the second place. do not know how to acquire the necessary legal talent to see that they get an adjustment under the somewhat vague language that is in this bill.",

We have complained bitterly about the fact that the administrative agency which has exercised control over the rental properties. as well as control over the construction of housing units throughout the country. has been unfair to the nth degree. I have not found anyone to raise his voice in commendation of any of the administrative agencies. successive to one another in this field.

It is estimated there are from 150.000 to 200.000 houses now unoccupied. but this estimate had to come from a person outside the Government who was admittedly making a guess. Much has been said about what we should do for the veterans to get them into these houses. If I analyze this situation correctly. the very controls which have been Impressed and which this bill. if enacted. will continue to impress. will keep the inflationary situation alive. It is forcing rental houses off of the market. forcing them into a market which is a sellers market. and that itself steps up the price. because if you cannot rent shelter you are forced to buy It. and at the sellers price. If you make shelter subject only to purchase. then the price goes up.

I realize that I am in the realestate business. and therefore possibly prejudiced. but at the same time there is such a thing as justice. It is probably difficult for anyone to get all of the figures. but tremendous sums are being paid the farmer. as well as others. for the purpose of maintaining prices and/or subsidizing operations. The landlord. however. has taken a terrific beating and still continues to get no relief. The countrys landlords have not asked for subsidies. although the Government has spent outlandish amounts supplying public housing. which is nothing more than a subsidy to renters. All of the rentcontrol administrators that I have come in contact with have been of such a caliber that they were just filling in with that particular task until they could get something more stable. as most of them had never held a job of any responsibility. We have had one here who could tell your landlord. or landlords agent. bow the poor tenant should be protected. but at the same time he could spend all of his money betting on the horses. Now the tenants are receiving the enclosed questionnaire and letter from the OPA Enforcment Division. It would appear that they are trying to again develop more propaganda end publicity for consumption by the Congress in order to keep their bureau alive. I personally do not own any rental property that would be affected by the continuation of the OFA rental program. I do have charge of approximately 85 rentals. however. and I can say that if the rents were increased or even doubled my personal income in way of fees from handling of these properties would be no different. than it is now. so I am not discussing the mattetr from a selfish angle. I can also state that momentarily I have actually benefited from the rent control program as many properties that the landlords would have kept as rentals have been sold because of the OPA policy. I believe this is true over the entire country. and it still gets back to what has been said so many times. namely: \"The OPA has kept rentals from increasing. but there are no rentals.\" If you are given an opportunity.

Many Members of the House had voted against every measure which would have prepared us for that crisis. Surely we have had our lesson. We realize that we are in a different situation now. that in every war up to this time we have had allies who held the enemy in check until we had time to retool our factories and start production and prepare for the shock of war before it actually reached us. This time there are no buffer states. there is no ally that can delay for a day the onslaught of the enemy. We must be prepared when the attack comes. If not prepared then. we will never be prepared. While I deplore the necessity of increasing the amount which has been reported by the committee. I believe not only that it will be highly advantageous In materially expediting the preparation which Is necessary for us to make but that the psychological effect will be highly advantageous. It will be unmistakable notice to Russia. which understands no other language. that we will be prepared. that we propose to back up every commitment we have made.

In further reference to the remarks of the gentleman from Wisconsin regarding the recommendations of the Postwar Military Policy Committee on UMT. I do not say that had we adopted universal training in 1945 that we would have had an Army of sufficient size today. I think in all probability It might still be necessary to resort to selective service In view of the aggression of the Soviets since then. but. generally speaking. if we had adopted universal training in 1945 and started training in 1946 we would have had at least 1.200.000 or 1.500.000 young men with 6 months training and in the National Guard or Reserve Corps now. This bill of course has been reported by the committee but has not been passed by the House. Continuing with universal training. I want to say this: No one. of course. likes publicopinion polls. such as the Gallup poll. when they do not come out the way they want them to or think they should. but the fact is that the poll of last week showed that universal training had reached the highest percentage of popularity of any time during the last 5 years. I think it was 80 percent. whereas the poll on the question of selective service was as low as 66 percent. Why there is so much aversion to the adoption of universal training which only takes a young man away for 6 months and then returns hm to his home. either to a Reserve unit or his own National Guard. or his favorite college ROTC.

UMT would have made the Guard in 2 yearsit will add enough men to the National Guard so that they will have all that they possibly can use. and they will be under World War II officers if the Government recognizes them in the way they should be recognized. The reason a lot of the young men from this war have not gone into the National Guard units is that some are commanded by men who were not in World War II. The average young fellow who was in this war wants to go with someone who he knows did some fighting fairly recently. So I say this in conclusion: It is a problem not of having just the 70group Air Force. technically speaking. I am not just for that alone. I am for a bigger Army. an increase in the ground forces.

In other words. this was the situation: We passed unification and we expected that there would be a definition of the respective missions of the Air Force and of the Navy in the air. yet we were confronted by the testimony that in spite of the purposes of unification and in spite of the Key West conference. the concept of naval mission in the air remained what the Navy itself said it was before we had unification. that it has not been changed. and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not passed upon the requests for naval air procurement which were before us. And that is the reason why I think that the Congress cannot escape at this time facing the larger question here as to the relative emphasis to be placed upon the Air Force and the Navy in air operations. That is why this- morning I went to the gentleman from New York. and later conferred with other Members on how we might give effect to what I think is the judgment of the country that if we have another war our first line of defense is going to be in the air. and that the country wants the Air Force put in such condition as rapidly as is consistent with the procurement of modern types of aircraft that we willhave the best relative position against any possible foe. So. I worked out some legislative language. which was the language the gentleman from New York asked might be in order as an amendment to this appropriation bill. which would require that the Secretary of Defense report quarterly to the committees of the Congress on Appropriations and Armed Services the amounts obligated under these contract authorizations. and include in that report a statement of finding by the President that the contracts let are necessary in the interest of national. defense and that the contract specifications are such as to insure the maximum utilization of improvements in aircraft and equipment consistent with the defense needs of the United States.",

We must produce at the rate of 64.000.000 airframe pounds per annum by 1950 in order to break even with the present supplies coming in part from production and in large part from storage. If we are to build up to this 64.000.000 airframe pounds per annum by 1950 and 1951 when the storage is exhausted. of course. we must start now. because it takes a year to double production and a year and a half to treble production of the plants that are now in being and operating. It goes clear back. as someone before me has said. through the subcontractors and the subsubcontractors and finally to the finding of rare metals and minerals which are so necessary in the production of aircraft and their instruments and engines. It is a very exceedingly complicated production problem. In order that we may have those airplanes then. we must order now. Another good reason for it is this. that at the present moment the contracts that have been let by the air arms. both the Air Force and the Navy. over the past couple of years. are running out. It has been reliably reported to me that in a considerable number of places men are about to be laid off in the aircraft industry. skilled technicians and engineers. When they are once laid off. the factories will not get them back again. Many of them will drift into other and more stable industries. We must keep these skilled workers on the aircraftproduction job if we are to meet this dead line of 1950. when the storage aircraft give out.

That was followed. of course. by the Finletter Commission appointed by the President which also recommended 70 groups.

Mr. Chairman. this legislation. as has already been said. was enacted unanimously by this House last year after a unanimous report from the Committee on Agriculture. My recollection is that it passed unanimously in the Senate. The legislation itself was the contribution of many different individuals and organizations. The gentleman from Minnesota had introduced a bill previously which was incorporated in this bill. The gentleman from Virginia had introduced a bill. I had introduced a bill. the farm organizations had various suggestions. and all of this legislation was merged into the bill known as the Research and Marketing Act which I believe everyone who has made any study of the matter agrees is a significant contribution to agricultural progress. It is significant and it is important because of the fact that we are now in a new era as far as agriculture is concerned. During the war we increased our production over 30 percent. and we did that in spite of all the handicaps that confronted farmers during that time in the way of shortages of labor and machinery. fertilizer. and transportation. Now that we are getting out of the war period and farmers are again able to secure normal supplies and equipment. it is certainly not to be thought that our production is going to be any less. rather. the tendency is going to be to increase. and we have adopted a policy in this country as far as agriculture is concerned that we want a policy of abundant production. In order to carry out a policy of abundant production we must have research. not only research in productionwe have had that for many years and we have accomplished wonders through that type of researchbut research in utilization and research in. marketing. because it is in utilization and marketing that we are going to find how to consume these surpluses of agricultural commodities that we are going to have as soon as the present abnormal world demand for food is supplied. and that time is probably not very far in the future.",

The series of amendments now on the desk of the gentleman from Missouri propose that $6.000.000 be raised to $9.500.000. I trust the Committee will vote the amendments down. I was very much interested when my friend from Oklahoma indicated that while the committee showed zeal and courage. sometimes it was with mistaken judgment. The best the committee can do is always to be guided by the testimony and make out the best case it can. The story is about this: In the first place. the Department said they expected to run this up to $61.000.000 by 1951. With a program of that size the committee has to exercise the utmost caution. So we took a very good look to make sure that when the program begins the foundation is good and that it is launched in the right direction so that there will be a really efficient effort in the field of research. It ought to be noted at the outset that this does not displace research in the Department. This Is in addition to all other research. There is $59.000.000 worth *of research in this Department and we have not disturbed it. We have not cut. for instance. research by the commodity branches in Production and Marketing Administration.

I said. \"What did you do with the other nine?\" He said. \"We kept them.\" But getting scientific talent is a hard chore. Where are they going to find them? We went into this thing completely. because every member of the committee is interested in research. so we canvassed the situation. This is the most that in our judgment they can expend. The committee shares the view of the gentleman from Kansas. I conferred with him on many occasions and the committee conferred with him because we wanted to be sure that the action we were taking would in no way cripple the research activity. Insofar as the testimony indicatesand we labored this item probably more than any other item in the billin our humble judgment. after reviewing the whole business. this Is as large an amount as they can efficiently expend.

It has been on the statute books from then until now. It was a part of the original Agricultural -Adjustment. Act. It is a farm section and was intended to help the farmers. I hope the amendment submitted: by the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina will not~be approved. for the simple reason that in my judgment it will In effect repeal section 22. The gentlemans amendment provides that no action. no proclamation can be issued under that sebtion without the prior appro/al of the Secretary of State or the Department of State. \ufffd Inasmuch as Mr. Clayton. the Under Secretary of State. is in charge of the foreign economic affairs of our Government. that means. and can only mein. that it would place Mr. Clayton to a considerable extent in charge of the farm program of this Nation. The farm program should be in charge of the Secretary of Agriculture. but when you enact an amendment saying no action can be taken upon section 22 relating to farm programs without the prior approval of Mr. Clayton. in effect we have placed the farm programs in this country. to an extent at least. in charge of Mr. Clayton. If that is not true I do not know the purpose of his amendment. As I read to you yesterday. and.I shall read again. the. following line which is a part of section 22. It is subsection (d) of section 22: Any decision of the President as to facts under this section shall be final. Therefore unless it is an effort to put the UnderSecretary of State in charge of the farm program I can see no reason for the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina. because as the law Is today before any import fee may be put on any agricultural commodity. it must in the first instance have. the approval of the President of the United States and I assume that there is sufficient collaboration between the President of the United States and his Under Secretary of State to have a uniform program as to international negotiations.

Mr. Chairman. at the risk of repeating. and because of the limitation of time. the chairman of the committee had no opportunity to respond to the statement I made a few minutes ago. I should like to say at this time that it strikes me that inserting in the bill the language \"Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. as amended. and the Stabilization Act of 1942. as amended.\" would strengthen the bill. I want to be perfectly fair and candid. I stated to the chairman during the course of the general debate that I thought the language of the bill H. R. 1825 he introduced at the request of the Secretary embraced other programs. and I suggested that the language amending section 22 (a) and (b) might be included here in connection with the Wool Act of 1947 in his substitute. The gentleman stated that he did not want to open up this bill to other programs because wool was entitled to relief. and I agreed. because he said that matter in H. R. 1825 was going to be considered by the committee later on. But I now make this statement to the gentleman: In view of the threat that section 32 funds may not be made available for the fiscal year 1948. I have made inquiry and I am advised by competent legal authority. happening to be a lawyer myself. and this is my view. that while export subsidies and export quotas are authorized by other acts. in fact they cannot be invoked until first of all there is a program. I am further advised that if section 32 funds are not available no program can be invoked or inaugurated by the Secretary of Agriculture and. therefore. there would be no export quota or export subsidies for cotton. corn. or wheat. and similar commodities. I make the statement now that favoring as I do relief for wool inasmuch as there is put forward in this bill the substitute that you have proposed. the Wool Act of 1947. that that language gives wool a preferred status for 2 years. and even if section 32 funds are not available wool will still be entitled to a program whereas cotton. corn. and wheat will not have a program unless section 32 funds are available.",

I am in agreement with the views the gentleman has expressed as to the necessity for reconsidering the question of including some amendments such as the gentleman has suggested in section 22 legislation. I feel that the need for that consideration is imperative. and I can assure the gentleman that I will bring the matter to the attention of the Committe- on Agriculture at a very early date.

I am very zealous. as I have said time and again. of the civil liberties of our people. but I believe this agency has had written around it. proper protections against the invasion of the police and the subpena powers of a domestic poliee force. I want to impress upon the minds of the Members that the work of this Central Intelligence Agency. as far as the collection of evidence is concerned. is strictly in the field of secret foreign intelligencewhat is known as clandestine Intelligence. They have no right in the domestic field to collect information of a clandestine military nature. They can evaluate it. yes.",

From my own military experience I consider this legislation essential to the coordination of our military establishment. and to the performance of our national responsibilities in foreign affairs. During World War II. I was for some years as an Army officer on duty as the secretary of the joint United States Army. Navy. and Air Forces committee to coordinate our chemical warfare effort with that of our allies. I worked in an area exactly in line with that sought to be covered by this bill. The coordination contemplated by this bill was attempted during the war. it worked well enough to win. but I felt on many occasions the need for a statutory basis for the boards and staffs engaged. This bill will give background and substance to the joint and combined efforts which were responsible for our winning the war. One further point needs to be emphasized. The tempo of a future war will be so highly accelerated that we must be completely ready with the right organization from the start. The peacetime creation. functioning. and experience of a War Council. a Joint Chiefs of Staff to deal with strategic plans. a Munitions Board to coordinate production and procurement. a National Security Resource Board to plan for industrial and civilian mobilization. and a Research and Development Board to provide integrated programs for research and development for military purposes gives us realistic implementation of a policy of national security and for the discharge of our international responsibilities.",

When he gets through as Director of Intelligence. or if he does not like the work. or does not do too good a job and is let out. well. never mind. he can always go back to active military service. To do that. he has to keep his bridges intact. his military fences in good repair. That is. his mind may not be single because his interests are divided. We do not want that. Under the amendment he will still have his retirement rights. his family will be protected. and yet he is retired and completely separated from the military service. free from any possible influence so that he does not need to consider what might happen if the time should come that he wanted or needed to go back into the military service.",

They are afraid. in this particular instance. over the possibility that there might be some sort of Gestapo set up in this country. I will agree and I will admit to you very frankly that it is entirely possible that you might have a military officer who would like to do that. but I know one thing. that if you require a civilian to be the head of this agency then you will not have any danger within the agency of military influence or military dictatorship. I do not believe the present occupant of that office would ever abuse it. I have the highest confidence in him. but I do not know who may succeed him. We have had three different military officers in charge of this central intelligence group or agency in the last 15 months. and we might have more. I say to you that we need a civilian of the type of J. Edgar Hoover in charge of an agency like this. and the appointment of a civilian would at least be a partial guaranty to the people of the United States that this agency is not going to be usurped by any branch of the armed services at any time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. to reassure the committee let me say that this is the only other amendment I shall offer. and I present it now because it also has to do with the Central Intelligence Agency. If the members of the committee will look on page 11 of the bill. line 16. subsection (e). and follow along with me. I think we can make it clear quickly. The subsection reads in part: (e) To the extent recommended by the National Security Council and approved by the President. such intelligence operations of the departments and other agencies of the Government as relate to the national security shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central Intelligence. The first half of the amendment deals with that. It strikes out the words in line 18. \"and other agencies.\" Why? Primarily to protect the FBI. I agree that all intelligence relating to the national security which the FBI. the Atomic Energy Commission. and other agencies with secret intelligence activities develop should be made available to the Director of Central Intelligence for correlation. evaluation. and dissemination. The second half of my amendment provides that their intelligence must be made available to the Director of Central Intelligence. But under the amendment he would not have the i.. ht to go down into and inspect the intelligence operations of agerlcies like the FBI as he would of the departments. I do not believe we ought to give this Director of Central Intelligence power to reach into the operations of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. which are in the domestic field. Under the Iangauge as it now stands he can do that. The Director of Central Intelligence is supposed to deal with all possible threats to the country from abroad. through intelligence activities abroad. But without this amendment he will have not only the results of the FBIs intelligence activities here at home. but also the power to inspect its operations. I do not believe that if we had realized the full import of this language when we were studying it in committee we would have allowed it to stand as it is. Surely we want to protect the Atomic Energy Commission and the FBI from the Director of Central Intelligence coming in and finding out who their agents are. what and where their nets are. how they operate. and thus destroy their effectiveness.",

That is. open air theaters goIng up. other theaters going up. bowling alleys going up. beer gardens being built. Yet we were constantly receiving complaints that others could not build bowling alleys. others could not build dance halls. others could not build any other recreational or amusement facilities. We found the answer when Mr. Tighe Woods. the Housing Expediter. was before us. He said that it is almost impossible to administer it. that they did not have the force to administer the law. The only complaints they got were from competitors. So it became one of those inconsequential. irritating controls that has outlived its usefulness. and in this legislation we have put it behind us. We decontrolled. in addition to the decontrols in the present law. trailers and trailer spaces. I do not think there will be too much objection to that. It has already been done by regulation. I never knew that trailer space had been under control. I did not think that trailer space was a housing accommodation under the provisions of the act. but we found in our deliberations that trailer space. not the trailers. was a housing accommodation. You try to keep the rain off in a trailer space and see what happens to you. It cannot be done unless you have a trailer to put in there.

We had a right to assume the Governors of the States would interpret the language as it was intended to be interpreted. that on these boards there would be individuals representative of the various interests affected. That is what we meant. and It was very obvious that we could not have said otherwise. because what is a representative citizen otherwise is just a matter of opinion. Whether he perhaps has a particular social position. whether he belongs to a rotary club or a lions club or an elks club or a board of commerce should not guide the Governor in the appointment of a representative board. So to clarify that and make it much easier for the Governors to carry out the intent of the Congress as we thought we expressed It last year. we amended that language so that now the Governors make recommendations from which the Expediter names a board of not less than five members of citizens \"representative of the interests affected\" in the areas.

I want also to congratulate the committee on bringing In such a full report in connection with the operations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was only a short while ago. when hearings were held before the committee. that many innuendos were being uttered and indictments made by various witnesses against members of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. That was especially true with respect to a loan which was made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. I recall that almost every day the newspapers have carried headlines regarding the lack of good faith on the part of certain officials. of the Reconstructibn Finance Corporation. They were charged with collfision. impropriety. fraud upon the court. and a number of other adts detrimental to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and its board members. I think it was well worth while for the committee to delve deeply into those questions and to submit a report such as that which has been given to the Senate and to the country in connection with the charges which were constantly being made. The committee agrees with the threeman court with respect to the charges of collusion. impropriety. fraud upon the court. bad faith. and so forth. which were made by certain individuals against the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Its members. In other words. the Reconstruction Finance Corporation comes out clean as the result of the investigation which was made by the committee regarding this one very important question. I desire to pay tribute to Mr. Goodloe. Jesse Jones. and the other members of the Corporation who did such a magnificent job In handling the funds of the taxpayers in a great emergency before the war. during the war. and since the war. They deserve credit instead of condemnation. That is what the committee found In making Its report. and I congratulate the committee.",

Your inquiry can be answered. categorically. in the negative. The RFC does not make loans for such purpose. and this has been Its longestablished policy. However. under certain conditiobs. the RFC has made and does make loans where a portion of the proceeds may be used to repay previously existing loans. but only where the retirement of such existing loans is incidental to the consolidation of the borrowers Indebtedness and collateral security. or is considered a proper step in strengthening the borrowers position. In no case is the making of a loan by RFC based. in any measure. upon a consideration of taking a bank or other lending institution out of a bad loan. There have been some cases In which. where special circumstances warranted such action. RFC has taken a bank out of a loan which at the time was considered a sound loan. and it is possible that other similar cases may be presented where the public interest might be best served by a departure from our general policy. With best wishes. Sincerely yours. JOHN D. GOODLOE. Chairman.",

From my point of view. there ought to be in the law a positive provision forbidding the RFC to bail out banks. I do not think anything else is sufficient. in the public interest. I do not think the letter which the Senator has read is sufficient as an indication of the policy of the Board. As I read the letter. it simply means that the Board will not bail out banks unless it thinks it desirable to do so.

To hold that a branch of the Government. manned by personnel chosen directly by the people. answerable directly to the people. and removable directly by the people. may not be entrusted with enough power to properly discharge its constitutional responsibility is an indictment of the scheme of representative government.

    "speech": "The Senator may recall that about 20 years ago 23 States of the Union supported the construction of the St. Lawrence seaway. As I recall. most of them appropriated funds to further the construction of the seaway. Speaking of the Ohio Valley. among those 23 States was the State of Ohio. which obviously would benefit greatly from the project. so far as the northern half of the State is concerned. The Senators own State of Kentucky and the State of West Virginia also joined the group of States which were attempting to secure approval of the development of the St. Lawrence River. I think the reason is very obvious. It would facilitate the movement of millions of tons of coal from northern Ohio shipping points to Canada and other parts of the world. But it is quite noticeable that when it was proposed to develop the St. Lawrence River and to construct a dam to produce power at low cost for the benefit of all the people. certain interests in these States were able to swing support away from the St. Lawrence project. In other words. so long as the private power companies could control the development. the coal interests favored the St. Lawrence seaway. but evidently from the way in which they are nbw acting. the coal companies think they would be injured if the St. Lawrence River were developed for the benefit of all the people. I simply call that historical fact to the attention of the Senator from Kentucky and of the Senate. namely. that at one time the coalproducing States backed the St. Lawrence seaway. Its construction certainly would result in the shipment and use of more coal. But when the special interests found that private power companies could not grab all the power benefit. they seemed to withdraw their support.",

Sometimes things happen. and support Is not continued for various reasons. This project has been discussed for a long time. and it would not be strange if a State had started out to assist other States in bringing about a situation in which the project might be constructed and. finally. merely through inactivity or immediate lack of interest. withdrew Its financial assistance. I can say. I am sure. that it was not any power influence or any power rossibility that induced the State of Kentucky to withhold its appropriation. There is no State in the Unio:2 which has been more enthusiastic and more unanimous in its support of the improvement in the Tennessee Valley than has the State of Kentucky. Outside of the State of Tennessee. and probably one or two other States. I do not know of any State that would benefit more by that great development than would the State of Kentucky.",

The reason for that is that the people of New York and New England today pay approximately $400.000.000 a year more for electric energy than they would have to pay at TVA rates. That is the real reason for the opposition. in my opinion. Various fronts are put forward. Recently some of the electric power companies have come out into the open. but in general they have kept in the background. using the railroad and other interests as a front. They have interlocking directorates. But the real reason is that there is a $400.000.000 overcharge for power that the Northeastern States have to pay every year.",

I have no fear that the construction of this seaway will flood the United States with coal from abroad. Today the whole continent of Europe is straining every nerve to get coal for its own demandsto increase the facilities of its own mines. to modernize and mechanize them. in order that they may meet the demands of the people of Europe. As the Senator has said. we have been shipping coal across the Atlantic to Europe during this emergency. It has been costing the people of France and the people of Italy $24 a ton for soft coal. shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. to keep those people from freezing and to enable them to begin to start some of their industries for which they do not have sufficient coal nearby. Of course. it is hoped that the coal industry of Europe. and especially of the Ruhr. may be developed and expanded so that it may meet the demands for coal in Europe. because there is no particular economic value to us in undertaking to ship coal all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. if they can produce coal closer at home cheaper. not only in order that they may furnish coal for their own domesticconsumption purposes. but also so that they may get their industries back on their feet and proceeding under their own steam.",

The story that he has repeated here through telegrams and letters can be repeated in many sections of the United States at this time. showing the results flowing from a lack of power. I have received telegrams from communities within my State and from communities within Indiana. complaining that because the Federal Power Commission had seen fit or had been compelled to shut off a supply of natural gas due to a shortage in the country. not only many industries and schools were compelled to go without fuel for heat. but many homes were likewise deprived of fuel for heat. because of a shortage of natural gas. We must look forward. it seems to me. to the day when there may be a shortage of all sorts of heating fuels and industrial fuels. and the only substitute for them I know anything about is power. It will never be developed for the benefit of all the people of the United States by little piecemeal developments here and there. by the building of a little dam over a creek or a very small river. for some particularly local purpose. It mustbe done on a broad scale. It might as well be said that every community ought to protect itself against floods. That was tried long ago. It failed. and finally Congress declared by legislative enactment. with all the solemnity that goes with such action. that flood control is a national obligation. Necessary appropriations are now made year by year to protect cities and towns and communities and farm lands from the devastating floods of great rivers. because it cannot be done by private enterprise. That is utterly impossible. It must be done by the only agency the American people have for such a development. That is the Government of the United States.",

We have heard on many occasions that the FBI has nothing to do with State law enforcement or the enforcement of criminal law so far as the State is concerned. We all know that the great branch of the criminal law of America comes under State jurisdiction. Very little of it comes under Federal jurisdiction. So first. what authority has the FBI to keep files unless they are ordered by the Executive himself to make an investigation? Then I can see a reason for an investigation and a file. But are we talking here about a clipping bureau? Is that what the President of the United States asks the FBI to be. so they may look through the newspaper clippings they have on important people?",

Some had been imprisoned as long back as 1933. That was one of the first things I learned upon visiting concentration camps in Germany. Mr. President. I do not know how broad the definition \"displaced persons\" is. but certainly one who was imprisoned in a political prison camp in Germany. even though he was of German ethnic origin. and who was opposed to Hitlerism. and for that reason was imprisoned. should be classified as a displaced person and be permitted to come into this country under some quota.

The tragic part of it. so far as America is concerned. is that they are displaced as a result of an agreement entered into by our Government. They were driven from their homes in Poland. in Yugoslavia. and in what was formerly Czechoslovakia. and sent into Germany. They had been in those countries for generations. The strong antiGerman feeling that swept those lands after the fall of Hitler caused persons there who were not of German ethnic origin to drive them out of those countries into Germany. In the Potsdam agreement. which was referred to by the Senator from North Dakota. the United States agreed to the removal of those people. To say that they are not displaced is simply to blind ones self to fact- They were driven out of their countries. they were forced out. I saw some of them in the Army camps. They cannot come into IRO camps. I saw one camp operated by the Army in Vienna. In that camp there were farmers who had been uprooted from the soil after living in what had been their native land. the land of their forefathers. for generations.

I understood that the military were in charge up to January 1. when the Commission took over. I understand that the Commission is functioning. I undertand that research is being carried on. We have heard the suggestion repeatedly from scientists that they were going on a sitdown strike if we did not arrive at a solution acceptable to them. That Is one of the most amazing suggestions I have ever heardthat unless we adopt a formula of which they approve they will walk out on us. That is pretty near to deserting in the face of the enemy. Within the past week I have read in the newspapers that the Atomic Energy Commission. now functioning under recess appointment. had .decided to shift the emphasis in research from military uses of atomic energy to civilian uses. The clear inference from that statement is that military research had been going on. and that now a shift in emphasis to the civilian aspect is to be made. It comes at rather an extraordinary time. when we are saying to Russia. \"Thus far and no further.\" I cannot conceive of any time in the past 19 months when a shift from military to civilian uses would have been more inappropriate than it is at this particular time. It is notice to Russia that we have gone as far as we wish in the military direction. and that we are now placing emphasis on the civilian aspect. I do not know how many thousands are employed by the Atomic Energy Commission. but I presume they are earning their money and doing their job. If they are not. certainly the Atomic Energy Commission is rather seriously derelict in its duty.",

Many of the projects badly disintegrated during this period. Other projects are still held together by the hope that a responsible management will soon be established. The Lilienthal Commission took over the operations on the first day of January. having previously made a study of the problems of operating these projects. If the Chairman of this Commission should be refused confirmation now. another 6 months will pass before orderly operation of atomic energy research will get under way. During this time. these projects may collapse. and the work on atomic energy in this country will be wrecked at a time when other nations are making rapid progress in this field. The scientists hope that Congress may keep party politics out of the vital issue of atomic energy. In conclusion. let me say this: The Senator may wish to voice his opinion. and I have respect for it. and I know his colleagues have. too. the Senator and others brought about an appropriation to make the atomic bomb. but neither he. nor any other Member of this body. contributed one iota of ideas or intelligence that went into nuclear science.",

It does not need to take a back seat when compared to any. other organization. Its graduates. I think. have been a credit to us throughout the world. However. there is nothing sacred about the Naval Academy. I have always believed there should be other ways of getting into the commissioned ranks than having to go through the Naval Academy and without having to get an appointment from a Senator or a Congressman. I believe the Navy would be better off if it took in. with reasonable .safeguards. a reasonable number of graduates of colleges in the United States. I think that the proposed system. the system we are trying to build up. by which a certain number of ROTC graduates from accredited colleges are to be given commissions in the Navy. and then in a few years to go to a postgraduate school togdther with the regular graduates of the Naval Academy. will be for the best interests of the Nation.

Unlike the House bill. it does not authorize private employers to obtain injunctions. and it leaves the difficult and delicate problem of industrywide bargaining for further study. Furthermore. it safeguards but does not prohibit employer contributions to union welfare funds. It is my hope that the House conferees will see fit to accept the substance of the Senate bill. In my opinion. such a bill has a far better chance of becoming law. In the interests both of the workers and the general public it is important that some legislation on this vital problem should become law during this session.",

It may be too mild. It may be altogether too mild to have very much effect. because if the banks own $65.000.000.000 of Governments. and they could sell $10.000.000.000 to meet the requirement. they still have a huge potential for credit expansion. * * * 1 am not saying that they would do that.

The impact of the rising cost of living. in terms of hardship. is necessarily associated with the distribution of family income. According to the most recent comprehensive studies covering 1947 (see chart 5). about 50 percent of all families had incomes below the $3.200 a year estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be necessary to maintain an urban family of four at a reasonably satisfactory standard of living. Between a quarter and a third of all families had incomes of less than $2.000 a year. and more than 10 percent had incomes of less than $1.000 a year. Even allowing for the fact that many of the families included in these statistics were of smaller size than four. and that many of them were rural families where the cost of living is somewhat less. it is nonetheless a palpable fact that a large proportion of our population is being literally submerged by the high cost of living. It may be said. of course. that \"the poor are always with us\". that millions of families were submerged even before the war and before inflation. and that. relatively speakIng. lowincome families are better off now than they were during prewar periods. If we take the whole span of years since 1939 into account. these assertions are undoubtedly true. because our total national output has gone up so much since 1939 that practically everyone has benefited to a degree. But this would not be true since 1946. when postwar inflation got started in earnest. since then. families of low income and moderately low income have undoubtedly lost ground in the race with living costs. And 1946 is a fairer base of comparison than 1939 for this purpose. because our national output now is quite similar to 1946 but far and away above 1939.",

Moreover. as a study of developments In 1946 and 1947 indicates (chart 6). while a majority of the families in the middleincome and upperincome brackets have received increases in incomes as the cost of living has advanced. a majority of those in the lowestincome brackets have either received no increases in income or have actually suffered decreases in income. Among families with incomes under $2.000. a full quarter suffered actual decreases of Income during this period. and an additional 40 percent of these families received no increases in income. Thus. the families who have been the worst victims of the advancing cost of living because their incomes are low are also the families who have been least able even to hold their ground during the process of inflation. The sheer physical problem of being unable to maintain a satisfactory standard of living has been compounded by the psychological problem of going deeper into debt. In 1947 (see chart 7) about 67 percent of the families with incomes below $1.000 and about 41 percent of the families with Incomes between $1.000 and $2.000 either spent more than they earned or barely broke even. By early 1948 (see chart 8). about 27 percent of all spending units had no liquid assets. while another 15 percent had liquid assets of less than $200. and still another 13 percent had liquid assets between $200 and $500. Cumulative. about 55 percent of all spending units had liquid assets of less than $500. These hard facts illustrate one of the clearest and most undebatable evils of spiraling inflation. There can be no disputing the truth that inflation is imposing an intolerable and everincreasing burden upon millions of families. While It is hard to draw the line between matters of social and economic significance. it Is obvious that a social maladjustment so extensive in its range must have great economic significance in a nation of people who believe rightly that the ultimate objective of their economic system Is to promote the welfare and security of its citizens as a whole.",

I would say that I have tried to approach this subject objectively. and as I said near the beginning of my statement. it doesnt always follow that wages and profits should increase at the same rate. There are periods when profits should increase faster than wages. because the profit structure is more volatile. When the economy is going downhill. when it is running into a period of largescale unemployment. profits sometimes fall below the zero point. and manifestly we couldnt allow wages to fall below the zero point. And likewise. profits have to increase faster than wages at times to make up for the times when they have decreased faster. At other times. wages should increase faster than profits. I think the second formula is closer to the correct formula for a well balanced. healthy maximum employment and maximum production economy. What has been happening at the present time is partly illustrated by this chart (20) showing the relative movements in prices and wages from June 1946 to June 1948. The line moving upward is the price line. The line moving sideward is the wage line. The dates on the lines indicate the points at which particular spurts occurred. and they are important for the purpose of showing you how you have had a sequence of a price jump and a wage jump and a price jump and a wage jump.

It may have some merit. but it still would leave you with the real problem. Senator TOBEY. which is the fundamental problem of the distribution of the product. because you cannot simply say that the wage at all periods should change simply comparable to the cost of living. If it did that. you would have a constant standard of living. although production might be increasing. If you arein a period when production is increasing. you should have an increase in the real wage. This is a generally accepted proposition. The real question is how much of an increase. The real question is how much of that increased production should take the form of further capital expansion financed or stimulated in part by profits. and how much should go immediately to increased consumption. This is the problem at Its core. As an economist. I would say that in one form or another we are always going to have this problem with us in the free society we want to maintain. But we can. I believe. reduce this problem by developing some economic judgments to promote a better balance in the economy than is generated by the unrestrained pricewage spiral during inflation.

I am just wondering if you and your group of analysts have analyzed that situation.

I believe. I also saw somewhere that the profit they were already making after taxes was something over $12 a ton. As I said. I dont vouch for the accuracy of those figures. I wonder if you have analyzed that situation so as to be able to say whether or not there was any justification of this in such a price increase. on steel. following that wage increase. and particularly in view of the already existing high corporate earnings?",

I am prepared to say. however. directly in answer to your question. that it has seemed that the price advances which have taken place in certain key industries. steel being one. have been more than were justified or necessary in view of the whole economic situation. In other words. in such cases the level of profits after taxes has afforded a higher rate of return than has been necessary amply to stimulate and support the level of investment and production required to keep a fully employed labor force and plant at work and to use the resources that should at this time or shortly be turned to production purposes. This conclusion is generally implicit in my analysis of the production picture. and it was developed a little more specifically in the charts and figures which I have submitted on the profit picture in general.

Every Member of this House is in accord on the absolute necessity for these towers. Just recently we have seen the lives of eight prominent officials of one air line and the operator of a private plane taken because there was no control tower operated at a particular airport.

The defeat of this amendment means the curtailment of air navigation facilities in this Nation and at a time when we can ill afford to do so. I am in receipt of a letter from the State director of aeronautics of the State of Alabama in which he states that the Department of Aeronautics is particularly concerned over the reductions proposed for the establishment of new air navigational facilities and for the maintenance and operation of existing air navigation facilities. also the elimination of all funds for the operation of airport control towers. except the one at Washington National. I am greatly concerned over the elimination of funds for the operation of airport control towers as it means the elimination of the tower in Montgomery. Ala. I am in receipt of a telegram from Col. W. A. Gayle. city commissioner of Montgomery. In which he urges the continuation of the control tower at Dannelly Field. the municipal airport. Montgomery is not in financial condition to support this tower. The city owned one of the finest fields in the country. namely Gunter Field. which was turned over to the Federal Government at the outbreak of the war. This field has never been returned and it become necessary for the city to go out at great expense and purchase other property. it is not a question of the city not wanting to assume the responsibility of the control tower. but it is a question of this city and many others not being able to do so. It is a matter of public safety. The cost is small in comparison to the benefits obtained. We just cannot fail to continue to make air travel safe by continuing appropriations not only for control towers but for the improvement of landing systems. I trust that nothing will be done in this bill to affect air safety of the aeronautical communications stations. We have one of these in my district at Evergreep. Ala.

The cities. at this )ate date. would have no opportunity to either levy taxes or assessments against the air lines for the purpose of continuing the program. Because the Government established the program and because it is necessary to the safety of the traveling public and because of the inability of the municipalities to cope with the situation in so short a time. I must oppose this item of the bill and vote for the amendment restoring the appropriation providing for the cost of these aircontrol towers.",

No one can deny the fact that we simply must reduce Federal expenditures when and if possible. In the present instance. however. it seems to me that the elimination of necessary funds to provide for control towers would certainly be false economy. We recall some months ago when we had more than the normal number of air tragedies a great hue and cry went up throughout the entire country demanding a reduction in air tragedies and contending for greater degrees of safety. These days many of us are accustomed to and. in fact. are compelled to use air transportation in order to meet our many important engagements. We not only travel by air ourselves but our constituents. friends. and families are fast becoming accustomed to and demanding the right to travel by air. As an example of the advantages of air travel. some months ago I was in St. Louis. Mo.. and needed to return to Washington by the most direct and quickest route. when I learned that the fastest train scheduled from that city to the Capital required 22 hours. whereas by air only 4 hours were needed. This is an airminded age. Thousands of our fine young men by reason of their military experience are eager to continue their air careers. Airplanes have come to be essential in this modern age for convenience. commerce. and national security.. Maintenance of airtraffic control towers increases safety in too many ways to enumerate here. The argument to discontinue this vital service is no more logical than for a person to discontinue the carrying of insurance. either personal or property. We have become accustomedfto paying insurance premiums and are glad that we seldom suffer losses. If. as. and when the Federal funds are discontinued and the matter of safety controls at. airports reverts to municipalities. counties. and States. all semblance of uniformity will be lost. The pilots will not have time to familiakize themselves withthe various types and forms of safety devices. if any. In my judgment. we simply cannot justify the striking. of necessary funds from this bill which would carry on essential aircontrol towers. I strongly urge the adoption of the pending amendment.",

Some of our cities and larger communities cannot afford this additional expense which would impair the service rendered by these towers. I favor the restoration of the amount needed to operate these control towers in this appropriation bill. It is one service our Government can render to the air bases of America. We have held many long hearings on air safety. and our Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce is fully aware of the need for every safety device we can obtain to make air travel safer.

The jagged peaks and the deep canyon valleys of the Rocky Mountains make it absolutely mandatory that control towers be used. It seems to me that the proper control of air traffic is a Federal function. since from the time the plane leaves the ground until it reaches its destination it is almost entirely interstate traffic. In my opinion. this action would leave the responsibility of such operations to the respective communities. which cannot operate as efficiently. effectively. and economically as the coordinated activities of the CAA. The Salt Lake Airport in my district is vitally located. and a place where a great number of Army as well as civilian airplanes use its facilities.

Mr. Chairman. the Seventyninth Congress went on record as being in favor of the development of the airports of this country. and we passed a bill providing the sum of $500.000.000 to be spent over a certain term of years. What good is it for this Government to go just halfway in providing a system of airports unless we provide for the operation in a safe way of those airports? This would provide something that we cannot continue unless we have aircontrol towers. It is very much like the Congress did in providing the terminalleave bonds for the veterans. The bonds in the hands. of the veterans are not worth a cent to them for use now. Those bonds cannot be cashed nor be negotiated for a period of 5 years. They have to just sit and wait and hope for a period of 5 years before they can get payment on the bonds. Now this is the same thing we are doing here.

    "speech": "Here is the figure I wish to call the Senates attention. On page 12 of the committee report the following appears: This year the Childrens Fund had an appropriation under Public Law 84 of $40.000.000 to be matched with funds of other nations In the feeding of children. Under its original matching formulas the fund was able to distribute only $15.000.000 of the amount awarded by the United States. That means that only $15.000.000 was actually employed. because the other countries could match only $15.000.000. So we put up only $15.000.000. I continue to read from the report: A revision of the matching formula in the passage of the ECA authorization bill enabled the fund to distribute in the past few months an additional $12.652.364. That makes a total of not quite $28.000.000 we have actually disbursed. I read further: However. an unobligated balance of $12.347.636 remained in the fund as of May 1. 1948. In addition to funds directly appropriated by the Congress. the Childrens Fund has been the recipient of several million dollars arising out of the liquidation of UNRRA. Money from this source continues to be received even at this late date. What I wanted to suggest was. would the Senator say I was correct if I supposed that. let us say. $75.000.000 would be the outside limit of all the United States has thus far contributed to this International Childrens Emergency Fund? Would I be in error if I should say $75.000.000 was the outside limit?",

Mr. President. the able Senator has referred to the fact that some of these children are behind the iron curtain.

Take. for instance. the country of Poland. a country behind the ironcurtain. or take Czechoslovakia. which is now behind the iron curtain. We can take nearly every one of the countries behind the socalled iron curtain and find that from 85 to 90 percent of the people are opposed to communism.

We cannot reach them. I was in Russianoccupied territory. I went to the city of Wiener Neustadt. 50 miles inside the Russianoccupied territory. and I saw the conditions which prevailed there.

Therefore it does not constitute an omission of any significance. but certainly in the report of the minority member there appeared. many questions which had been raised. Here I address myself not to Whether or not any reflections were proved but whether or not he had been primarily occupied with work of what we could properly term of a semiprofessional character. Work before a legislative group was. I think. admitted and agreed. and work in connection with the activities of a municipal government. which in no way necessarily reflected upon the man or his character. but it bore upon the question of whether or not he has been devoting himself to the practice of the law in such a fashion as to commend himself to our consideration. . I now come to what seems to me to be the very pertinent situation in connection with the earlier case to which I refer and I should like to have the clerk read the remarks of the Senator from Maryland at that time dealing with that matter.",

Opposing one who is nominated for high office such as membership on the Supreme Court of the United States is not a pleasant task. No man can find pleasure in standing on the floor of the Senate and opposing the confirmation of one nominated to sit on the Supreme Court. I am getting no pleasure out of it. I am approaching the matter merely from a sense of duty. of public obligation. believing it is my duty. with the knowledge of the facts I have. to call to the attention of the Senate of the United States the question of the fitness of Mr. Jackson for this high office. There is one thing which we can carry with us all through this investigation. there is one thing which stands out in the whole controversy like a lighthouse. and that is that we are agreed on the facts. There is no disputing the facts in the case. The facts I am about to relate are admitted by Mr. Jackson. Therefore. there is not presented by me for the consideration of the Senate a set of facts which are disputed by Mr. Jackson. He has admitted. both in writing and in testimony before the Committee on the Judiciary. that the things I shall relate are the true facts.",

I do not know whether that is true. I let the mattes drift along until I learned that one of the persons engaged in this broadcast. Robert Allen. had written a letter to Colonel Harrington. The occasion for the letter to Colonel Harrington by Mr. Allen was upon the following circumstance: When I called the attention of those in control of the broadcasting to the fact that the report was. of course. a lie. they immediately got in touch with Colonel Harrington. the head of the WPA. and Colonel Harrington wrote to the ones in charge of the broadcasting that this charge had been frequently made by Pearson before. that it.had been thoroughly Investigated by the WPA. and that never had a cent of Government money been spent on the property of Senator TYDINaS.
