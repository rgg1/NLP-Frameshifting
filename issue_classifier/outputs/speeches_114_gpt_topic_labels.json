The beloved father. son. brother. and uncle died unexpectedly at the age of 47 on Saturday. May 23. 2015. in Longmont. Colorado. Brent was born on October 23. 1967. in Berkeley. California. to Shirley Hughes and A. Winn Layton. Although Brent lived in many cities throughout his life. he was a longtime resident of the Escalon area and considered it home. Brent was a very gifted man with many levels. He served as a deputy sheriff in Kern County. California. and Clark County. Arkansas. He also served as a peace officer for the Escalon Police Department. In addition to his commitment to law enforcement. Brent was committed to God. He was a very spiritual man and found great comfort in his faith. Unfortunately. in 2009. Brent became a Gold Star Father when his firstborn son. James. was killed in action in Kunar province. Afghanistan. serving during Operation Enduring Freedom. Since then. Brents mission in life was to embrace other Gold Star families and help them through the grieving process. Brent had many friends that loved him. and he had a heart full of love for them. His laugh. his sense of humor. and his big bear hugs will be missed forever. In addition. his friends and family admired his honest pride in his Cherokee Nation citizenship and will miss listening to him play guitar. There is peace in knowing that he is now with his son as well as the family and friends that have gone before him. Mr. Speaker. please join me in honoring and recognizing Brent for his friendship. faith. and unwavering support for other military families. He had a genuine love for people. community. and country and will be missed by many. God bless him always.",

I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of Officer Benner as they mourn the loss of a husband. father. grandfather. and friend who was taken from them far too soon. Officer Benner dedicated his life to protecting his community and his country. From his career in the United States Air Force to his last 4 years serving as a member of the Rio Rancho Police Department. Officer Benner put his health and safety on the line to make us safer. The same was true last week. When most of us were settling down after a long Memorial Day weekend with family and friends. Officer Benner was doing his duty to protect the people of Rio Rancho. When he didnt return that evening. Officer Benner left behind a legacy of valor of service. The loss of any police officer is a painful reminder of the dangers that they face each and every day. While we are shaken by Officer Benners loss. we can take comfort in the memories that he left behind for all who knew him and the example that he set for all those in the community. Rio Rancho is a tightknit community. and while a tragedy such as this is unexpected and shocking. the response has brought out the best of its residents. who have displayed an outpouring of support and sympathy. My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Benners family. friends. fellow officers. and the entire Rio Rancho community. and I hope that they find peace in this most difficult time. Officer Benner. thank you for your service. and may you rest in peace.",

Documents show that the EPA crafted the waters of the U.S. rule behind closed doors. leaving no seat at the table for farmers. business leaders. county and State officials. homebuilders. livestock producers. ranchers. and many others who are concerned by this Federal overreach. and it affects their lives. Everybody wants clean waterlets all be on the record for thatbut we need to respect this process. Stakeholders should have been consulted. The people whose lives are affected by this rule should have been consulted. The EPAs final rule is flawed. and despite attempts by Congress. it is not an improvement over the proposed rule. The rule still requires farmers and ranchers to get permits for activities on their own land. On their own land. The rule still expands the waters under the EPAs jurisdiction. The rule still hurts manufacturers and States and counties looking to expand economic development projects and looking to expand opportunity. This rule remains flawed and should be thrown out. I urge Members of Congress to support efforts to stop this jobkilling. farmkilling rule that invites lawsuits instead of real solutions. I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to support efforts to create a new rule that will truly improve water quality for all Americans and put stakeholders in the process and respect private property.",

Their bravery and sacrifice made possible the liberation of a continent and the defeat of an evil ideology. The American heroes who fought at Normandy are examples of what we want our country to be: courageous. generous. and undeterred by a commitment to freedom. But we owe every veteran from Dday to today more. We should remove the expiration dates in the GI bill so that veterans have access to education and training at any point in their career. We should pass an infrastructure plan with a preference for hiring veterans in the building and construction trades. We should help veterans keep medical appointments by providing child care at the VA clinics. And we should make sure that our veterans hospitals are stateoftheart facilities.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Enewetak Atoll Cleanup Veterans Registry and Study Act of 2016. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Maine. Senator KING. in this initiative. Our bill would address an issue important to veterans. including many in Maine. who participated in the Enewetak Atoll radiation cleanup missions from 1977 to 1980. These veterans may now be suffering from adverse health conditions due to exposure to radiation during these missions. At the end of World War II. Enewetak Atoll came under the control of the United States. which used it to test nuclear bombs. From 1948 to 1958. Enewetak Atoll was the site of 43 U.S. nuclear tests. The combined federal effort to clean up the resulting radioactive waste cost about $100 million over three years and required an onatoll task force numbering almost 1.000 people. The veterans who served on the cleanup task force did not ask to be sent to Enewetak Atoll. Like good servicemembers. they received their orders and went to work serving the U.S. government by cleaning up radioactive waste over a 3year period. I have heard from several Enewetak Atoll veterans who have now developed cancers. and they have expressed their concerns that these cancers may be rooted in their service cleaning up nuclear material. To address this troubling issue. our bill would help identify and bring together the shared experiences of those who served as a part of the Enewetak Atoll cleanup. It would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. VA. to establish a registry of U.S. veterans who participated in the cleanup missions of the Enewetak Atoll and who have subsequently experienced health issues. It would also direct the VA to commission an independent study investigating any possible linkage between radiation exposure during the cleanup missions and subsequent health problems among the servicemembers who served or trained there. Protecting the health of those who have served our nation is a solemn responsibility. This legislation keeps faith with our veterans by demonstrating that our government takes the allegations of serviceconnected exposure to radiation seriously. We must fulfill our obligations and affirm a larger commitment made long ago to take care of those who have so proudly served our Nationthe patriots who have worn our Nations uniform. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

SUSAN COLLINS. in introducing this initiative. which will help to combat a very important issue facing the servicemen and women stationed at the Enewetak Atoll between 1977 and 1980. These veterans assisted in a radiation cleanup mission that may have exposed them to harmful nuclear waste. and may be causing them health problems to this day. Between 1948 and 1958. the United States used the Enewetak Atoll for nuclear bomb testing. In 1977. after a total of 43 nuclear tests. the United States engaged in a 3year cleanup mission. costing $100 million and requiring a task force of nearly 1.000 servicemembers. However. despite the clearly dangerous nature of handling radioactive material. there is no registry or health study for those who served at Enewetak during that time. This bill would require the Secretary of the VA to establish a registry of veterans who served as part of the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll. and have subsequently experienced health issues that may have resulted from exposure to radiation. In addition. the bill would direct the VA to commission an independent study investigating any linkages between those who were exposed to the radiation and subsequent health problems. It would allow for the gathering of targeted data for a better assessment of exposure. and would help determine whether these veterans should be granted the presumption of serviceconnection disabilities. Throughout our Nations history. our veterans have put themselves in harms way to ensure our freedom time and time again. Their unwavering patriotism and courage demonstrate the fortitude of American character and our Nations commitment to democracy worldwide. In response. we must do everything we can to follow through on our responsibility to provide for our veterans. and the brave men and women who served at Enewetak Atoll are no exception to this solemn duty. This bill demonstrates our commitment to honoring and respecting our Nations heroes. past and present. and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Ohio in the House of Representatives for 30 years and will be missed by every person he touched. Although I never had the privilege of serving with Lou. he was a dear friend to my husband and they did much good work together on many critical issues. including civil rights. I will always remember him for his thoughtfulness. graciousness. and integrity. Born on February 23. 1925 in Cleveland. Congressman Stokes revealed the true nature of his character at an early age when he started shining shoes and clerking at an Army/ Navy store to supplement the income of his widowed mother. A man dedicated to public service. he served our nation honorably in the U.S. Army and continued his service when he returned home through working at the VA and Treasury Department offices in Cleveland. He also made a name for himself as a civil rights lawyer while working for the Cleveland NAACP. and ran for Congress successfully in In Congress. Lou was a strong voice for minorities and the disadvantaged. A founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congressman Stokes served as Chairman of the group for two consecutive terms beginning in 1972. Through his seat on the Appropriations Committee. Congressman Stokes advanced civil rights in this country by fighting against segregation and in support of affirmative action and fair housing. His legacy on these issues can still be felt today. Congress would do good to follow the example that Congressman Stokes set for all of usthat what matters most in this body is that you put your head down. do what is right for your constituents. and vote your conscience. The thing I remember most about Lou is that he never forgot where he came from and always put the people of Cleveland first. My thoughts and prayers are with the Stokes family during this difficult time. It is my hope that all members of this Congress will be inspired by the great example that Congressman Louis Stokes set for all of us and by the contributions he made to this country. E1238 Tuesday.

We heard from manufacturers from across the State. including leaders from Click Bond in Watertown. Connecticut. who are committed to growing their businesses right here in the United States. But they need our support. Congress needs to be a more effective partner for American manufacturing. We must continue to foster an innovation economy that creates manufacturing careers. not jobs. but careers that are at the heart of the middle class. We must reauthorize the ExportImport Bank. a critical financial tool for our companies to remain competitive in the global marketplace. We must work together to create a predictable Tax Code that encourages companies to return to the United States and levels the playing field for our small businesses. particularly our familyowned companies. We must inspire our students in science. technology. engineering. and math so that the United States remains the leader in global innovation for generations to come. By engaging our students in the STEM fields. we can prepare them to be the scientists. entrepreneurs. and innovators of the future. These students could become NASA astronauts like Waterburys own Rick Mastracchio. who circled the planet on the International Space Station. or machinists or Teamsters. who assemble the aircraft that our military flies proudly all around the world. or computer programmers. who make our world more accessible and connected. Many of my colleagues share my passion for STEM education and bolstering our skilled workforce. With Minority Whip STENY HOYERs leadership. Congress has advanced the Make It In America agenda and passed important legislation to cut taxes. provide small business loans. train skilled workers. and support American manufacturing. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are dedicated to creating and growing American jobs. By rising above partisan politics and focusing on commonsense practical policies. our bipartisan efforts can stimulate real economic growth. We should seize the opportunity to work together to support highpaying careers in American manufacturing.",

Sadly. we read tragic stories of men. women. and children fleeing their homes in Syria. They are escaping a murderous government. the same government propped up by the Iranian regime. The President is establishing a failed dangerous legacy that has left the Middle East in wars and mayhem with refugees and migrants drowning at sea. Ambassador John Bolton said it best when he remarked: Obamas mistakes make it impossible to travel in time back to a theoretical world where sanctions might have derailed Irans nuclear weapons program.

Since the announcement of the deal on July 14. the world has learned piece by piece just how bad it is. Earlier this year. I spoke on the House floor on the elements that would be needed in order to consider an agreement with Iran. One such element was the requirement of anytime. anywhere inspections. which would give inspectors 24hour access to any site inside Iran. yet. according to Hillel Fradkin. an expert at the Hudson Institute. Iran could get as many as 63 dayspossibly morebefore inspections. This gives Iran time to hide and destroy any potential evidence of nuclear weapons research. Additionally. this deal lifts economic sanctions too quickly and gives Iran access to $150 billion in sanctions relief. Iran is a top exporter and supporter of terrorism. We should not be making it easier for them to fund groups like Hezbollah and dictators like those in Syria. nor should we make it easier for Iran to procure conventional arms and missiles that have the capability of reaching American soil. Despite our negotiators assurances that the conventional arms embargo would not be lifted. this is precisely what will happen with the UN arms embargo ending in just 5 years. The President is rewarding Iran with money. access to weaponry. and a 10year pause on their nuclear weapons researchand that is if the Iranians dont cheat. Empowering Iran to fund terrorists and bully its neighbors is not what I call a good agreement for the United States or allies Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Recently. a number of patients and advocacy groups came to Washington to share what the proposed rule changes would mean to them. One patient from Minnesota noted that the proposed rule would turn back the clock and force her to use a prosthetic that she claimed would be the car equivalent of a 1970s Vega. Mr. Speaker. I share the apprehension that these patients have. and I encourage CMS. the agency in charge of administering Medicare. to chart a different course when it comes to administering lower limb prosthetics.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Republican selfstyled experts like Sarah Palin. Glenn Beck. and Donald Trump condemning an agreement to decrease the nuclear threat is hardly new. One Republican Presidential candidate blasted a \"nuclear Munich.\" The National Review denounced a \"suicide pact.\" The Conservative Caucus founder derided our President as a \"useful idiot\" and a \"weak man.\" Old George Will lamented the \"cult of arms control.\" Sharp words for a President who is negotiating a nuclear agreement with an untrustworthy. terroristpromoting regime that is bent on destroying America. Yet these shrill Republican attacks were not against President Obama. rather they were against President Ronald Reagan for agreeing with the Soviets to limit nuclear missiles. What the bombfirst. rejectionist crowd lacks in understanding and creativity they make up for here today in fatal consistency. Those who think the only good deal with Iran is a dead deal over nuclear weapons are only endangering our families. This week. I believe that reason will prevail and the President will be sustained. and our families will be all the safer for it.",

However. I must note that on the broader point of dynamic estimates. I am opposed. and I was therefore opposed to section 3112 being included in the budget resolution and conference agreement to start with.

Through their patriotism. the walls of segregation were finally removed from our Armed Forces on July 26. 1948.

The Cornwall Brothers Store is the only surviving historic waterfront building in Alexandria Bay. Built in 1866. The Cornwall Brothers Store has served the community of Alexandria Bay in many ways. This building originally opened as a store that sold everything from dry goods to fine clothing but was forced to close during the Great Depression. Since that time. the building served first as a customs house. then a United States Coast Guard station and a United States Post Office. before officially becoming the store and museum that it is today. The restoration of the store and the development of a museum sprang from an order to demolish the building in 1973. Knowing the significance of the Cornwall Brothers Store. a band of citizens came together to form the Alexandria Township Historical Society. a group whose first priority was to protect the Cornwall Brothers Store. After launching an intense campaign to save the building. the Alexandria Historical Society was able to save the building and have it registered in both the National Registry of Historic Places in 1975 and then the New York Registry of Historic Places in 1991. The museum now holds a variety of exhibits showcasing the lifestyles of residents of the Saint Lawrence River from the 19th and 20th centuries. Congratulations to the Cornwall Brothers Store on the 150th anniversary of your formation. I wish this business and museum continued success in the future.",

I wish to state my position on a piece of legislation that received consideration on the House floor yesterday. The House voted on the \"Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis\" Act. This legislation was introduced by my friend. Rep. TIM MURPHY. and I have strongly supported this bill since its introduction. The bill will make much needed reforms to the way our nation administers its mental health programs. and will authorize a number of grant programs to improve mental healthcare in our country. Tens of millions of Americans suffer from some kind of mental illness. and far too many of them suffer in silence. I believe we must take urgent action to increase our nations capacity to treat mental illness. to defeat the stigma that is all too often attached to mental health treatment. and to get help to those who need it. This bill will be a crucial part of this effort. and were I present for its consideration on the floor. I would have enthusiastically supported it. E1064 Thursday. July 7. 2016 Daily Digest",

I know that to be a cops wife or a cops husband is to prepare for the worst. but who could fathom such horror as this.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to commend the House on the passage of H.R. 5210. which it passed this week. This legislation provides relief to durable medical equipment providers in competitively bid areas until October 1. 2017. Competitive bidding was created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. H.R. 5210 extends the current phasein of competitively bid DME prices to noncompetitively bid areas. This is vital to ensure that Congress has enough time to monitor current phasein of noncompetitively bid DME prices and their effect in rural areas. In January of 2016. the competitive bidding program began its nationwide rollout. and. as a result. many areas. including rural areas. saw a significant cut in prices. which is now jeopardizing access to durable medical equipment for many beneficiaries. The First Congressional District of Georgia has numerous durable medical device companies that provide services throughout all of southeast Georgia. With many parts of my district being rural communities. evidence suggests that the current structure of CMS proposed pricing of DMEs would significantly harm these communities. That is why H.R. 5210 is so important. I commend my Georgia colleague. Representative PRICE. for offering this bill. and I commend my House colleagues for passing this measure. I encourage the Senate to begin consideration of this measure so rural beneficiaries in need of durable medical equipment are not unduly harmed by CMS proposals.",

They stood in the gapeven keeping order as their fellow officers were fallingas they were being protested in the march over recent tragic events that had happened elsewhere in our Nation. As the sniper shots rang out. and as they saw their brothers falling. these Dallas officers still responded to their internal call to duty to protect not themselves. but the innocent demonstrators that were also in that line of fire. Mr. Speaker. time and again. Americas police show their commitment to all lives. and we know they will continue to do so.

The Superior Township Chapter (STC) of the Southeast Michigan Land Conservancy (SMLC) has protected and preserved the natural habitats of Superior Township for the last 25 years. Starting with humble origins as a committee of the Southeast Michigan Land Conservancy. this group of active citizens formed to protect what was deemed the \"last frontier\" between Ann Arbor and Detroit in order to maintain the rural character and natural ecosystems of Superior Township. Since 1991. the STC has been steadfast in its dedication to protecting this land. fostering a healthy environment. and engaging and educating the public about the need for conservation. Started after a class lecture at Henry Ford Community College. Bill Secrest and Jack Smiley began organizing interested citizens with the goal of advancing environmental preservation. From the start of this project with the generous donation of thirty acres to establish the Springhill Nature Preserve. the STC has continued to grow and has not looked back. The STC now protects over twenty four hundred acres in our community. safeguarding this precious natural habitat and resources for future generations. Today the STC operates twelve nature preserves which are all open to the public and the new Superior Greenway Nature Trail. which is a project that leads the way in environmental maintenance. preservation. and education. The STC has implemented a long term plan for the nature preserves which will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy them. Our natural resources are invaluable and must continue to be cherished and protected. The Superior Township Chapter has worked tirelessly with local stakeholders to ensure environmental harmony and preservation in Superior Township and beyond. and for that we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 25th anniversary of the Superior Township Chapter of the Southeast Michigan Land Conservancy.

Included in these amendments was Amendment Number 17. which would have struck language from the underlying legislation that delays the implementation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus (CFPB) recently proposed rule regulating payday loans. While I will not be present to vote on the adoption of this amendment. I will vote against this measure. It is an unfortunate reality that many people live paychecktopaycheck in this country. For these individuals. any unexpected bill. whether it is a car repair or a medical emergency. can wreak havoc. Shortterm. smalldollar loans are essential resources for those who need just a little help overcoming these types of unexpected expenses. Likewise. just as these smalldollar. shortterm loans are essential to many workingclass American families. protecting consumers from unscrupulous actors is also imperative. However. I fear that in trying to protect consumers. the CFPBs proposed rule will cut off access to shortterm credit without providing a necessary alternative. By some estimates. the current proposed rule will force nearly 80 percent of payday lenders to shutter their doors. Ironically. in trying to protect consumers. the CFPBs efforts to regulate payday lenders will end up hurting consumers and their ability to access much needed sources of credit. Mr. Chair. it is for this reason that I oppose the implementation of the CFPBs proposed rulemaking at this time and will vote against the amendment preventing the rules delay. I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck: ensure workingclass Americans have unencumbered access to vital shortterm. smalldollar credit. while protecting consumers from unscrupulous actors in the industry.",

This prowoman amendment would strike a longstanding and unfair policy rider from the underlying legislation that restricts abortion coverage for those ensured under the Federal Employees Health Benefits E1058 Program (FEHBP). Restricting access to this constitutionally protected right sets women working for the federal government apart as a separate class. FEHBP provides health insurance to federal employees and their dependents. Like employees in the private sector. federal employees contribute to the cost of their health insurance through copays and deductibles. Unlike other employees in the private sector. however. federal employees are unable to access health plans that cover abortion. Since 1983. Congress has adopted language through the Financial Services Appropriations bill to eliminate abortion coverage from FEHPB except in narrow circumstances when the pregnancy would endanger the womans life or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. I rise in support of this amendment because it is time to end this prohibition. Every woman in the United States is entitled to access the constitutionallyprotected full range of pregnancyrelated care. including abortion. No employerincluding the federal governmentshould be allowed to dictate how an employee uses health care coverage or interfere in the benefits an employee chooses to access. Congress should respect the health care decisions of each federal employee and treat women with the dignity and compassion they rightly deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to protect the rights of federal employees and their right to access constitutionallyprotected medical services. For too long. this body has interfered with the difficult decisions women should make with their families. their doctors and whomever they choose. Its time that Congress lifts this ban and all bans on abortion coverage not just in FEHBP.",

This bill serves as the mechanism for interagency coordination of R&D to produce a tighter focus without wasteful duplication of research efforts among Federal agencies or the private sector. This will help save taxpayers dollars. It also rebalances agency R&D portfolios to focus less on shortterm. incremental approaches and much more on largescale. longterm interdisciplinary research to transform and enable new computing capabilities. Federal agencies are expected to invest more than $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 on NITRD Program activities. These investments go toward basic research at the frontiers of highend computing. networking. and information technology. More than $1.1 billion of this is invested by the National Science Foundation and $720 million by the Department of Energy. This taxpayerfunded basic research is intended to keep the United States the global leader in highend computing and networking. which is crucial to our future economic and national security.

The first one is that our legislation would somehow punish and make it more difficult for illegal persons to report crimes and cooperate with local law enforcement. That is a pure myth. What is the fact? Well. read the bill. as the American people suggest. Read the bill. Our bill. S. 2146. specifically provides that if a jurisdiction has a policy that local law enforcement will not inquire about the immigration status of crime victims or witnesses. such jurisdiction will not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction and it will not lose Federal funds over that. So that argument is simply a myth. The second argument often made is that somehow this legislation is requiring local law enforcement to carry out Federal immigration responsibilities. Again. that is a pure myth. a purely erroneous argument. and if we read the bill. S. 2146. we will see it is simply not true. The bill does not require local law enforcement \"to carry out Federal immigration responsibilities\" in any way. shape. or form. Removing illegal immigrants remains the exclusive province of the Federal Government. The bill simply withholds certain Federal funds from jurisdictions that prohibit exactly the cooperation that our opponents on the other side say is so necessary and correctly say is so necessary. So that. again. is the fact versus the myth that is being propagated. Again. we have several myths versus facts as part of the record. and I urge everyone. starting with our colleagues. Democrats and Republicans. to study it carefully. This is an important issue. Sanctuary cities are a real problem. and we need to fix that problem to move forward. So I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this issue of what is driving these sanctuary cities policies. Our legislation will take up those drivers. those obstacles. will solve those problems. and will result in the cooperation at all levels of law enforcement that we desperately need.

For some lawsuits. the U.S. will be substituted as defendant specifically. suits alleging that that the immigration detainer should not have been issued. But such a claim could already be brought against the U.S. under existing law. thus. S.2146 does not create a new source of liability for the federal government. S.2146 simply provides that if the federal government made the error. the federal government should be the defendant. We. the law enforcement officers of America. are on the front lines day after day. We know the challenges of apprehending criminals and the difficulties of working with crime victims and witnessesespecially those who may be fearful of local and federal authorities.

Mr. Speaker. while we are discussing H.R. 4472. reducing the time that it takes to process a child who might come from a different State for adoption or foster care placement. there are other issues of child welfare. one that I will mention. The issues of child welfare have a long history of bipartisanship. In addition to the Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act. I hope to engage my colleagues in addressing the substance abuse needs of families involved in child welfare. Aside from neglect. alcohol and other drug use is the number one reason for removal from the home. More specifically. approximately onethird of cases list alcohol or other drug use as the reason for the childs removal. What is exciting is that we have good. clear empirical evidence that certain strategies have demonstrated effectiveness. Specifically. these quality interventions help children and families affected by substance abuse experience fewer days in care. higher reunification rates. less recurrence of child maltreatment. and better permanency over time. I am preparing to introduce a bill that scales up these successes from smaller targeted interventions into fullscale interventions while building the research to better inform Federal policy overall. My bill does two key things. First. it dedicated staff under Title IVE for the coordination of substance abuse prevention and treatment services with child welfare services. Secondly. it creates grants to expand the lessons learned from the research on smaller scale efforts to the State level. funding additional research to improve related Federal policy. My home State of Illinois has led the Nation in addressing substance abuse issues in child welfare. We know that we need to do more to address this problem. We know that it works. And. of course. I look forward to being engaged in the development of programs and activities that would further enhance that kind of success. Again. I want to thank Mr. YOUNG for his tremendous work on H.R. 4472.

I hope we can find ways to work together to advance what has been done here and to advance specific legislation that will help reduce the number of children that suffer from abuse and neglect.

I hope that is not done by the Congress as a whole. The Social Services Block Grant is a major source of funding for prevention of child abuse and neglect today. used by State and local governments to focus on prevention with far too little focus on prevention overall. One of the major conclusions of this Commission on Child Fatalities is that we focus our attention so much on the end. after the abuse has occurred. and not on the beginning. to try to prevent abuse. We need to focus on prevention. So at the same time this bill was approved. that support was cut. Hopefully. Congress will reject the bill to eliminate the Social Services Block Grant and we can come together to find more resources to do what must be done to prevent us from just lurching from one tragedy to another and help stabilize and support families working to see that children are protected.

Active Duty designees are members of civilian groups who served alongside the regular Armed Forces during World Wars I and II. These brave men and women were often located in combat zones. where they risked their lives to protect the freedom that we should never take for granted. Their contributions to the war effort was so vital that they have been granted the most prestigious title our Nation can bestowthat of veteran. As such. they are eligible to be laid to rest in any cemetery administered by the National Cemetery Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. However. Arlington National Cemetery is run by the Department of the Army. Between 2002 and last year. the Army inurned Active Duty designees with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. Unfortunately. last March. thenSecretary McHugh. reversed this policy. which means that many of those courageous individuals can no longer choose to be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. H.R. 4336. as amended. would reverse this decision and require the Army to provide Active Duty designees inurnments with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.

I am here to urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation that recognizes the services of certain groups of men and women who have valiantly served their country.

Ultimately. nearly 35 groups have been made eligible for benefits through that law. These include the Women Airforce Service Pilots. the U.S. merchant seamen who served on blockships in Operation Mulberry on DDay. male civilian ferry pilots. U.S. civilians of the American Field Service. and many. many more. In recognition of their service. the cremated remains of these groups may be inurned in all cemeteries under the jurisdiction of the VA. However. Arlington National Cemetery is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. not of the VA. This bill recognizes all of the individuals who are eligible to have their cremated remains inurned in Arlington National Cemetery to include groups that have been given veteran status in the GI Bill Improvement Act. including the WASPs. Decades after Congresswoman Boggs championed this legislation. I am proud to continue Louisianas long tradition of support for these groups by cosponsoring this bill. I thank. most greatly.

But right now. political posturing has handicapped the ExIm Bank. one of our countries most reliable tools to increase Americas economic competitiveness in our global economy. In my home State of Washington. there are nearly 100 businesses. the majority of them small or mediumsized. that used the Banks services last year to help sell their products overseas. We are talking about everything from apples to airplane parts. beer. wine. software. medical training supplies. and beyond. The reality is that people in other countries want Americanmade products. That is a great thing because these businesses support tens of thousands of jobs in our country and keep our economy moving. The ExportImport Bank is the right kind of investment because it expands the access of American businesses to emerging foreign markets that create jobs right here at home. Do you know what it costs taxpayers? Not a single penny. In fact. the ExIm Bank reduces our national debt. So here is the bottom line. The Bank creates jobs. It strengthens our businesses. It helps our economy grow from the middle out. not just the top down. So it is time for my colleagues to put ideology aside. to allow this proven program to operate at its full capacity. and to allow a vote that we were denied today to get the ExIm Board operating again because it is critical that the Bank continue to receive the strong bipartisan support we have seen in the past as we work to build on its success.

It is nighttime or it could be daytime. Suddenly. you lose control of your car because your ignition switch cuts off the car and you lose control of your power steering and your brakes. There is an 18wheeler coming at you and you have no time to react. There is a crash and you. as the driver. are killed in the unfortunate accident. Lets assume that that has happened in numerous other cases. Perhaps the injuries were not as bad as a death. Perhaps someone just suffered a closedhead injury. a concussion. or perhaps a broken arm in the accident. Lets assume that both of those cars were made by the same manufacturer. had the same ignition switch. and a defect in that ignition switch caused the crashes. Now there are numbers of claimants who are wanting to get together and file a class action lawsuit because they know that the large company has an army of lawyers. all of whom will go to court against a single plaintiff to defeat the claim. These briefcasetoting. loaferwearing. silkstocking lawyers. who are getting paid $900 an hour go to court. have helped the corporation hide the existence of the defect for many years. and there have been so many accidents that have occurred that singular plaintiffs who aggregate their claims and come together against that corporation have a better shot at winning the case than has just a single plaintiff who is going against an army of corporate lawyers. This legislation changes the rules. It tilts the scales in favor of the company by making the plaintiffs prove that they have suffered the same type and scope of injury as has the named class representative. and that is despite there being one common question of law in fact that permeates all of the cases. Why shouldnt they be allowed to bring that case together?

    "speech": "Madam Chair. this amendment should be defeated because it essentially guts the bill. The bill requires that class action members share the same scope of injury. which is intended to prevent the certification of grossly overbroad class action lawsuits that include members with wildly varying injuries. The ordinary meaning of scope in the dictionary is the range of a relevant subject. Judges are certainly capable of determining the relevant range of injuries that would make class members suitably typical of one another. The base bill uses the word \"scope\" to make clear that all class members do not need to have suffered the same type of injury to the exact same extent. but they still must demonstrate they have suffered the same range of injuries as determined by the court. This amendment also strikes the term \"economic loss\" from the bill. The base bill defines the scope of class actions covered by the bill as those involving claims for monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss. Economic loss is defined by Blacks Law Dictionary as \"a monetary loss. such as lost wages or lost profits.\" In a products liability suit. the economic loss includes the cost of repair or replacement of defective property as well as commercial loss for the propertys inadequate value and consequential loss of profits or use. These sorts of claims should also be covered under the bill because they are claims for monetary relief. Those with significantly greater claims for such relief should have their own day in court and the chance to obtain the most compensation for their economic loss.

When I heard my colleague from Texas. a good friend. talk about costs and making sure that the individuals in the class are spread out so that they are limited in the ability to press their case. I got the answer. Again. I say that a oneway street to justice is unacceptable. There are too many people who died that I cannot stand on this floor and deny those who are sick and ailing or those who had in the 1950s thalidomide where babies were born with malformations because women took medicine that had not been tested. The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a balanced approach to the bills disclosure requirements by applying transparency rules in the bill equally to the asbestos industry defendants. Specifically. this amendment will require that an asbestos defendant seeking information from the trusts about a plaintiff to first make available to the plaintiff and trust information about the median settlement amount paid by that defendant for claims settled or paid within 5 years of the date of the request for the State in which the plaintiffs actions were filed. The American Bar Association understands my point. Frankly. in their comments. they made the following statement that I think is important: \"We oppose legislation such as H.R. 1927. because it would unnecessarily circumvent the Rules Enabling Act. make it more difficult for large numbers of injured parties to efficiently seek redress in court\"-again. a oneway street-\"and could place added burdens on the already overloaded court system.\" The ABA goes on to relate how this bill is a poor bill.

So if you are a poor farmer or if you are a poor waitress or you are someone driving a 1989 car and you are in a circumstance that puts you in a category where that car. even as old as it is. had some defect and you have no ability to press your case. you have the ability to press your case along with others. I am outraged to think that they would deny that. So my amendment says to the defendant: You need to put forward all the information that you are demanding of those individuals who are singularly unable to provide the kind of legal representation that they need. If transparency was the true goal of this bill. then. why doesnt the bill require settling defendants to reveal information important to public safety?

The FACT Act eliminates this problem by requiring minimal disclosures from asbestos trusts and allowing for access to additional information at the cost of the requesting party. It doesnt put a burden on the trusts. The amendment not only removes the minimal disclosure requirements. but it would replace additional disclosure requirements on parties who request information from the asbestos trust. Over the course of four separate hearings before the Judiciary Committee the issue highlighted was the lack of disclosure by the asbestos bankruptcy trust. not private party litigants. There has been no record of plaintiffs encountering difficulties in obtaining information necessary to sue these businesses. In fact. the evidence is to the contrary. Go look at a plaintiffs attorney who specializes in asbestos litigation Web site and you see how they tout their access to information necessary to sue these companies. It is the parties. other than the plaintiffs. including other asbestos bankruptcy trusts. as well as State court judges. who have difficulty obtaining information from the asbestos bankruptcy trust system which has created an environment that is conducive to fraud and takes money out of those trusts that is needed for future victims.

Of most interest to the gentlewoman from Texas should be the Texas Coalition of Veterans Organization. which represents more than 600.000 Texas veterans. supports this because they know that our young servicemen and -women that were exposed to asbestos and have not yet manifested the symptoms of mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases need to have these trusts in place so that there will be money to compensate them because they cant sue the Federal Government over sovereign immunity. This protects the veterans and makes sure there is money for future claimants. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. we should realize that the Bankruptcy Code sections cited by the distinguished gentleman from Texas are permissive. not mandatory. Bankruptcy Code section 107(c). for example. permits. but does not require. the bankruptcy court to issue an order prohibiting the disclosure of certain information pertaining to an individuals for cause if the court finds that disclosure of such information would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual or the individuals property. In other words. the victim here. who has been victimized by the people who produced the asbestos. would now have to go into court and request the protective order. The burden would be on the victim. Why are we putting the burden on the victim instead of on the tortfeasor? The bill would do that. The Bankruptcy Codes section 107 socalled privacy protection is not automatic. As a result. the asbestos victim would have to retain counsel and go to court to prove cause to obtain relief. Again. you are shifting the burden further to the victim from the tortfeasor. That is not a very good idea. and there is no great necessity for it. If the court finds or if a trust believes that it is being defrauded. it can request the court to get this information. It can ask for discovery. Yes. discovery is expensive. but you want to shift the expense to the victim. That is highly unfair. This bill shifts tremendous burden to the victim. If he doesnt pick up that burden and go in for protective orders. it puts personal information that can be used to further victimize him open to anyone who wants to get it on the Internet. My amendment would say no. to publish aggregate data that will help prevent fraudI am not sure that there is much fraudbut publish aggregate data that would help prevent fraud. and if you have a reason. then you can go and ask the court for more. instead of the other way around. The question is: Should the burden be on the tortfeasor or on the victim? I side with the victim. I urge the adoption of this amendment. Madam Chair. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I think we are going down a rabbit trail here. I agree with Mr. NADLER. This bill is designed to protect victims. It is not intended to increase the burdens or the cost on the victim. It does require the trusts to publish the name and the basis of the claim of folks who claim trust so that they are not doubledipped and pay more than one claim for the same person. That is what we are trying to do here. As we start to get into the additional information. that is further down the road. That is not part of the disclosure requirements of the FACT Act. But once the litigation proceeds and we have determined that somebody has filed a claim and they are in another court. the further information requested would normally be part of that proceeding and then would fall under the Bankruptcy Code rules. The disclosures of the FACT Act requirements from the asbestos trust are very limited: name and the nature of the claim and where they were exposed. That is less information than you have to release when you file any sort of tort case in a State court. It is basically what we consider to be the bare minimum in order to allow defendants to sniff out the possibility of doubledipping and fraudulent claims. Madam Chair.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. 2 years ago today Pennsylvania abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was convicted of murder. conspiracy to kill. and involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment. Even though the news of Gosnells child slaughter was largely suppressed by the mainstream media. many of my colleagues may remember that Dr. Gosnell operated a large Philadelphia abortion clinic where women died and countless babies were dismembered or chemically destroyed. often by having their spinal cord snipped. all gruesome procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim. Today. the House considers landmark legislation authored by Congressman TRENT FRANKS to protect unborn children beginning at the age of 20 weeks postfertilization from these painfilled abortions. The PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act is needed now more than ever because there are Gosnells all over America. dismembering and decapitating paincapable babies for profit: men like Steven Brigham of New Jersey. an interstate abortion operatorsome 35 aborted babies were found in his freezer. men like Leroy Carhart. caught on videotape joking about his abortion toolkit. complete with. as he said. a pickaxe and drill bit. while describing a 3daylong lateterm abortion procedure and the infant victim as \"putting meat in a CrockPot.\" Some euphemistically call this choice. but a growing number of Americans rightly regard it as violence against children. and huge majorities60 percent. according to the November Quinnipiac pollwant it stopped. Fresh impetus for this bill came from a huge study of nearly 5.000 babies. preemies. published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The next day The New York Times article titled \"Premature Babies May Survive At 22 Weeks If Treated\" touted the Journals extraordinary findings of survival and hope. Just imagine. Madam Speaker. preemies at 20 weeks are surviving. as technology and medical science advances. Alexis Hutchinson. featured in The New York Times story. is today a healthy 5yearold who originally weighed in at a mere 1.1 pounds. Thus. the babies we seek to protect from harm today may indeed survive if treated humanely. with expertise and with an abundance of compassion. I urge support for the legislation.",

I know the worry and anxiety that comes along with carrying a child. And many times. that worry doesnt end after birth. I still think about my children with concern every day. and I understand the difficulties and the decisions that many women have during this time. Motherhood is a big responsibility and a huge change. As a community. we need to help women through this time. But we also have the responsibility to come together as a country and protect the most innocent and the vulnerable among us. In this bill. we are talking about protecting unborn babies that are already 20 weeks old and mothers who are halfway through their pregnancy. That is about 5 months. At this stage. many women already have a baby bump and they are wearing maternity clothing. The baby can be as long as a banana is and kicking and moving around. even to the point where the mother will feel those kicks and that movement. More importantly. this is the stage where we know the baby can feel pain and could be viable outside the womb with proper care. In fact. there is evidence that the pain that the unborn baby feels is even more intense than what a young child or an adult would feel because their nervous system isnt developed enough to block that pain. The majority of women in the United States are with us on this bill. We must protect these innocent lives when they are the most vulnerable and sensitive among us to feeling pain.",

Ideally. we would reauthorize section 215 of the U.S. PATRIOT Act and other expiring FISA authorities without making any changes. These provisions authorize important counterterrorism programs. including the NSA bulk telephone metadata program. What is more. they are constitutional. authorized by Congress. and subject to multiple layers of oversight from all three branches of government. As threats to Americans at home and abroad increase by the day. now is not the time to be weakening our national security with all the tragic consequences that may follow. However. I also realize that some of my colleagues disagree. Despite the fact that the NSA bulk telephone metadata program has never been intentionally misused. many Members wish to make changes to increase confidence in the program and allow greater transparency into intelligence activities. Like the bill the House passed last year with more than 300 votes. this bill would replace the bulk program that will expire on June 1 with a targeted authority. This new targeted authority will be slower and potentially less effective than the current program. Along with Ranking Member SCHIFF. I have worked with the Judiciary Committee to ensure these changes still allow as much operational flexibility as possible. Chairman GOODLATTE. Ranking Member CONYERS. and Subcommittee Chairman SENSENBRENNER. thank you for the constructive work between our committees. In addition. the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 contains several significant measures to improve national security that were not part of last years bill. It closes a loophole in current law that requires the government to stop monitoring the communications of foreign terrorists. including ISIL fighters from Syria and Iraq. when they enter the United States. It streamlines the process for the government to track foreign spies who temporarily leave the United States. It helps the government investigate proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. It increases the maximum sentence for material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Those changes are real improvements that will make it easier for our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to keep Americans safe. Again. I would prefer a clean reauthorization. but the bill we consider today is the best way forward in the House to ensure Congress takes responsible action to protect national security.

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee. I work with our servicemembers and military leaders daily to ensure our adversaries do not harm this great Nation.

The point of being here today is that the worst is yet to come and. God. I hope I am wrong because this is what I think is going to happen. I think there is going to be an attack on our country that is being planned as I speak. coming from Syria. If we went on the ground in the regionnot 100.000 U.S. troops but mostly people from the region with some of uswe could destroy the caliphate and we could disrupt their plans against our homeland. but we are not doing that. If we dont change our strategy regarding Syria. we are going to lose one of the best allies America has ever had. and that is the Kingdom of Jordan. because it is being overrun by refugees. The whole seam of the Middle East is splitting wide open. I will say this. Everybody makes mistakesBush. LINDSEY GRAHAM. and JOHN MCCAIN. The key is to adjust. The problem I have with this administration is that they seem unable and unwilling to adjust. If they dont change their strategy. we are all going to regret it. As bad as it is today. the worst is yet to come.",

He says that we only have two choicesto send in a couple of hundred thousand troops or to do nothing. Neither LINDSEY GRAHAM Or I or any smart person I know are advocating that. What we are advocating is about a 10.000 American force providing the capabilities of ISR training. forward air controllers and others. with a large contingent of Arab countries that would then move to Raqqa on the ground with the use of American air power. Please do not be fooled by this constant barrage of untruths that are being said about those of us that we want to send in hundreds of thousands. We do not. This has to be an Arab coalition with the United States a small part of it. and. by the way. have them pay for it as well. With the proper American leadership and commitment and credibility. which is totally absent now in the region. that could be done. Otherwise. we will fight them there or we will fight them here.

I have heard from law enforcement officers and grateful families what a miracle this drug can be. so we need to make sure we have it supplied where it can literally save lives. I have had police officers tell me that they arrived at a scene with an overdose. and because they had that with them. they saved the life of the person. If they had not had it. the person would have been dead by the time the ambulance arrived. In Vermont. we have seen a 65 percent increase in the number of Vermonters getting treatment for their addiction over the past 2 years. This is encouraging progress and reflects the fact that our Governor and also State legislators of both parties have stepped up. But we know that there are hundreds more who are on waiting lists. and patients in the very rural corners of my State travel hours just to get their medication. We need to do more about this real threat to our communities. I am very proud to cosponsor Senator SHAHEENs emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I want to be able to fund additional public health outreach. treatment. recovery. and law enforcement efforts. We have passed much larger emergency supplemental bills to address swine flu and Ebola. We passed huge supplemental bills on Ebola when we did not have a single case of Ebola originate here in the United States. We were worried about it coming in. but it did not originate here. But here. we have tens of thousands in the Presiding Officers State. in my State. and in every other State. We have to take the health epidemic already in our communities just as seriously as we did those diseases that did not originate on our shores.

For two decades. he helped members of the Capitol Hill community by keeping us safe. and on the day he passed away. he helped members of his own community in Magnolia. DE. by shoveling snow for his neighbors. Officer Alston was a caring and modest man who took great pride in his work. As a former Capitol Police officer myself. I understand the dedication and sacrifice required of members of the Capitol Police force. and Officer Alston was an exemplar of these traits. I am saddened that the U.S. Capitol Police has lost one of our own. but I will always be grateful for Officer Alstons service to the Capitol Police force and to our Nation.

Carolina Panthers defensive tackle Dwan Edwards and Denver Broncos backup quarterback Brock Osweiler. I am so proud that Montana will be well represented in this years Super Bowl. and I am so proud to honor these men for their leadership and athletic accomplishments. Dwan grew up in Columbus. MT. and graduated in 1999 from Columbus High School. He then went on to play for Oregon State University and eventually was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2004. where he played for five seasons. In 2010. he was picked up by the Buffalo Bills for two seasons. He signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2012 and is now playing in his 12th NFL season. Dwan has certainly not forgotten where he is from. He is currently making arrangements to bring former Columbus High School football coach John Smith out to watch Dwan play in his first Super Bowl game. This summer. he will put on the eighth Dwan Edwards Elite Football camp. where he spends a week in Billings helping young players develop their football skills. Brock represents Kalispell. where he attended Flathead High School. He graduated in 2009 as an honor roll student and was coached by Russell McGarvel. Brock played college football for Arizona State and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in 2012. During his time playing in the NFL. he has given back to Flathead and its football program by regularly sending letters of encouragement to the high school team and donating a Flathead Football captains board in 2014. The football teams captains names are etched into the board each year. which serves as a great honor for these young leaders. My biggest congratulations goes out to both of these fine men for representing the great State of Montana well. both on and off the field. Best of luck to you both in Super Bowl 50 this Sunday. Keep making Montana proud.*",

Katie. who is never shy to take on a challenge. opened her own staffing agency and has built it from the ground up. Ten years later. Portico Staffing has thrived under her exceptional leadership. business savvy. and highly regarded reputation as a people person.

She knows it comes with sacrifice and risk. And she has worked hard to make her dream come true. Katie is a great mentor and role model for the next generation. She shows that perseverance and persistence pay off. Always on the job. whether networking in the community or listening to her clients. Katie makes good connections happen. And that is a good thing for job seekers and employers looking to hire and grow their business. Katie was nominated by her peers for consideration of this prestigious award. It is no surprise to me that my fellow Iowans would sing her praises. Without hesitation. I endorse Katies selection as the 2015 Business Owner of the Year. I have had the pleasure of knowing Katie Roth since 1980 when she joined my first campaign for the U.S. Senate. Always a tireless worker. I have enjoyed watching Katie thrive and succeed throughout the years. A loving wife and mother. Katie is fiercely loyal and Barbara and I hold her in our highest regard.

Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers was created in 2000 following the tragic death of Navy ENS John R. Elliott in a drunkdriving related crash. The campaigns mission is to prevent drunk drivingrelated crashes and deaths through the use of designated drivers. That mission has been a significant success across New Jersey. with many drivers citing the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign as a reason why they choose to serve as designated drivers. Over the last 15 years. the organization has grown from a small group from Southern New Jersey. to an organization nationally recognized by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Commission Against Drunk Driving for its efforts. The effects of the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign have gone beyond the Southern New Jersey region. Seven States across our Nation have adopted the HERO Campaign as their designated driver model in an effort to decrease drunk driving fatalities. The HERO Campaign has also partnered with the New York Giants. the Philadelphia Phillies. and other professional sports franchises in their mission to promote the use of designated drivers. These partnerships do not include the thousands of individuals across our Nation who have also registered as designated drivers at concerts and sporting events as a pledge to the HERO campaign. The John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers was instrumental in the passage of Johns Law. enacted in 2005. which gave States $145 million in highway grant incentives for establishing car impoundment laws for drivers suspected of drunk driving. The tragic circumstances surrounding Navy ENS John R. Elliotts crash have turned into a long history of meaningful accomplishments across not only New Jersey. but across our Nation. It is my hope that the legacy of John R. Elliott will live on and expand across our country. I applaud the efforts of the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers and thank them for their efforts in making our roads safer across our country by promoting the use of designated drivers.*",

In celebration of this special occasion. festivities were held in Kouts on August 22. 2015. which included a parade and commemoration ceremony coinciding with the towns annual Porkfest and the historic Aukiki Festival. An idyllic sanctuary for rural life. Kouts has become the thriving community it is today due to one noble trait: perseverance. In 1865. when surveyors of the nearby Pittsburgh. Cincinnati. and Saint Louis railroad sought lodging. they were denied at the first home they E1213 came to and wandered onward to be accepted with hospitality at the second. where the Kouts family lived. Henceforth. the family name was given to the area as it expanded from the Kouts train station and was built into a prospering community by the surveyors. The village applied for incorporation three times. failing twice before Kouts patience was rewarded in 1921. the same year electricity spread to the area. Kouts has always been a town of industry. not in the sense of material production. but in the sense that the people of Kouts have always toiled with conviction and tenacity to create the lives they envision for themselves and to lift up their community as a civil microcosm worthy of respect. It is a testament to the quality of the people of Kouts and their interest in supporting each member of the community that Blake Benson. an eighth grader at Kouts Middle School. has assumed the role of President of the towns Sesquicentennial Committee. performing the duties of his office with pride. In collaboration with his Committee. Blake has organized the joyous commemoration of this special day in Kouts history. For their devotion to their towns history and prosperity.

California. for more than 40 years of outstanding reporting at the Marin Independent Journal (IJ). the largest daily newspaper in Marin County. Mr. Johnsons columns and articles have sparked conversations and changed policies in our community for decades. and his presence in the paper will be sorely missed. A graduate of Rutgers University in New Jersey. Mr. Johnson initially came to California in a Volkswagen van on a crosscountry road trip in the early 1970s. After working briefly at a weekly paper in Tiburon. he joined the IJ as a reporter in May of 1972. where he continued to work through his retirement on April 28 of this year. Mr. Johnsons encyclopedic knowledge of Marin County and its government is unparalleled. During his tenure. he covered some of the largest stories in the North Bay. From the Trailside Killer to the Mount Vision Fire to monitoring Supervisors expense accounts. Mr. Johnson was at the forefront of the news he coveredand once. famously. became part of the story himself. When an elderly couple in Inverness disappeared in 1994. his reporting led investigators to find the truck in nearby Lake Nicasio. Throughout my years as a California State Assemblyman and now as Member of Congress. I always found his coverage to be tough. fearless. and fair. He often used his voice to empower the voiceless. particularly in elevating threats facing local fisheries and fishers. I appreciate the unbridled passion for journalism Mr. Johnson brought to the Marin IJ. and his honest approach to both big and small stories. I know I am not the only one of his readers who will miss Mr. Johnsons dogged reporting. insight into local news and issues. and. of course. his column on fishing. Mr. Speaker. it is therefore fitting that we honor and thank Nels Johnson for his immeasurable contributions to civic life in Marin County and California.",

Mr. SpeakerJordan did not shrink. it did not retreat. Instead. it took even a more active role in airstrikes against the ISIS threat. The Syrian civil war and instability created by ISIS has placed a tremendous pressure on the country of Jordan. Jordan has absorbed 620.000 Syrian refugees during this crisis. Its healthcare and educational systems are under severe strain as a result. The United States has provided over $460 million in response. on top of the over $1 billion in bilateral foreign assistance Jordan received last year. In February. the U.S. and Jordanian Governments signed a memorandum of understanding outlining the intention to provide Jordan with $1 billion per year for the next 3 years. This agreement and this legislation seek to ensure that Jordan is able to defend itself in the wake of these severe threats. For the next 3 years. the bill would treat Jordan as a NATO member in how weapons sales and maintenance. manufacturing licensing agreements. and technical assistance are considered and notified to this Congress.

We told him that we would do what we could to ensure that he had all of the tools needed to win this fight against ISIL. Since the coalition campaign against ISIL began. Mr. Speaker. the terror group has made great gains in Iraq and Syria. It has expanded its influence across the globe to places like Libya. Tunisia. Sinai. Europe. and even here in the United States. Congress needs to do our part. We need to step up. We need to show our allies that we are committed to help them. They are taking the fight to ISIL. Lets help them with these tools. We need to show ISIL and all of our enemies that we will stand by our allies. We will stand by our friends and help them do what is necessaryall that is necessaryto defeat terror and to defeat radical extremism. I urge my colleagues to support this vital. important bill and support our key ally. the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

Madam Speaker. many businesses show their gratitude to our Nations servicemembers and veterans by offering special discounts on goods and services to those who have served our Nation in uniform. Unfortunately. unless a servicemember is a qualified military retiree. DOD does not issue an official ID card as proof of service. That means that millions of veterans cannot easily provide evidence of their service. This bill. as amended. would change that by directing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue a veterans ID card that would display the veterans name and photograph to any veteran who requests such a card. as long as the veteran is not entitled to military retired pay. nor enrolled in the VA healthcare system. This card would give those who served in the Armed Forces a convenient way to prove that they are veterans. for the purpose of receiving the promotions and discounts offered by many businesses around the country. The bill. as amended. would also require the Secretary to determine a fee to be charged that would cover all costs of producing the cards and managing the program. The bill also specifies that the card does not entitle the holder to any VA benefits. H.R. 91 passed the House by a vote of 4020 on May 18. The Senate passed it by unanimous consent on June 22. with an amendment that would authorize VA to provide this card to any person who meets the statutory definition of a veteran. Under current law. a veteran is defined as \"a person who served in the active military. naval. or air service and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.\" I thank my colleague Mr. BUCHANAN for his efforts on this commonsense legislation.

That is the same size as all of Western Europe. if you can imagine that. that being 27 percent of the United States landmass. The Forest Service alone owns over 230 million acres of this Federal land. This amendment is very simple. All it does is to have the Federal Government examine the land that it has in its possession for the potential sale back to Americans so that Americans can own America. We are not talking about National Forests. We are not talking about the Grand Canyon. We are talking about unused land that is owned by the Federal Government. It will have the Federal Government go through that land27 percent of the landmass in the countryand decide whether some of that might actually be better to be in the possession and the property of Americans so that. if Americans then own the land. that land in some Statelike Utahcan then be developed by Americans. and then those people can pay taxes on the land that would go to the State of Utah. for example. Right now the land is unused. It is not able to be productive.

When Mrs. Vandiver became first lady. Central State Hospital in Milledgeville served as Georgias only State hospital for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. In the late 1950s. Central State Hospital was home to more than 12.000 clients. many of whom had been abandoned by their families at an early age. Upon visiting the hospital. Mrs. Vandiver became very concerned about the plight of the clients and their living conditions. She determined that she would devote much of her time and energy as first lady to raise public awareness of the needs of Georgias mentally ill and developmentally disabled. One of Mrs. Vandivers initiatives to show care and concern for the clients at Central State Hospital was to work with the Georgia Municipal Association to create a statewide Christmas gift collection drive known as the Mayors Motorcade. which was established in 1959 and expanded years later to support the clients of the States regional hospitals. Each year. caring Georgians support the Mayors Motorcade by donating gifts to cities participating in the program. Through Mrs. Vandivers efforts. thousands of clients residing at Georgias State hospitals have received Christmas gifts and visits from city officials at special Motorcade events. Today it is my pleasure to honor Mrs. Vandiver for having the vision to create the program as a way of providing not only gifts but also raising public awareness about the needs of Georgias mentally ill and developmentally disabled.*",

Vernon Ashley was born on January 15. 1916. at the mouth of Wolf Creek along the banks of the Missouri River near present day Fort Thompson. SD. In 1946. after serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II. Vernon was elected tribal chairman of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe. As chairman. he was credited both with helping to author the tribes first constitution and bylaws and for working to preserve tribal lands for his people during the Federal Governments flood control projects of the 1940s and 50s. He was a servant to his people of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe and to his fellow South Dakotans. After nearly 10 years of working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Vernon went to work for South Dakota as the first Indian Affairs coordinator. serving in that role under three different Governors. He was a fluent Dakota speaker whose Dakota name was Sinkpe. which means muskrat. This past July. the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe honored him by making him a chief. The eagle bone whistle was traditionally used by some Plains Indian warrior societies. When Vernon and his fellow veterans were honored at his memorial services. several people heard the sound of the eagle bone whistle even though no one was playing one. Therefore. may the sound of the eagle bone whistle be with us. too. when we need to be inspired to be brave and do what is right for the people we serve. Chief Vernon Ashley will be remembered by all for his humility. for being a man of faith. and for his friendship to so many. With this.

My colleague talked about the Balkans. We know World War I began in the Balkans. We know it has continued to be a part of Europe where Russian aggression and Russian efforts to subvert the governments there continue. they continue their activity. It is a place where we have a number of different ethnic groups and where different religions converge. So it is a place we need to keep supportingBosnia and Herzegovina. We need to look at how we can help them ensure their continued progress toward the West and Europe and also toward economic prosperity. I traveled there in 2010 with former Senator Voinovich from Ohio. who had done a lot of work on the Balkans when he was in the Senate. I will never forget a lunch we had with a number of young people there. mostly college students or recent graduates. We talked to them about what they saw for the future of the country. and there was so much hopelessness in that conversation because they didnt see the kinds of opportunities we want young people to see as they are thinking about their futures and their children and what is going to happen in their country. So I think this is a partial answer to how we can help them provide that economic prosperity they are looking forward to. Finally. I think what has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Dayton Accordsfor all of its flaws. it is a model we can look to as we are looking at the challenges we face in Syria. The Bosniaks. the Serbs. the Croatians. the Muslims. the Orthodox Christians. and the Roman Catholics all came together and they agreed to end the conflict in Bosnia. They agreed to try to build a successful democracy and a strong economy to create a successful multiethnic. multisectarian state under very difficult circumstances. And while we need to continue to look at how the Dayton Accords should change. it is still a milestone in what happened with that conflict and I think serves as a model for so many other regions in the world where there is conflict.",

That is why I am introducing the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success. or APLUS. Act. By shifting control back to the states. individual and effective solutions can be created to address the multitude of unique challenges facing schools across the country. Through these \"laboratories of democracy.\" Americans can watch and learn how students can benefit when innovative reforms are implemented on the local level. The APLUS Act would give states greater flexibility in allocating federal education funding and ensuring academic achievement in their schools. With APLUS. States would be freed from unworkable teacher standards. Washingtonknowsbest performance metrics. and onerous Federal testing requirements that have failed to bring about promised improvements in academic achievement.

As the challenges facing our service members change. we must work to ensure that our laws continue to keep pace. In this regard. I have worked with my colleagues over the years to strengthen the protections for service members and their families under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act. SCRA. Today. I am joined by Senator GRAHAM in introducing on a bipartisan basis legislation to further enhance SCRA protections. The SCRA Rights Protection Act seeks to protect service members from being forced to accept mandatory arbitration clauses as part of everyday transactions. such as those relating to mortgage origination. automobile leases. and student loans. Often service members sign contracts that include arbitration clauses buried in the fine print. and this eliminates their access to the courts. which can limit their ability to assert their rights and reach a fair resolution. In disputes involving SCRA rights. this bill would make arbitration clauses unenforceable unless all parties consent to arbitration after the dispute arises. and would also ensure that service members retain their right to join with other service members to file a case together as a class. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this improvement to the SCRA. which will better protect our military families while the men and women of our Armed Forces protect our nation.",

Today. older Americans are living longer than ever. Unfortunately. more seniors are also developing chronic illnesses. Among the most prevalent of these illnesses is diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 11.2 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with diabetes. Diabetes is a costly medical condition/disease that can lead to heart disease. blindness. kidney disease. amputations. and even death. This is especially true in Ohio. where. according to 2013 data from the Ohio Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. it is estimated that 10.4 percent of the State has diabetes. exceeding the national average of 9.3 percent. Nationally. one out of five older Americans with diabetes have vision problems. and peopie with diabetes over age 75 are twice as likely to visit the emergency room for low blood sugar. Diabetes is especially acute for African American adults who are 80 percent more likely than nonHispanic white adults to be diagnosed with this disease. Medicare spends one out of every three dollars on people with diabetes. We owe it to our nations seniors to improve diabetes prevention. detection. and treatment. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Diabetes. I am proud to work to advance legislation such as the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Act of 2015. H.R. 2102. the Minority Diabetes Initiative Act. H.R. 4209. and the National Diabetes Clinical Care Commission Act. H.R. 1192. to help curb the effects of diabetes. Congress must make diabetes prevention and care a priority and enact legislation that would improve the health and wellbeing of all of our nations seniors.",

Following a landmark victory reaffirming treatyprotected fishing rights. the Tribes created the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission to assist them in developing biologically sound fisheries and restore the salmon runs that sustained their people for centuries. The interconnectedness of habitats and ecological systems throughout the Puget Sound region means that Tribal participation is vital to all aspects of natural resource management in the Pacific Northwest. E1384 To that end. NWIFC provides a forum for member Tribes to jointly address natural resource management issues and enables Tribes to speak with a unified voice on issues of mutual concern.

The Puget Sound Partnership is the agency of Washington state serving as the backbone organization for Puget Sound recovery. The Partnership coordinates the efforts of citizens. governments. tribes. scientists. businesses and nonprofits to set priorities. implement a regional recovery plan. and ensure accountability for results. It is this kind of cooperative effort that can turn back the tide of degrading habitats and changing ocean chemistry. and I commend the Partnership for taking on the mantle of leadership in this vital mission. The Puget Sound is not only a national environmental treasure. it is the centerpiece of our cultural identity and economic strength in the Pacific Northwest. If habitats continue to degrade and our cool. clean water is jeopardized by changing ocean conditions. we will lose much of what makes the Puget Sound and Washington state so special. That is why I have worked closely with the Puget Sound Partnership and its Executive Director. Sheida Sahandy. to bring their model of cooperative. coordinated recovery to federal agencies through the Promoting Unified Government Efforts To Save Our Sound Act. or the PUGET SOS Act. This bill is a significant first step to bring more federal attention to bear on Puget Sound recovery. and I sincerely thank the Partnerships staff for their assistance and advice in crafting this important piece of legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to fast track authority and the Trade Act of 2015. Passage of this legislation today will undermine Congresss constitutional authority to regulate trade and. I fear. accelerate the deindustrialization of our great country. The Constitution is very clear that it is Congress. and Congress alone. that has the power to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations.\" Passage of fast track. which grants the Executive Branch authority over how and when legislation must be considered by Congress. undermines our chambers very ability to effectively regulate foreign commerce. I share the concerns of many Members and middle class families in Texas and around the country about the TransPacific PartnershipTPPthis megatrade deal we are negotiating with Japan. Vietnam. and other countries. To this date. Congress has been left in the dark as to whats in TPP. let alone made public to the American people. We are told that TPP will help American businesses export billions of dollars of manufactured and services each year and has labor and environmental protections that all countries will have to abide by. But we simply dont know because we havent seen the text. What I do know is that these socalled free trade deals have displaced millions of middle class jobs to developing countries over the past 20 years. Our district in Houston and Harris County. Texas saw firsthand the consequences of free trade when five plants moved to Mexico in the years immediately after we joined NAFTA. If TPP benefits the American people as much its supporters say. it doesnt need fast track. It canand shouldbe considered under regular order and give Congress and the American people the time to debate the merits of this trade agreement. the largest our country has ever negotiated. Mr. Speaker. I call on Members from both sides of the aisle to stand with Americas working families and small businesses and to vote no on fast track.",

When we have huge tariffs on some of the products we try and export around the world. it makes it noncompetitive. This will send. again. a very strong signal the U.S. is ready to compete. it is not going to be pushed around on trade. and TPA will be a good tool to do that. However. it is not TPP. which we havent had much input on lately. and is very difficult to get at.

Ms. Korinna Brown of Bunker Hill has just been named one of the top honorees in Indiana by the 2015 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. an annual honor bestowed upon the most impressive student volunteers in every state. including the District of Columbia. Ms. Brown is being recognized for her passion of volunteer service that began with her diagnosis of primary immune deficiency at age six. Since that time. she has raised $150.000 through organizing Relay for Life teams and creating the iroK Foundation in 2009 to help support children diagnosed with cancer and blood diseases. Given the challenges we face today. it is vital that we encourage and recognize the kind of selfless contributions that these young citizens have made. Young volunteers like Ms. Brown are inspiring examples to all of us. and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. The program that brought this young role model to our attentionThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awardswas created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995. It is used to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and highly valued. and inspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 20 years. the program has become the nations largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service. and has honored more than 100.000 young volunteers at the local. state and national level. Ms. Brown should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this years program. I heartily applaud Ms. Brown for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live. and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. She has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in todays world. and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans canand doplay important roles in our communities. and continue to hold tremendous promise for our future.",

Contrary to opponents claims. the RHNDAA does not violate religious freedom protections.

RFRA prohibits the government from \"substantially burden[ing] a persons exercise of religion\" unless the government can demonstrate that the burden is justified by a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. RFRA is not triggered when there is just \"the slightest obstacle to religious exercise.\" And. burdens are permissible when the governments interest is important. including combatting discrimination. The bill does not compel any employer to endorse any actions that may be in conflict with their religious tenets. This act merely ensures that employees and their families face no employment consequences for their private health care decisions. Eradicating employment discrimination against women is a compelling government interest and there is no less restrictive means of preventing discrimination. Furthermore. this bill protects women who choose to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to make \"personal choice[s] in matters of marriage and family life.\" Business owners are absolutely entitled to their religious beliefsbut they cannot use their beliefs to justify discrimination against their employees. The RHNDAA would make sure that employees and their families can make their own private health decisions. based on their own consciences and in consultation with their own physicians. without fear of losing their job. Finally. its important to remember that the RHNDAA does not override existing protections for religious employers in hiring. The D.C. Human Rights Act already contains an exemption for employers \"operated. supervised. or controlled by or in connection with a religious . . . organization\" to give preference or limit employment to those of the same faith. Moreover. as the Supreme Court held in HosannaTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. E.E.O.C.. the First Amendment protects religious institutions right to make decisions about employees in ministerial positions -those who preach and teach the faith.

It is imperative that this body adopt this resolution of disapproval to ensure the protections granted to each and every American by the First Amendment of our Constitution. As a matter of fact. folks tried to say what this resolution would do. It is a very simple resolution. It is a 1page resolution. It has a few sentences to it. and I would like to just read those sentences. It is \"disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Reproductive Health NonDiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014.\" That is simply what it does. We have the constitutional authority to give an upordown vote. We are not amending. If this resolution of disapproval is adopted by this body. it simply will put back into place what is already law in the District of Columbia. It will not be taking away any rights. I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it is simply shocking that in this day and age employees are still being discriminated against because of their reproductive health choices. such as whether or not to use birth control. undergo in vitro fertilization to get pregnant. or for having sex without being married. The Council of the District of Columbia recently passed a law protecting D.C. women and families from such discrimination. making it clear that they cannot be penalized or retaliated against because of the employees personal reproductive health care choices. The District of Columbia Reproductive Health NonDiscrimination Amendment Act takes a stand and makes a statement that this sort of discrimination will not be tolerated in the District of Columbia. The House Majority wants to overturn the D.C. Councils law. H.J. Res. 43 is not only a slap in the face of the women of D.C. but also to their families. It affects whether people can chose to wait to have children. have children at all. and when they can or cannot have sex. Frankly. its none of our business. Is there anything more private than someones childbearing decisions? Than who to get intimate with? In a country that will spend $166 million on the movie 50 Shades of Grey. the Republican Majority thinks imposing their own Puritanical ideology and theology on District residents is acceptable? House Republicans constantly argue for limiting the power of the federal government and to respect the rights of the state and local governments. However. once again. they feel it is necessary to usurp the decision that the D.C. government unanimously voted on for its own citizens. Do unto others but dont do unto me. That is about as hypocritical as you can get. Madam Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res. 43 and to support D.C.s local government and the women of D.C. to make their own reproductive choices.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to House Joint Resolution 43 to overturn the D.C. Reproductive Health NonDiscrimination Amendment Act. To be clear. this Resolution is not about protecting freedom of religion and beliefs. No. House Joint Resolution 43 is about allowing discrimination. Despite misleading rhetoric. this Resolution would allow an employer to discriminate against an employee based on the employees personal health care decisionsdecisions which have nothing to do with the employer. Everyone should have the ability to make private health decisions including whether. when. and how to start a family. without fear of losing their jobs or facing retribution from employers. The D.C. Council understands this and. by passing the Reproductive Health NonDiscrimination Amendment Act. seeks to ensure fair and necessary employment protections for the people of the District of Columbia. The Council deserves our respect when protecting the rights of their constituents . . . the people who elected them. The oversight of this body should not extend to overturning legislation passed by democraticallyelected representatives of the people of D.C. The freedom of religion is a fundamental freedom established by our founding fathers that we should fiercely protect. but to suggest that it extends to employers imposing their beliefs on the people that work for them. as this Resolution does. is just plain WRONG. particularly when it comes to something as personal as reproductive health.",

Seventeen students competed on the core team. however. 85 students from Galena High School contributed to 21 projects that continue to develop as a result of the contest.

This money will be used to purchase new technology for the high school. a contribution that will help future students for years to come. Galena High School students chose to address difficulties faced by fellow peers with disabilities. Specifically. they worked alongside two students with disabilities to bring firsthand experience and realistic application to the project. The students utilized their STEM knowledge to create innovative equipment capable of adapting to difficult scenarios relating to those with disabilities and motor skill restrictions. The students spent hours researching current technology and worked tirelessly. brainstorming and creating solutions to different scenarios and ultimately chose two successful projects. The first. a tool to help specialneeds students with typing. and the second. a portable table space making it easier for students with disabilities to carry lunch. These are only 2 of 21 projects that continue to develop and will be distributed to the local community. The students are shining examples of how compassion and hard work can make a difference in the lives of others and stand as role models for future Galena Grizzlies.

My colleagues in the Majority often claim to be opposed to government spending they describe as \"wasteful.\" But this bill is the epitome of wasteful spending. By permanently repealing the estate tax. without any additional revenue whatsoever to cover the losses. it increases our nations deficit by almost $270 billion. Make no mistaketax breaks are spending. Moreover. this bill spends money on those who need it least. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation. only the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates will benefit at all. and almost three quarters of the benefits will go to estates worth more than $20 million. For every rich estate that reaps the benefits of this bill. there are ten thousand of our fellow citizens living in poverty. Yet the same House Majority that now supports this bill also passed a budget last month that would cut $125 billion from food stamps and kick up to 20 million Americans off Medicaidall at a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet. Talk about misplaced priorities. Madam Speaker. instead of spending hundreds of billions on a tax break for a wealthy elite. we should be directing more assistance to those who are in genuine need.

This unanimous decision sparked the movement toward desegregation of American institutions and paved the way for the civil rights movement. On the anniversary of this landmark decision. it is appropriate that we pay tribute to our ancestors who endured and lived through those days of crisis and challenge so that we could enjoy the right to vote. the right to equal protection of the law. and to enjoy the blessings of liberties. This historic case originated in Topeka. Kansas. and involved a black thirdgrader named Linda Brown. who had to walk one mile through a railroad switchyard to get to her black elementary school. even though a white elementary school was only seven blocks away. Lindas father. Oliver Brown. tried to enroll her in the white elementary school. but the principal of the school refused. Brown went to McKinley Burnett. the head of Topekas branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and asked for help.",

In talking about the families. like Ms. Garcias from my district. we really know that. especially during a campaign season or when there is rhetoric on the floor. the words that those of us in elected office say matter. I found that out firsthand as I talked to some of the families in my district who have mixed status children who turn on to VTV and see some of our national politicians rail against them. I asked permission to use stories from some of our families here today. In the past. it has always been very customary that they have said. \"Yes. If it will help to share my story. please share it with the American people. The American people will understand that I want to be with my child. What is more family oriented than that?\" Those are the values of the people. Yet. when I asked over the last few days and when my staff asked. there were many families who said no to having their stories told on the House floor. Why? Because major. national political figures. like Donald Trump. are running for higher office and are trying to win votes by promising that they will do everything in their power to break up families like Ms. Garcias. They promise to do everything in their power to rip apart our communities at the core. to separate American children from one or both parents. By any means necessary. they say. we will deport mothers and fathers of American children. We are better than that. Mr. Speaker. We are better than that. DAPA and DACA are an enormous step forward.",

He acted within his legal authoritysomething I am confident the Court will affirm. He acted because it would have been inhumane not to do anything while families were being torn apart by our broken immigration policies and this Congress failure to act. The Democraticcontrolled Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill in June of 2013. and House Republicans did nothing for more than 500 days before President Obama resorted to the power of his pen.

Today. the House Republicans brought a polarizing resolution to the floor authorizing the Speaker to file an antiimmigrant amicus brief with the Supreme Court opposing these executive actions.

As cochair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force.

I rise in strong opposition to House Resolution 639. which would allow the Speaker to file an amicus brief on behalf of the entire House of Representatives in United States v. Texas. This case deals with critical executive actions implementing immigration initiatives that will strengthen our communities. protect the dignity of families. enhance public safety and national security. raise average wages for U.S.-born workers. and grow our economy by tens of billions of dollars. Unfortunately. the majority opposes these initiatives and now seeks to influence this pending appeal before the Supreme Court. I oppose this resolution for several reasons. First. it is entirely unnecessary. Earlier this month. 185 of my colleagues and I filed an amicus brief in this case with the Supreme Court. And other individual Members of this body are already free to file their own amicus briefs as well. The Speaker. however. has chosen to expend legislative time on this measure instead of focusing on what Americans truly care about. Americans are worried about jobs. about overwhelming student loan debt. and in my State. the safety of the drinking water. Another problem with this resolution is that it authorizes the filing of an amicus brief on behalf of the entire House of Representatives in United States v. Texas when in fact it would not reflect the views of the entire legislative body. The amicus brief authorized pursuant to House Resolution 639 would represent the views of only the Republican majority. The majority should not be able to bind the minority to this illconceived and misleading undertaking. Finally. we have already thoroughly debated the constitutionality of the Presidents executive actions and it is clear that the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration programs are lawful exercises of executive discretion. Presidents from both parties. including George H.W. Bush and Ronald Regan. have routinely used similar deferred deportation policies to promote family unity in our immigration system. These programs are commonsense solutions to our broken immigration system that has divided families for decades. The Supreme Court is the proper venue to resolve this issue. and I am confident the Court will find these actions consistent with the law and the Constitution. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill conceived and wasteful resolution.",

Res. 639 is an unprecedented measure by the House Majority to make its opposition to deferred action the official policy of the United States House of Representatives. A resolution offering the full House to file an amicus has never been done before. Last week. I proudly joined 222 congressional colleagues in sending a amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of immigrant communities and deferred action. House Republicans are welcome to do the very same. However. to send a brief in the name of the full House and the American people is unprecedented and unwarranted. DAPA. Deferred Action for Parental Accountability. and expanded DACA. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. created by the Presidents 2014 Executive Order. would give over 5 million immigrants living in our country todayincluding an estimated 182.000 immigrants living in Harris County. Texasthe opportunity to no longer live in fear and a shot at the American Dream. The Presidents Executive Order that created DAPA and expands DACA is entirely within the Department of Homeland Securitys legal authority to grant or deny applications for deferred action. Congress has explicitly passed laws delegating broad immigration enforcement authority to the Executive Branch. There is a strong historical precedent for DAPA: During the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. deferred action was granted to hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the 1980s and early 1990s. All of this would be completely unnecessary. Mr. Speaker. if the House Majority had stood with the American people in the last Congress and passed comprehensive immigration reform. Instead. we will be voting on an unprecedented resolution that has little. if anything. to do with fixing our nations broken immigration system and everything to do with the political season. I sincerely hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. many of whom I have worked with for years and consider good friends. will not allow the Peoples House. or their party. to adopt the antiimmigrant views of Donald Trump. Mr. Trumps demagoguery and fearmongering against immigrants who came to this country for a better lifejust like our forefathers and foremothers before usmust not be allowed to become the sanctioned policy of Congress.

The headline reads: \"CBO: Health law will cost less than expected.\" It says: \"President Obamas healthcare law will cost taxpayers substantially less than previously estimated. congressional budget officials said Monday. in an upbeat note for a program that has faced withering criticism since its passage five years ago.\" I would just note here that the opposition has come from my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House. They voted 67 times to repeal it in the House. Of course. each time it has failed. Continuing on in this article. it says: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office attributed the savings to spending on medical care in coming years that will not be as great as previously forecast. As a result. the agency said. insurers are not expected to charge Americans as much for coverage. and the government will save on subsidies for low- and moderateincome people. Whats more. the CBO has concluded that companies are not canceling health insurance policies as often as had been anticipated earlier this year. Fewer Americans consequently are planning to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. generating more taxpayer savings. In total. the healthcare law will cost taxpayers . . . 11 percent less over the next decade than estimated in January. The cost of providing subsidies for people to buy insurance on the state and federal marketplaces the centerpiece of the law will be 20 percent lower than projected.

In addition. the legislation allows wiretaps obtained through state courts to be used for child sex trafficking. trains federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution. and trains law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). at least 100.000 American children each year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. Women and children. especially girls. are also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease. anonymity. and impunity. This happens in every city. in every state.

They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers pay for the prison. whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for the prisons. but there is no money for the victims. What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked about up to $30 million. I think. in fines. but lets suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise to these victims that cant be met? Is there an alternative for them in case the fines dont pay for it?",

I certainly look forward to supporting this bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment. but I obviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill. Clearly. this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. It takes many forms. all of them ugly. One form is a phenomenon I am going to talk about today. which is the issue of birth tourism and trafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in order to physically have their children in this country because present policy recognizes those children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they were born in this country. This phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one. and it often puts these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations. quite frankly. at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent to have two news reports which illustrate this phenomenon printed in the RECORD. The first news report is an article entitled \"No vacancy at California birth hotels.\" which underscores some of the abuses and horrendous conditions that go on as a result of this. and the second article is from the Washington Post. which is entitled \"Inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at maternity hotels.\"",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from California for sharing his experience as a medical doctor and as someone who stands with Planned Parenthood. Thank you for joining us. Congressman Ruiz raises an interesting point about looking at our system of health care. Part of the proposal from the Republicans is that this is easy. that we can simply take the money from Planned Parenthood and give it to community health centers. but there is simply not the capacity in the system to handle these extra patients. Currently. more than half of Medicaid providers are not offering appointments to new Medicaid patients. but twothirds of the States report difficulty in ensuring enough providers. including OB/GYN care. Madam Speaker. this hurts lowincome women especially hard because 60 percent of Planned Parenthood patients access care through Medicaid and/or Title X. and 35 percent of women view their OB/GYN as their main source of care. So what we are talking about here is not abortion. but womens health care. preventative measures that save lives. We know that over 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are preventative. We know that they serve underserved areas. We know that there isnt enough capacity to see these patients in other settings and that eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood would mean over 390.000 patients would no longer receive health care. If all of this sounds crazy to you. you are not alone. It is why I came down here tonight. and I thank my colleagues who joined me. It is time that we reveal the falsehoods of this argument and defeat these effortsthese radical effortsthat are threatening to shut down our government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. which carries so much of our healthcare system for women in this country and especially for lowincome women. It is time we stand up. debunk the lies and the mysteries that we are being told. and let women have the healthcare access that they need and deserve. Madam Speaker.

The share of people without coverage dropped in every State in the Union in 2014. That is the first time in the history of the Census reports that every State has improved. States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act did better than those that did not. States that adopted the new laws Medicaid expansion had a 3.5percentagepoint drop in their uninsured rate. That is about 11/2 times the 2.3percentagepoint decline in States that did not expand the program. Overall. the national uninsured rate dropped by 2.9 percentage points.

    "speech": "Colleagues. before the next vote. Senator ANGUS KING and I wish to make a couple of observations for a few moments. Former Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith was once known for a nearly unbeatable attendance record. She hadnt missed a single rollcall vote in more than 13 years of service. but that came to an end one day in 1968 when Senator Smith narrowly missed casting her 2.942d consecutive vote. She had been recovering from surgery hundreds of miles away from here. So it was understandable. Yet I am not sure if surgery. a Tsunami or the most wicked Maine noreaster could stop a woman who occupies Margaret Chase Smiths seat today because not only is the senior Senator from Maine a fierce admirer of her pioneering predecessor. she is also nearly unstoppable once she puts her mind to something. and we have all experienced that. Since assuming her seat in 1997. one of those somethings that she is so fixated on has been to never miss a single vote. She blew past her idols record nearly a decade ago. The senior Senator then marched on to 3.000 consecutive votes. 4.000. 5.000. and the next vote will be her 6.000th vote in a row. Only two other Senators have ever achieved a longer unbroken streak. Former Senator Proxmire took 10.252 consecutive votes. and our colleague. the senior Senator from Iowa. has voted more than 7.440 times in a row. This means our colleague from Maine hasnt missed a single vote during her entire Senate tenure. She has not had one sick day in more than 18 years. It is really remarkable. and so are the tales of what it took to get here. One time she twisted her ankle as she tore down a corridor. sprinting back to the Capitol from a readytodepart plane. Just ask her about the logistics of planning a wedding and honeymoon around the recess calendar. Our colleague is willing to do just about anything to ensure that she is here in this Chamber representing the people of Maine. I ask the entire Senate to join me in congratulating her as she celebrates this notable milestone.",

In addition. the new law will encourage the donation of food to food banks from local businesses as well as promote environmental conservation through the granting of land easements. Mr. Speaker. there are many Americans who want to give back and help others. and it is important that our Tax Code reflect these same values and doesnt punish them for wanting to do so. Each of these provisions help make that possible.",

Mr. McCreary was a member of the famous Tuskegee Airmen. He flew almost 100 combat missions over Europe in his redtailed P51 fighter plane during World War II. In 1944. he was shot down and spent 9 months as a POW. After the war. he was assigned to Lockbourne Army Airfield. now known as Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in Columbus. Ohio. In 2007. the Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Their exemplary combat record and honorable service are rightfully credited as the driving force for the full integration of our armed services. Walter McCreary lived his life with courage. bravery. and honor. I extend my condolences to his family. and honor the legacy of both him and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen. Mr. Speaker.

I continue to be inundated by grave concerns raised by families and businesses in my district. One individual wrote to me and summed it up this way: \"Mr. BISHOP. the Affordable Care Act is anything but.\" He explained that his family of four went from an overall $5.000 deductible to having the same deductible per family member in addition to having his premium doubled. \"Where is the affordability?\" he asked. Another smallbusiness owner from the small town of Fowlerville in my district called the other month to say that her rates for her family had more than doubled in just the past 2 years.

Not only does this bill represent Republicans 62nd attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. but it is yet another ideological attack on womens health care. It would defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year. preventing millions of women from accessing critical healthcare services. such as cancer and STI screenings and contraceptive care. In 2013 alone. Planned Parenthood provided healthcare services to more than 800.000 Californians and provided more than 93.000 pap tests and 97.000 breast screening exams. Although Planned Parenthood centers make up only 10 percent of all publicly funded family planning centers. they serve. mind you. 36 percent of clients who obtain care from the family planning center network. Denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned Parenthood will harm the communities that need these services the most. including lowincome women and women of color. Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker. this afternoon will mark the llth vote to attack womens health care this Congress. It is past time for Republicans to end their attacks on Planned Parenthood and recognize that they are really harming women by denying them these badly needed healthcare services. I hope my colleagues will vote \"no\" on H.R. 3762 and really begin to look at what they are doing in terms of the freedom of women to make their own decisions and to really access the vital healthcare services that they need. Again. this reconciliation act does nothing to reconcile healthcare services. which women desperately need in our country.",

I cannot stress strongly enough my opposition to this plan. The reasons are numerous. but let me emphasize two of the most obvious: military bases are not appropriate for housing unaccompanied children. and unaccompanied children are not appropriate residents of a military base. The last Congress clearly expressed our opposition to housing unoccupied minors at military installations through the passage of H.R. 5230. Additionally. funding sufficient to meet the needs at the southern border was provided just a few weeks ago in the passage of the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill.

Forcing Americans to jump through more hoops and spend more money to exercise their Second Amendment rights will. at best. have zero effect on public safety and. at worst. embolden those who already disregard our laws. Finally. lets look at what the Presidents proposal boils down to. More Americans would have to pay more to the Federal Government in fees to exercise their constitutional rights. Enforcement of current laws could have a much better effect on that. yet we see very few red flags that are put up by people trying to legally purchase guns that are already felons. More investigations would be held and more people prosecuted if those laws were enforced. yet our attorneys general at the State level and Federal level dont follow up on those red flags.

Every weekend. it seemed. while he was teaching. we would hear stories and personal experiences of children who desperately needed help to get the education that they needed so they had any chance. any hope. of being successful in life. And. finally. I am also the father of six children. I understand in a deeply personal way how important it is that we teach our children and educate our children.

That is what the SOAR program is about: giving all of our children the opportunity to succeed. So lets look at the program and see what it has accomplished. Since 2004. more than 6.000 children have had the opportunity to attend a private school of their choice. This has changed the trajectory of their lives. More than 90 percent of them now graduate from high school. compared with 58 percent throughout the rest of Washington. D.C. Eightyeight percent of them go on to a 2- or a 4year university.

Mr. Speaker. the short answer to the gentleman who wants to know why would we want to take away vouchers from these children is that we dont want to take vouchers away from these children. We want those who are currently in the program to maintain their voucher until they graduate. But I should caution Members on both sides about voting for $100 million for a private school voucher program for a District that didnt ask for it while the Republican majority has pending a $2 billion cut for K12 education for kids in their own districts. The irony is that. when Newt Gingrich was Speaker. he first proposed private school vouchers. but as conservative as he was. he worked with me on a home rule public charter school alternative. The D.C. Council had voted for charter schools. but there were only two or three fledgling schools and charters werent going anywhere. Today. Mr. Speaker. there are 115 public charter schools in the District. and the reason is that. with my support. Speaker Gingrich placed H.R. 3019 in the 19951996 omnibus legislation establishing the D.C. public charter school board. Today almost half of D.C. students go to publicly accountable charter schools. and most of these schools have long waiting lists. That. my friend. is what choice looks like. Another speaker has now stepped forward with a private school voucher program to be authorized for the third time today. although the evaluation that Congress mandated definitively shows that the program failed to meet its stated goal to help children improve. Vouchers did not improve math or reading scores for the children from lowincome neighborhoods in this program. and that was the reason for the bill in the first place. In light of that failure. I offered a compromise. and the President supports it. All of the students in the current voucher program would remain until graduation. but no new students would be funded. That would mean years of private school vouchers. but only in the District of Columbia. because this Congress has just voted down similar private school vouchers for the Nation.",

Mr. Speaker. it is one of those things that I think that we have to find a bipartisan solution to identify the problem areas. perhaps. that need to be addressed. but to also come alongside those parents. both fathers and mothers. who were there in the hearing who were applauding the successes of their children. It is with great pride that I strongly support H.R. 10. I encourage my colleagues opposite to do the same. I am committed to working through some of those issues that they have addressed.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in support of the rule and urge specific passage of H.R. 10. the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. Over 10 years ago Congress took action to give the children of the District a handup through access to a quality education by creating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. I was heavily involved at that time. as a Member of the House Appropriations Committee that oversaw the Districts budget. and our committee provided the initial funds. The program was the first and only initiative in America where the Federal Government provides lowincome families with funds to send their children where they will have a chance to thriveprivate or parochial schoolsbecause. in some cases. some D.C. schools were not providing that opportunity. That is not all schools. but some schools. We all know the story of some District of Columbia public schoolslow graduation rates. high dropout rates. low math and reading scoresthat need to do better. We can all agree that all children in the District deserve a firstclass education and the lifelong benefits that come from that education. whether it be public. private. parochial. or charter. The bill before us today will reauthorize the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program for 5 years. By the way. the program is a huge success. Last year over 3.600 students submitted applications and the program enrolled nearly 1.500 students. Through these scholarships. District children have flourished. In 2014. 88 percent of high school graduates who were enrolled in the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program enrolled in 2- or 4year colleges. a very high mark. Mr. Speaker. Congress should listen to the voices of parents. as we did 10 years ago. who want their children to succeed. and we should continue to work to ensure that the program not only survives. but that it grows. I commend Speaker BOEHNER for all his years of leadership on behalf of the children of Washington not only in terms of his support for this legislation. but many things he does as a private citizen. I urge my colleagues to join in support of the rule and this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. These are crucial bills. They make significant progress on two important issues: addressing our fiscal crisis in a responsible manner and the education of our next generation. We cannot squander the incredible wealth this country has built over decades of hard work by the American people. The full faith and credit of the United States is not ours here. as Members of Congress. It is theirs. the American people. We are the reserve currency because individuals across the world look to us for prudent fiscal choices and rocksteady resolve in our principles and integrity. There are few debates more contentious in this body than those over spending levels or the leverage points that our system provides to exert control over those levels. The Default Prevention Act would enable us to continue to fight tooth and nail over the right direction for our countrys finances while giving Americans and financial markets certainty that they can remain confident in the Federal Government meeting its obligations. We can and should stay up late at night and have passionate debates in this Chamber over how to address mandatory spending. but we shouldnt allow retired and disabled Americans to stay up late at night because they fear their Social Security checks wont arrive. The Default Prevention Act is commonsense legislation to remove catastrophe as a possibility by enabling the Secretary of the Treasury to issue debt necessary to make principal and interest payments on the national debt and pay Social Security benefits in full. It is the right first step in beginning a conversation about how to constructively address our immense fiscal challenges. If we dont address those challenges. we will be unable to provide for other important programs. such as the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. or SOAR Reauthorization Act. which this resolution provides for consideration of as well. As any parent knows. the education of our children is one of our highest priorities. For far too long children in Washington. D.C.. have not received the education they deserve. but have suffered from unacceptable achievement levels in graduation rates.",

Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Ketner family as they mourn the loss of this great man. Never one to shy away from a challenge. Mr. Ketner learned early on the value of a hard days work. receiving a single penny for each chicken he plucked at his familys house. While it was far from glorious work. that never bothered Mr. Ketner and he used the lessons from those early days to launch one of the most successful grocery store chains in the country. In 1957. Ralph Ketner opened the first Food Town store in Salisbury. North Carolina. When the store initially opened. it struggled to differentiate itself from the competition E891 until he took a major risk and began an aggressive price cutting program. However. the risk paid off and the results were revolutionary. With the rallying cry of \"Lowest Food Prices in North Carolina.\" Mr. Ketner went from having one store to owning one of the largest grocery franchises. Even though his professional accomplishments are outstanding. Mr. Ketners proudest achievements came in what he was able to give back to the community through his many philanthropic works. During his lifetime. he never forgot to thank those that made it all possible and helped whenever he could. After the success of Food Lion. Mr. Ketner donated millions of dollars to support various education projects including the development of the business school at Catawba College which now proudly bears his name. Ralph Ketner was a remarkable man known for his dedication. passion. and kindness. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who does not speak of him with the utmost respect and admiration. I will always cherish the time I spent with Mr. Ketner. I will never forget his friendship. humor. and sound advice. While we mourn the loss of Mr. Ketner. there is no doubt that his legacy will live on through not only his professional success but also the countless lives he was able to touch.

It is the law of the land. We will uphold the law of the land and do our work based upon those numbers. Now. the question you had before me was dealing with what we referred to House Administration. I have met with the chair and I have met with Members on the gentlemans side of the aisle. We have nothing scheduled for next week. but we are currently working towards solving this. to me. a very serious and sensitive issue. and I look forward to getting it done and working with you to make it happen.",

It is our intention to be able to have that. We have a plan. I believe. we are working towards. and the first step was extending highways to the December 18 date.

For years. the Turkish LGBT community and their supporters have been able to partake in one of the few permitted pride parades in the Muslim world. but this year this peaceful parade was broken up when police dispersed the parade with tear gas. rubber bullets. and water cannons. reminiscent of the worst full countertactics of the American civil rights movement. LGBT pride gatherings are peaceful. focusing on love and solidarity and the human rights of all people. including LGBT people. which is a stark contrast to the unnecessary and brutal violence endured by those paradegoers. This past May I had the opportunity to visit the brave LGBT activists in Turkey and to speak to them about their hopes for a better community. As a member of the LGBT community and of the Congressional Equality Caucus. I am deeply disturbed by the way in which such a positive festival was received by the Turkish Government. Turkey has long expressed. by its commitments to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. its dedication to freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. Turkey is a NATO ally. Its actions are at odds with these previous commitments to freedom. I am urging this Congress to join me in condemning these actions.

This 92mile stretch of lake. shore. and river is a shining example of the dedication of the people of Maine to protect and preserve the natural beauty and heritage that define our great State. For thousands of years. the Allagash was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Wabanaki. and the rivers northerly flow provided an important transportation link between the Maine coast and the Saint John River. The Waterways Native American heritage is found in such appellations as Umsaskis Lake and Musquacook Stream. In 1857. Henry David Thoreau explored the upper reaches of the Allagash during his third trip to the Maine woods and learned from his Penobscot guide that the rivers name referred to the useful bark that could be harvested from the vast forests along its banks. In the years that followed. the Allagash became a vital part of Maines timber industry. While hiking through the regions remote wilderness. it is possible to come upon abandoned steam locomotives deep among the trees. remnants of the vast lumbering operations of the early 20th century. As the Allagash. rich with fish and game. became a favorite destination of outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. the surrounding woodlands have remained very much a part of Maines working forest economy. In 1966. the people of Maine recognized the special qualities of the Allagash and voted to protect it by approving a $1.5 million bond to \"develop the maximum wilderness character\" of the river. and the Maine Legislature established the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. Two years later. Maine Senator Edmund Muskie authored an amendment to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 that combined permanent Federal protection with permanent State administration. In 1970. the Allagash Wilderness Waterway was granted Federal designation as a wild river and became the first Stateadministered component of the National Wild and Scenic River System. The Allagash Wilderness Waterway captures the essence of the great north woods. This 50th anniversary is the time to celebrate the commitment to safeguard for generations to come this special place that captures the essence of the people of Maine.",

Val was a part of the 200 ships sitting in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese surrendered and ended the war. After the war. Val served as a sawmill operator and business owner in Belgrade. The city of Belgrade owes thanks to Val for his part in constructing the Catholic church and the goalposts for the Belgrade High School football field. Val was also the entrepreneur behind the first fourplex housing unit in Belgrade. Together. Val and his wife. Betsy. have raised nine children. four of whom inherited the talent and building trades from their father. Today their children continue his legacy by working on construction projects all over the world. However. out of all of his achievements. his children are his pride and joy. On July 23. 2016. Val will celebrate his 90th birthday. surrounded by family and friends. Thank you for the long hours and hard work that helped build Belgrade. MT. I am so grateful for all that you have done and all that your children continue to do. and I wish you a very happy birthday.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to recognize two of Nevadas brightest students. Athena TurekHankins and Daniel Saftner. on being selected as 2016 recipients of the Fulbright scholarship. The Fulbright Scholar Program was developed shortly after World War II by former U.S. Senator James William Fulbright to promote the exchange of students in the fields of education. culture. and science. Today the program offers 1.900 grants each year for students to study in various fields in more than 140 countries worldwide. As a highly competitive and prestigious scholarship. thousands of students and young professionals apply from across the country. I am proud to congratulate these two students on their achievement. These students are shining examples of how hard work leads to success. and they stand as role models for future members of the Nevada Wolf Pack. Ms. TurekHankins recently graduated from the University of Nevada. Reno. UNR. as an honors student and received her bachelors degree in international affairs with a special emphasis in Middle Eastern affairs. She also earned a bachelors degree in French and a minor in philosophy of ethics. law. and politics. Ms. TurekHankins will be teaching English in Luxembourg this coming fall through the Fulbright scholarship and will have the opportunity to expand her knowledge on European economics. Mr. Saftner received his bachelors degree from UNR in geology in 2011. His studies focused more specifically on climate change. He is currently pursuing his masters degree from the university in hydrogeology from the Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences. In addition. he spent 2 years in Cameroon. Africa. as a volunteer in the Peace Corps. His Fulbright scholarship will allow him the opportunity to return to Africa in Niger. West Africa. While there. Mr. Saftner will research the variations of groundwater quality in the rural areas of Southwest Niger and participate in a global effort to increase access to safe drinking water in developing countries. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these exceptional young Nevadans. I am proud to have them representing both Nevada and UNR as global ambassadors through the Fulbright scholarship. These students worked hard for this incredible opportunity. and I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.*",

Vanderburg Elementary School on its team of fifth grade students and facilitator selected as a national winner in the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program. SSEP. This team of students should be proud of its achievement as 1 of 11 national winners selected for the opportunity to have their experiment conducted on the International Space Station. Facilitator William Gilluly and student investigators Shani Abeyakoon. Kendall Allgower. and Avery Sanford created a winning proposal titled. \"Soybean Germination in Microgravity.\" The experiment seeks to gain further clarity on whether soybeans can be used as a vitamin and nutrientdense food source for astronauts during longterm space travel. The experiment is expected to be conducted on the space flight scheduled to take place in early 2017. During this time. astronauts will activate the experiment as the students conduct the same experiment on land. ultimately comparing the results to evaluate the effects of microgravity on the germination of seeds. SSEP is a national science. technology. engineering. and math educational program with the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education. which works to inspire future generations of scientists and engineers. I extend my sincerest congratulations to these Nevada students selected as winners of the SSEP competition. They stand as role models to future Vanderburg Elementary students of what hard work and determination can accomplish. I am excited to see local students bringing recognition to both Nevada and Vanderburg Elementary School for their advancement in a national competition. These students should be proud to call themselves top contenders in a competitive environment. I ask my colleagues to join me and all Nevadans in congratulating Vanderburg Elementary School for its success and honorable representation of Nevada.*",

The difference we had is that the hearingI understand there was a disagreement with the executive order. but I would hate for us to confuse the disagreement with the executive order with the action that we can do here in Congress. We had concluded this last year in the appropriations bill. the exact same language. to the best of my understanding. and I know that. since then. there has been an executive order that we are trying to have a conversation with the executive branch about. However. it is not fair to the contractors who abide by the law that. when you bid against someone who doesnt abide by the law because they are shortchanging their employees. that makes it an unfair practice. We think the bottom line is we should be protecting those good contractors. we should be protecting the employees who dont get their fair pay. and. despite any disagreement we might have with the executive branch. I think we should. at minimum. as a Congress. stand up for those workers and for those good contractors. Mr. Chairman. I have been in business for 28 years as a smallbusiness owner. I know that. when I bid on something. I want to know I am at a fair and even playing field. We are not making a fair playing field when you have this number of people who are getting violations who already get Federal contracts and are really getting a slap on the hand. $196 million in penalties versus 81 billion in taxpayer dollars in contracts awarded. Clearly. there is an imbalance. and that becomes a cost to business for a bad company. but you are punishing the good companies and the good workers by doing that.

Mr. Chairman. I am honored to represent the Fourth Congressional District of Texas. home to the Red River Army Depot. The depot has supported the warfighters since 1941. Although the depot community has weathered many changes over the years. their commitment to mission remains the same. It is reflected on the placard placed in each of the vehicles there which reads. \"We build it as if our lives depend on it. Theirs do.\" The Red River Army Depot is a vital job creator in northeast Texas. and it is a critical component of our national defense. Mr. Chairman. in this fiscal environment. we need to be careful stewards of taxpayer dollars and focus our limited resources on addressing critical national security objectives and military readiness. Having another round of BRAC wont help us achieve this goal. In fact. the Government Accountability Office reports that the last round of BRAC in 2005 cost the American taxpayers $35.1 billion. which was 67 percent more than the original cost estimate. At the same time. the expected savings from the last round of BRAC were 73 percent less than was advertised. Starting another round of BRAC would weaken our capabilities and increase our vulnerability in the face of the critical threats facing our Nation.

But a BRAC was included in the Presidents budget. and here we are today. Along with the gentleman from Texas. I am bringing this amendment and fighting against BRAC for two reasons: First. BRAC is not cost effective. As was mentioned. the 2005 BRAC was supposed to cost $21 billion. Just a few years later. it has now skyrocketed to $35 billion. On top of that. the savings were reduced by 73 percent. So it cost the taxpayers more and saved them less. Once more. the Department of Defense wont even recoup its upfront costs until 2018. 13 years after it started. And second. I oppose BRAC because it destroys local economies. I know this all too well as Fort Monmouth in my home State was shuttered in 2005. That area is still recovering from the loss. My district is home to Joint Base McGuireDixLakehurst. which is responsible for 105.000 local jobs in southern New Jersey. It is a $7 billion impact on just one local community. Like so many other military bases around the country. it is the backbone of our community. If it is closed. the area would be devastated. Spending more. saving less. ruining local economies. and reducing our military capability should not be done based on what we know today. In closing. I urge passage of this amendment.",

I offered a similar amendment that passed this body which prohibited funds from being used to create or to maintain unofficial recordkeeping systems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This year. I am proud. once again. to offer this commonsense policy with the support of my friend and colleague from Georgia. As many of you know. several whistleblowers came forward with allegations that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Healthcare System had been using secondary unofficial records of veterans claims and appointment requests to misrepresent the actual wait times that veterans faced as they sought health care. Some employees within the VA even received bonuses as a result of these manipulations. It is unfortunate that. over the past year. many of these once unthinkable allegations have become substantiated. Recently. an inspector generals investigation uncovered actual memos from VA leadership that encouraged this type of behavior. This is outrageous. The memo I speak of is known as the \"Fast Letter 1310.\" and it was handed down directly from the Office of the Director of Veterans Benefits Administration to the Philadelphia VA Regional Office. I am appalled but not totally surprised to learn of this memo. I have said this before. but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats dont use good judgment or common sense. Congress must address these issues. No matter what the investigation shows and no matter who was involved. this practice must be prevented in the future. This amendment would prohibit the practice of altering or falsifying veterans waittime data pursuant to the Fast Letter or any other purpose. We should have only one. uniform patient recordkeeping system within the VA in order to provide accountability as well as uniformity and to prevent employee manipulation.

The memo that was issued by the VA. commonly known as \"Fast Letter 1310.\" was a deliberate attempt to make VA bureaucrats appear as if they were delivering services and benefits to veterans faster than they really were. Through these internal actions. some VA offices were \"eliminating\" the backlog of benefit claims with a stroke of a pen. Just because you lie about the details does not make the problem disappear.

It has been almost 2 years since that planned activation was to begin operating. However. reports in our local media have indicated that there is additional engineering and that it is not functioning and not operational. Further. sections of the solar panels for this system are now being torn down in order to be relocated to make way for a parking deck that was planned before the installation had begun of the solar panels. Many questions remain unanswered about this project and when the VA plans to fully implement this supposed costsaving system to provide energy for the facility. Further. I found from the VAs own Web site a list of 40 key energy projects that are designated as \"works in progress\" by the VA under its key renewable energy program. Some of these date back to 2010. yet they have not been completed and have not been made operational. There are over 90 solar projects that have been funded under this program and 198 projects that have been funded under the VAs Green Management Program. Some of these projects individually have cost the taxpayers up to $20 million. The Little Rock project is only projected to save $150.000 annually in energy costs. which would make the payback on that $8 million investment some 50 years. On April 8. I sent a letter to Secretary McDonald. asking for answers about these solar systems. in Little Rock particularly. about the relocation of the panels at the facility. and about the activation date. Senator JOHN BOOZMAN and I have called for an IG investigation into this project and into other aspects of the key renewable energy program to ensure that the taxpayers hardearned dollars are safeguarded. This amendment would simply prevent any new funding for these projects this fiscal year. allowing Congress the additional time to conduct oversight and allowing the VA to ensure that this program is effective.

This legislation will have a direct impact on the constituents in the Eighth District because Indiana has more coal ash ponds than any other State. I was concerned that the EPAs final rule on coal combustion residuals lacked clarity and did not adequately address enforcement of the Federal minimum standards for public health and safety. H.R. 1734 fixes this by giving States like Indiana the authority to implement coal ash rules in a way that protects the environment. public health. and goodpaying jobs rather than totally deferring to bureaucrats in Washington. D.C. This legislation also reconfirms that recycling this nonhazardous material helps keep utility costs low. provides for lowcost. durable construction materials and reduces waste.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under the proven model of environmental regulation. Congress sets the standard of protection the State programs must meet. EPA interprets that standard through rules or guidance so States know what they must do to achieve that level of protection. States can demonstrate to EPA that they have in place programs adequate to provide the minimum level of protection required. and EPA retains backstop enforcement authority to ensure that State programs are enforced. This bill. Mr. Chairman. fails on each of these points. Unlike EPAs rule. it does not contain any minimum Federal requirement to protect health and the environment. It undermines the minimum national safeguards in EPAs rule by introducing significant discretion. It fails to establish Federal backstop authority. Finally. it fails to define what facilities the bill covers instead giving States discretion to define the scope of their programs. So this proposal will not ensure the safe disposal of coal ash. protect groundwater. or prevent dangerous air pollution. and it certainly isnt going to prevent another catastrophic failure like the one we saw in Kingston. Tennessee. I continue to oppose the legislation. just as the administration does and just as environmental groups and public health groups do. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.

And one might think that we are facing a stark choice. either vote for this bill or coal ash recycling will stop. but that is not the choice that we face. When EPA issued its final coal ash rule. they finalized a nonhazardous regulation. exactly what the coal ash recycling industry sought. and the rule explicitly protects beneficial reuse. Many Members of Congress sent letters and submitted comments to EPA during the comment period on the proposed rule in support of the subtitle. the option they ultimately chose. In this bill. on the other hand. the decision between hazardous and nonhazardous would be moved to the State level. meaning that these materials could be regulated as hazardous in some States. but not others. Now. how will that avoid the stigma so many in the industry have spoken of and how will it create the certainty they crave? Even worse. this bill would eliminate important protections in EPAs final rule. meaning the number of damage cases is likely to continue to grow. and that will really create a stigma around these materials. So. if we leave these ash ponds in place and another one fails. what will happen to the beneficial reuse industry? The way to ensure a strong beneficial reuse industry is to ensure consistent regulation and safe disposal of CCR by allowing the EPA rule to be implemented. Again. that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule if they really want to see the beneficial reuse industry flourish. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last night. 77 Senators voted to advance legislation that would keep the government funded through the fall at the bipartisan level agreed to by both parties. The bill hardly represents my preferred method for funding the government. but it is now the most viable way forward after Democrats extreme action forced our country into this situation. Lets remember how we got here. Democrats knew the American people were unlikely to buy their desire for more bureaucracy and more debt. but they figured they might in a crisis. So Democrats pursued a deliberate strategy of blocking government funding all year in order to force our Nation to the brink. Democrats said they would block government funding legislation they had even voted for in committee. Some of these bills came out of committee overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. Democrats said they would block government funding of legislation they had actually praised in their press releases when these bills emerged from the Appropriations Committee with large majorities. Democrats even voted repeatedly to block the bill that funds our military. to repeatedly block the bill that funds medical care and pay raises for our troops. That is how far Democrats are willing to goat a time of daunting international threatsin order to tear down the normal government funding process and force our country into this situation that we now face. Well. I am not prepared to let the Democrats lead us over the cliff. The bill before us would keep the government open. it would allow time for cooler heads to prevail. That is why I joined 76 other Senators and voted to advance it yesterday. But. look. obviously the best way to fund the government is by first passing a budget and then passing appropriations bills. The Senate also passed a budget. The Senate is prepared to pass appropriations legislation too. All that is needed is for Democrats to drop these endless filibusters. We know that nearly all these funding bills are bipartisan. We know that Democrats and have supported and praised them. And with the CR behind us. we can turn back to the work of trying to pass these appropriations bills.",

I rise today to honor Dusty Shultz. superintendent of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore upon the occasion of her retirement on November 2. 2015. after 42 years of service. including 14 years with the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in my district in Northern Michigan. Ms. Shultz has had a long and industrious career with the National Park Service. Ms. Shultzs interest in a career with the Park Service began early. Following an opportunity to attend an Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site near her home in Central Pennsylvania. Ms. Schultz remained in touch with contacts at the event and was hired by the service upon her high school graduation. After a long and distinguished career with the National Park Service. Ms. Shultz was appointed as Superintendent of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in August of 2001. Under her leadership. she worked with local residents. landowners. local communities. and the National Park Service to rework the plans for the general management plan of the lakeshore. I was honored to work with all stakeholders. including Ms. Schultz. to pass legislation that codified the new general management plan that garnered tremendous support in our local communities. I was happy to sponsor the \"Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act.\" which was signed into law by President Obama on March 13. 2014. This legislation ensures that the park will remain both protected and accessible for generations to come. Ms. Schultz played a key role in ensuring that the balance of accessibility and conservation in the park was maintained. and stakeholders from around our local communities have praised her efforts. On behalf of all residents of Northern Michigan. I wish to salute Ms. Shultz for her many years of dedicated service to the National Park Service. and the citizens of the United States.",

Mr. Speaker. I dont think it is wasting time to help and protect working families and small businesses from this onerous rule that may actually prevent them from saving for the future. As we have said here on the House floor. almost a third of all Americansand it distresses me every daydo not have any retirement savings or pension plan.

We have now grown that to 450 employees. and we have a totally different arrangement because we have a different business model now. Higher income and higher earning people. like myself. dont have to worry about this rule. It will not affect us. It will affect small businesses that are trying to get started and individuals like my children who are out there starting their pension plans. If you believe. as I do. that the American people deserve better than a flawed rule that will wreak havoc on workers and retirees. I urge you to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker. this is a 1.000page bill to define one word. This is a Websters dictionary that defines every word in the English language. which is only slightly bigger than that 1.000page bill right there.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 88. One of the biggest concerns I hear from my constituents in Houston and Harris County. Texas is having enough money for retirement. For decades. we have seen the private sector moving their employees from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans. Now were seeing growing pressure to move public sector workers onto defined contribution plans as well. Even more concerning is the current effort by multiemployer pension funds. like Central States. to pull the rug from under retirees and slash their pensions by hundreds of thousands of dollars. This pattern has troubled me for years and I hope Congress will take action to ensure workers in Houston and Harris County and throughout our great country who have worked for decades get the secure retirement they deserve. If American families are going to be required to secure their retirement in the private market. at the very least. they ought to have peace of mind that they are getting the best advice from financial professionals. The Labor Department and Secretary Tom Perez worked for years to put together a fair and balanced rule that will ensure that when it comes to saving for retirement. customersin other words. the American peoplecome first by holding advisers and brokers to a fiduciary standard. The Council of Economic Advisers has reported that due to loopholes that had been on the books for 40 years. conflicted advice and hidden fees have cost American families $17 billion a year in lost retirement savings. These conflicts of interest can cost a retiree almost onefifth of their savings by age 65.

It pitted the Allies against the central powers and stretched across five continents. The United States was isolationist at that time and was not in the war. But in 1917. the British intercepted a telegram called the Zimmerman Telegram from the German Government to Mexico. encouraging Mexico to join Germany. In return. Germany would help Mexico take and conquer Texas. New Mexico. and Arizona. So after the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines. the sinking of the Lusitania. and the publication of the Zimmerman Telegram. the United States Congress declared war in April of 1917. Fourandahalf million Americans signed up to fight. including a friend that I later got to know by the name of Frank Buckles. who was 16 when he joined the war in World War I. He lived to the age of 110 and died in 2011. American doughboys like him proved the decisive difference. Just a year after the U.S. was in the war. the war was over on the 11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour. In all. there were 30 million casualties worldwide. civilian and military. Mr. Speaker. after the war. the United States became an international power. So 114.000 doughboys died over there in the great World War I. When they got home. an equal number died from the Spanish flu that they had contracted when they were in Europe.

Raising the minimum wage is critical to addressing income inequality in the United States. one of the most pressing issues facing our Nation. But the majority has not even called a hearing on this issue. Yesterday. the Committee on Education and the Workforce Democrats held our own forum on this issue. during which we considered the evidence in support of raising the minimum wage. We heard from business leaders and economists that raising the wage will reduce workforce turnover. stimulate consumer spending. and grow jobs. The evidence is absolutely clear that raising the minimum wage will give 35 million workers a raise and lift 4.5 million Americans out of poverty. It is also abundantly clear that raising the minimum wage will benefit businesses in the U.S. economy. That may be why in a recent poll from Republican pollster Frank Luntz. 80 percent of business executives supported raising the minimum wage. The record could not be more clear: raising the minimum wage is good for workers. businesses. and the American economy. That is why today I include in the RECORD testimony from yesterdays Member forum on the Business Case for Raising the Federal Minimum Wage. presented by David Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute.

    "speech": "AND CONGRESSWOMAN PELOSI: July will mark five years since the federal minimum wage was last raised. We urge you to act now and enact a threestep raise of 95 cents a year for three yearswhich would mean a minimum wage of $10.10 by 2016and then index it to protect against inflation. Senator Tom Harkin and Representative George Miller have introduced legislation to accomplish this. The increase to $10.10 would mean that minimumwage workers who work full time. full year would see a raise from their current salary of roughly $15.000 to roughly $21.000. These proposals also usefully raise the tipped minimum wage to 70% of the regular minimum. This policy would directly provide higher wages for close to 17 million workers by 2016. Furthermore. another 11 million workers whose wages are just above the new minimum would likely see a wage increase through \"spillover\" effects. as employers adjust their internal wage ladders. The vast majority of employees who would benefit are adults in working families. disproportionately women. who work at least 20 hours a week and depend on these earnings to make ends meet. At a time when persistent high unemployment is putting enormous downward pressure on wages. such a minimumwage increase would provide a muchneeded boost to the earnings of lowwage workers. In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment. with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimumwage workers. even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research suggests that a minimumwage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as lowwage workers spend their additional earnings. raising demand and job growth. and providing some help on the jobs front.",

So we are satisfied that this bill is a good bill. and it is a good bill because veterans are getting $2 billion more. There are other reasons. of course. I think the bipartisan support we got for the bill was important. but for our veterans. the most important part was $2 billion extra.",

    "speech": "Madam President. the Fifth Circuit Courts decision yesterday was a political move that ignores past precedents on Executive action on immigration. The Republicans have spoken out against the Presidents action on what he has done on immigration. Why did he do it? Because he was trapped. He had to do it because the Republicans refused to legislate. And like every President before him. President Obama has a legal right to establish clear immigration enforcement priorities and allocate resources accordingly. But the attorney general of Texas and 25 other Republican Governors and attorneys general filed a lawsuit stating that the President had exceeded his authority. This decision affects millions of American families who are now subject to being torn apart. and as many as 5 million immigrants could be set for mass deportation. I expect the administration will swiftly appeal this decision to the Supreme Court and that the Court will find the actions lawful. It is sad that Republicans are wasting their time talking about mass deportation when they could be doing things to solve the problem. such as passing a bill that reforms our immigration system once and for all. The Republican Party has neglected the lessons of the 2012 elections and has plunged over a cliff following Donald Trump. Ben Carson. and the others. The Executive actions were neither a complete nor a permanent solution to the problems plaguing the immigration system. but they were a commonsense step in the face of inaction. As Judge Carolyn Dineen King stated in her dissent very clearly. \"a mistake has been made.\" So it is now up to the U.S. Supreme Court to correct this grave mistakea mistake that sets not only a dangerous precedent but one that is bad for families. bad for our communities. and bad for the future prosperity of our country. Again. as Judge King said. \"a mistake has been made.\"",

That is why the United States and Israel are negotiating right now a new 10year memorandum of understanding on security assistance. Much of yesterdays meeting between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel centered on the continued assistance we would provide Israel. Israels interests have always been protected by the United States in matters that come before the United Nations. as Israel has always protected the interests of the United States before the United Nations.

Unfortunately. it makes it clear for the umpteenth time that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care for women. some Republicans are determined to stand in the way of progress. I expect that some of my Republican colleagues will say this resolution shows how much they care about womens health. The truth is it shows the opposite. It shows once again that the Republican Party wants to interfere in a womans medical decision. Strengthening womens health care doesnt start with telling women what they should and should not do with their own bodies. but that is exactly what that resolution does. If my Republican colleagues really want to support womens reproductive care. they would work with Democrats on improving access to affordable birth control under the Affordable Care Act. including emergency contraceptives. ensuring women and families make their own decisions about their health carenot their bossesand fighting back against efforts across the country to undermine womens constitutionally protected health care rights.

    "speech": "Madam President. I wish to support the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active military. veterans. and their families. The courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers. sailors. airmen. marines. coastguardsmen. and all servicemembers over the years cannot be understated. Major chapters in our Nations rich history have been and continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women. many of whom hail from Louisiana. The very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. It is our obligation to fund veterans health care and benefits. and this bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the scandalplagued Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Louisiana veterans have waited a long. long time to have efficient access to effective health care. and they deserve much better than what has been handed to them. That is why I have worked for years to authorize new VA clinics and build interim clinics in southwest Louisiana. including one in Lake Charles. LA. that is expected to open before the Thanksgiving holiday. The latest National Defense Authorization measure has been revised to reflect the recent budget deal. which modified the spending caps for both base and war defense spending. In light of these changes. I firmly believe the administration should honor past statements that current military reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from sequestration. which have now been postponed for 2 years. It is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2year budget deal provides necessary relief for the Department of Defense and allows a muchneeded opportunity to avoid further cuts to the ActiveDuty Armys troop strength. Since 2013. the U.S. Army alone has decreased troop strength 21 percent. That is both dangerous and unacceptable. I have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to fight this issue on the Senate floor last year. The United States cannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say that we are facing an unprecedented number of threats. I urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this bipartisan bill.*",

This bill requires the Secretary to submit an annual report on the Departments furnishing of hospital care. medical services. and nursing home care to veterans. One of our priorities on the committee is to ensure that safe. quality health care is provided to veterans and their families. This report will assist us in our oversight duties of the Department. This bill expands the definition of a \"homeless veteran\" to include veterans fleeing from domestic violence. As you know. veterans who experience domestic violence are considered at high risk for homelessness. This is a very vulnerable population. and anytime we find a barrier to care. we should remove it. Further. one of my biggest priorities as ranking member is to ensure that we provide safe. quality housing for homeless women veterans. Women veterans are an underserved population. and there is a serious lack of housing options for those who become homeless. There is an even greater crisis in attempting to find housing for women veterans who have children. This is largely due to the fact that many facilities do not allow women and children to be in the same facilities as men. This must be corrected immediately. I have encountered several womenthose who have been forced to live on the streetsin weekly motels and in other housing places that are not fit to live in due to domestic violence. This is completely unacceptable. We should be working closely with the VA and HUD to ensure that there is transitional and emergency housing available for women veterans during their greatest time of need. This bill addresses gaps in the identification. tracking. and the procurement of biological implants at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

This bill makes positive. bipartisan reforms to the VA. which has become the hallmark of the Veterans Affairs Committee. We have such a good committee. Mr. Speaker. I am particularly pleased about the inclusion of my bill. H.R. 271. the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery Act. better known as the COVER Act. Last year the Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing regarding veterans access to the VAs mental health services. At the hearing. we heard from the mothers and fathers of deceased veterans. I remember vividly how hearing their testimony moved me. I cant remember another instance when the Veterans Affairs Committee room was so quiet and solemn as on that day. Statistics show that one in five veterans who serves in Iraq and Afghanistan has been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress. Now we must responsibly ask ourselves: Are we doing enough when it comes to addressing mental health in our veteran population? Recent data has shown that every day in this country approximately 18 to 22 veterans take their own lives. This statistic answers the question I posed earlier. It is obvious more needs to be done. Far too often we have heard of situations in which our veterans are being overprescribed opioids and antipsychotics. While traditional forms of therapies may work for some. tailoring therapies to the veterans and finding the balance between traditional and complementary. alternative treatments could be the difference in saving lives. Late last year I met with a veteran who was able to tell me just how much alternative treatments have improved his life. His treatment plan to address his PTS and physical injuries consisted of over 30 different pills every day. He told me how much this affected him. He said he felt hopeless and wasnt quite himself anymore. He then decided to take control of his life again and looked for an alternative. He found an alternative treatment in training and in caring for a service dog. Now. his treatment includes one multivitamin. one other medication. and a fourlegged companion that never leaves his side.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2256. as amended. which includes a bill I introduced. H.R. 1016. the Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act. A frightening January 2014 GAO report found that the VA does not use a standardized process for tracking biological tissue from a cadaver to a living donor veteran patient. In the event of a recall. it would be virtually impossible to track down which patient had received contaminated tissue. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration does not always ensure it is purchasing tissue from biological implant vendors that have registered with the FDA and does not maintain an inventory system to prevent expired tissue from remaining in storage alongside unexpired tissues. The GAO and Veterans Affairs Committee staff have discovered that VA often uses a loophole that allows it to purchase biological implants on the open. unregulated market. which it does in 57 percent of its biological implant purchases. This bill would require the procurement of biological implants from vendors on the Federal supply schedules which have been appropriately vetted. For biological implants not on the Federal supply schedule but requested by clinicians. my bill requires justification and approval of open market purchases under the Federal acquisition regulation on a casebycase basis rather than simply granting a blanket waiver. This bill would also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt FDAs unique device identification system for labeling of all biological implant tissue and implement an automated inventory system to track the tissue from donor to implant recipient. This legislation would also require all biological implant tissue to be procured through vendors that are registered with the FDA. accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks. and use FDAs unique device identification system. The 6 million veterans served annually by VHA deserve the highest standard of patient care in the Nation. Implementation of H.R. 2256 would help establish the VA as an industry leader in biologic implant safety and accountability. I want to thank the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee staff for their help in developing this legislation which truly puts veterans first.",

Mr. Speaker. the financial crisis of 2007 was not an accident and not an unavoidable byproduct of free markets. It was a mistake. a mistake driven by ideologically driven deregulation. Countries which maintained adequate capital requirements did not suffer a financial crisis. Countries which maintained an adequately regulated primary and secondary mortgage market did not suffer through a housing bubble. In response to the crisis. taxpayers stepped in and saved the global financial system by stabilizing the marketplace and staving off a second Great Depression through economic stimulus. To ensure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for the irresponsible actions by some on Wall Street. the DoddFrank Act required that financial institutions hold adequate capital against the risks they take and take responsibility for the risks that they sell into the market. The DoddFrank Act has unquestionably made our markets safer and more stable.",

I am pleased to have been one of the conferees to H.R. 644. the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of There are many important provisions in this legislation. some of which I helped to draft. There is one such provision that I particularly want to highlight. Honey producers in my State of South Dakota as well as producers of honey. crawfish. garlic. and mushrooms around the country. have suffered for 15 years because of unfair dumping from China. Senator WYDEN and I have worked together for 5 years to ensure that the trade laws were enforced in these cases. Unfortunately. the latest struggles have been more with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP. than with Chinese dumpers. Duties collected on dumped imports and all interest on those duties from 2000 and 2007 were to be paid to the injured domestic producers to allow them to reinvest and rebuild. For reasons that defy simple explanation. CBP ignored the direction of the statute to pay all interest to producers and instead deducted some types of interest from payments to producers. In effect. this practice amounted to forcing South Dakota honey producers to pay for the delays caused by Chinese dumpers. the U.S. insurance companies that posted bond for the duties. and in some cases of CBP itself. This practice defies the plain language of the statute and cost domestic producers tens of millions of dollars over the years. During the Finance Committee markup of this legislation. Senator GRASSLEY. Senator NELSON. and I offered an amendment which is included in this conference report that corrects CBPs misreading of the law. This is an important victory for honey. crawfish. garlic. and mushroom that have suffered from Chinese dumping and CBPs unfounded practice.",

In my home State of Alaska. trade currently supports more than 90.000 jobs. which is more than one in five of all jobs in the State. Per capita. Alaska is one of the top exporters in the country. We are the top exporter of fish and seafood products in the Nation.

With the global marketplace becoming more competitive and increasingly challenging. it is vital that the United States focus its efforts on maximizing our ability to export our goods and services abroad in order to create more opportunity and goodpaying jobs for all Americans.*",

Title I of the BALTIMORE Act includes law enforcement perform provisions to help better train and equip law enforcement officers so they can better serve communities across the country. The first provision contained within the BALTIMORE Act is the End Racial Profiling Act. The End Racial Profiling Act would end racial and discriminatory profiling by State and local law enforcement and require mandatory data collection and reporting. Think about this for a moment: In 2016 there is no national standard against law enforcement officers stopping someone merely because of his or her race. I am pleased that Maryland attorney general Brian Frosh recently issued guidelines prohibiting the use of discriminatory profiling by State and local law enforcement in Maryland. And the Attorney General of the United States has acted. but we need a national standard with the force of law that would prohibit the use of discriminatory profiling by any Federal. State. or local law enforcement officer. The second provision deals with State and local accountability. It would require local law enforcement officials receiving Byrne JAG and COPS Hiring Program funds to submit officer training information to the Department of Justice. That information would include how officers are trained in the use of force. racial and ethnic bias. deescalating conflicts. and constructive engagement with the public. The Police CAMERA Act would establish a pilot program to assist local law enforcement in purchasing or leasing bodyworn cameras. I am pleased that several provisions that are consistent with the BALTIMORE Act were included in the fiscal year 2016 appropriations measure enacted by Congress in December. The appropriations legislation directs the Department of Justice to swiftly devise and submit plans to improve training levels in use of force. identifying racial and ethnic bias. and conflict resolution for State and local law enforcement officers. It urges DOJ to partner with national law enforcement organizations to promote consistent standards for highquality training and assessment and directs the agency to better collect State and local law enforcement data on the use of force.

Mrs. King opened the Sydney School of Dance in the 1940s for aspiring African American dancers who were not allowed to attend white dance studios in post war segregated Philadelphia. Born in Kingston. Jamaica in 1919. King came to Philadelphia with her family when she was just two years old and at an early age began studying ballet under the tutelage of dance pioneer Essie Marie Dorsey. For more than six decades the Sydney School of Dance trained hundreds of Black children and many went on to receive national and international recognition in the dance world. Those students include dance professionals such as: Joan Meyers Brown. the founder and director of the much acclaimed Philadanco. Billy Wilson. famed director/choreographer and E257 soloist with the National Ballet of Holland. Broadway performer Betsy Ann Dickerson. singer/actress Lola Falana. Carol Johnson. a former principal dancer with the Eleo Pomare Dance Company and founder of an aboriginal dance company in Australia. and Arthur Hall. founder of the Afro American Dance Ensemble. These dance greats in no way diminish the accomplishments of hundreds of her other students who did not choose careers in dance but because of the empowering and esteem building training at the Sydney School of Dance they are today proud and successful professionals in a variety of fields. Mrs. King. the mother of three children. is a widow and now at the age of 95 sums her lifes dedication to dance by saying simply she wanted to. \"train and create Black ballerinas.\" Mr. Speaker. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring her and her lifetime contribution to the arts and the African American community. Mrs. Sydney Gibson King is a treasure!",

Congressman JIM MCDERMOTT (DWA). a senior member of the Budget and Ways and Means Committees. today introduced legislation that would save students and parents thousands of dollars by allowing student loan borrowers to refinance their federal and private student loans. The Fairness in Student Loan Lending Act will also allow holders of private student loans the ability to discharge their debt in bankruptcy. which is not currently permitted. Federal law currently prevents responsible student loan borrowers with federal student loans in good standing from refinancing their loans to a lower rate. This has left millions of students and parents holding loans with interest rates of 7 percent. Under the Fairness in Student Loan Lending Act. student loan borrowers in good standing will be able to refinance their loans to a rate equal to the 10year Treasury note on the last day of business of the previous month plus one percent. For example. a borrower who refinances on February 2015 would refinance to a rate of 2.64%. While federal law allows borrowers to discharge many types of debt during bankruptcy. including car loans and gambling debt. student loans holders are not permitted to discharge their student loans during bankruptcy. The Fairness in Student Loan Lending Act provides a mechanism that allows borrowers holding private loans the ability to discharge these private loans during bankruptcy.",

South Carolina and join with his friends throughout the Pee Dee area of South Carolina in celebration of his 90th birthday. Mr. Gannon is a decorated veteran. having served thirtyseven years in the Air Force before retiring in 1980. His service began in 1943 while he was a high school junior when he entered an Air Force pilot training program. from which he graduated one month after DDay. During his decades of service. he flew more than 6.000 hours in thirtyfour different types of aircraft. Fourteen of those years were served overseas and included 387 combat missions in Vietnam. After the end of World War II. \"Rocky\" spent three years in Iwo Jima. Japan. His service in these theaters. as well as in the Korean War and Belgian Congo. earned him fifty military awards. including the Distinguished Flying Cross. the Bronze Star. the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. and ten Air Medals. After his retirement from the Air Force in 1980. Mr. Gannon took his expertise to the private sector as an independent aviation consultant and was subsequently named Executive Director of the Florence Regional Airport. In 2001. commemoration of his accomplishments in both civilian and combat aviation. he was named South Carolina Aviator of the Year and was inducted into the South Carolina Aviation Association Hall of Fame. \"Rockys\" passion for aviation is matched only by his dedication to the Boy Scouts of E261 America. He joined the scouts when he was twelve years old and rose to the rank of Eagle Scout before joining the Air Force. He credits the training he received as a Boy Scout to much of his success in military and civilian life. He has given back to the scouts throughout his career and in 2009 received the Distinguished Eagle Award. the Boy Scouts of Americas highest honor. Mr. Speaker. I ask that you and my colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Gannon on this milestone and thanking him for his outstanding contributions to Florence. the Pee Dee area. to South Carolina. and to our great country.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 5. the Student Success Act. This bill undermines the fundamental purpose of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). which was created to ensure that disadvantaged children are provided a highquality education that allows them to compete on a level playing field with their moreadvantaged peers. Among its many problematic provisions. this bill cuts crucial education funding. fails to hold states and districts accountable for supporting and improving the achievement of all students. eliminates and weakens protections for disadvantaged students. and lacks critical support systems for our nations educators. I believe No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is flawed and must be reformed. and reauthorization presents a tremendous opportunity to make muchneeded improvements and bring our education system into the 21st century. However. instead of fixing the problems of NCLB. the Student Success Act does not reflect best practices and fails to strike the appropriate balance between flexibility and accountability. Reauthorization should support college and careerready standards. address the overuse of testing in teacher and school evaluations that currently forces educators to substitute test preparation for instruction. and feature an accountability system that includes meaningful targets for improving student attainment that gives schools and districts flexibility in how they achieve those goals. I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 5 and instead support reauthorization that restores our nations commitment to providing equal opportunity for all students regardless of their background and protect our countrys students including the most vulnerable. which was the intention of this landmark civil rights law.",

It seems to me. if you are a convicted sex offender. why do we want you in this country? The irony is that just this week the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on sex trafficking. and we heard heartbreaking stories of very young girls who had been abused by men. who had been taken from State to State. coerced into prostitution. I do not want those individuals. if they come from another country. to be allowed to stay here. All 20 of the women of the Senate requested this hearing from the Judiciary Committee. and the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Minnesota have bills that deal with this kind of human trafficking. We are trying to send a message that these individuals should be a high priority for deportation. but I want to make it clear that contrary to allegations that have been made about my billand. frankly. it is a completely specious argumentthere is nothing in my bill that deprives the Department of Homeland Security of the authority it needs to pursue those who would seek to harm our countrythose. for example. who are terrorists or belong to gangs or pose some sort of public safety or national security threat. Indeed. the public safety threat is big enough to cover the people we are talking about. but we think they merit special mention in our bill.

I believe he helped to clarify a lot of important issues that I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will consider as they cast their votes. I am for comprehensive immigration reform. I have voted that way. That is not what this is about. My bill simply prevents the executive branch from usurping the legislative power by creating categorical exceptions from the law for whole classes of people. That power belongs to Congress. Whether Congress was wrong or whether Congress was right. it does not give the President the authority to write the law on his own. and that is what he has done with his November 2014 Executive order. I wish to make two other points before I close. The first point is there is nothing in my legislation that in any way undoes the more limited 2012 Executive order that applies to the DREAMersnothing. It doesnt prevent them from being renewed nor does it take away their status. There is nothing that changes that Executive order. The first version of the House bill did. and I opposed that provision and it is not in my bill. The second point I will make is that this debate is not about immigration. It really is about the power of the President versus the powers delineated in our Constitution for Congress and the judicial branch. I will close. once again. with President Obamas own words. because he got it right back in September of 2013. He said: Congress has said \"here is the law\" when it comes to those who are undocumented ... What we can do is to carve out the DREAM Act And that is what he did with his 2012 Executive order. saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome . . . But if we start broadening that Which is exactly what he did in his 2014 Executive order. then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So thats not an option. That is why the court stayed the implementation of the 2014 Executive order. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to speak about a historic decision by the Federal Communications Commission. It was a 3to2 decision in a landmark case that will go down as a way to protect an open Internet economy. Consumers all across America should applaud this decisionand I know they will in the Pacific Northwestbecause we will be protecting an aspect of our economy that has created thousands of jobs and millions of dollars. This decision. known as Net neutrality. simply says that cable companies and telecom companies cannot artificially charge more on the Internet. thereby slowing down traffic or making a twotier system in which some applications would be given access to faster service and others not. based on what they paid for. This is an important decision because it champions an open Internet economy that has built so many new aspects of the way we communicate. the way we educate. and the way we continue to transact business around the globe. In 2010 the Internet economy accounted for 4.7 percent. or approximately $68 billion. of Americas gross domestic product. Next year that Internet economy is expected to pass $100 billion and comprise 5.4 percent of our countrys estimated $18 trillion GDP. So in 6 years the Internets value has climbed over 30 percent. What this decision says is: Lets protect the Internet. Lets not artificially tax it. lets not artificially slow it down. and lets not artificially create two tiers of an Internet system and stymie innovation. So many of us now know and enjoy the benefits the Internet provides when we buy a Starbucks coffee and use an app to pay for it or use an app to get on an airplaneand so many other ways that we communicate in an information age. Slowing all that down by just one second causes big problems and curtails an economy of growth. We all know we have questions about the way cable companies and phone companies charge us for data. Lets make sure the Federal Communications Commission does its job by overseeing those companies that might want to charge more for those services than they need to charge. Lets keep an open Internet. Lets have Net neutrality be the law of the land. I applaud the FCC for this historic decision today. I thank the Chair. and I yield the floor.",

The SelmatoMontgomery march was a pivotal event in the drive to achieve the right to vote for all Americans. a right which was being systematically denied in that area and other places in the country. This action was historic. It dealt a major blow to deliberate discrimination. It produced a positive and lasting change for Americans. Those who stood tall for freedom on that fateful day deserve to be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal. It is a rare thing. We do not give it out often. But this is a very special occasion. I think these courageous individuals are greatly worthy of this high recognition from the Congress. I would note that two Alabama Congresswomen. new. younger Members of the House of Representatives.

I am proud to cosponsor this bill. which would award the Congressional Gold Medal to those who gave their blood. sweat. and tears in the name of ending unfathomable injustices in our country. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the march. this award will recognize those whose groundbreaking efforts acted as a catalyst for the Voting Rights Act and made our Nation a more free and equitable place. Bloody Sunday. Turnaround Tuesday. and the final 54mile march from Selma to the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery were defining moments in the neverending struggle for equal treatment under the law. On Bloody Sunday. peaceful marchers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge by Selma were met by State troopers and locals. resulting in a brutal conflict. Seventeen members of the march were hospitalized. and shameful images of protesters being beaten with nightsticks focused national and worldwide attention on the event. Following Turnaround Tuesday. in which 2.500 marchers held a silent prayer at the same bridge. and a court battle to stop police interference with the march. a final march took place with over 25.000 people flooding the State capitol. The Bloody Sunday. Turnaround Tuesday. and Montgomery marches created undeniable momentum for change. and the events left an indelible mark on our national consciousness. President Johnson presented the Voting Rights Act to Congress shortly after Turnaround Tuesday. and by August of the same year. the bill passed Congress. This bill would provide the plainly warranted recognition to these brave men and women. It would provide a Congressional Gold Medal to be displayed at the Selma Interpretive Center near the Edmund Pettus Bridge. a fitting tribute to the Foot Soldiers who made that fateful march. Our country was founded on the precept that the power of government is derived from the people it governs. The primary form of expressing opinions in our democracy is through voting. The marchers who risked everything were committed to ensuring our democracy was truly representative. leaving a lasting and positive effect on our Nation.

I wish to respond briefly to what I understand was a presentation made by one of the Republican Senators suggesting that the continued existence of snow disproves climate change. First. that is not the only measure. We can take a look at sealevel rise. which we can measure from Fort Pulaski in Georgia up to Alaska where LISA MURKOWSKI has acknowledged that climate change is causing sealevel rise. eroding her native villages. to the sealevel rise in my hometown State at the naval station. We can look at the pH changes in the ocean which we actually measure. It is not complicated. Kids measure the pH in their aquarium all the time. We can measure ocean temperature. which is absolutely clear. It involves something called a thermometer. It really isnt all that complicated. And if we want to understand why the existence of snow might actually be consistent with climate change. I urge people to get their personal device heretheir iPad. whatever it is they haveand load up the EarthNow! app. The EarthNow! app is run by a group called NASA. NASA is pretty capable. They are driving a rover around on Mars right now. These are folks who know a little bit about what they are talking about. They map the temperature of the planet. and we can see the cold arctic air drawn down to New England. drawn down to our area. and it is in large part because the ocean is warming offshore that we have this snow. So not only does the continued existence of snow not disprove global warmingif you actually know what is going on and take the least bit of effort to understand ityou would see it is completely consistent with global warming as it is understood by scientists such as those from NASA.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. one of the most effective tools in fighting the drug crisis is the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. It is also known as HIDTA. This program works at Federal. State. and local levels. bringing together law enforcement to stop drug trafficking in our communities. In my district. the funding is to provide necessary resources to local police departments and county sheriffs offices to help facilitate efforts to stop drug trafficking. It teams up with local law enforcement. the FBI. and the DEA to get drugs off our streets and lock up traffickers. The police chief in my hometown of Huntington. West Virginia. says HIDTA is critical to the success of their counterdrug mission. They rely on HIDTA funding to support training and operational activities. The amendment I offer today is straightforward and completely offset. It will increase funding for the HIDTA program by $2 million. The increase will go a long way in ensuring our sheriff and police departments can continue making strides in combating the drug crisis. I want to thank Chairman CRENSHAW and the committee for their tireless efforts to fund programs making a difference in our communities. His work on this bill and continued support of HIDTA are truly making a difference in combating the drug epidemic. Mr. Chairman. while I have only served on the Appropriations Committee for 2 years. it has been a pleasure working with my colleague from Florida. Mr. CRENSHAW. Again. thanks to the chairman.

There is something that troubles me a lot. and I have to say it. There is always so much talk about our veterans. our veterans. our veterans. and yet. at the same time. people cut the Veterans Health Administration. At the same time. they try to take away preferences that they have gotten and they have earned the hard way. When we think of veterans. we shouldnt only think of that picture we always see of the person in uniform and so on. There is also the veteran in a wheelchair. There are the young kids that come here and greet us Monday nights sometimes. with a missing limb and so on. So. to me. I am either a contradiction or I am the way a lot of people should be. I will have to be really forced into voting for Congress to declare war. Given a choice. I dont want any war. But coming back from that war. I have become a bigspending liberal when it comes to veterans. Give them whatever they want. Give them whatever they need. Give them whatever they deserve. And I mean that sincerely. So this. to me. is an important amendment that the gentleman brings up. This. to me. is one that sticks to our comments that we care about the veterans. If we start chipping away at the benefits that veterans get. the day will come when we treat veterans just like any other Federal agency and cut away all their benefits and all the support that they need from us.

The families expressed frustration that they could not obtain through the VA the highly specialized and efficient care they were receiving in Buffalo. It was not until Operation Backbone arranged their treatments and the Buffalo Sabres hockey team facilitated recovery that these men received the care they needed. I commend Operation Backbone and the Buffalo Sabres for their commitment to our veterans. but their work is necessary only because Congress is failing in its responsibility to these men and women. When we ask our servicemembers to put their bodies on the line. we incur a moral obligation to get them the best possible care when injury occurs. Last year.

For instance. the United States and Papua New Guinea are the only two countries in the worldthe only two in the worldthat do not provide paid leave for the birth of a child. So before another Mothers Day rolls around. lets give mothers something they really want: policies that allow them to hold wellpaying jobs so that they can help provide for their families.",

This time last year. the State of New Hampshire lost a true Granite State hero. During this time of great sadness. we remember and celebrate the life of not only a tremendous police officer. but also a father. brother. master carpenter. coach. and friend. Arkell devoted his life to protecting our families and our communities. and ultimately died in the line of duty while responding to a domestic violence dispute. As his family. friends. neighbors. and fellow police officers knew. Arkell was really one of a kind. The bravery and compassion he demonstrated during his 15 years of service are notand will notbe forgotten. It takes a remarkable individual like Stephen Arkell to risk their life daily to keep us safe and protect us from harm. So let us take a moment today and pause. reflect. and celebrate the life and valor of Officer Arkell. He put his life on the line to protect the Granite State. and we are forever grateful.",

I also stand today to ask the incredible question: How can we put on the floor of the House H.R. 36. the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act. which is merely a disregard. disrespect for the Constitution and a womans right to choice. I look forward to a vigorous debate. standing on the side of the Constitution. But as I look today. I also realize that more of Congress work is not done. While we are dealing with violating womens rights. we are not dealing with the highway trust fund bill. In my own county of Harris. there are 3.616 bridges. and 1.559 of them are deficient. Our citizens are driving over bridges that are destroying the economy. destroying their cars. and stopping them from moving about the community in the way that they should. Mothers and fathers and carpoolers and workers are trying to get to work. The total deficiency is 43 percent. When are we going to get a longterm infrastructure bill? When are we going to stand up as Americans and not Republicans and Democrats? Democrats want to stand up with Americans to pass a longterm infrastructure bill.",

Mr. Speaker. I believe this to be one of the human rights issues of our day.

This bridge. like thousands of other bridges and roads throughout the country. is in dire need of repair. And let me be as clear as I can be: unless Republicans in Congress join with Democrats in our commitment to invest in our Nations infrastructure. not only will our roads and bridges continue to deteriorate. jobs will be lost. and the economy will suffer. Ever since Republicans took control of the House in January 2011. they have shown neglect and indifference towards the Nations infrastructure needs. In fact. since Republicans assumed the majority in January 2011. the Republicanled Ways and Means Committee has not held a single hearing on financing options for the highway trust fund. All this. despite the U.S. being ranked 16th in quality of infrastructure. behind Switzerland. the United Arab Emirates. Japan. and others. according to the World Economic Forum. and the country received a Dplus from civil engineers for our infrastructure nationwide. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues in Congress to quickly extend the highway trust fund. We only have another 6 legislative days.

We need reliable roads. highways. and bridges to keep our economy moving. and for almost 60 years we have depended on the highway trust fund to make necessary repairs to our Nations deteriorating infrastructure. However. the gas tax hasnt been raised in 20 years and no longer generates enough revenue to meet our needs. The highway trust fund faces a serious and immediate funding shortage. The deadline to fix this is just weeks awayjust 6 legislative days. So unless we act now. construction projects across the country will come to a standstill. putting the jobs of 600.000 American workers on the line. Paving our highways and keeping our bridges safe and reliable is one of the most basic jobs of Congress. We have until May 31 to figure this out. Failing is not an option.",

Yountvilles rich history dates back to 1831. when George Yount settled in Napa Valley. In 1836 Mr. Yount obtained the first land grant from the Mexican government awarded to a United States citizen in Northern California. By 1855. a surveyor had laid out the towns borders and Mr. Yount decided to call this town Sebastopol. Given that there was another town by the name of Sebastopol nearby. the town was renamed Yountville two years after Mr. Younts death in 1867 in honor of its founder and his invaluable contributions to the towns beginning. which included planting the first grape vines in Napa Valley. On February 4. 1965. the City of Yountville was officially incorporated and in 1982 changed its name to Town of Yountville. Over the past 50 years the town has grown to almost 3.000 residents. Today the town is home to many awardwinning restaurants. such as The French Laundry which boasts a ThreeStar Michelin rating. and which contributes to the towns reputation as the \"Culinary Capital of the Napa Valley\". In addition to the towns rich culinary history. Yountvilles wine. retail. and lodging industries attract tourists from around the world to this small town known as the \"Heart of Napa Valley\"TM.

Along with my colleague Rep. Gus BILIRAKIS. I am proud to reintroduce legislation to support Americans with limited or impaired vision. For someone with a visual impairment. reading a book or crossing the street could be blurred or distorted even with the help of glasses or contact lenses. In many cases a physician can prescribe magnifiers or special optical devices to help an individual remain independent. While there are a wide variety of options to help people with low vision. currently. there is an exclusion from Medicare coverage for devices that include a lens to aid vision or provide magnification of images for impaired vision. Ultimately. not having these assistance devices could shift more individuals from independent living to care facilities or nursing homes. To understand the impact of covering these devices for Americas seniors. we are introducing the Medicare Demonstration of Coverage for Low Vision Devices Act of 2015. This legislation would create a fiveyear national demonstration project administered by the Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate the economic impact of allowing reimbursement for certain low vision devices under the Social Security Act. Coverage of such devices could help Medicare beneficiaries with low vision lead healthy. safe. and independent lives.",

I think that this amendment really tells the story that they really are trying to destroy the ExportImport Bank as opposed to reform it. How can you deny borrowing authority to a lending institution and say you are serious about having it stay alive? The Bank has done a fantastic job of managing risk by keeping its overall debt rate below one quarter of 1 percent. far better than most private banks. in fact. The ExportImport Bank reauthorization already includes the creation of a permanent chief risk officer role. establishing a risk management committee. enhancing the Banks loan loss reserves. among other reforms. The underlying bill makes the Bank safer and better run than before. making this amendment transparently unnecessary. Members should oppose this antiExIm amendment.",

When we go back home to our districts. a lot of times we are on the tail end of jokes. being Congressmen and Congresswomen. and sometimes they talk about us being a little slow. So let me go over the facts one more time for the gentleman from South Carolina. The Bank doesnt cost the taxpayer a penny. We are doing more in the way of reforms than since President Reagan. It returns $500 million to $1 billion a year back to the Treasury. Now. I know that they have taken the position to kill the Bank. but this kills jobs. This is about jobs in Tennessee. jobs in California. jobs in Oklahoma. jobs in Illinois. This is not a level playing field. China. Russia. and all of these other countries are just hoping that we make the mistake and we dont reauthorize the charter of the ExportImport Bank. Lets be responsible adults. Lets not play politics as usual and worry about these outside groups and our political scores. Mr. Chairman. Isnt it sad that we would worry about some score with an outside group more than our districts and more than our constituents that have jobs because of the ExportImport Bank? We should be ashamed of ourselves. I again urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on all these amendments. and lets get to the serious business of the peoples House.",

This amendment is aimed to kill the Bank because it is a poison pill amendment on ExIm. That is what all these amendments are. They are attempting a lastditch effort to destroy something that has really. frankly. provided a lot of jobs in my district and provided a lot of exports from my district. We talk about protecting taxpayers. Protecting taxpayers from what. an extra $500 million? Are we protecting them from a smaller deficit? It doesnt make sense. I am not sure why certain folks have made this the hill to die on. There are a lot of better hills to die on. to fight. to argue in this. I will tell you a quick story. I went to Ethiopia 6 months ago or so. I flew to Ethiopia on a Boeing Dreamliner. Now. I know a lot of people like to call out names of big companies. but I didnt go to Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines on an Airbus. The fact that I was on a Boeing Dreamliner means that the parts and components are made in my district for that Dreamliner. which means there are people who have a job because Ethiopian Airlines bought a Boeing.

I was on a working group last year under the auspices of the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services with. amongst other people. the good gentleman from Tennessee . who has now left us for dinner. No. there he is. One of the things that the opponents and proponents of the Bank could all agree on was the fact that the Bank was poorly run when it came to managing its risk. Specifically. it has what bankers call market concentration. It puts too many of its eggs in one basket. In fact. one particular industry. aircraft and avionics. takes up almost 30 percent of the Banks portfolio. We had a banker on that committee who worked with us. He said no selfrespecting private sector bank would ever allow that to happen. That is simply bad management. It is not credible management. It is not responsible management to the shareholders. The bad news here. of course. Mr. Chairman. is the shareholders are the people who pay us. What does this amendment do? It tries to bring some of the private sector sanity into the ExportImport Bank and say: Look. you are going to have to abide by rules that ensure diversification of risk. both within industries and across companies. If this were really a bank and not just a political extension of the current administration. they would probably be doing this. If the Bank was run by a banker and not a political bundler. the Bank would probably already be doing this. But since it is a political extension of this administration. since it is run by a political bundler and not a banker. it falls to us to make sure that the Bank follows some commonsense rules about to whom it lends and how much it lends to them.

In fact. if they were. they would probably be in jail. because a lot of the same restrictions on lending that are contained in DoddFrank are exactly the rules that the ExportImport Bank is breaking right now. We would never tolerate a private institution that allows the type of concentration. both marketwise and geographically. that the ExportImport Bank has. DoddFrank would never permit it. Apparently. now it is okay. because we dont have private shareholders on the hook. We have taxpayers on the hook. So. if things go bad. it is really not that big a deal. I will remind everyone here. Mr. Chairman. that the inspector generals report has suggested exactly the type of reforms that are contained in this amendment.

There are a lot of people in here who are apparently very proud of the Bank. They are happy with the way the Bank is run. They dont think that. but for some token reforms and changes. the Bank needs to change very much at all. The last 6 years have been 75 years of combined prison time because of wrongdoing at the Bank. There were 90 criminal indictments and complaints. 49 criminal judgments. and more than $223 milliona quarter of a billion dollarsin courtordered fines and restitution because of wrongdoing at the Bank. We are proud of that? That is something that doesnt need serious overhaul? That is something we can just tweak around the edges because we have done it for so long? Maybe that is part of the problem. Maybe it has been a really. really long time since we have looked at this Bank under the microscope like we should. Maybe we should not have rubberstamped it for the past 16 administrations. Maybe the Bank should have followed the law that we passed in 2012 to reform itself. What does it say about an institution. Mr. Chairman. that ignores the law that this Chamber passes. the Senate passes. and the President signs?

Mr. Chairman. and this is it. The amendments that you will see tonight are your only opportunity to do that.

They get out. they cant find a job. they cant do anything. and they are right back into prison at $30.000. $40.000. $50.000 a year. If you spend a little bit of money supporting them. they might not come back. One of the elements the President talked about today is the \"ban the box.\" When you fill out an application. there is a little box. \"Have you ever been convicted of a felony?\" If you check the box. that is the end of the interview. What the ban the box is suggesting is dont talk about the criminal record at first. Go through the process so you can present your credentials. Then. at the end of the process. they can discuss criminal record. but not at the beginning. You will find that many people. the conviction is so far past. Studies have shown that after a few years. if you have got a clean record. the chance of you committing a crime isnt any higher than the general population. So if it is a 15yearold nonviolent offense. well. maybe it is not relevant. and maybe your credentials are so much better than everybody elses that you are the right person for the job. but you never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if you had to check the box. So all around the country. cities. States. and businesses are eliminating that box to check. talking to people and seeing if they are actually qualified for the job. and those that are qualified can get the job. Obviously. some violations. if you have got an embezzlement charge and you are trying to get a job in a bank. or child molestation at a daycare center. you know. but a lot of them. if it is a 20yearold marijuana possession charge or something like that. compared to your credentials. compared to everybody else head and shoulders. well. people can overlook a 20yearold conviction.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on October 27. 2015 the House of Representatives considered H.R. 1090. the Retail Investor Protection Act. This legislation prohibits the Department of Labor (the Department) from issuing updated retirement investment advice rules until the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its rule governing standards of conduct for brokers and dealers. In light of the ongoing rulemaking at the Department and the fact that this legislation does not address any of my concerns regarding the Departments proposed rule. I oppose this bill. While I oppose this bill. I remain concerned by the multiple unanswered questions related to the proposed rule and the potential impact the rule will have on the affordability and accessibility of financial information for investors. For example. I am concerned that there may be practical problems for providers to implement the Best Interest Contract Exemption as proposed. The Department should implement the exemption using a less prescriptive and more principlesbased approach. I am also concerned by the potential impact the proposed rule would have on consumers access to important retirement education information. The Department should maintain flexibility for advisors to provide investment education. and take steps to clarify that the proposed rule does not disadvantage lifetime income options. Given the complexity of the proposed rule and the many outstanding questions regarding a final rule. the Department should consider options for convening a small working group of industry professionals and consumer advocates to aid with implementation. and provide a safe harbor for \"good faith implementation.\" In order to have a successfully implemented rule. it is vital that the proposal does not limit consumer choice and access to advice. disproportionately impact lower- or middleincome communities. or raise the costs of saving for retirement. I recently joined a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Department expressing concerns with specific provisions of the proposed rule that may cause market disruptions and limit the ability of segments of the market to reasonably access advice. Unfortunately. H.R. 1090 is neither constructive nor relevant at this time. which is why I will vote against this bill. I will continue to work in a bipartisan way with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee and House Education and the Workforce Committee to address the many concerns that remain with this proposed rule.",

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2206. the State Wide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act. which was introduced by the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. the gentleman from New Jersey . This bill recognizes the important role played by Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. SWICs. We have all witnessed the communications failures during the response to the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. Interoperability is vital during disaster response. However. despite investing more than $5 billion in grant funding to enhance communications capability over the past 10 years. interoperability remains a challenge. To address this challenge. States have appointed SWICs to ensure emergency response providers in their States have the ability to communicate. SWICs complete Statewide Interoperable Communications Plans. ensure grant investments are coordinated statewide. and oversee communications projects. Many SWICs also serve as the State point of contact to FirstNet for the design and construction of the Public Safety Broadband Network. H.R. 2206 requires Governors to certify. as part of their applications for State Homeland Security grant programs. that they have designated a person to serve as the SWIC or. if not. that the functions of a SWIC are being carried out in another manner.

And as chairman of the subcommittee that oversees and funds this program. the SBA. let me assure my colleagues that this will not require any additional appropriations this year. It would simply lift the cap. as has been pointed out. let this continue on. and. again. do the good job that the SBA does. So I urge my colleagues to support this. I thank everyone involved that has worked in such a timely manner to make this happen so quickly so that we dont interrupt the lending that goes on.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2499. the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015. The Small Business Administration 7(a) Loan Program is a critical source of capital for Americas entrepreneurs and is SBAs largest and most important program in terms of the number of loans and programs supported. My home State of Michigan. where I am proud to serve as the congressional Representative. has benefited greatly from the SBA 7(a) Loan Program. In fiscal year 2013. the SBA guaranteed nearly 2.000 loans to Michigan small businesses through the 7(a) Loan Program for more than $500 million. Michigan ranked second in the Nation that year for all SBA loans. Even better. in fiscal year 2014. the SBA guaranteed more than 2.000 loans to Michigan small businesses. for more than $600 million. This was an increase of 17 percent over the previous fiscal year. This immensely successful program continues to show strong success. with loan volume up 20 percent this year over last year. Unfortunately. the lending cap established in the 2015 omnibus appropriations bills of about $18 billion was reached last week. That means that roughly $3 billion in loan programs needed for small American businesses have been stalled. putting Americas entrepreneurs at a serious financial risk. H.R. 2499 will reopen the crucially needed 7(a) Loan Program for Americas small businesses and provide a fee waiver for our Nations veterans who are seeking new careers after service to our country. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that would raise the cap of 7(a) loans to over $23 billion. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on this issue. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the underlying bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first of all. I would like to thank Chairman CHABOT and Ranking Member VELAZQUEZ for this opportunity. Mr. Speaker. on Friday. the 7(a) program reached its loan guarantee program limit for the year. As a result. the Small Business Administration was forced to suspend its 7(a) small business lending until the start of the new fiscal year or until such time as the 7(a) program is reauthorized or increased by Congress. Over 20 of my colleagues joined me in sending a letter to Speaker BOEHNER asking to bring this legislation to the floor to raise this limit before Congress goes on its August work period break. While I am thankful that we are finally doing this. it only speaks to the pattern of inaction that has plagued us here in Congress. Right now. because of this inaction. small businesses across the country are facing the uncertainty of where their next loan will come from. Lenders use the 7(a) program to fund working capital and other critical needs to small businesses. and the SBA provides a backstop by guaranteeing this loan in case the borrower defaults. Due to restrictive marketing conditions. SBA programs like the 7(a) loan program have seen an increase in usage by small businesses. making it more imperative that the lending limit be increased for this program. As you know. Mr. Speaker. over 90 percent of the American businesses are considered small and make up the backbone of our Nations economy. It is critical to note that the 7(a) program is funded entirely by guarantee fees paid by the program beneficiaries. not taxpayer dollars. Increasing this loan limit will not increase our national debt or deficit. but it will mean that small businesses can get access to the credit they need to expand and create jobs in our communities. Without SBA loan options. millions of small businesses will have to resort to practices not in their best interest. I came to Congress assuring my constituents that we would break this pattern of crisis and do our jobs. This shouldnt be a lastminute issue. Lets be sure our small businesses have the resources they need to continue being the engine of our economy.",

SBA has guaranteed over $3 billion in the 7(a) programan alltime record. Providing the Agency with additional lending authority will ensure creditworthy firms will continue to have access to low cost capital for the rest of the fiscal year.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker. I again want to thank the gentlewoman from New York . our ranking member on the Small Business Committee. for her cooperation and her hard work in making sure that we resolve this sticky issue and that small businesses across the country who need access to capital will get that access. So I definitely want to make sure that it is recognized that we have been working on this in a bipartisan and cooperative effort. I again want to stress that it is critical that we pass H.R. 2499 today for the benefit of both our veterans and also the benefit of the entire small business community. which right now is unable to obtain loans from the flagship SBA 7(a) lending program since last Friday. I would also note that there are reforms in this bill so that the SBA has to bring notice to Congress to let us know up front next time and not wait until the eleventh hour to notify Congress that they are in trouble. Hopefully. this will resolve this so that we dont see this in the future. that we will get notification on a fairly regular basis and not put the elected representatives of the American people in this kind of dilemma where we have to act at the last minute and that we basically put small businesses all across the country in jeopardy of not having access to loans. As we know. by pushing this forward along with the veterans bill. which. in essence. waived the fee that they would have had to pay so that veterans have access to loans that they need to grow a business or to create businesses since they have worn the uniform of our country. we certainly need to do everything we can to help them. and this bill does that as well. As has been mentioned by Mr. TAKA and others. this does not cost the taxpayers any additional dollars because the money for this is generated from the fees of those who take advantage of the program. so it is a winwin all around. I urge my colleagues to vote to concur on the Senate amendment to H.R. 2499. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

We all understand how important it is for the VA benefits to keep pace with the rate of inflation. and our Nations veterans depend on these benefits to pay for housing. food. and other necessities.

These benefits are instrumental in supporting those who have honorably served our Nation. Passing the Veterans Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2015 provides our veterans with muchneeded peace of mind so that they know their benefits will be secure each year. We must demand the highest protection of our veterans and their financial security.

Lets hope they dont have as much bureaucracy to get through to export their gas as we do. But the country is held back because it is still divided by a foreign power. Turkey still has 30.000 troops in Cyprus. Erdogan thinks he is still in control. The beauty of democratic elections is that you can see what the people really want. And faced with the choice between a candidate that wanted to keep Cyprus divided and one that wanted to reunify Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots chose reunification. It is encouraging to hear that negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are getting back on track. You know. I was a judge in my former life. I dealt a lot with one word: justice. And as a judge I would never have allowed the kind of bullying that is seen by Turkey. The Turkish Cypriots should be able to negotiate on their own behalf. If they want peace. they should be able to get it. They dont need another foreign country like Turkey telling them what they can and cannot agree to. They do not want to be dependent on Turkey. They want to enjoy the economic freedom of the EU. Reunification will require a lot of work. but ultimately it will only happen if the two sides talk to each other.

Matthew Polk is deeply involved in the preservation of cultural heritage and I believe his comments are both insightful and valuable to the ongoing effort to preserve the cultural heritage of civilizations around the world. Mr. Speaker. I first wish to thank Congressman Issa for his interest in this matter and the opportunity to provide a statement for the Congressional Record. With regard to H.R. 1493. I applaud this bipartisan effort to protect Syrian cultural property as well as to coordinate our Governments enforcement efforts to protect international cultural property. I also applaud Mr. Chabots and Mr. Engels understanding that this bill is not meant to target the lawful trade in Syrian or other cultural goods and that it only authorizes import restrictions on artifacts illegally removed from Syria after the start of its civil war. Nonetheless. it must be emphasized that the burden remains on the Government to prove that the artifact in question is illicit. While protecting Syrian cultural artifacts from looting is important. it is also important that we stay true to our own values. Our tradition of due process requires that the Government meet its burden of proof before private property may be seized or forfeited. This legislation does not change the burden placed on the Government under the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. Here. as under the CPIA. the Government must establish: (1) the item is of a type that appears on the designated list of Syrian artifacts that will be created. (2) the item was \"first discovered\" in Syria and is subject to Syrian export control. and (3) the item was illegally removed from Syria after the effective date of the restrictions. which in this case is March 15. 2011. The fact that an objects \"country of origin\" or manufacture may be \"Syria\" cannot constitute the sole basis for its seizure and forfeiture under either this legislation or the CPIA. Sincerely.",

Following 28 years of tireless service. Dr. Billington announced that he will be retiring from his post as the Librarian of Congress. During his tenure. Dr. Billington made significant contributions by providing visionary leadership as he ushered the Library of Congress into the digital age. Since being unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 1987. Dr. Billington has overseen the expansion of the Librarys collection size. It has roughly doubled. from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items today. Dr. Billington dedicated much of his efforts to ensuring that our nations historic items and collections be made readily available to the American public. In his early years. at the dawn of the internet age. he worked to facilitate an innovative program for the Library of Congress known as the National Digital Library (NDL) Program. which ensured that American historical and cultural information was available online. As a result of his efforts. projects such as the NDL. Congress.gov. and numerous pieces of information from the U.S. Copyright Office have become frequently used in K12 education systems across America. In addition to efforts ensuring the spread of the richly diverse history of the United States. Dr. Billington is also responsible for the development of the World Digital Library. A project similar to the NDL. the World Digital Library compiles cultural materials from the 193 countries listed in the UNESCO into one database for public access. I can say without question that throughout his decades of service. Dr. Billington has been firmly dedicated to the spread of information.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since the early 1990s. Pastor Duong Kim Khai has been detained or arrested thirteen times. The first time he was arrested he was just 14 years old. Usually. he is arrested for simply organizing Christian prayer sessions. Most recently. he was arrested in August 2010 for his efforts to advocate for religious freedom and social justice. The trumped up charge? Attempting to overthrow the government. For this. he was sentenced to 28 years in prison and 35 years probation and house arrest. Unfortunately. his wife. who was denied permission to visit him in prison. died before she could see him again. In 2011. the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that the Vietnam governments detention and conviction of Pastor Duong Kim Khai and six other activists were in violation of international law. But the State Department refuses to include Vietnam as a Country of Particular Concern for religious freedom. The Pastor is not only a spiritual leader in his community but he also works to promote democracy and help victims of injustice. For example. he has served as an advocate for Vietnamese farmers whose land was confiscated by the government. Pastor Duong Kim Khais trial was a sham and imprisonment is unacceptable. Freedom to worship is a human right and the Vietnamese government should immediately release him. Until they do. the State Department should call it like it is and recognize Vietnam as a Country of Particular Concern. And thats just the way it is.",

Larnell Sawyer recently received the Teacher of the Year award for outstanding work as a teacher at Lincoln Elementary. Lincoln is recognized as a haven for academic achievement and growth. Ms. Sawyer has played a crucial role in creating this reputation. Larnell Sawyer has deep ties to Chino Valley. She grew up and attended school there from kindergarten through high school. She then moved to Tucson and attended the University of Arizona. where she received her Bachelors Degree in Elementary Education. After teaching 1st grade for a year in Tucson. she got married to her high school sweetheart and moved back to Prescott. After her own initial academic successes. Larnell was hired in Chino Valley to teach an English Language Development kindergarten class. which she taught for two years. Realizing that she wanted to expand her knowledge. Larnell started her Masters program at Northern Arizona University and received her advanced degree in Early Childhood Education. Afterwards. she continued to teach in Chino Valley for another two years and was ultimately hired at Lincoln Elementary in 2012. where she continues to roar with pride as a Lincoln Lion kindergarten teacher. When the dedicated Ms. Sawyer is not shaping the minds of her students. she is spending quality time with her husband and two daughters. Ms. Sawyer is a prime example of a great educator. and the positive influence that she has on her students will resonate for years to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. my good friend and colleague. Chairman MILLER of the Veterans Affairs Committee. has implied that my clear and present danger standard in the substitute that I have offered is too narrow and does not give the Secretary enough tools to dismiss bad employees. I respectfully disagree. Particularly in the case of the Phoenix VA. the hospitals director. Sharon Helman. clearly posed a threat to the health and safety of veterans. Under my substitute. she would have been immediately removed. Similarly. many of the speakers on the other side of the aisle cited a crackhouse case where a VA employee took a veteran to a crackhouse. Now. my substitute and the clear and present standard. the health and safety standard that we have put forward. would clearly have addressed that employee and would have made that employee immediately dismissible. Let me remind you again that VA does have current title 5 procedures that they have been using to remove poorperforming employees. We should encourage the VA to use them better. to use the tools that they have. I remind my colleagues that last year 872 permanent employees were removed. 487 more resigned in lieu of being fired. and 958 probationary employees were terminated. Now. the fact that the VA wait list scandal emerged out of Phoenix was because we do have protections for whistleblowers. They could be strengthened. Nevertheless. the current civil service protections. the due process protections. afforded those employees the security to move forward and to come forward as whistleblowers. Again. my amendment in the form of a substitute fixes the deficiencies of my good friend Chairman MILLERS bill. I have said before that I believe his bill puts extra barriers in front of whistleblowers in coming forward. It complicates and makes more cumbersome their ability to come forward. If you are an employee who is under threat of dismissal and immediately losing your livelihood. that is a huge. huge barrier to your coming forward as a whistleblower. That is exactly what his bill would do. It would make everyone in the VA an atwill employee. I reserve the balance of my time.",

But I want to express my gratitude to the chairman for the work that he and the Veterans Affairs Committee have done. all the work they have put into this legislation to prevent another VA catastrophe by making sure that the Choice Act funds we appropriated last year can be used for related veterans community care expenditures. This bill will ensure that no veterans hospital or care for any veteran will be jeopardized due to the VAs continuing mismanagement of the influx of patients that followed last years passage of the Choice Act. Once again. Congress is providing the VA with all the resources they require to provide timely. quality care to our veterans and their loved ones. It was only about a month ago that we were informed by the Department that there was a shortfall of the magnitude of almost $3.4 billion. and here we are today remedying this problem. The bill also proposes something that is sorely needed: the consolidation of the myriad programs VA uses to provide care outside their facilities. Veterans are confused. VA employees are confused. Doctors are confused. Reimbursement rates are not standardized. We need to make sure that the nonVA care program is thriving so that patients can get the highquality care they deserve in their homes. in their home communities. right where they live. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction. Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies. I will continue to devote time and attention to pinpointing the VAs future funding needs and maintaining vigilant oversight of their appropriated taxpayer dollars. The VA must develop systems that give us accurate and ontime information and engage with Congress in a transparent and timely manner. We cannot and should not continue to lurch from one VA funding crisis to another. What we have seen is terrible management and a terrible disservice to our veterans by the VA in many of these cases. we need to fix it. I believe the Secretary is a good and honorable man trying to do his best. but the taxpayers deserve better. and our veterans most assuredly do. I urge passage of this bill.

The accountability substitute is offered today because it brings real accountability to the VA while maintaining constitutionality due process protection for civil service employees. At the Committee on Veterans Affairs over the past 2 years. we have learned of widespread mismanagement andlet me emphasizelack of training at the VA. The problems that the VA has have gone back for many years. over 30. Maybe if we had adequately funded VA. they would have fewer problems. The majority has introduced H.R. 1994. which attempts to increase accountability by allowing VA to immediately fire any employee for misconduct with only limited due process. The substitute increases accountability by allowing VA to immediately suspend. without pay. any employee whose misconduct posed a direct threat to veterans health and safety. Unlike H.R. 1994. the substitute provides sufficient due process rights to meet constitutional requirements by providing an accused employee with a fair chance to tell their side of the story.

On this past Monday. 62 years after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. the committee laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery in honor of our fallen military members. Today. we need more than a ceremony. We should honor our veterans now by passing H.R. 3236. I support this legislation because it addresses the $3 million shortfall for fiscal year 2015 at the VA and keeps hospitals and medical facilities open for our veterans through the end of the fiscal year. Let me repeat that. It will allow the VA to keep hospitals and clinics open for our veterans through the end of this fiscal year. This legislation allows the VA to use $3.348 billion that was appropriated for the Choice Program to use for nonVA care. to pay for health care provided to veterans and family members under the programs provided by nonVA providers from May 1 to October 1. 2015. The VA has completed more than 56 million appointments between June 1. 2014. and May 31. 2015. That is 2.6 million more than the same time last year. H.R. 3236 allows the VA to access $3 billion from the Choice fund and $348 million from other unobligated accounts. Of that amount. $500 million may be used for pharmaceutical expenses related to the treatment of hepatitis C at the VA. This is a cure that many of our veterans need. especially those who served in Vietnam.

Chairman DENT. who chairs the Appropriations MILCONVA Subcommittee. where I serve as ranking member. Today. this body is debating text within the highway bill to address the Department of Veterans Affairs $3 billion budget shortfall for veterans health care in FY 2015. Without this legislation. the VA could run out of money by September. Costs have exploded by more than 10 percent in the last year as a result of higher demand. while the budget increased by only 2.8 percent. Additionally. costs for treatments have increased. For example. due to the new lifesaving hepatitis C medicine costing as much as $1.000 for a single pill. the VAs $700 million FY 2015 budget for hepatitis C has already been exceeded with more than 2 months left in the fiscal year. This situation is a prime example of how the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act and locked in by the Republican budget constrain our ability to deal with issues responsibly and in a timely manner. It is well past time that we come to the table to break the cycle of irresponsible funding levels that are shortchanging our veterans health care. While the Housepassed FY 2016 MILCONVA Appropriations bill adds $970 million for VA medical care advance appropriations within the FY 2015 bill. the amount still remains $330 million below the VA request. most likely leading to another budget shortfall in FY 2016. Todays bill is only a BandAid. a temporary solution. because of budget caps. To be clear. if we continue to ignore the new reality of increased demand and higher costs. delivery of healthcare services to millions of currently enrolled veterans will be devastated for the foreseeable future.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act of 2015. This bill fixes a longstanding problem with the tax code that harms the ability of volunteer fire departments to recruit and retain both firefighters and emergency service personnel. For years. local and State governments have provided their volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits including Length of Service Award Plans. commonly known as LOSAPs. These are pensionlike benefits for volunteer emergency responders. Unfortunately. the way the tax code handles LOSAPs hinders the ability of departments to administer plans and makes it more difficult for volunteer emergency personnel to receive benefits. My bill would simplify the taxation of LOSAPs in two steps. First. it would allow an election to treat LOSAPs as deferred compensation plans. and second. it would exempt them from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These two changes will improve access to LOSAP benefits for volunteer emergency responders. without increasing Federal spending. Today. an estimated 180.000 volunteer firefighters across 27 states participate in some form of LOSAP. Many states that do not offer these benefits would be more likely to do so if the Federal tax code were simplified. This. in turn. would help volunteer fire departments to recruit more easily and retain personnel. These men and women. our local first responders. are the foundation of our emergency response capabilities. These volunteers put their lives on the line to help protect our communities. and their spirit of selflessness and service should be rewarded. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator SCHUMER. and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill through the Senate and into law.",

Azerbaijani rioters started a murderous rampage in response to peaceful protests on February 27. 1988. that forever changed Armenia. During those three days. scores of Armenians were killed. hundreds were wounded. and thousands were forced to leave their homes and livelihoods behind. As we recognize this tragedy. we should also take this time to commend the people of Nagorno Karabakh on being the first to demand their right to freedom and selfgovernance from the Soviet Union. Although a small nation. Nagorno Karabakh sparked the democracy movement that ended decades of dictatorial rule in the USSR and eventually led to the fall of the Soviet Union. Sadly. the Azerbaijani government continues to act as an aggressor today. In November 2014. Azerbaijani armed forces shot down a NagornoKarabakh helicopter participating in a training exercise near the ceasefire line. killing the three crew members on board. This aggression is completely unacceptable and further hurts efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution. Today. I ask my colleagues to stand with the proud people of Nagorno Karabakh in recognizing the anniversary of these tragic events.

This misguided bill would reinstate procedural rules that failed thirty years ago. stripping federal judges of the ability to impose the sanctions they deem appropriate for bringing frivolous lawsuits. During the ten years the old rules were in effect. judges completely lost their discretion about whether or not to impose sanctions on attorneys and were forced to issue harsh penalties for even the smallest infractions. Heavy punishments under the old system lead to endless motions that clogged our already burdened legal system. preventing access to justice. Moreover. had the provisions in this bill been law for all of the twentieth century. they would have prevented dozens of landmark civil rights cases from moving forward. Under this bill. both Brown v. Board of Education. which struck down school segregation. and Loving v. Virginia. which eliminated bans on interracial marriage. might not have made it into the courtroom. To rectify this situation. Congress in 1993 brought back the standards that existed during the Civil Rights Era. giving judges more flexibility and focusing on deterrence. rather than punishment. H.R. 758 would undo that work by abandoning our faith in judicial prudence. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past. and we should not allow this bill to become law.",

When the first Planned Parenthood video was made public. I called it horrific and inhumane. and called for an immediate investigation.

I rise today in recognition of the 100th Anniversary of the New Bedford Symphony Orchestra and in celebration of a century of music. entertainment and education in the arts to the public. The New Bedford Symphony Orchestra owes its establishment to Clarence Arey. a Fairhaven music teacher who founded the thenNew Bedford Philharmonic Orchestra to provide quality performances of classical music for his community. It is recognized as the third oldest symphonic group in Massachusetts and one of the first twenty established in the nation. Today. the Orchestra performs six symphonic concerts. six chamber music concerts and a holiday Pops every year. These widely attended events are renowned as a pillar and celebration of the arts from the South Coast and beyond. Their performances enrich the lives of adults and children alike through the power of music and exposure to the fine arts. When Clarence Arey founded the New Bedford Symphony Orchestra. he did so with a very specific goal in mindproviding his students with a place to continue practicing and growing their talents and abilities after they left the school. It is in that spirit that the Orchestra continues to offer a free music education to over 30.000 students annually. The Orchestra does this in coordination with schools in the region at all age groupsfrom organizing its signature programs for preschool. elementary. and adolescent programs. including Symphony Tales. Music in the Morning. Youth Orchestras and the Strings Program. Designed to ignite a passion for music in future generations. the Orchestra also works with music teachers to establish and collaborate on education frameworks. and provides resources to assist in teaching their students. Mr. Speaker. the 100th Anniversary of the New Bedford Symphony Orchestra provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the significance of the fine arts in Massachusettsand our nationshistory. May this historic Orchestra continue to enrich our lives with the power of music for years to come.",

A trailblazer and tourdeforce in every aspect of her life. Mrs. McEvoy left a lasting impact on family. friends. colleagues. and community. Mrs. McEvoy occupies. in particular. a special place in the hearts of Marin County residents. Along with serving as Chairwoman of the San Francisco Chronicle. a leader in several philanthropic causes. and a lifelong advocate for womens rights. Mrs. McEvoy also ran an olive farm near Petaluma. Originally intended as a getaway for her family to experience the beauty Northern California offers. McEvoy Ranch today produces highquality oils and body care products for specialty stores across the nation. While Mrs. McEvoys time in Marin represents just a slice of her collective achievements. its an apt metaphor for the remarkable life she led. When she first proposed the idea to grow olives. people told her that it wouldnt workthat she should use the land for cattle. perhaps. She ignored her critics. and moved forward with her original plan. Today. McEvoy Ranch now grows more than 18.000 trees and receives accolades from national media and local voices alike. In Mrs. McEvoys way. though. her efforts have not just proven successful financially. but also for our community as a whole. The ranch uses certified organic farming practices. produces its own compost. andas of 2009meets half its electrical needs with an onsite windmill. the first privatelyowned turbine of its size in the county. Nan McEvoy was a leader in our community and a voice for the underserved. While her professional success was remarkable. its her passion for life and compassion for others that will endure. It is therefore appropriate that we pay tribute to her today and express our deepest condolences to her son and grandchildren.",

Although the country temporarily lost its independence due to Soviet aggression. it regained full independence in 1990. Since regaining independence. Azerbaijan has been one of Americas closest allies in the Middle East. Throughout Operation Enduring Freedom. Azerbaijan worked closely with our armed forces against radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan. Not only did Azerbaijani forces fight alongside our forces. but they also provided crucial refueling. landing. and airspace rights for our armed forces. Over a third of all nonlethal equipment for our troops in Afghanistan went through Azerbaijan. Our military cooperation with Azerbaijan was strengthened in 2011. and remains vital today. Today we see the Middle East under attack. Terrorist groups with no regard for human life have torn the region apart. Now. more than ever. we see the tremendous importance for a close ally. We are extremely fortunate to have that ally in Azerbaijan. I ask that my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Azerbaijans independence and thanking them for their strong partnership.",

And so my question and my inquiry is to the new. incoming Governor for the State of Texas. Governor Abbott. to find value in this medical facility because of its historic relationship. It once housed the only outside posttraumatic stress disorder center in Houston outside of the veterans hospital system. It was well attended by veterans who loved the idea of a center that was away from the massive hospital system. It serves people who are poor in the neighborhood and seniors. It has helped those who suffer from substance abuse. and I believe that it needs and desires and deserves a new start. I will be working with a variety of agencies to do that. and will not be ashamed that unfortunately tragic or. let me say. misbehavior of some caused this unfortunate turn in this hospital.

I want to share a letter I received from a woman in Columbus: Im devastated by the events this weekend in Orlando. Frankly. I have had to personally be retriggered with every mass shooting thats occurred in the past three years. My tragedy occurred 3 years ago this July. The love of my life. best friend and man I was going to marry was murdered .... He was shot to death by a prior felon with a gun. It can happen to anyone. anywhere. at anytime. for any reason. Change is needed now. We cant keep waiting. . . . Please do something. Anything. Saving one person from feeling the hell Ive felt these past three years is worth it. My heart hurts for the loved ones affected by this weekend. because I know this pain. I guess this is just a question. and maybe there is no answer. But why. when so many in our country have felt this paincertainly. the pain is felt more among poorer people and people of color because they have been the victims far too often and. in the great majority of cases. are totally innocent. and far too many of them are children. whether it is Sandy Hook or a random shooting in Cleveland or Newark or Hartford or Detroit or New Haven. What do I tell this woman from Cincinnati or from Columbus who says to me: Cant you do something? Why should more people have the pain she has felt?",

I think the answer is we have to look at ourselves sometimes. and ask: Have we fought as hard as we possibly could to galvanize the American public around these changes? The reality isand I said this earlier on the floorthat the small handful of individuals in this country who oppose these changes are calling our offices sometimes with more frequency than the large majority of Americans who support these changes. and they take cues from us. So that is why we are here. We were about to come back to the Senate and just proceed with business as usual. As if Orlando didnt happen. we were just going to start debating amendments to the CommerceJustice- Science act. Those on the floor todaycertainly. in particular myself. Senator BOOKER. and Senator BLUMENTHALsaid: Enough. Enough. We have to give a signal to the American public that we carethat we care so deeply about the consequences of inaction that we are. at the very least. going to stop this process from moving forward until we cant stand any longer. Now that is a tiny. tiny sacrifice. But at least it shows we are willing to put something behind the passion that letter writer and many others have. So there are a variety of answers to your question. I say to Senator BROWNthe strength of the gun lobby. the misunderstanding about the nature of the Second Amendment. and the data that we have not done a good enough job of getting out there that talks about the efficacy of stronger gun laws. But this exercise today on the floor is also a part of changing that reality. With that.

They are pretty simple. they are bipartisan. and they are noncontroversial outside of this body. One. we want a version of the Feinstein bill. which prohibits individuals on the nofly list from getting a gun to come before the Senate Floor for a vote. Second. in order to make that bill effective. we want a version of the ManchinToomey compromise to expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales to come before the Senate for a vote. Both of those measures are supported broadly by 80 to 90 percent of the American public. and both are necessary in order to protect Americans from terrorist attack. Why? Because we know last year 90 percent of individuals who were on the nofly list and who tried to buy a gun were successful in buying one. The only reason 10 percent werent is because they were on some other list of prohibited individuals. So we know every year there are individuals on the nofly list who are trying to buy guns and they are getting them. We know. unfortunately. the individualthe shooterin Orlando was at least for a period of time on those lists. and he went and bought a gun. In order to make it effective. you also have to make sure you are capturing gun sales that happen online and at gun shows. We think what we are asking for is pretty simple. Both those proposals have drawn bipartisan support. Neither are controversial outside this body. And. frankly. it is about the lowest hanging fruit we could imagine in order to get this body on record as trying to stop the carnage in this country. I yield for a question.",

The alternative that has been proposed to Senator FEINSTEINS legislation is laughable. in that it would require the FBI and law enforcement to go to court every single time they want to stop someone on the nofly list from getting a weapon. It wouldnt be automatic. Instead. they would have 3 days to scurry into a court. file a motion to deny the weapon. and have a hearing. First of all. there is no way all of that could happen in 3 days. but it certainly cant happen with the resources we provide them. So they do not have the resources they need right now in order to protect us from these myriad of threats that are posed from this desire of ISIS and others to inspire lonewolf attacks.

It is probably around the hour when people are getting home. and they are wondering why we are here. why the Senator is choosing to hold the floor in this extended debate. People should know that our Nation has seen a string of gun tragedies. The Senators home State of Connecticut saw the horrific Sandy Hook shooting of young children. In San Bernardino we saw an ISILinspired terrorist attack. This terrorist slaughtered his former coworkersinnocent people. In Orlando. a disturbed man. perhaps inspired by ISIL. murdered 49 people in cold blood. This was an assault on the LGBT communitya hate crime. In the last week. in my home State of New Mexico. we have seen some terrible gun tragedies. A man is now accused of murdering his wife and four children in Roswell. NM. There are so many tragedies. and they all have different reasons. But one thing that almost all of us agree on is that we must do more to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who mean harm to others or to themselves. You should have to pass a background check to buy a gun. If you are a risk to others because of a history of making threats or because you may be affiliated with a known terrorist organization. law enforcement should be able to step in and prevent you from buying weapons. The first thing I wanted to ask the Senator from Connecticut. for people who are just tuning in right now. is this: What are the two amendments that you are seeking to vote on today. and how would they help stem this tied of horrific violence that we are seeing across the country. and as you have continually pointed out happens every day?",

We think there is common ground on these issues. We cant think of any excuse why we cant come together and figure out a way to get these passed. We have taken votes in the past. and votes are important and would be important if we took them. but what would be more important is to bridge our differences.

    "speech": "I ask one additional question through the Chair. Many New Mexicans live in very rural areas near the border with Mexico. Carrying a gun is not unusual in those areas. It is a different way of life than in Connecticut or anywhere on the east coast. For example. the entire State of Connecticut is about 5.500 square miles. with a population of 3.5 million. Hidalgo County. NM. one of our 33 counties in southwestern New Mexico. is almost 3.500 square miles and has a population of fewer than 5.000. Many of the ranches there are tens of thousands of acres. They are in the remote boot heel area of the State. a region that is divided by mountain ranges and that borders Mexico on two sides. So I understand why many New Mexicans feel safer carrying a firearm. They might be miles from the closest help. It might take law enforcement a significant time to reach them. So I certainly dont want to do anything to infringe on their right to protect themselves with a firearm. But I would ask my friend from Connecticut who has worked on this issue so long and understands this so well. would any of the proposals we are asking to get a vote on take away their rights to purchase or own a firearm?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the House will soon consider legislation to address sanctuary cities. local policies that skirt Federal policies regarding the detention of undocumented individuals who have broken the law. a policy that led recently to a terrible tragedy. We should address this. It is right we do so. But I rise out of concern for the enforcement mechanism in the current draft of the legislation. The current draft would penalize sanctuary cities by reducing assistance to law enforcement. the very men and women we rely on each day to keep us safe. Consider the irony. To promote greater public safety in law enforcement. we are threatening to reduce assistance to law enforcement. when it is commissions and councils that actually adopt policies regarding sanctuary cities. This is simply wrong. We can do better. I anticipate voting for passage because we need to address this issue nationally. but I ask my colleagues today to work together. Lets replace this shortsighted provision that wrongfully punishes those who serve us each day on the front lines of law enforcement. men and women that. months ago. we lauded on this House floor during Police Week for the fine work they do. Lets not reduce resources for law enforcement. Lets ensure that we are able to increase and continue to invest in local law enforcement.",

The House will vote on this bill today. I share the concerns of many of my constituents in Californias 13th Congressional District about the proliferation of untested. genetically modified foods entering our food supply. I also share the concerns about the risks to farmers. the environment. and public health created by the rushed commercialization of genetically engineered crops and genetically modified food products. American consumers deserve the best information available when it comes to food choices that they make for themselves and their families. Already. some 64 nations around the world require GMO labeling. We need to be on the side of transparency and the safety of the people we represent. That is why I support legislation like Representative PETER DEFAZIOs Genetically Engineered Food RighttoKnow Act. H.R. 913. which would require the labeling of genetically engineered foods at the Federal level. So I hope my colleagues will defeat H.R. 1599 and move forward with Federal efforts requiring adequate and clear labeling for the foods American families are eating.",

I had the honor of meeting with 11yearold Skye Archibald from Exeter. New Hampshire. who was in Washington as part of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundations Childrens Congress. Skye was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the young age of 9 and. since then. has been vital in changing the stigma attached with diabetes. raising money to help find a cure. and advocating at both the Federal and State level. In fact. her hard work and dedication has resulted in the signing of a bill by New Hampshires own Governor.

The Eagle Scout rank is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performancebased achievement with high standards that have been wellmaintained for more than a century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank. a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges. as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Jeffreys Eagle Scout project involved constructing a large sign to be placed in the yard at Country Haven. a residential care facility. making it easier for people to locate the facility. The work ethic Jeffrey has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker. the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work. dedication and perseverance.

Ryanne is a student at Enarson Elementary in Villisca. Iowa. The theme for this essay contest was \"What Does A Veteran Mean To Me?\". and was open to all fifth graders in public. private. and home schools throughout Iowa. Ryannes essay reads: I deeply thought about what a veteran means to me. I have chosen to share emotional descriptions of what a veteran means to me. The initial meaning of a veteran to me is how fear is considered. understood. and accepted but they still make the decision to face this fear for the freedom of their families and all other families they are standing strong for. The second meaning of a veteran to me is courage. The attitude of never giving up. never backing down. and always remaining faithful. These are characteristics of semper fidelis. The third meaning I want to express is brotherhood. which is described as equally caring for the life of your fellow soldier. The fact that no one is left behind especially the veterans that are KIA. MIA. or POW. I will carry memories of them with me forever. Mr. Speaker. I applaud and congratulate Ryanne for earning this award.

Bill Haney graduated from the College of New Jersey with a Bachelor of Science in Education. While teaching elementary school in Talbot County. Maryland. Bill worked to earn his Masters Degree in Supervision and Human Relations from George Washington University. In 1983. Mr. Haney accepted the position of Chief Executive Officer of Every Citizen Has Opportunities. Inc. (ECHO). a Leesburg. Virginia based nonprofit which provides employment. training. and community integration to individuals with disabilities. Mr. Haney has decided it is time to retire from his lifes work. thus ending a bright chapter in ECHOs history. As Mr. Haneys extraordinary career comes to a close. I would like to take a moment to highlight the work he has done over the years. When Mr. Haney took over as CEO at ECHO. the organization was supporting about 75 individuals with disabilities. with an annual budget of under three hundred thousand dollars. and only two worksites. Under Mr. Haneys leadership. ECHOs budget has grown to nearly five million dollars. and has expanded services to nearly 170 individuals with disabilities. ECHO has approximately 15 work locations. ranging from Loudoun County Public Schools to Inova Hospitals. In addition to his work at ECHO. Mr. Haney has extended his skills to the community through his work on the Board of Directors for the Loudoun County Red Cross. as Cubmaster for the Pack 11 Boy Scouts in Boyce. Virginia. and as a Sunday school teacher at St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Front Royal. Virginia. Mr. Haney leaves ECHO after a storied 33 years at the helm with zero debt. positive cash flow. and outright ownership of its facility. ECHO will continue serving our community. but without a doubt. will miss Mr. Haneys leadership and dedication. At this moment. Mr. Speaker.

It tried to eliminate auto dealer discounts. essentially helping consumers. on the grounds that these discounts create a fair credit risk. Now. there are two major problems with what they did. First. the CFPBs actions will actually raise costs. raise credit costs for familiesthese very same families that are having a tough time. as it is. in this economy because this is a bad economy right nowand make it harder for these family to purchase a car. Secondly. the CFPBs action is expressly prohibited by law from regulating auto dealers by the authorizing statute in DoddFrank. You see. the CFPB acted behind closed doors. without any transparency or input from the general public that they are supposed to be protecting. to circumvent. to go around the law. and found an indirect way to alter an industry that the CFPB is prohibited by law from doing.

I also agree with the proponents of this bill that the CFPB cant directly regulate auto dealers. and I dont think the CFPB wants to regulate auto dealers. The problem with this bill is that it doesnt help auto dealers. and it is not a response to CFPB regulatory overreach. What the CFPB does have jurisdiction over is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. A few years ago. the Bureau noticed a funny thing: that minorities were paying higher markups on auto loans. even when you control for credit risk and other factors. discounts. They noticed if you were Jesus Rodriguez or Barack Obama Jones that somehow you paid a higher price for the car. Now. the problem is that this legislation attempts to free the auto dealers from discrimination. Of course. discrimination is a violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The CFPB and the Department of Justice brought actions against these lenders for violations of ECOA. We heard from the other side that there was no evidence that these car dealers had done anything wrong. No. because it didnt go to court. That is why there was no evidence. It went to settlement. and they settled for $140 million. Pretty simple. the CFPB protected borrowers from discrimination and then put out helpful guidance. So why are we here today. Mr. Chairman?

First. the CFPB issued its bulletin in order to get around the rulemaking process for indirect auto lending. This kind of guidance is traditionally used as a mere restatement of law or to provide further explanation of rulemaking. It is not traditionally used to make a major policy like fundamentally altering the auto loan market. Second. it is clear that the CFPB is unwilling to publish online all of the data and assumptions it has relied upon for this guidance. Providing these details should be an obvious and easy step to implement for any credible government agency. Unfortunately. because the CFPB is not subject to the appropriations process. they seem unwilling to comply with even the most commonsense oversight by Congress. Therefore. H.R. 1737 is necessary to require the CFPB to provide for a notice and comment period before it can reissue any related guidance. Mr. Chairman. this compromise legislation represents fair and reasonable adjustments to the CFPBs regulatory guidance process intended to promote transparency and accountability for regulators. This legislation is truly a bipartisan effort that was supported in committee by 13 Members on the minority side of the aisle. I am also glad to see widespread support for this legislation from a range of groups. including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. the National Automobile Dealers Association. the national RV Dealers Association. the Independent Community Bankers Association. and the Credit Union National Association. Mr. Chairman. last year I was proud to introduce legislation similar to Mr. GUINTAs after hearing from so many auto dealers in my State the frustrations they had with this particular rule. I am proud to support this legislation. and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help us promote greater transparency and accountability and bring common sense back to the marketplace. Again. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire .",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1737. Mr. Chairman. this legislation is yet another attempt to obstruct the most important watchdog working on behalf of U.S. consumers. the CFPB. Since its creation. the agency has returned over $11 billion to more than 25 million consumers harmed by unfair and deceptive practices. Its work is absolutely essential for everyday Americans. giving them the security of knowing that there is someone on their side. One area where the CFPBs role is increasingly important is auto finance. where outstanding car and truck loan balances now reach $1 trillion. the highest in history. Unfortunately. discrimination is still alive and well in the indirect auto lending marketplace. In the three settlements to date against Ally Financial. Fifth Third Bank. and Honda. the CFPB secured nearly $140 million in borrower relief and penalties. It found that minority borrowers paid $200 more over the life of a car loan than White borrowers. even when controlling for borrowers creditworthiness. The CFPBs findings are consistent with decades of litigation and research that confirm that discretionary markups in indirect auto lending cause millions of dollars in overpayments from minority borrowers. To further their work in this area. the CFPB issued specific guidance regarding auto lending practices. Unfortunately. H.R. 1737 will repeal this guidance and place absurd restrictions on the reissuance of any new guidance. These new restrictions would be unique to the CFPB and would place an unprecedented burden on the agencys issuance of guidance designed to help lenders comply with Federal fair lending laws. This undermines the basic role of the CFPB and will create uncertainty regarding the application of Federal lending laws in the auto finance sector. The Acting CHAIR .

I have been a champion of the consumer and have fought for their protection. As a member of the Financial Services Committee. I strongly supported the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and continue to be a strident defender and proponent of CFPB. I support this bill to correct the CFPBs guidance with respect to indirect auto lending. which would increase the cost of consumer financing. In our effort to find discrimination in the marketplace. we must be careful not to push for policy solutions that hurt the very consumers we are trying to protect. This bill does not prevent nor hinder the CFPB or any agency from enforcing fair lending laws. Rather. it provides an opportunity to reissue the guidance in a more inclusive and transparent manner. As part of our mission to protect consumers. I urge the CFPB to work closely with stakeholders to improve the guidance in this important area. I also encourage the Bureau to develop and implement a financial literacy program aimed at teaching consumers the skills necessary to make informed financial decisions regarding the purchase of an auto through the use of financing. We need to do everything we can to ensure Americans have the basic financial literacy skills to enable them to navigate our increasingly complex financial system and make good. informed decisions.",

And if they are even lucky enough to get an education. how they are going to be able to afford to pay off that education. how they are going to find a wellpaying job that can help them pay off that education. buy their first home. start a family. and send their own kids to school. That is the issue that the Future Forum is going to address. We are going to address this issue. the American Dream of homeownership. and something very important to millennials. diversity and equality. Millennials make up about 75 million people of the American population. It is the most diverse generation in Americas history. We believe in the Future Forum that we are uniquely suited for this because we are a part of the future too. and it is time that the party of the future starts talking to the future. We will be taking time on the House floor and at events around the country to meet with and listen to younger Americans about how we in government can better ensure that younger Americans have the opportunities that will allow them not only to dream but to achieve. This is a twoway conversation. We will use technology and a collaborative approach in our communications and in our outreach. Our policy priorities are very simple: college access and affordability. job security and entrepreneurship. and equality and diversity. Many of the members of the Future Forum were called to public service because of what happened on September 11. A recent Center for American Progress survey found that the defining issue for millennials is September 11. As I stand in this well. we are just 3 days from the Department of Homeland Security being shut down. I have invited members of the Future Forum to share their own personal story about how they were called to service and what homeland security means to them and their constituents. I would first like to invite down a freshman Member. I yield time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania",

Third U.S. Army. U.S. Joint Forces Command. and I Corps. His combat deployments include Operation Just Cause (Panama). Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (Kuwait). and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq). Although he is a highly decorated Soldier with more than 28 years of service to his credit. perhaps his most notable accomplishments have occurred off of the parade field. For example. prior to beginning his military service. Colonel Lissner worked with severely mentally and physically handicapped children. taught Physical Education. and coached a variety of sports at the scholastic and collegiate levels.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we talk a lot in this Chamber about the negative impacts of overly burdensome rules and regulations handed down by bureaucrats in Washington. Nowhere are the potential negative consequences more evident than the 700page rule proposed by the Department of Labor. Among other things. it expands the Departments complex pension rules to cover IRAs as well as changes the definition of who is classified as a financial adviser. Ultimately. I believe this rule will restrict access to advice and drive up costs for small businesses. It also illustrates a fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want everyone to end up in the same place with identical outcomes. and Republicans believe in providing individuals with the same level of opportunity. This rule seeks guaranteed outcomes for everyone. but there are inherent risks associated with investing. While I am open to modernizing current rules in order to protect consumers against predatory practices that pose unnecessary risks. I will not support efforts that make it harder for American families to save and plan for retirement.",

He began his career a half century ago at Roosevelt Junior High School in Port Angeles. Washington. where he taught seventh grade homeroom and coached football. I have met so many people who had him as a teacher. I think he may have taught my entire hometown. But the common themes from his former students that I have met have been these: He was a great teacher. He cared about me as a student. He didnt just teach me English and geography. he taught me to be a better student and a better person. Earlier this week. he finished out his career at the Chrysalis School in Woodinville. Washington. and yesterday he had his first welldeserved day of retirement. Mr. Speaker. the teacher that I rise to honor today is named J.C. Kilmer. and he is my dad. Mark Twain remarked that the two most important days in a persons life are the day he is born and the day he figures out why. My father was born to teach. And like so many fantastic educators. he has affected so many lives in so many ways. So today I hope you will join me in thanking a teacher.

He received a 100 percent serviceconnected disability. but that hasnt held him back. Daniel completed a blind rehabilitation program at the Southern Arizona VA. He enrolled at the University of Arizona and was instrumental in establishing its student veterans center. a place that offers assistance to transitioning student veterans. The center now is a national model for Student Veterans of America. Today. Daniel is a staunch advocate for veterans across the country. He credits his education as being the most important factor in helping him overcome his disability. and he now helps countless other veterans earn their degrees. In advance of Veterans Day. I thank all the men and women like Daniel who serve and served our Nation and continue to make a difference today.",

Stephen Talley. known as Steve. who passed away last week after his battle with cancer at the age of 62. Steve was 11 years old when he began his career. creating and selling his artwork. That passion is what led him to pursue and share his artistic vision with the community and the world. For more than 30 years. Steve taught art at San Jacinto High School. touching the life of every student who sat in his class. He was known internationally for his work. winning more than 100 awards in numerous competitions. many of them in first place. He never let his success get in the way of his commitment to his students and. as a result. he has inspired a new generation of artists to never give up on their dreams.

Montana is blessed with a rich legacy of service. and it is my honor to recognize not only Ricks service to our country. but his work to make quality health care accessible for all Montana veterans. Rick proudly served our country as a marine from January 1971 to January 1975. Unfortunately. his current illness requires constant care and attention. His wife. Sharon. long served as his primary roundtheclock caretaker and was confined to their home due to Ricks condition. which required an external ventilator to breathe at all times. Eventually his needs surpassed his ability to stay home. and he had to move into a longterm care facility. While Rick was still at home. the Rosebud Health Care Center. RHCC. facility initiated a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA. to be able to provide care and services to veterans in its longterm care unit. The previous aging and resource center for Rosebud County was in Glendive. MT. about 1 hour and 40 minutes away from Ricks home in Forsyth. MT. Thankfully. RHCC received approval from the VA to provide care services close to home for Rick on November 1. Ricks persistence and advocacy throughout his illness helped serve as the catalyst for RHCC establishing a contract with the VA that allows for veterans to receive longterm care in Forsyth. Our State has one of the largest populations of veterans per capita. and Ricks efforts have led the VA to create additional resources to help to provide health care services to Montanas extensive veteran population. I am so proud to have advocates like Rick and Sharon fighting for veterans in Montana. Through his inspiring work to increase veterans access to care. Rick Young has created an unmatchable legacy that will leave a lasting mark on our State. Keep fighting. Rick. I am rooting for you.O",

It gives me great pleasure to see him receive this prestigious award after years of hard work within northern Nevada. In 1998. Mr. Landon began his air ambulance career in Greeley. CO. In 2003. he joined Care Flight in Reno and has since served as safety and training coordinator and flight paramedic. During his time at Care Flight. he has been a key contributor in the founding of a formalized safety committee. which meets twice a month and is comprised of medical flight staff pilots. air communication specialists. managers. and maintenance personnel. This important committee. chaired by Mr. Landon. works to review. develop. and implement safety initiatives for Care Flight and those that it serves. As chair. Mr. Landon spearheads important safety trainings. including an annual training for hospital emergency departments. prehospital agencies. and ski patrols servicing a 40.000 square mile area. His unwavering dedication to Care Flight in Reno has helped provide hundreds of hours of safety and medical training needed to save lives throughout northern Nevada. His work for our State is invaluable. The Lynn Stevens Excellence in Safety Award goes to individuals who have gone above and beyond in the transportation community to promote safety awareness. This accolade is truly prestigious and attained by only the most influential members in this community. Since 1981. Care Flight has served northern Nevadas health organizations as an important resource for transportation with flight paramedics and pilots to respond to a variety of medical emergencies. Our State is fortunate to have someone like Mr. Landon serving Care Flight and its safety initiatives. Throughout his tenure. Mr. Landon has demonstrated professionalism. commitment to excellence. and dedication to his trade. I am honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today.

I strongly believe that in order to be a Congresswoman. I had to first see myself as a Congresswoman. The person who most embodied that was Shirley Chisholm. Through herI was able to see that I too could be in Congress. I too could represent my community and work towards positive change for people who were denied a seat at the table. I am fortunate to have met Ms. Chisholm before she passed away. I took a train to Mount Holyoke my senior year at Princeton to interview Ms. Chisholm for my senior thesis. \"Black Women in Politics: Our Time Has Come.\" As luck would have it. it started to snow just as soon as I sat down in the chair across from her. My thirty minute interview turned into a four hour interview. and Ms. Chisholm shared the challenges and struggles she encountered as the first AfricanAmerican woman ever elected to Congress. Whenever I feel the weight of the world resting on my shoulder . . . I walk by her portrait hanging in the Capitol to remind myself of her strength. courage. and conviction. I know that whatever challenges I have encountered pale in comparison to the trials she faced. It was not easy for her to walk the halls of Congress as the only black woman. She opened the door for Barbara Jordan. and everyone else who followed including me. Even though many barriers have been broken since her tenure here. there is still much work to do. Ms. Chisholm once said that \"service is the rent we pay for the privilege of living on this earth.\" I can only hope that my service in this august body will one day inspire others to work for a better. more just society in the same manner that Shirley Chisholm has inspired me.",

Congresswoman Chisholm was the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Congress and the first woman (and African American) to run for a major partys presidential nomination. The Congresswoman was also one of the 12 founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. She was a catalyst for change. To quote Congresswoman Chisholm. \"You dont make progress by standing on the sidelines. whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas.\" Let us remember her words during the remainder of our legislative session. The Members of this House have the opportunity to implement ideas that can transform this nation. Just yesterday. we approved the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and address some of our nations most pressing public education issues. The bill protects Title I funding. ensures equitable allocation of resources to schools. recognizes the importance of afterschool education. and maintains subgroup disaggregation of data for reporting. The ESSA also gives states and local school districts more flexibility. while preserving the federal role in education and ensuring that states and districts honor the civil rights legacy of ESEA. I am pleased my colleagues came together to pass this important bill. While not perfect. the ESSA is a step forward for public education in this country. As Congresswoman Chisholm also said. \"I dont measure America by its achievement but by its potential.\" Yesterdays actions showed the nation this Congress has great potential to put politics aside and serve the best interests of the American people. May we continue in this spirit. and let us honor Congresswoman Chisholm by working together to improve the lives of all Americans.",

Betts said that unlike during other conflicts. including those in Southeast Asia. the Balkans and Central America. governments are not stepping up to offer assistance commensurate with the scale of a problem that now touches virtually every corner of the globe. \"This isnt a regional problem.\" he said. \"Its a global challenge.\" The UNHCRs report identifies at least 15 wars across three continents that have either erupted or reignited in the past five years. and that together have forced millions to abandon their homes. A total of 13.9 million people were displaced in 2014 alone. About a third of those were in subSaharan Africa. where wars in the Central African Republic. South Sudan. Somalia. Nigeria and Congo all flared. Somalia alone is the source of more than a million refugees. the worlds thirdhighest total. Europe experienced the biggest proportional increase in displaced persons last year. with a staggering 51 percent increase over 2013. While much of that was due to Syrian refugees streaming into Turkey. it also reflected the 219.000 people who entered the continent via the perilous journey across the Mediterranean. And as Russianbacked rebels brought war back to European soil. more than 800.000 people were left internally displaced in Ukraine. About 200.000 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Russia. Worldwide. the number of internally displaced people vastly outstripped the number of refugees. Once people fled their home countries. they had little hope of returning. Just 126.800 refugees went back to their home countries in 2014 out of a global refugee population of 14.4 million. That marked the lowest level of return since 1983.",

The legislation also enhances confidential reporting options for victims of sexual assault and increases access to timely disclosure of certain materials and information in connection with the prosecution of offenses. On management reform. the NDAA ensures the Department of Defense and the military services are using precious defense dollars to fulfill their missions and defend the Nation. not expand their bloated staffs. While staff at Army Headquarters increased 60 percent over the past decade. the Army is now cutting brigade combat teams. The Air Force evaded mandated cuts to Headquarters personnel by creating two new Headquarters entities. while at the same time complaining it had insufficient personnel to maintain combat aircraft. The NDAA directs targeted reductions in Headquarters and administrative staff that would generate $1.7 billion in savings in just the next fiscal year. With these savings and billions more identified. this bill invests in providing critical military capabilities for our warfighters and meeting the unfunded priorities of our service chiefs and combatant commanders. Even as challenges to maritime security increase in the Middle East and the Western Pacific and pressures on our shipbuilding budget increase. the Navy remains well below its fleet size requirement of 306 ships. The NDAA directs savings identified in the budget request to accelerate Navy modernization and shipbuilding. to mitigate impacts of the Ohioclass ballistic missile submarine replacement. and to grow the Navy to meet rising threats. As adversaries seek to counter and thwart American military power. the NDAA looks to the future and invests in the technologies that will maintain Americas military technological superiority.

What is happening to American credibility in terms of foreign policy? We used to be the shining city on the hill. a beacon of strength. a beacon of freedom. Countries that wanted to do us harm didnt because they feared us. Our allies respected and trusted us. But. unfortunately. that is starting to change. It is changing. Red lines have been crossed with no consequences in places such as Syria. Ukraine. Russia. and in the Iranian negotiations. Many say American credibility has declined.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I appreciate Mr. VAN HOLLEN yielding. We are talking a lot about gimmicks. Even the conservative Financial Times said the Republicans had to resort to smoke and mirrors to make this budget balance. But I want to talk about one of the other tricks that is used. What the Republicans budget uses is they do something called dynamic scoring. which basically allows you to project all sorts of. probably. at least. speculative growth based on policies that they would anticipate doing. Now. here is a realworld example of that. This weekend is the Kentucky Derby. It would be as if somebody went out and said: I am going to buy a 2yearold for $2 million. And then that 2yearold I am sure is going to win the Kentucky Derby. so I am going to use that $3 million purse that that horse is certainly going to win next year. and I am going to plug that into my budget so my budget comes out ahead. Yes. it could happen. but there is no evidence to believe it will happen. That is one of the ways that this budget reaches socalled balance. There are other macroeconomic effects which we ought to consider. however. As we have mentioned several times. this budget would direct the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The Deloitte professional services firm just did an audit of Kentuckys experience over the last 14 months. 15 months. with the Affordable Care Act. Here is what it said would happen in Kentucky over the next 6 years. $30 billion in increased economic activity. 44.000 new jobs. and a positive impact on the Kentucky State budget of $850 millionthat is what would be eliminated from Kentucky. That is another effect of the Republican budget. Think about what it might do in other StatesCalifornia. New York. Florida. For it to have that much impact in a State like Kentucky. the national effect would be very consequential. Aside from all of the truly damaging ways in which this budget affects our economy and our citizens. we have to take note of the fact that there are impacts beyond just the Federal budget. and this budget would be a disaster for the American economy and the American people.

I am excited to say that. for the first time in many years. the House and Senate will adopt a unified resolution for a balanced budget. The 2016 Federal budget resolution will set the guardrails for Federal spending. and it is a step in the right direction for our country. Families in my home State of Michigan and across the country tighten their belts when there is a change in household income or expenses. and Washington needs to do the same. The 2016 budget resolution does not raise taxes on hardworking Americans. It keeps the promises that have been made to seniors while slowing the soaring national debt. Leaving less debt to our children is vital. and if we fail to act. debt payments will crowd out spending for the priorities of the American people. including national security and protecting the Great Lakes. This budget provides for flexibility. and it gives States the opportunity to innovate on Medicaid policy. allowing them to design a safety net that works best for those in need. This will move Medicaid further away from Washington bureaucrats and closer to the people it was meant to serve. This budget also calls for tax reform. which has the potential to add 1 million new private sector jobs. The Tax Code is over 74.000 pages long and was last overhauled 29 years ago. It is time for a progrowth Tax Code that is simpler and fairer.

Written by House and Senate Republicans alone. it reaffirms their commitment to a severe and unworkable policy agenda that would harm the economy and that stands little chance of being implemented. This budget conference report draws heavily on the House Republicans budget framework by eliminating the Medicare guarantee. turning Medicaid into a capped block grant. limiting Pell grants for college students. and cutting nutrition assistance while hiding $1 trillion in additional cuts behind a magic asterisk to be filled in at some time in the future. These proposals. if implemented. would be disastrous for our country. and I suspect even most Republicans wouldnt vote to make them law. and I predict they will not vote to make them law. Still. many of its proposals must be taken very seriously. The Republican budget conference report includes reconciliation instructions to fasttrack yet another vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. jeopardizing affordable coverage for millions of Americans with no alternative in sight. It continues the Republican policy of sequester for nondefense priorities this yeara disinvestment suggestion. an undermining of Americas economy and its quality of lifeand further limits our ability to invest in priorities like education. research. and infrastructure by $496 billion below sequester levels over the ensuing decade. This is the same sequester policy that the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee called \"unrealistic and illconceived.\" Let me repeat that. He is the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee. HAL ROGERS of Kentucky. and he said that the policies being pursued in this budget are \"unrealistic and illconceived.\" He is right. Shamelessly. they propose to do all of this while exempting defense spending from the sequester caps. Defense spending needs to be raised. It ought to be raised honestly and not pretend that some slush fund will pay for. not contingencies. which it is intended to do. but for regular defense investments. which we need to do.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. over the next decade. the U.S. is set to spend hundreds of billions of dollars operating and upgrading our nuclear arsenal. But in this budget environment. every dollar we spend to keep our outdated and oversized nuclear arsenal functioning is a dollar we arent spending on other priorities that keep us safe and secure or on reducing our unsustainable debt and deficits. That is why the amendment I am offering with Mr. POLIS will put $167 million towards deficit reduction by placing funding for the new nucleararmed cruise missile warhead back on its original 2015 acquisition schedule. In the FY 2015 budget. production of the warhead was scheduled to begin in 2027. but this years budget request sped up the development for the warhead by 2 years. This is despite the fact that the existing airlaunched cruise missile and warhead isnt being phased out until the 2030s. And there is plenty of uncertainty about whether this program is affordable or even necessary. Chairman SIMPSON is so concerned about the cost of the warhead that language was included in the E and W report to require a red team assessment on the affordability of the programand for good reason. given our history of spending large amounts of money on warhead programs that end up getting tabled. Given the cost concerns over the program. does it really make sense to rush the acquisition process? Furthermore. as some experts note. there is no longer a need to shoot nuclear cruise missiles from far away when we have the most advanced bomber ever created in our arsenal. the B2 stealth bomber. which is capable of penetrating enemy airspace and dropping a nuclear bomb directly above a target. And if we decide we want to shoot nuclear missiles from thousands of miles away. we still have very expensive submarines and very expensive ICBMs capable of doing just that. So ask yourselves: Should we really be accelerating the development of a warhead that goes on a missile we dont need and could cost hundreds of millions. if not billions. more than anticipated? I ask my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment to maintain funding at the programs FY 2015 acquisition schedule. and save the taxpayers $167 million in the process. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I appreciate the gentlemans courtesy in permitting me to speak on the en bloc amendment. and I appreciate the committee having accepted the amendment dealing with cost accountability for the B21 bomber. This is a new weapon that has both conventional and nuclear weapons capability. We are in a situation now where there is tremendous stress on our Defense Department budget with a whole range of weaponry. I think it is more important now than ever that we are able to understand exactly what we are getting into. how much this is going to cost. There is about $1.4 billion already into this. We ought to be able to know what the total commitment is being made. to be able to have appropriate decisions made by Congress. I am deeply concerned that the Defense Department. to this point. has resisted giving an appraisal of what the total cost is going to be. somehow fearing that. if the total budget were available. that would give too much information to our adversaries about the weight. size. and range of the plane. I think not. I think the real danger here is that the American public and Congress would know what the costs are. This is not an acceptable approach as we deal with these critical questions. It is important. Mr. Chairman. that we have full transparency about what the costs are going to be for these massive. expensive. and. in some cases. questionable weapons systems. This is not an argument for or against it. It is an argument for transparency and being able to know what we are getting into. The worst of all possible worlds is making commitments and then finding. 5 and 10 years down the line. that we cant follow through on them or they result in cannibalizing other important priorities. I would think that this is one area that we could all agree we need to have this transparency and have this information available. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.",

In the more than 14 years since its passage. it has been used 37 times in 14 countries to wage war with little or no congressional oversight. It has been used 18 times by President Bush and 19 times by President Obama. This report only looks at unclassified incidents. How many other times has it been used without the knowledge of Congress or the American people? Not only has this authorization been used to justify military action thousands of miles away. it has also been used much closer to home to allow warrantless surveillance and wiretaps. indefinite detention practices at GTMO. and targeted killing by drones. including of American citizens. It has also been cited as the authority for the nearly 2yearlong war against ISIL. a war that Congress has never debated. voted on. or specifically authorized. Mr. Chairman. our brave servicemen and -women continue to be deployed around the world. Whether they are combat troops or not. they are in combat zones. They are risking their lives. Dont we at least owe them our representation in terms of our job to debate and vote on the cost and consequences of the war? I think we owe them that. If we all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled. then why is Congress missing in action? Every day more bombs fall. We have already lost three brave servicemen. We have already spent more than $9.6 billion. and we spend an additional $615.000 per hour. I know that while we may not share a common position on what the shape of any new AUMF to address ISIL might look like. I know that many of us do agree that the overly broad and almost 15yearold AUMF represents a major and very concerning deterioration of congressional oversight. That means a lack of involvement and input and voice of the American people. Lets repeal this blank check and finally. 90 days later. debate and vote on an AUMF to address the ISIL threat.

The President has determined that the 2001 AUMF allows the United States to target ISIS. Both the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs agree that they have full legal authority to combat ISIS. and Congress has supported that view by appropriating funds. Many Members want to enact a new AUMF to renew the authority to fight ISIS and support our troops. but this amendment fails to do so. We must understand that a new AUMF cannot give President Obama any more authority to fight ISIS than he currently claims. It could give him less. The President asked for less in his proposal. It is clear many want an AUMF that limits the authority of this President and the next President. The administration still does not have the broad. overarching strategy needed to defeat these radical Islamist terrorists. Once the President provides that strategy. this House can have an informed debate over a new AUMF. but this amendment would leave us with no strategy and no authority. That is irresponsible.",

Inflation is supposed to be 2.1 percent. So what it really means is this bill. even in real dollars. is a cut. even as it is. This bill is 23 percent less than we were spending on defense in real terms in 2010. Mr. Chairman. the world is not 23 percent safer now than it was 6 years ago.

And they were included in the unfunded requirements list from the Army. So the way it works is we get all sorts of requests from Members on both sides of the aisle. Each of the services gives us a list of what they would like to have had in the budget request but the administration took out. and then where the two match up as Member priorities and service priorities. that is what these funds are. It is not that they werent asked for from the military. It is the military wanted them but OMB took them out. And when you have many Members. particularly on the Black Hawks. the V22s. the LCS. and a number of the items he just mentioned on his side of the aisle. asking for them as well as the service. then that becomes part of the modernization priority. Let me just make one other point. In the Black Hawk case specifically. these new Black Hawks will replace helicopters that were built in 1979. for which we cannot get parts. which have very restricted flight envelopes because of all the restrictions. They cant be repaired. They cant do everything the Army wants them to do. So the administration did not ask for any. Many Members on the Democratic side asked for some. We put them in here.

U2s are currently flying more hours today than at any point since the end of the cold war and have been deployed in our ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS. Flying at an altitude of 70.000 feet. the U2 is able to reach heights other spy planes cannot. Because the U2 can reach such extraordinary heights. it is able to use hightech sensors to increase its ability to collect intelligence. Other unique features of the U2 include cloudpiercing radar and interchangeable nose cones. The U2 can also take incredible highresolution photographs on a 10.500foot reel wet film. My amendment to the NDAA will prevent the Air Force from retiring the U2. It is absolutely essential to our ability to meet our highaltitude intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissance needs.

H.R. 3936. that would establish a 3year pilot program to assist veterans in receiving timely decisions on their claims. Under this administration. the VA has nearly eliminated the claims backlog. At the height of the backlog in 2013. there were more than 600.000 claims. Today. that number has been reduced to fewer than 75.000. The VA has made incredible strides on claims. and I applaud its hardworking staff who has made this happen. However. we also owe it to our veterans to look at and test new methods to improve services and continue refining the VA claims process. This legislation is a step in that direction. However. I must note that the VAs success in the timely processing of claims has come at the cost of a new backlogappeals. There is an appeals inventory of 450.000. The average wait for a veteran to have his appeal resolved is almost 5 years. We need to address this in our closing legislative days.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. For all our best intentions. we too often see government programs fail both the constituencies they are intended to help and the taxpayers who fund them. Thousands of families across this country continue to be trapped. generation after generation. in programs that were well intended but are now ineffective or outdated. Our social safety net has instead become a poverty trap and not the springboard to prosperity we once envisioned. Our constituents. all Americans. deserve better. They need their Federal Government working together with their communities to focus on how we can help members of our society successfully climb that ladder out of poverty. not just check them off as another individual served. By changing the Federal Governments definition of success in Federal social programs. from inputs to actual outcomes. we can help our fellow Americans overcome the root causes of poverty and seize economic opportunities to work and provide for our families. It is this shift in focus. this focus from inputs to outcomes. that could substantially transform our safety net to better serve our most vulnerable. The Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act does just that. It empowers States. local governments. nonprofits. and the private sector to scale up evidencebased interventions that address our Nations most pressing social challenges. This legislation would foster the creation of publicprivate partnerships that harness philanthropic and other privatesector investments so we can expand and replicate scientifically proven social and public health programs. Because social impact partnerships are focused on achieving real results. government dollars are paid out only when desired outcomes are met. Furthermore. this legislation would reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program at current spending levels for 1 year as well as build evidence on our efforts to help our most needy families find jobs and achieve selfsufficiency by cataloging the best evidencebased approaches. The What Works Clearinghouse would make it easier for States to know which approaches have been tested using independent. rigorous evaluations and. based on those results. an understanding of their effectiveness in achieving positive results for individuals and families. By cataloging the different approaches States are taking in helping welfare recipients move into work. we can help empower wellintentioned policymakers across all levels of government to improve lives through evidencebased policymaking.

Dr. BOUSTANY and Representative THOMPSON. for their leadership on this important issue. It is not very often that we have bipartisan legislation that will make a real difference in lowering healthcare costs for working families. and I am pleased to see this bill come to the House floor today. This legislation is a nobrainer. As a physician with more than 30 years of experience. I have personally seen the need for commonsense reforms that will remove barriers to lower healthcare costs and give Americans more control over their own healthcare decisions. Because of the Affordable Care Act. I constantly hear from families who are paying higher premiums and outofpocket costs for less coverage and lower quality of care. I hear from smallbusiness owners who desperately want to help their employees acquire health insurance. but face costly regulations that make it harder. if not impossible. for them to do so. Employers of all sizes are implementing innovative solutions to address the rising healthcare costs. and we should do everything we can to support those efforts. Unfortunately. misguided Federal rules too often stand in the way. Regulatory guidance issued by the IRS that penalizes small businesses who offer standalone Health Reimbursement Arrangements is a perfect example. HRAs are popular among both workers and employers. Employers offer HRAs to help their employees pay for health care. In return. families are provided greater flexibility and an opportunity to set aside pretax income for medical expenses. It simply doesnt make sense for the Federal Government to restrict a positive tool aimed at expanding access to affordable healthcare coverage. It is unconscionable that ObamaCare is penalizing small businesses for trying to do the right thing and alleviate the financial burden on working families. That is why this bill is so important. We need to encourage policies that empower every American with affordable coverage. provide more choice. and promote a healthy workforce. And I hope we can all agree that we should eliminate misguided rules that only make it harder for families and small businesses to obtain healthcare coverage they desperately need. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation which will restore the ability of small businesses to offer HRAs.",

I will tell you that I am a physician. and I can tell you what is already taking place within private insurance with these peer reviews when you recommend something. I recommended an MRI to a patient. That afternoon. I get on the phone. The woman says: I have had a problem for 10 years. I have had cortisone injections. physical therapy. blah. blah. blah. I said: You need an MRI. I am being denied the MRI by the insurance company because I have only seen her once. And I said to the gentleman. the doctor on the phone: How many times have you seen her? None. I said: What State do you have a license to practice in? Not Ohio. which is where we were. And so I said: Tell me your specialty. My specialty is foot and ankle.

This bill would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board. or IPAB. and pay for it by drastically reducing our investment in prevention and public health. Mr. Speaker. I do not support IPAB. I oppose independent commissions playing a legislative role other than on the recommendatory basis. It is not the job of an independent commission to make decisions on healthcare policy for Medicare beneficiaries. Congress simply must stop ceding legislative power to outside bodies. However. IPAB remains an insignificant provision from the Affordable Care Act. as it has not even been convened. Because of how well other provisions of the ACA are working. Medicare cost growth rates are projected to remain beneath IPAB targets through the entire budget window. thereby not triggering the IPAB provisions until 2024 at the earliest. That said. I urge this House to oppose H.R. 1190. which would pay for IPAB repeal by effectively gutting the Affordable Care Acts prevention and public health fund. an incredibly significant provision from the ACA.

Established under the Affordable Care Act. the Fund represents an unprecedented investment in preventing disease. promoting wellness. and protecting our communities against public health emergencies. Since its creation. the Fund has invested in a broad range of evidencebased initiatives. These include community prevention programs. research. surveillance and tracking efforts. increased access to immunizations. and tobacco prevention programs. Much of this work is done through partnerships with state and local governments. which leverage Prevention Fund dollars to best meet the local need. These monies have been used for important work. such as controlling the obesity epidemic. detecting and responding to outbreaks. and reducing health disparities. Congress has a distinct responsibility to formulate and fund programs and initiatives that promote public health and wellness. The Prevention and Public Health Fund is one means by which Congress fulfils this obligation.

I dont know another way to describe what I heard this morning in my morning briefing and then the news accounts of this sickening revelation of what took place in South Carolina last night. Think about this. The sanctity of a house of worship was violated as a gunman opened fire in the historically Black Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. SC. We know now at least nine people are dead. and others. of course. are hurt. I dont know how to describe it. This individual was like a wolf in sheeps clothing. He sat among the congregation for a substantial amount of time before he pulled out a weapon and started firing at people. The thought of people who were in a house of worship being gunned down as they gathered to pray is heartwrenching. devastating. and is the ultimate act of cowardice and hatred. As our good Chaplain said. our hearts go out to the families and friends of the people who were gunned down in that church. It is hard to even comprehend anything so awful. So. on behalf of the Senate family. we send our support and our sympathy. We hope Charleston law enforcement are able to capture this murderer. and the perpetrator be swiftly apprehended and brought to justice. Mr. President. I had some remarks I was going to give. but they could be deemed partisan in nature and I can give them some other time. I dont feel it would be appropriate for me now to talk about these things that are definitely inappropriate today with this pall hanging over our country. Based upon that. I would ask that the Presiding Officer announce the business of the day.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I thank the chairman and congratulate him on a great bill. When the abuse of prescription medications silently took hold of rural towns in Appalachia over a decade ago. we knew we had to do something to curb the rising tide of addiction and overdose deaths. We gathered individuals from all disciplines and backgroundsteachers. preachers. parents. judges. cops. doctors. pharmacists. community leaders. and othersto brainstorm as to what we could do to address the staggering problem. We quickly realized there was no silver bullet that could easily solve the crisis. but we responded by creating a holistic. multidisciplinary organization called Operation UNITE: Unlawful Narcotics Investigations Treatment and Education. Since 2003. UNITEs law enforcement agents have confiscated more than $12 million worth of these drugs and arrested over 4.300 bad actors. But we also established 30 drug courts so that the nonviolent offenders could get their lives back on track. UNITE established a tollfree treatment referral helpline. receiving 1.200 calls a month. We have provided 4.000 free vouchers to individuals who otherwise would be unable to access treatment for their addiction. UNITE also works hard to engage our young people through community coalitions of thousands of people as well as UNITE clubs in our schools. Over 100.000 students have taken part in antidrug education activities to warn about the dangers of prescription drugs. Today it is difficult to imagine a single town in the country that has eluded the devastating grasp of opioid addiction. So UNITE took its model to the national stage. Over the past 5 years. the National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta has brought together thousands of our countrys brightest. most dedicated minds. At the Federal level. we should be replicating UNITEs holistic. multipronged approach. I am. therefore. proud to support this bill. which will enable communities around the country to unite to implement similar strategies. incorporating law enforcement. treatment. and education. There is no silver bullet. Mr. Chairman. to bring an end to addiction. but together we can certainly save lives and restore hope in every community. I think this bill allows that to occur.",

I think. on this House floor because of what we are doing here to address the heroin and opioid crisis in America. It is sad to watch someone from Virginia and someone from Wisconsin and someone from Michigan and someone from Ohio and someone from Texas all get up and really kind of embody and express how deep this problem is in our country today. I know we have all been to calling hours and we have all been to funerals and seen up close and personal how devastating this epidemic is here in the United States. Like many of my colleagues. unfortunately. Ohio has now seen accidental deaths by overdose surpass even car accidents. So we all need to come together. Democrats and Republicans. to try to solve this problem. I think this week is a major step in that direction. I am supporting the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act and many other bills that are coming to this floor this week. In Trumbull County alone. one of my biggest counties. a few months back we had 22 overdoses and. of that. 7 deaths in that one county. This is pervasive in Cuyahoga County. which is Cleveland. We have almost one death a day that we are dealing with in Ohio. So the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act program creates at the Department of Justice a real opportunity for us to fix this program. It focuses on how we can tackle substance abuse through preventative programs. expansion of the prescription drug programs. and resources for veteran treatment court programs. That is one of the key elements of this: how we are going to make sure our veterans can get diverted through veterans courts. The Acting CHAIR . The time of the gentleman has expired.",

I rise in support of this critical legislation to address the nationwide opioid epidemic which has affected south Florida. where I am from. as it has communities from California to New Hampshire. Today I want to tell you about a related crisis that is obstructing the recovery of addicts and damaging the character of south Florida neighborhoods. and neighborhoods across the Nation. I am talking about the overproliferation in residential areas of group homes for recovering addicts called sober homes. In theory. it is a very good thing. a way to reintegrate addicts back into the community. It is activity protected by two historic laws that prohibit discrimination in housing against persons with disabilities. But this civil rights protection is being abused by two many unscrupulous actors who are luring young adults away from their families and placing them in group homes that have no standards and then leaving them to their own devices until their insurance runs out. The result is an overdosing nightmare as well as an increase in homelessness. code enforcement violations. and crime. Making matters worse. cities and towns feel regulation and consumer protection would be in violation of Federal law. As a consequence. we are seeing thousands of sober homes in south Florida disrupting services and the health and safety of neighborhoods and leaving young people who are trying to repair their lives spiraling back into hopelessness. Mr. Chair. I urge this Congress and the President to work with folks in my area and around the country to find the proper balance between protecting the rights of addicts and getting them recovered and keeping the integrity and character of our neighborhoods.",

Last week I visited with Judge Berlin Jones in Pine Bluff. Arkansas. His Jefferson County drug court has a recidivism rate of only 4.9 percent. Drug courts have also saved billions of taxpayer dollars. on average. because it costs $14 a day to send a person to a drug court whereas incarceration costs $58 per day in my State of Arkansas.

I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5046. the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act. which will provide more effective cooperation between our law enforcement and treatment agencies. grow our treatment capabilities. and strengthen programs for training and veterans. This bill is an important step in combating the growing costs of the terrible opioid epidemic. Just last year. in my home State of New Hampshire. deadly overdoses following the abuse of heroin killed over 430 people. That staggering figure marks the rising toll of this epidemic. I commend my colleagues for offering this legislation as part of the response to the epidemic and as part of a wider plan moving through the House this week. This bill aims to bring sorely needed resources to different groups and agencies working to help families and individuals in need. sometimes in desperate need. For too long. too many of those helping our sons and daughters and our veterans have been underfunded in their efforts. This week we have heard and shared stories of people suffering from this epidemic all over the country. These stories help us draft and pass effective response to the needs of our communities. We know that no one bill or amendment on its own is equal to the massive scale of this epidemic. but together they can begin to address some of its worst effects and harshest consequences. We need to incorporate the best practices that have emerged across disciplines and different agencies. and we need to ensure cooperation between actors on the ground. As part of the House response to the Senatepassed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. this bill represents our commitment to restoring hope in shattered communities. I have been a proud sponsor of many of the bills coming forward this week. and I am pleased that so many have passed and many more are expected to pass today. We provide a cohesive. unified. and farreaching legislative package to meet the enormity of this epidemic. and I believe we have begun to move in that direction. I thank my colleagues for their dedication and tireless work to support this effort. I particularly want to commend Chairman GOODLATTE on his leadership and his efforts as we continue to help and provide hope for people not just in New Hampshire. but all across the country.",

I have seen firsthand the struggles that these people face. H.R. 5046 seeks to fight the opioid epidemic through a grant program that would provide States with the resources to provide programs to help Americans fight this disease. It would help improve prescription drug monitoring programs. help address juvenile opioid abuse. give first responders the training to reverse opioid overdoses. and improve access for veterans in treatment court.

Many of them are returningin fact. 67 percent of our returning vets face mental health challenges. and too many of them are choosing to selfmedicate. or are dealing with injuries that they have acquired. through opioids. It has led to not only addiction. but other kinds of behaviors. When we are able to bring them into the court system under the guidance. it creates not only the oversight of the system but. as well. the promotion of this peertopeer in which other veterans enable them to work together to get back not only their dignity and their lives. but they take advantage of the kinds of resources that we have within the veterans system to deal with the underlying addiction and other kinds of issues. This is a tremendous additional effort to authorize a program which we have been able to support here in Congress and create permanence for it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this measure. As a former State and Federal prosecutor who has been in charge of prosecuting narcotics cases. I have seen firsthand the devastating effect that opioid and heroin addiction has had. This nationwide opioid and heroin epidemic stretches home into my district in central and west central Illinois. Seventyeight people die from heroin or opioid overdoses each day. That has quadrupled since 1999. Now it is the leading cause of death. far surpassing deaths by motor vehicle accidents. Just last week I hosted a series of roundtable forums across my district to personally hear from law enforcement officers. medical professionals. treatment providers. local government officials. and those who have lost loved ones due to overdose. They shared with me the reality of the situation back home. Law enforcement has had to double its onhand stock of Narcan. and expand training for police officers when it comes to these overdoses. Heroin is now the primary abused substance in drug court programs like the one in Springfield. Illinois. but those programs are at capacity. Treatment centers have waitlists over 40 days. The consensus is clear. This is a public health crisis. To end it. we need to do a number of things. Update medical best practices for coping with pain. We need to expand access to addiction specialists and treatment centers. We need to give law enforcement the tools they need. and we must continue to promote programs like drug courts. Because this problem is complex. it must be addressed from all angles. and that is precisely what we are doing in the House this week. This bill will address this epidemic. and the concerns I heard last week. It would establish a comprehensive opioid abuse reduction program at the Department of Justice. target Federal resources directly at the opioid problem. give States flexibility. and create a streamlined comprehensive opioid abuse grant program. Without raising taxes. this measure authorizes $103 million each year for a variety of programs. including residential substance abuse treatment. drug courts. training for law enforcement and first responders.

Bulldog grew up in East Dallas. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1949 and was a star on the football team. He went to play football at Midwestern State University. but withdrew after one year to join the United States Marine Corps. During his service. he was wounded three times. And awarded the Purple Heart. After leaving Korea. he served the rest of his time as a drill instructor at Camp Pendleton. After returning to Dallas. he married his sweetheart. Mina. in 1954. They were blessed with four boys. Gregory. Vickers. William. and Michael. He is survived by Mina. his four sons. eight grandchildren and one greatgrandson. It was rare to see Bulldog or Mina separately. Their marriage of over 60 years was an example of a lifelong love. The Cunninghams are a very closeknit family. Bulldog made a lifelong passion out of his chosen profession of insurance. He based his insurance company in East Dallas. He was a member of the Million Dollar Round Table. In the last year of his life. he was still a national top 10 percent producer for Safeco Insurance. Bulldog was an active political volunteer. along with his wife. Mina. He was very active in the Dallas community. including the Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce. in which he was instrumental in their annual Economic Summit. investing a lot of time in building the event. Habitat for Humanity. City of Dallas Planning & Zoning Commission. and numerous other organizations and city boards and commissions. He was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame in 2004. Mr. Cunningham will be sorely missed by his family. friends. and the East Dallas community. We have lost a patriotic. hardworking businessman who was the example of who we should all strive to be. My condolences to Mina and the rest of the Cunningham family. Melissa and I are praying for Gods comfort on you during this time of loss.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to honor and congratulate a dear friend. Mayor Hal Richards of Terrell. Texas. Hal is an outstanding community leader and servant for the people of Kaufman County. Hal was born in 1953 in El Paso while his father served in the Army at Fort Bliss. After the military. his fathers job as a petroleum engineer took him across Texas to wherever the next oil boom struck. The Richards family even lived in Venezuela for a period of time. Ultimately. the family settled in Garland. Texas where he was an active musician in the Garland High School band and even played in a slightly lesser known garage band. The Monotones. After graduating high school. Hal took his talents to Texas A&M where he served as the drum major in the Fighting Texas Aggie Band. He graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science. and later he earned his MBA. Hal met his wife Christi while at A&M and they married in 1976. They found their way to Terrell in 1981 where he opened a tractor distributorship and raised his family. The folks of Terrell are glad they did. In 2001. Hal sold the tractor dealership and took over his fathers manufacturing company. Catco. where he continues to oversee operations. Hal decided to give back to his adopted town and ran for city council. and served for one term before being elected Mayor of Terrell in 2007. As mayor. he has been instrumental in the growth of \"Terrell America.\" the adopted slogan. Hal has served his community in a number of other capacities including: Chairman of the Terrell Chamber of Commerce. Assistant Scout Master. member and past president of the Rotary Club. and his churchs vestry. Not surprisingly. Hal was also recently named Citizen of the Year. And if he wasnt busy enough. Hal finally realized a lifelong dream of becoming a pilot in 2003. Hal and Christi have three sons. Jason. Travis and Chad. Like their dad. they are all proud Texas A&M graduates as well. It is truly an honor to represent Hal Richards in the United States House of Representatives.

The people of France stood by our side after the horrendous events of September 11. 2001. and the American people will stand by them during this tragic time. Cowardly and barbaric acts of violence against innocent civilians absolutely should not be tolerated anywhere in our society. and we must take any and all steps available to prevent a similar attack from occurring right here in the United States. Early reports from the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday indicate that the refugee programs in Europe allowed at least one of the attackers to enter France. In light of these reports. the United States should take notice. We are now faced with an opportunity to make a commonsense. responsible decision that would put Americans at ease and put an end to the risk of radical Islamic terrorists infiltrating our Nation through the refugee resettlement program. I believe we simply cannot trust this administration to put in place the rigorous vetting system needed to ensure that the refugees who enter our Nation will not be future threats to our people in our own homeland. It is. without a doubt. in the best interest of the American people and our national security to immediately halt any plans to allow Syrian refugees to resettle in the United States. We know we live in an increasingly dangerous world. and I believe the Obama administrations lack of leadership on foreign policy has exacerbated the problem. We cannot continue to let President Obamas illconceived policies put Americans at risk. This administration is either asleep or out of touch with the danger lurking in the world. I ask the American people today: What is it going to take to wake up this administration? Will it take another horrific attack on our own soil and our own people? I believe it is more than time to put an end to relocating Syrian refugees in our country. and that is why I will work tirelessly with my colleagues in the Senate to reverse President Obamas extremely dangerous position that threatens the American people and our homeland.

They need to know that we are resolved. that we speak with one voice. Let me talk for a second about the message to our allies. An authorization for use of force will dictate and will set the parameters for that use of force. Our allies need to know if we are all in or whether there are certain limitations. If we decideif the Congress decides there are certain limitations to that use of force. our allies need to know that. They need to know their role and what they are required to do. That will be useful. If there are limitations. we need to spell them out. If there arent. we need to let our adversaries know that as well. But whatever the case. we need to debate this.

I come to the floor to speak in recognition of the oneyear anniversary of the Bipartisan HBCU caucus and highlight the great impact of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs continue to stand as a bastion of learning and advancement for so many students of color. About 20 percent of African American students earning their bachelors degrees do so from HBCUs. HBCUs serve a disproportionate number of lowincome. firstgeneration students. More than 75 percent of HBCUs students rely on Pell Grants and almost 13 percent of students rely on PLUS loans. It is clear that. for many students who would otherwise find higher education out of reach. HBCUs provide a strong pathway to success. HBCUs also provide a strong value to students and their families. allowing for a smallcollege experience with lower tuition and fees than comparable institutions. This includes schools like Florida Memorial University. located in Floridas 24th district. Florida Memorial has the distinction of being the only historically black university in southern Florida and one of the oldest academic institutions in the entire state of Florida. Under the leadership of Dr. Roslyn Clark Artis. Florida Memorial continues to provide students with the quality education. leadership skills. and heart for service they need to become strong global citizens in our changing world. As a proud graduate of an HBCU. I am proud to work with my colleagues to advance policies that benefit HBCUs. I want to thank Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS of North Carolina and Congressman BRADLEY BYRNE of Alabama for their strong leadership on this bipartisan caucus over the past year. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues for the betterment of HBCUs in Florida and across the country.",

OBannon was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in 1801 and was quickly promoted to First Lieutenant in 1802. He served on the USS Argus. one of many ships used in the protection of United States commerce against the Barbary pirates. In 1805 he was selected for a special mission. During a storm. the USS Philadelphia went aground off the coast of Tripoli and the 180 member crew was captured and imprisoned at Derne. Lieutenant OBannon led a few brave Marines through fierce enemy fire. took possession of one of the enemys batteries. and planted the American flag. He became the first American to raise our flag on foreign soil during a time of war. Weeks of fighting ensued and finally the captured Americans were freed. The bravery of Lt. OBannon and others is forever commemorated in the Marine Corps Hymn in the words \"To the Shores of Tripoli\". Hamet Karamanli. the new leader of Tripoli. was so appreciative of the actions of Lt. OBannon that he presented him with the now famous blade of Damascus. a jeweled sword with a Mameluke hilt. U.S. Marine Corps officers still wear the Mameluke sword today as part of their dress uniform. Lieutenant OBannon left the Marine Corps in 1807 and moved to Logan County. Kentucky to live for the rest of his days. He served in both the Kentucky House of Representatives and the Kentucky Senate. He died on September 12. 1850 at the age of 74. The Daughters of the American Revolution removed his remains to the cemetery in Frankfort. Kentucky in 1920 and erected a memorial to this \"Hero of the Derne\". Lieutenant Presley Neville OBannon was a true American hero and I am proud to honor his memory before the United States House of Representatives. E640",

Senator CHRIS COONS. Earlier this year. we introduced the Defend Trade Secrets Act. a bill that will create a harmonized Federal standard for protecting trade secrets. Trade secrets such as customer lists. formulas. and manufacturing processes are an essential form of intellectual property. yet trade secrets are the only form of U.S. intellectual property where misuse does not provide the owner with a Federal private right of action. Instead. trade secret owners must rely on State courts or Federal prosecutors to protect their rights. The multistate procedural and jurisdictional issues that arise from such cases are costly and complicated. and the Department of Justice lacks the resources to prosecute many trade secret cases. Those systemic issues put companies at a great disadvantage since the victims of the trade secret theft need to recover information quickly before it crosses State lines and leaves the country. At a time when cyber theft of trade secrets is at an alltime high. particularly as it involves Chinese competitors. it is critically important that U.S. companies have the ability to protect their trade secrets in Federal court. Senator COONS. trade secret theft has hit some of the nations best known companies. including Delawarebased DuPont and its popular Kevlar synthetic fiber products.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank Senator HATCH for his leadership on this important issue. As the Senator from Utah has mentioned. trade secrets are the only form of intellectual property not protected from theft under Federal civil law. which is particularly striking when one considers the value of trade secrets to the economy. According to some estimates. they are worth $5 trillion for the U.S. economy. on par with IP protected by patent. The scope of the loss due to theft or misappropriation is huge. somewhere between $160 and $480 billion annually. I submit that there is not a State in the country that has not been affected by this problem. and Delaware is no exception. In the 1960s. DuPontone of our signature manufacturing chemistrybased companiesinvented Kevlar. a paraaramid fiber with extraordinary strength that is also very lightweight. These properties make Kevlar versatile. but its best known use is in lifesaving body armor worn by our police officers and the brave men and women in the American Armed Forces. It has saved thousands of lives. including more than 3.000 police officers here in the United States whose lives have been saved by Kevlar vests. About 10 years ago. DuPont developed the next generation of Kevlar. which is even lighter and better able to withstand penetrating trauma from a broader range of rifle rounds and IEDgenerated shrapnel. It represented a real breakthrough in safety. but it cost millions of dollars to develop. Chemically. paraaramid fibers are not that complicated. but the fabrication method. the manufacturing technique. which is what gives them their strength and flexibility. is actually incredibly difficult to develop and implement. So one day about 6 years ago. a rogue employee of DuPont took the knowhow behind DuPonts creation of nextgeneration Kevlar and began to work with a rival manufacturing company in Korea. using DuPont trade secrets. The potential loss to DuPont alone from this one instance of trade secret theft or misappropriation approaches $1 billion. So I ask Senator HATCH. if you were a CEO and your employees were ripping off your trade secrets. your intellectual property. and taking it to another country at the cost of $1 billion a pop. would that affect your willingness to invest the resources in future R&D here in the United States that are needed to make similar lifesaving technological breakthroughs?",

    "speech": "I thank Senator HATCH for the opportunity to go into more detail about this terrific bipartisan. bicameral Defend Trade Secrets Act. It is actually relatively simple. It creates a Federal private right of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. It uses an existing Federal criminal law. the Economic Espionage Act. to define trade secrets. It draws heavily from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act which has been enacted by many States to define what is misappropriation. Simply put. our bill harmonizes U.S. law. Each State has a different trade secret law. and they vary in a range of different ways. Not all of these differences are major. but they affect in small but real ways the definition of a trade secret. what an owner must do to keep a trade secret a secret. what constitutes misappropriation. and what damages are available. So our Defend Trade Secrets Act creates a single. national baseline or a minimum level of protection and gives trade secret owners access to both a uniform national law and our excellent Federal courts. which provide nationwide service of process and execution of judgments. It is important to note that this bill does not preempt State law because States are free to add further protections on top of what is in this bill. The proposed legislation does one more thing. and trade secret owners tell us this is a critical component of the law not available in States. It creates an ex parte seizure ability. Trade secrets are different from other forms of intellectual property because they are protected under the law only if they remain a secret. Once the public learns of a trade secret. even if it does so wrongfully. the trade secret loses its legal protection. So this bill provides a limited right of action for the owner of a trade secret to go to court ex parte and get it back before the misappropriator. the thief of the trade secret. has a chance to share it with a competitor or the world. thus exposing it. This is a commonsense idea to help address a very serious problem. but when talking about Federal private rights of action and ex parte injunctive relief. we had to be very careful to avoid any unintended consequences. So. Senator HATCH. would you address how you took concerns about unintended consequences into account as we worked together to draft this bill?",

I was initially cautious when he approached me about expanding Federal civil law to create a new private right of action for trade secret theft. After all. some have suggested that State law is sufficient. but after consulting with many in the business community. I was convinced that creating a Federal trade secrets law is the right approach. Soon after its introduction. the Heritage Foundation confirmed the need for Federal legislation. Mr. Alden Abbott from the Heritage Foundation writes: The lack of a federal civil remedy for victims of trade secret theft precludes owners of trade secrets from vindicating their rights under certain circumstances. Enjoining and sanctioning trade secret thieves who cross state lines is often difficult .... [A] federal civil statutory remedy would make Federal tribunals instantly available to aggrieved businesses that seek injunctions. which is particularly important when time is of the essence due to flight risks. Another problem we faced was ensuring that the ex parte seizure authority could not be used abusively or for anticompetitive purposes. When we began the drafting process last Congress. we started from scratch and asked for input from all interested stakeholders. especially in regard to the ex parte provision. We received many helpful suggestions and included them in the bill. That is correct. isnt it. Senator COONS?",

We also included damages for wrongful seizure. including attorneys fees. And with that whole combination of important measures to ensure that the ex parte seizure capabilities under the statute are not misused. I think we achieved real consensus at that time.

For more than 35 years. this duo shared their captivating magic show with visitors and residents of Las Vegas. Their stage presence and the participation of their trained white tigers kept audiences coming back for performances unlike any other. Siegfried and Roys awardwinning show at the Mirage Hotel and Casino was enjoyed by children and adults. and it opened the door to family entertainment on the Las Vegas Strip. Through their celebrity and love of animals. Siegfried and Roy have been working to raise awareness for animal conservation and are educating others about endangered species. The white tiger. an animal that became an icon of Siegfried and Roys performances. is among those listed as endangered and facing extinction. By establishing the Siegfried and Roy Masters of the Impossible Foundation. they are taking their efforts to educate. protect. and conserve animals that are endangered and threatened across the globe. For the first time in 5 years. Siegfried and Roys Secret Garden at the Mirage is welcoming four tiger cubs. Hirah. Maharani. Liberty. and Justice. Siegfried and Roy are calling these cubs \"ambassadors of conservation.\" as they hope these animals will help them share the important message that we must continue to work together to protect endangered species. I appreciate Siegfried and Roys dedication to the Las Vegas community and animal conservation. I wish them the best in their future endeavors.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. my thoughts and prayers are with the Israeli people who are enduring a new escalation of Palestinian terrorism. Last Thursday evening. a mother and father were murdered in front of their four children ages 9. 7. 4. and 4 months when Hamas terrorists opened fire on their car. A few days later. another Jewish family was walking in the Old City of Jerusalem after praying at the Western Wall when a Palestinian terrorist went on a stabbing attack. He murdered the father. along with another courageous man who rushed to the scene to the familys aid. Both men leave behind their wives and nine children. In addition to the four murdered. many more Israelis have been seriously wounded from carramming. rockthrowing. and brutal knife and screwdriver stabbing attacks in what appears to be a fresh horroran epidemic of lowtech. brutal attacks by militants who are acting on their own initiative. These attacks have been incubated by the continued incitement and glorification of violence by the Palestinian leadership. most recently by President Mahmoud Abbas during his address at the United Nations General Assembly. He still has yet to categorically condemn these attacks. It is long past time for the United States and the international community to hold the Palestinians accountable for their incitement and support for terrorism. including through the financial payment to Palestinian terrorists who are jailed in Israel for committing acts of terrorism. In yet another stark reminder of how closely our nations are connected in this fight. the father murdered last Thursday. Eitam Henkin. was a dual IsraeliAmerican citizen. The terrorist who killed him did not care. as his sole intent was to kill Jews. not to engage in a political process. There is no moral equivalence between Palestinian terrorism and the obligation of Israel to act in defense of its people. To the Israeli people. especially those who are victims of terrorism and their families: I proudly stand in solidarity with you during this challenging time.",

It has now been 3 months since we started the Innovation Initiative. In that time. we have met with innovators at the forefront of both our missions. Today in the House. we are focused on harnessing innovation for the public good. Just moments ago. we passed Representative DARIN LAHOODs bill to advance networking and information technology research and development. and now we are considering BARRY LOUDERMILKs reform of the National Science Foundation. Basic research and development investment is important as we strive to remain at the cutting edge of technologies that will offer Americans a happier and healthier life. But when the integrity of such efforts at public institutions is compromised. as happened with the major NSF facility that experienced massive cost overruns last year. it calls into question the entire model. So this bill makes changes to our research facilities to make them operate with transparency and accountability. When you look across our government. you can see inefficiencies. a lack of accountability. and practices and policies that just dont make sense. That is bad for the workers. it is bad for business. and. most importantly. it is bad for America. Here in the House. we arent accepting the status quo. If it doesnt make sense. we are getting rid of it. If it is holding back innovation. we are changing it.

In fact. it can be found on the shelves of grocery stores just miles away from their farm. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee. I know how important farming is to not only Pennsylvanias economy. but to our Nation.

Unfortunately. this week Congress wont do a thing about any of these issues. In fact. all too often actions and language here in Congress and on the campaign trail actually exacerbate wouldbe terrorists. and actions even on the floor of the House of Representatives all too often reinforce the hate of some people. including gays and lesbians. Unfortunately. this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of militarystyle assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and gun lobby.

This piece of legislation is another attempt by politicians to control womens private health care choices. As we emerge from one of the worst economic crises in our nations history.

I firmly believe that the American people wish to see their representatives focus on proactive policies that strengthen our economy and address their health care needs. such as by increasing access to affordable health care and reducing health disparities. Rather than imposing national restrictions on private medical decisions. policymakers should focus on keeping Americans healthy via comprehensive health care. healthy pregnancies. and healthy children.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) maintains this ban and a federal appeals court confirmed that no federal dollars may be used to pay for abortion services under the law. Far more sweeping in scope than the title implies. the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act goes well beyond codifying the Hyde Amendment and protecting public funds. This bill intrudes on womens reproductive autonomy and access to health care. manipulates the tax code to put additional financial burdens on many women and small businesses. and unnecessarily restricts the private insurance choices available to consumers today.

H.R. 7. so I want to be clear about what the bill before us does do and does accomplish. This bill follows a longstanding principle. as my colleague said. going back to 1976. the principle that the American people and Members from both sides of the aisle in both Chambers of Congress have supported for decades. and that is taxpayer dollars should not be spent on abortions and abortion coverage. The vast majority of my colleagues voted for this exact same principle in countless appropriations bills. including a bill that we passed out of this Chamber last month. Yet today. some Members are fighting the widely shared belief that taxpayer dollars should not be used to take an innocent life. The bill before us today also provides muchneeded transparency regarding which health plans on the exchange pay for abortions. The Obama administration promised to provide Congress and the American people a list of plans in ObamaCare that covered abortion. yet they refused to live up to that promise. They forced Congress to act. And. indeed. the GAO has informed us that 1.036 plans include abortion coverage. There is no excuseno excuseto hide information about abortion coverage from the American people. Madam Speaker. 68 percent. a vast majority of the American people believe there should be no taxpayer money used for abortion and abortion coverage. HHS has forced Congress to act on this issue. The commonsense transparency requirement that is in H.BR. 7 is needed. and it is supported by all Members. So that is what this bill is about. following an established bipartisan principle and providing transparency. I urge my colleagues. each and every one. to vote to protect life. to vote to protect taxpayer dollars. and to promote transparency by rejecting the motion to recommit and supporting the underlying bill. I urge a \"no\" vote on the recommittal. I yield back the balance of my time.",

Bill grew up in a Sonoma County that was much more rural and undeveloped than today. By the early 1960s. he foresaw that a growing population could threaten the countys natural landscape. so he fought to protect the home he loved. He was singularly responsible for instituting lasting environmental protections throughout Sonoma County and California. though he would never claim credit for them. One of Bills first victories was to prevent the development of PG&Es nuclear power plant at Bodega Head. He helped create the California Coastal Commission. which continues to guarantee public access to the coast today. He established Sonoma County Conservation Action. helped create the Sonoma County Open Space District. and championed the Sonoma Land Trust and the SMART train. Bill illustrates the incredible impact one person can have in making the world a better place. His legacy in Sonoma County and beyond will not soon be forgotten.

I am proud to recognize this month in honor of the many Hispanic Americans who contribute so much to communities across our state and country. Hispanic Americans make up the largest ethnic minority throughout our Nation. as well as in Nevada. This community is an integral part of our State. helping shape our economy. trade. culture. and intrinsic Nevada footprint.

That is why I recently cosponsored a resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and the fundamental role Hispanic Americans have in the accomplishments of the United States. I am proud to support legislative efforts that distinguish the immense efforts brought forth by this community. Hispanic Americans play a critical role in our Nations identity. especially in 2015. As of August 2015. Latino workers represented nearly 17 percent of the workforce and exhibited the largest percentage of labor force participation of any ethnic group with nearly 63 percent. This community is made up of hardworking physicians. surgeons. chief business executives. lawyers. educators. and many other professionals crucial to the success of our country. Latinos represent one in four public school students and 19 percent of college students between the ages of 18 and 24. Hispanic Americans have served the United States in every war. helping bring freedom and democracy to our country. As of July 2015. 164.000 ActiveDuty servicemembers from the Hispanic community served and continue to serve our country. maintaining these principal values. The vast influence this community has had on our great Nation warrants only the greatest gratitude. I ask that today and throughout the rest of this time set aside for Hispanic Heritage Month. we recognize the many contributions that the Hispanic community brings. I join citizens across the Silver State in thanking the many Hispanic Americans who have brought greater strength to our State and our Nation.",

This outstanding accomplishment represents the great collaborative work to restore one of the greatest treasures this Nation has to offer. Floridas Gulf Coast. The improved estuary will have an immeasurable impact on the future of the States environment and economy. Since its establishment in 1991. the Tampa Bay Estuary Program has partnered with the Southwest Florida Water Management District and other state and local municipalities and local businesses to restore and protect Floridas largest open water estuary. As the Tampa Bay region is home to a population of more than 2 million people. this valuable estuary serves as a diverse ecosystem for plant and wildlife and is an economic driver for the region. After decades of voluntary effort. I am proud to learn how successful the Tampa Bay Estuary Program was in its environmental restoration by exceeding its original goal in recovering seagrass. to improve fish and wildlife populations. and to maintain the highest quality of water since the 1950s. From 2012 until 2014. the Tampa Bay Estuary Programs efforts were able to restore 5.000 acres of lifesustaining underwater grasses in Tampa Bay. which now total 40.295 acres of seagrasses. This amount significantly surpasses its original goal set in 1995 of harboring 38.000 acres. Although Tampa and its surrounding cities have seen an increase in population since 1950. the Tampa Bay Estuary Programs Nitrogen Management Consortium. which includes local governments and agencies supporting voluntary environmental recovery. has invested over $500 million since the 1990s. The strategy developed by the Consortium continues to set standards that could serve as a model for and be implemented across the nation in other estuary recovery programs. I am proud that the Tampa Bay Estuary Program aided in recovering sea grass in Floridas Tampa Bay. I whole heartedly commend the Tampa Bay Estuary Program on its accomplishments over the past 23 years and wish it further success in its continued endeavors to protect our natural resources.O",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today with my colleagues Senator RON JOHNSON. Senator TIM SCOTT. and Senator CORY BOOKER to introduce the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. bipartisan legislation to extend the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. I am a longtime supporter of this important program. which provides lowincome students residing in the District of Columbia the opportunity to improve academically by attending a private school of their choice. Without this platform. D.C.s most disadvantaged students would not have access to a highquality education. including smaller class sizes and effective curriculum. That is not right. All students should have the same opportunity to learn and thrive. The Opportunity Scholarship is a successful and transformative program. It has shown promising results in raising student achievement. According to data released by the program administrator for the 20142015 school year. 90 percent of scholarship students graduated from high school and 88 percent of those graduates are enrolled in a 2or 4year college or university. The Opportunity Scholarship Programs graduation rate is more than 30 percentage points higher than D.C. Public Schools rate. which stands at only 58 percent. well below the national average of 81 percent. For the 20152016 school year. there were more than 8.500 names on waiting lists at D.C. charter schools. an 18 percent increase over last year. This shows the demand for highquality education in this city and unfortunately. the shortage to meet that demand. I have worked on this legislation with my House colleague. Speaker JOHN BOEHNER. for many years. I also had my staff visit schools and talk to administrators and parents about ways to improve the program so that it can fully meet the goal of providing a better education to lowincome families in the Districts lowestperforming schools. I am pleased that this legislation strengthens the program by requiring participating schools to acquire and maintain accreditation. and by ensuring that an evaluation study truly assess the effectiveness of the scholarship. including how it affects academic achievement for scholarship recipients. I am pleased that Senators JOHNSON. SCOTT and BOOKER have joined me as original cosponsors of this bill. I remain fully committed to the success of the program. and I believe this reauthorization bill makes critical improvements to ensure that scholarships continue to transform the lives of the Districts most vulnerable students.

That founder. Robert E. Simon. Jr.. whose initials were the basis for naming the town. passed away on September 21st at the age of 101. Bob Simon was a visionary who recognized that all humans ought to be able to live together and be neighbors. His vision was of a community in which people could live. work. and play in the same general area. He believed that features like natural landscaping. open plazas. and public art were important to building a vibrant community and fostering a sense of place. Today we would call that \"smart growth.\" but to Bob. it was simply commonsense. His vision was ahead of its time in another way. It was a vision of a community in which people of all races and income levels could coexista vision that was not yet shared by all in the segregated Virginia of the early 1960s. The legacy of Bob Simon will live on in the community he created and loved. I and my Virginia colleague Senator MARK WARNER ask the Senate to formally commemorate Bob and the ideals he championed in his lifes work of a better and more just America.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 Each year. the National Defense Authorization Act provides a framework for our armed forces in the fiscal year ahead. Crafting and considering this legislation is a serious matter. one that has earned strong bipartisan support in the past. This year. House Republicans have instead decided to intentionally violate last years Bipartisan Budget Act and abdicate this Congress solemn responsibility to sufficiently fund our troops. H.R. 4909 takes $18 billion from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). the account that pays for our countrys fight against ISIS and other important military efforts. in order to fund base budget items that the President and the Department of Defense have not requested. This funding shift breaks the spirit of the Bipartisan Budget Act reached last October and degrades our militarys readiness. Furthermore. H.R. 4909 stops authorization for OCO funding next April. long before the fiscal year ends. and places our servicemen and -women squarely in the middle of a partisan budget fight just months into the next presidents term. This is reckless and irresponsible. and Congress owes it to our troops to authorize a full year of funding. H.R. 4909 also includes several disturbing Republican ideological stances that I find highly objectionable. This legislation fails to uphold President Obamas protections for LGBT Americans who work for federal contractors and grantees and allows for discrimination against them. This outrageous partisan rider has absolutely no place in a bill that authorizes the funds necessary for our servicemen and -women to do the jobs they have bravely volunteered to do. Additionally. H.R. 4909 once again includes provisions that prevent President Obama from responsibly closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. ensuring that the detention center will remain an extremist propaganda tool and a threat to our national security. Now that President Obama has put forward a plan to close the detention center responsibly. Congress should move immediately to enact it. The closure of this facility is long overdue. House Republicans owe it to our servicemen and -women to put forward legislation free from partisan ideological riders and adequately funds them for a full fiscal year. Unfortunately. H.R. 4909 falls far short of this. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 .",

I am also pleased that the bill includes language on EnergyWater Nexus initiative that I worked on with our Ranking Member MARCY KAPTUR. This language encourages the Department of Energy to enter into an agreement with the Department of Agriculture at various national labs to work on development of affordable and efficient food production systems for our most food insecure communities. This is a critical step towards addressing food insecurity and poverty. Lastly. Im pleased that the Advanced Light Source program is fully funded in this bill at the level of $64.95 million in FY2017. This $2 million increase over FY 2016 enacted levels will ensure that these facilities remain fully operational. including the Advanced Light Source and Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in my home district. However. I remain deeply concerned regarding the many poison pill policy riders and low funding levels included in this spending bill. We know that California is experiencing an unprecedented drought coupled with the real effects of climate change. The fact that most of H.R. 2898. the Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015. has shamefully been inserted into this bill is a disgrace. This harmful rider fails to adequately address critical elements of Californias complex water challenges and will only worsen the effects of the drought. It would also violate existing laws protecting salmon and other endangered fish in Californias BayDelta estuary. I am also concerned regarding the other harmful policy riders that would shamefully allow guns on Army Corps of Engineers land and prevent implementation of the administrations Clean Water Rule. Mr. Chairman. instead of trying to roll back vital environmental protections. we need to be proactive about preserving our environment for the health and safety of future generations. We need to make more investments in clean energy like solar. wind. and geothermal. Unfortunately. this bill does not do that.

I rise today to express my disappointment with the way the Majority has undermined the welfare of our troops E800 by inserting poisonous language into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017. Last week I unfortunately had to vote against the FY 17 NDAA. I want to state that it pained me to take that vote. Throughout my career I have supported our service members in every respect. I have worked tirelessly on veterans issues. I have worked closely with Department of Defense leadership to ensure our troops on the front lines have had every resource they needed to be successful and that our troops and their families at home were well taken care of. Last week. the Majority injected their reckless ideology into the bill: a provision that would explicitly allow defense contractors to discriminate against LGBT employees. The language seeks to nullify an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from laying off or otherwise punishing employees because of their sexual orientation. Instead of passing a bill supporting our troops. they hid behind our troops in opposing LGBT Americans. In doing this. the Majority placed the welfare of our troops in jeopardy. potentially robbing them of much needed resources. and undermined protections for LGBT employees of federal contractors created by a Presidential Executive Order. As I stated earlier. this was a difficult vote to cast. However. I also know that this was the correct vote to cast. This body should not be risking national security nor sanctioning discrimination. I urge the Republican Majority to delete this language in a HouseSenate conference. They should not play politics with our national security.",

However. the reality is that this legislation cynically uses this isolated incident to scapegoat all undocumented immigrants and undermine community policing. Specifically. H.R. 3009 would withhold critical funding for State and local law enforcement agencies as well as victims of crimes unless these jurisdictions bear the burden of enforcing Federal immigration statutes. If passed. this bill would tie the hands of local law enforcement agencies who are working to promote safety and build community trust. Requiring local police to enforce Federal immigration laws often times dissuades undocumented individuals from reporting crimes. offering testimony. and serving as witnesses in court proceedings. For example. the evidence shows that victims of domestic violence will be afraid to report these crimes to police for fear of deportation. A survey conducted by the National Domestic Violence Hotline in 2013 found that nearly 50percent of foreign born individuals were afraid to seek help because of their immigrant status. As Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson testified earlier this month. \"mandating through legislation the conduct of sheriffs and police chiefs\" is not the way to go.

Unfortunately. the Majority has chosen to politicize this tragedy by bringing this misguided and unacceptable bill to the floor. H.R. 3009 would withhold Department of Justice grants specifically targeted to enhance public safety. support community policing. and assist crime victims from states and law enforcement agencies that do not collect information regarding a persons immigration status. We can and should ensure that serious criminals who are dangerous and enforcement priorities for ICE are not released from the custody of local law enforcement. However. it is misguided and counterproductive to force local law enforcement officers to inquire about a persons immigration status at any time and for any reason in order to be eligible to receive critical public safety funding. It is also wrong and irresponsible that this bill misrepresents the immigrant community as one comprised entirely of criminals. In fact. decades of research show that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than nativeborn persons. Earlier this year. many Republicans insisted that our Homeland Security Appropriations bill include antiimmigrant riders. and threatened to shut down the Department of Homeland Security if they did not get their way. Sadly. H.R. 3009 is just more of the same from the Majority. who apparently think it is more important to incite hatred of our immigrant population for political purposes than it is to keep our communities safe and secure. If we truly want to deal with our broken immigration system. we must pass comprehensive immigration reform that treats immigrants humanely. focuses on deporting those who threaten our safety and national security. and better secures our borders.

We must continue to make sure that her killer is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. but we should not respond with irresponsible public policy. Our Founders indicated that the House of Representatives is supposed to reflect the passions of the people. but the passions should be properly channeled into an appropriate legislative vehicle. On December 14. 2012. 20 children were brutally gunned down in Sandy Hook Elementary School. More than 30.000 additional Americans have died as a result of gun violence since that fateful day. Mr. Speaker. 952 days have passed. This House has done nothing. On June 27. 2013. the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. 52 Democrats. 14 Republicans. 2 Independents. That bill would have secured our borders. That bill would have reduced the deficit by more than $850 billion over 20 years. That bill would have required undocumented immigrants to learn English. pay back taxes. pass a criminal background check. and then get at the back of the line. Mr. Speaker. 757 days have passed. This House has done nothing. Instead. we are here today considering a misguided legislative response to a terrible tragedy. That is why I offer this amendment. which will prevent the elimination or reduction of funds to State or local law enforcement organizations if the Attorney General determines that the elimination of funding would result in an overall increase in the crime rate. particularly with respect to domestic violence. sex trafficking. and crimes against children. or if it would result in a decrease in the number of trained law enforcement officers on American streets.",

Chief Farrar has actively served in various capacities to lead officers in the Rialto Police Department. His work has been described as exemplary by colleagues on account of his extreme professionalism and compassionate nature. Among Chief Farrars many accomplishments include his induction into the EvidenceBased Policing Hall of Fame for his scientific evaluation of policing practices. Throughout his tenure. he has received widespread commendation for his leadership and extensive knowledge of tactical operations. As Chief of Police. Chief Farrar has been a major proponent of integrating new technologies into everyday police activities. In doing so. he is an advocate for \"evidencebased policing.\" which consists of implementing tactics that have demonstrated proven effectiveness. He understands the complexities of modernday policing. and insists on officers continuing their education throughout their careers in order to gain a continual understanding of the field. Chief Farrars outlook has been essential for maintaining an active police force that provides public safety to people in the region. Most recently. Chief Farrar has been involved in researching Body Worn Video devices that are being implemented in police departments throughout the United States His work is contributing to the growing field of literature on the subject and is developing future police tactics. Last year. the Journal of Quantitative Criminology published an article written by him analyzing the effects of these devices on the use of force and citizens complaints against police. His knowledge in this field is bolstered by the masters degree that he received from the University of Cambridge in 2013 along with the many fellowships that he has participated in throughout the years. Chief Farrar is retiring from the Rialto Police Department. and on December 21. many members of the community will be participating in a walk of honor to celebrate his legacy. This momentous event will be a demonstration of the lasting impact that he has made on residents in the area. While he will surely be missed.

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has a long tradition of tackling FEMA and emergency management issues in a bipartisan manner. I would like to acknowledge Chairman BARLETTA and Ranking Member CARSON of the Economic Development. Public Buildings. and Emergency Management Subcommittee for leading efforts in the House to improve our Nations Emergency Alert System. Public alerts save lives. And their efforts. along with this bill. will save even more. This committee was the first to introduce legislation in 2008. and every Congress since. to modernize the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. also known as IPAWS. because we recognized the critical need to provide timely and effective disaster warnings to our citizens and communities. Modernizing the alert and warning systems will help save lives. At the committees request. the GAO issued a report in 2009 detailing key problems with FEMAs development of IPAWS. GAOs findings supported the need for legislation to ensure consultation and coordination with key stakeholders. strategic planning. and the timely rollout of the new system. GAO issued a subsequent report in 2013 identifying a continued need for guidance and testing of the system. We also heard from many stakeholders. including people with disabilities. the elderly. and industries like the broadcasters and wireless industry. that FEMA was not giving them a seat at the table as FEMA modernized the system. Involving these stakeholders who are the primary users and owners of the infrastructure is key. Without them. alerts couldnt go out. I am happy to stand here and support the culmination of that work in S. 1180. the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015. I commend the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for continuing to advocate for a nationwide integrated and interoperable system.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania . Chairman BARLETTA. and my good friend. Ranking Member PETER DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this measure today. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015 directs the administrator of FEMA to codify the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. commonly known as IPAWS. With IPAWS. Mr. Speaker. public safety officials are able to warn the public of impending hazards using multiple communications platforms. such as radio and television broadcasts. mobile devices. and other Internet services. These warnings. Mr. Speaker. can even be geographically targeted so that only those in harms way will receive the messages. All of this leads to saving lives. Mr. Speaker. and reducing property damage. During the months of May and June. tornados are most likely to strike the great Hoosier State. Getting citizens to safety or even alerting them to shelter in place before a tornado strikes can ultimately be the difference between life and death. Success in that effort. Mr. Speaker. depends largely on access to timely and precise information. During 2011. a violent storm caused the sudden collapse of a concert stage at the Indiana State Fair. This tragic incident killed seven and severely injured dozens more. It could have been much worse. Timely alerts enabled fair officials to clear the midway minutes before the storm struck. potentially saving hundreds of lives. Our committee has primary jurisdiction over IPAWS. and we have worked hard. Mr. Speaker. on this issue for several Congresses. While this bill is similar to another billH.R. 1472that the Transportation Committee reported last year. I am very disappointed that regular order was not followed in S. 1180. It should have been referred to the committee of jurisdiction so that the House of Representatives can do the job we were elected to do: consider the details and implications of all the different provisions and how they impact our alert and warning system. Despite the lack of regular order. Mr. Speaker. I still support this measure greatly. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of S. 1180. the Integrated Public Alert Warning System. or IPAWS. Modernization Act. Modernizing our alert and warning capabilities is essential to keeping us safe. We must effectively communicate important information to the public during national emergencies. and our warning efforts must evolve with the growing and emerging threats of today. During my time as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness. Response. and Communications. this was a top priority of mine. I have worked to update our alert and warning systems and utilize innovative new technologies. Since the 112th Congress. I have introduced and advocated for the passage and enactment of this important piece of legislation. which is very similar to my bill. H.R. 1738. During my work on the Integrated Public Alert Warning System Modernization Act. I heard from many stakeholders and experts who highlighted the need to ensure alert systems are available to the largest number of people. including individuals with disabilities and those living in rural areas. In 2006. FEMA implemented the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. which improved public safety by quickly disseminating emergency messages and lifesaving information to the public. However. these systems have not been modernized in decades. which is why I have consistently reintroduced this bill. With congressional oversight. we can ensure our constituents have alert systems that work reliably. effectively. and efficiently. S. 1180 provides authorization to update our communications infrastructure to allow important information and alerts for instantaneous message delivery over cell phones. text messaging. the Internet. and broadcasting. Additionally. this bill improves our capabilities and communications network by creating a national public warning working group to bring State and local officials together. This will ensure systems developers. regulators. users. and relay participants meet on a regular basis. This important legislation allows us to uphold our responsibility in the protection of the people we serve. I want to thank Senator JOHNSON for his work and advocacy on this issue. I also want to thank my colleagues: Representative SUSAN BROOKS. chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Chairman MCCAUL. and Subcommittee Chairman DONOVAN. for their support in cosponsoring my bill. H.R. 1738. This is a great step in the right direction. and we must continue this progress of modernizing our capabilities with the passage of this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.",

Off duty in Manchester one day. he noticed a commotion. A car had stopped in traffic. Steven saw that the man behind the wheel had lost consciousness. He pulled the man from his car and successfully administered CPR. not once. but twice. after the man lost consciousness a second time. He had overdosed. unfortunately. on heroin. Steven. who lost his own son to an OxyContin overdose. saved that mans life. ABC News happened to be there to document New Hampshires fight against opiates and heroin. capturing the lifeordeath moment. Steven is a credit to the Granite State. He started Dads and Moms Against Drug Dealers to stop the spread of opiates and heroin in our great State of New Hampshire. Most heroin enters our country across the southern border. where I will visit this April to investigate. As Steven knows from experience. we must stop deadly drugs like heroin from entering our country. just as we must help those who are struggling with this addiction.",

This is North Korean saber rattling in 2016 alone. It is safe to assume the Iranians were on site as witnesses to these latest violations of international law. Why? Because the Iranian scientists have been present nearly every time the North Koreans have issued or launched missiles for decades. The rogue nations of Iran and North Korea have been working together since the 1980s on missile development. During the 1990s. they started developing longrange ballistic missiles. By the 2000s. the Iranians were giving North Korea sensitive data from their own tests to improve North Korean missile systems. Mr. Speaker. North Korea already has the ability to attack South Korea. and Iran has the ability to attack Israel. These longrange missiles are intended for the United States. The American people should understand the threat we face. We should be prepared. Our Nation must sanction these belligerent powers and develop a robust missile defense system to protect our homeland.

This form of medicine works to harness the bodys existing immune system to destroy cancerous cells. without harming healthy ones. as an effective treatment against nearly all solid tumors. This year funding for the National Institutes of Health was $32.1 billion. a $2 billion increase over the year before. This increase is in no small part due to the diligence and perseverance of Vice President BIDEN who is spearheading the White Houses Cancer Moonshot. Increased funding in cancer research will allow for more research into precision medicine programs. which will help develop even more personalized technologies expand their reach. I know this generation can be the one to cure cancer. and it is due to outstanding research institutions such as the Johns Hopkins BloombergKimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Once again.

I speak today about Cotton amendment No. 1605. addressing funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration. the administration that safeguards our nuclear stockpile for the country. The Obama administration. in its budget earlier this year. requested approximately $50 million per year for the next 5 years for the administration to be able to dismantle old or obsolete warheads. My amendment would simply codify President Obamas own budget request. limiting the administration to spend $50 million per year for the next 5 years on nuclear dismantlement. My amendment also includes a waiver that would allow the President to increase the amount of spending under certain limited conditions. This amendment has been approved not only by the majority but also the minority of the Armed Services Committee. I offer this amendment because of troubling statements from the Obama administration about their intent to accelerate nuclear disarmament. however. Last month. Secretary of State Kerry announced at the Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Conference that the United States would accelerate its dismantlement of nuclear warheads by 20 percent. Beyond obsolete or outdated warheads. I do not believe that is a priority. Nuclear modernization is a priority. We should not be accelerating our nuclear disarmament by up to 20 percent because it would send the exact wrong message to Russia. other adversaries. and our allies. Russia is making overt nuclear threats to the United States and our allies. and we are going to accelerate our unilateral nuclear disarmament? That defies logic. Madam President.

It unnecessarily limits the National Nuclear Security Administrations ability to dismantle the retired nuclear weapons that no longer have any role in our national defense. The Presidents budget proposed $48 million for dismantlement. and this amendment would freeze funding at that level and at specific funding levels for the next 5 years. However. the Appropriations Committee. just last month. provided an additional $4 million for dismantlement in the Energy and Water bill. I am ranking member on that committee. It was approved on a bipartisan basis. 26 to 4. This funding is appropriate and it is justified. The fact is. there are currently approximately 2.400 retired warheads awaiting dismantlement. The rate at which we dismantle these warheads does not have anything to do with the 4.800 warheads that remain in the stockpile. consistent with the New START treaty. This is a treaty. not an agreement. The administration has committed accelerating dismantlement and we should support its goals of eliminating redundant nuclear weapons. I see no reason to imply congressional disapproval for this effort and to micromanage NNSAs weapons activity. Modernization and dismantlement go hand in hand. NNSA routinely shifts employees from weapons stockpile stewardship and modernization work to dismantlement to keep the workforce fully and usefully engaged. It is completely unnecessary to complicate this process. I object.",

Is there a reason to manage our nuclear policy? Yes. I would say there is a strong reason. On many issues. the administration has shown itself less than forthcoming in dealing with Congress. in particular on nuclear policy. As we now know. the administration minimized reports of Russias activities under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty at a time they were trying to pass the New START treaty in I would further say this amendment simply codifies the Presidents budget request. The Senator from California said $48 million for this year. For the next 4 years after that. it is $48.3 million. $50 million. $52.4 million. $51.8 million. I will concede that. in sum. that is $50.1 million per year. on average. So I am giving the administration a haircut of $100.000 per year. If that is objectionable. I would be happy to modify my amendment to put it at $50.1 million per year.

The Department of Defense is in the midst of implementing a 20 percent headquarters reduction that defense officials have planned over time to ensure that consequences of the reductions are known and managed.

I fear the Department will be forced to reduce funding to critical programs. Finally. the men and women who will likely bear the brunt of these cuts are performing the very work that Congress charged the Department of Defense to conduct.

President Obama has called NATO \"the most successful alliance in human history.\" Thats because NATO is rooted in the bedrock principle of collective defensethat we are stronger together than we are apart. This principle is built on the common values of the 28 membersdemocracy. freedom. and selfgovernment. Today. more than 18.000 troops are promoting these values in six NATO operations. From assisting Afghan security forces to defending against Russian expansionism. NATO is instrumental in advancing global security and democracy. Ive been privileged to help represent the United States at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly for the past three years. where I engage with lawmakers from our NATO partners on todays pressing security challenges. Some have called NATO obsolete. They are wrong. NATO could not be more relevant today given the dynamic threats we and our allies face.

Forest County. located in Pennsylvanias Fifth Congressional District. Thanks to the efforts of State Representative Kathy Rapp. the bridge was renamed the Lt. Col. Michael McLaughlin/ AMVETS Post 113 Memorial Bridge. Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin was actually born in Germany. but raised in Forest County. He graduated from the West Forest High School in Tionesta. and later attended Clarion University. It was there he became an ROTC cadet. and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1982. Starting his military career in the Army Reserves. Lieutenant Colonel McLaughlin went on to earn a masters degree from the University of Pittsburgh. and later became the president of his own company in Mercer. Pennsylvania. all while serving in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Throughout his service. he was highly honored. earning many ribbons and medals throughout his 26 years of service. Unfortunately. Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin was killed in the line of duty on January 5. 2006. in Ramadi. Iraq. as the result of a suicide bomber. He was just 44 years old. and left behind his wife and two daughters. McLaughlin was honored posthumously with the Purple Heart and the Combat Action Badge. He was the first field grade officer of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard to die in action since World War II. I was proud to see members of Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlins community come together to honor him with this bridge naming. It is so fitting that it came in May. the same month as Memorial Day. when we honor the men and women who lost their lives in service to our great Nation. I am the proud father of an Army soldier. Americas servicemen and -women are very important to me. With Memorial Day coming up on Monday. I want to not only recognize the sacrifice of men and women such as Lieutenant Colonel McLaughlin who have given the ultimate sacrifice. but all of the members of our Armed Forces serving across the globe and all of our Nations veterans.",

The LEC was conceived in the fall of 2005 as a partnership between the Stanislaus County Hispanic Leadership Council. El Concilio. and the County of Stanislaus. The initial goal was to formalize a communication channel with leadership from the Latino community and the Stanislaus County Office of Emergency Services in the event of an emergency. The organization is a leader in emergency communication response as well as in personal emergency preparedness. The LEC distributes emergency preparedness information throughout the community in nonemergency situations and offers training to the community as a means of building community capacity and selfreliance in emergency situations. The LEC has assisted in multiple emergency responses. such as the HINI swine flu outbreak. heat emergencies. the West Nile virus. and cold weather situations. They also participate in multiple disaster exercises. translate vital information into Spanish. provide training for underserved community members. and perform outreach throughout Stanislaus County by distributing tens of thousands of pieces of literature in Spanish. Organization members also travel to the FEMA Region IX office in Oakland. California. and in Washington. D.C.. and advocate for emergency preparedness capacity in the Latino community. Mr. Speaker. please join me in honoring and in recognizing the Latino Emergency Council for their service and outstanding contributions to the Latino community as they celebrate their tenthyear anniversary.

We are grateful for the accomplishments of the legislation over the past year. The JVTA has reinvigorated our Nations commitment to fighting sex trafficking. The legislation sought to undercut demand for sex trafficking by holding buyers and advertisers of trafficking accountable for their choices. Under the SAVE Actmy legislation that was signed into law as part of the JVTA legislative packagewe have given prosecutors the tools they need to fight these Web sites and businesses that support human trafficking by knowingly advertising victims for profit. Right now. tens of thousands of demented online advertisements are openly selling children into sexual enslavement. Predators in our communities are going online and having children delivered to their hotel rooms as easily as they would a pepperoni pizza. Today. human trafficking is moving from the streets to the Internet. making it more accessible and more insidious. The SAVE Act fights this sick explosion of trafficking on the Internet.",

Backpage.com and other exploitive Web sites. which enable human traffickers by allowing them to post ads selling the bodies and the souls of our children. are angry that the U.S. is now holding the advertisers of human trafficking accountable. Backpage.com claims that their ability to post children for sex online is a matter of free speech. It is not a matter of free speech. Mr. Speaker. It is a flagrant violation of the dignity and the basic constitutional rights of these abused and vulnerable children. Facilitating the purchase of children for sex is not a right. it is a crime. and it is a crime of the most heartless and evil proportions. In December 2015. backpage.com filed a lawsuit against the SAVE Act in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia. and they specifically named me. ANN WAGNER. in their case. They are suing us because the SAVE Act has upset their pocketbooks and hindered them from making money off human trafficking sales. I take it as a huge success that we are finally moving in the direction where adults. Web sites. and businesses that exploit victims of human trafficking cannot profit and will not be given a free pass for their despicable crimes. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act creates a legal framework to ensure that those who sell children and young women for sex. those who buy children for sex. and those who profit from human trafficking will be held accountable for their choices. But this law will be rendered useless until the Department of Justice moves to fully implement it.

We dont know because the Department of Justice has not released this information. We do know that many buyers have inexplicably been allowed to walk. Americas children are not objects to be bought and sold and abused by predators. They are children who we. as adults. have the duty to fiercely. fiercely protect.

Experimental permits currently have three uses: the research and development of new test designs. concepts. equipment. or operating techniques. to show compliance with requirements as part of the process for obtaining a license. or to train crews before they receive a license for launch or reentry. However. the FAA currently does not have the ability to grant experimental permits for launch vehicles. Under current law. they are restricted to granting permits for reusable suborbital rockets. This can require industry and the Federal Government to go to extraordinary lengths to find ways to conduct tests. In some cases. there is no alternative for testing.

I am a firm believer that commercial and government unmanned and manned space exploration complement each other. The Internet was initially a federal government research and development project that transitioned to a commercial and public resource that has in less than 2 decades fueled economic opportunities for thousands of U.S. companies large and small. The transition to commercial space exploration will need the collaboration and support of the Federal government to be sure that it is inclusive. safe and profitable. The commercial space industry must yield opportunities for all U.S. businesses. which is why I am offering Jackson Lee Amendment Number 5. The Jackson Lee Amendment requires that the provisions of the bill that address future legislation also lay the foundation for the commercial space industry to include work on how to effectively conduct outreach to small business concerns owned and controlled by women and minorities. I have worked hard to help small business owners to fully realize their current and future potential. That is why I support entrepreneurial development programs. including the Small Business Development Center and Womens Business Center programs. These initiatives provide counseling in a variety of critical areas. including business plan development. finance. and marketing. Outreach is key to developing healthy and diverse small businesses in all sectors of the economy. There are approximately 6 million minority owned businesses in the United States. representing a significant aspect of our economy. According to the most recent available Census data. minority owned businesses employ nearly 6 million Americans and generate $1 trillion dollars in economic output. Women owned businesses have increased 20% between 2002 and 2007. and currently total close to 8 million. My home city of Houston. Texas. the home of the Johnson Space Center. is also home to more than 60.000 women owned businesses. and more than 60.000 African American owned businesses. Just as the national highway system and rural electrification has led to opportunities for communities to participate in the national economy. so will federal investment in our nations infrastructure and capacity in space exploration pave the way for a new era of economic growth and opportunity.

Mr. Chair. my district is a poster child for the need for ocean coordination and information sharing between local. State. and Federal Governments. and the military. ports. shippers. energy developers. recreational users. and other stakeholders. I know firsthand that we can have a thriving ocean economy and at the same time protect and conserve our precious ocean resources. For example. the Port of Long Beach is the second busiest port in the United States in my district. moving $140 billion in goods. supporting 1.4 million jobs in the United States. Offshore oil platforms extract crude oil in San Pedro Bay less than a mile from my front door. San Clemente Island in my district has a Navy training ground and a shiptoshore firing range. Nearby waters are home to seabirds. fisheries. and migrating whales. Sea level rise and extreme weather threaten neighborhoods and businesses all along my district and the entire coast of California. With so much activity happening. it simply makes sense to have the Navy at the table when NOAA is working on siting of a new aquaculture installation. It makes sense to have the fishery management council weigh in when oil rigs are being decommissioned. and it is a nobrainer that NOAA. the Coast Guard. and the ports all work together to get these massive ships in and out of port safely. We want these collaborations to happen because we want to have a sustainable ocean economy. and by developing regional plans and having a framework for multistakeholder involvement. we can streamline this process and promote a robust ocean economy that also conserves our precious ocean resources. The country and my district need a comprehensive approach to our ocean resources. which the National Ocean Policy provides. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on my amendment.

That amount is $82 million more than the amount provided in the fiscal year 2016 act. Additionally. the committee report directs the Corps to consider the severity of risks of flooding or the frequency with which an area has experienced flooding when deciding how to allocate the additional funding provided.

I rise to offer an amendment which will help prevent an unnecessary tax increase on hardworking families and send a strong message from the House of Representatives that we oppose the administrations new mandatory climate change transportation program. In February. the Obama administration proposed creating a new program nicknamed the 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that aims to spend $320 billion over the next 10 years and divert precious taxpayer funds to selfdriving cars. highspeed rail. and mass transit in the name of preserving the environment. In fact. $20 billion of the estimated $32 billion each year for this proposed program wont go to roads or bridges. but instead will be squandered on inefficient programs that require significant taxpayer subsidies. To pay for the majority of this unlawful $320 billion program. the Obama administration has proposed a $10.25 tax on every barrel of oil. This new tax on crude oil and petroleum products will inevitably be passed on to hardworking Americans that cant afford another new tax increase from the Obama administration. In fact. the $10.25 perbarrel tax is estimated to add an additional 25 cents to the cost of every gallon of gasoline. Millions of energyrelated jobs will be put at risk and lowincome families will be forced to bear larger financial burdens as a result of this unnecessary tax that is being proposed to pay for Obamas flawed climate change transportation program. In the Department of Energys fiscal year 2017 budget. the agency requested $1.3 billion for this year and $11.3 billion over the next 10 years to fund the administrations 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan. My amendment rejects the new $10.25 tax on every barrel of crude oil and prohibits funding in this bill for the administrations flawed climate change transportation program.

Americans for Tax Reform. the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. the National Taxpayer Union. the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. Concerned Citizens for America.

A proposed rule released by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in June of 2013 found that the Gray Wolf population has grown substantially and is now considered to be recovered. and therefore. does not merit protection under the Endangered Species Act.

When Sergeant Cooke saw a noncommissioned officer shot in the torso. he draped himself on the higherranking soldier to shield him from Hasan. He was shot five times in the act of protecting anothers life. Recovering physically and mentally from the massacre at Fort Hood has been a continuing struggle for Sergeant Cooke. Despite serving two deployments in Iraq. Sergeant Cookes greatest injuries and selflessness took place on home soil.

What is happening here. for the folks listening. is that the EPA has come up with a rule that is going to strengthen protections for drinking water for 117 million people. Our Republican colleagues have brought forth a resolution to disapprove of the rule. leaving people vulnerable to the status quo. This comes out to about one in three Americans across the country and perhaps one in five Minnesotans in my home State. Now. I am critically concerned about all of AmericaI am a U.S. Congressmanwhich leads me to the situation in Flint. The fact is that. by clarifying that waters are protected under the Clean Water Act. the rule would reduce the amount of pollution entering major rivers and waterways. This would mean less corrosive water. which is part of what led to the water crisis being seen in Flint. Michigan. right now. When the highly corrosive water of the Flint River passes through Flints service pipes. it leaches lead out of the pipes and into residents drinking glasses. bathtubs. and swimming pools. The water crisis in Flint reminds us that failure to step up and protect our water supply puts the lives of the public in danger. Eight thousand children are now facing poisoning because of this nasty situation. In Flint. residents were forced to pay for water that was poisoning them. by an unelected emergency manager. A mother and Flint resident. Lee Ann Walters. started bathing her children with bottled water. as she learned that her children were showing signs of lead poisoning and that the lead levels in her tap water were seven times higher than the minimum safety standard. The entire city has been exposed to dangerous lead levels. including as many as 8- to 10.000 children. If this does not compel us to stand up and fight for clean water. I dont know what will.

It is called so for a reason. which is our land lies low. I think of the farm I grew up on. My father got it about the time I was born. The reality of this measure. if these rules promulgated by the administration simply move forward. as has been referenced by several different speakers. that which he thought he got. he would have gotten a lot less of. I think that. fundamentally. this is about private property rights. It is about what Philip Howard talked about years ago in his book \"The Death of Common Sense.\" I dont think it makes common sense to classify as navigable waters of the U.S. so many of these dry streambeds or dry areas in any part of this country. I also think that this is fundamentally about the rule of law. We have a real tension in this country. particularly during the time of this administration. on: Do we stick with this 200year tradition we have had in place or do we move toward rule by edict? I think it would be a huge mistake to go down the other avenue. But. fundamentally. that is what this debate is about. It is about how do we decide things? There will always be disagreement. But how do we decide things? Finally. I think this is about taking something that wasnt partisan. I go back to the Clean Water Act. in its origination. was a bipartisan bill. but making it partisan by. again. executive overreach. So my colleague from Oregon. who is a dear friend and I think a strong advocate. mentioned the fact that he has strongly advocated for craft brewers back home. It would take me many beers to buy into the notion of moving forward without change. I think this is about upholding a 200year tradition in this country on rule of law. I think it is about protecting farmers. whether they be in Johns Island. South Carolina. or the outskirts of Texas. or. for that matter. it is about those of us who love the environment. but sticking with this tradition of deciding these things in this Chamber.",

Res. 22. a resolution to disapprove the waters of the U.S. rule. a rule that amounts to a massive overreach by the Obama administrations EPA. This rule and the process in which the EPA developed it ignored stakeholders. ignored States. and. as reports have shown. even ignored concerns from the Army Corps of Engineers. the Federal agency that was supposed to be codeveloping the rule. Through hearings. letters. and public forums. we repeatedly asked the administration to simply start over with a process that works with stakeholders to achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act. rather than act like a schoolyard bully. We all want clean water. and we can and should work together to achieve it. Unfortunately. all of these requests fell on deaf ears. and the administration. in what has become an alltoocommon pattern. moved forward to ram this bill through with little regard to the comments or the concerns of Americans. The final rule ignores the spirit and the intent of the law in that EPA has claimed Federal jurisdiction over essentially any body of water. such as a farm pond. or even a ditch that is dry most of the year. Americas farmers and ranchers deserve a government that will review and consider their thoughts. not a government that refuses to engage stakeholders and hands down orders from on high. The process of developing the rule was flawed from the getgo. and the final product was right on par with an administration that wants to impose its authoritarian will on every inch of this great land.

I think that time would be better spent. perhaps. on initiating hearings and looking toward. in the next Congress. Congress exerting its constitutional authority to revisit the Clean Water Act. which hasnt been revisited in 27 years. We have learned a lot about waters of the United States in the last 27 years. what needs to be protected and what can be exempted. We have certainly learned a lot since the Bush era when a rule was written that indiscriminately covers ditches. and other features of farms and roadwork. That was a mistake. So we could. I believe. probably. like we did with the WRRDA bill in the last Congress. or the surface transportation bill in this Congress. have a pretty vigorous debate. but come up with a decent way forward. because nobody disagrees over the need for clean water in this country. It is a precious. precious commodity. I yield back the balance of my time.",

They can inflict incredible pain on innocent victims and their families. President Obamas own Secretary of Homeland Security has called such policies \"not acceptable\" and \"counterproductive to public safety.\" Yet Democrats voted to block two proposals that would have worked to prevent socalled sanctuary city policies from existing in the first place and would have enhanced penalties to keep more criminals off our streets when cities refuse to do away with such policies. Senator TOOMEY offered one of them. the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act. which he described this way: My legislation stands for the simple proposition that the safety of the American people matters. The life of Kate Steinle matters. Protecting our neighborhoods from violent criminals and terrorists matters. Senator TOOMEYs bill would have ensured more fairness for citizens and governments that do the right thing. It would have supported police officers. who risk everything for our safety. and it enjoyed critical support from several law enforcement organizations. Democrats again chose partisan politics over making a difference for the American people. I know Senator TOOMEY wont be deterred. I know he will continue his work to do something about this issue. He has been an outspoken leader against the dangerous and extreme policies of sanctuary cities for some time now. I thank him for his leadership on this issue and his tireless work to advance this measure. I also recognize Senator CRuz for his legislation. Kates Law. which would have helped protect the public even when jurisdictions continue to follow socalled sanctuary city policies by putting more dangerous criminals behind bars and off our streets. These measures would have sought to prevent the kind of pain that Kates family has been forced to endure. a pain that no family should have to experience.",

AK. as this weeks Arkansan of the Week. for teaching Arkansas students to share his love of music and pushing them to succeed in everything they do. Patrick just completed his fourth year as band director for the entire Fountain Lake School District. As the programs sole instructor. Patrick teaches instrumental music for all middle school and high school students and directs both the marching and symphonic bands. To put that in perspective. the Fountain Lake Middle School and High School have a combined student body of over 800 students. Patrick is remarkable not just for teaching so many students. although I know that is a feat in and of itself. Under his direction. the Fountain Lake music program has truly soared. Over the last 4 years the number of Fountain Lake students who earned a place in allregion bands more than doubled. and the number of students who won competitive tryouts in the Four States Honor Band and the Arkansas AllStar Band both more than tripled. As a group. the Fountain Lake band earned a first division ranking in concert assessment for all 4 years of Patricks tenure. In 3 of his 4 years. the band also had the honor of being an Arkansas Sweepstakes band. Most recently. the Fountain Lake band was one of only two Arkansas bands selected to participate in this years National Independence Day Festival on the Fourth of July here in Washington. I was able to see the Fountain Lake band while they were in town and congratulate them on this big achievement. While I. unfortunately. wasnt able to see the parade in person. all reports indicated their performance was spectacular. I know I speak for all Arkansans when I say they truly made the Natural State proud. I am confident their success was due in no small part to Patricks leadership. as well as the hard work of Fountain Lake students. I am honored to recognize Patrick Combs as this weeks Arkansan of the Week and commend him for his dedication to music education and the Fountain Lake School District. Arkansas is lucky that a passionate educator like Patrick calls our State home. I yield the floor.",

That is the difference between what happened on the process of developing a GMO bill and the process of developing our response to the Zika epidemic. Everybody knows what happened here. We had a bipartisan compromise that passed the Senate. It went to a conference committee. Democrats were shut out of the conference committee. I am a member of that conference committee. There was no negotiation between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans on the conference committee threw out the bipartisan compromise that was negotiated here in the Senate in order to address the concerns of very conservative Members of the House Republican caucus. and the bill got loaded up with all of the things that Senator DURBIN mentioned. At the top of the list was a ban on funding for Planned Parenthood. which Republicans on the conference committee knew would poison the well. They knew that by putting in a ban on funding for Planned Parenthood. they would make it impossible to pass the Zika supplemental request. We dont need to engage in hyperbole or histrionics. That is what happened. What happened is the Republicans decided to put a bill on the floor of the Senate that couldnt pass. knowing exactly what could pass because weeks earlier we had formed a compromise that was thrown out the window. It is a little unpleasant to be lectured to about why Democrats are unwilling to support the Zika bill that is in front of us because Republicans know exactly why we cant support it.

There is absolutely no question. student loan debt is an enormous problem in this country. We all know the facts.

Nearly threequarters of college seniors graduate with some debt. bachelors degree recipients graduate with an average of almost $30.000 in debt. The Federal Government. the States. colleges and universities and other relevant actors in higher education must come together to address this issue.

I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the previous question so that we can amend the rule to bring up the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. The magnitude of the problem cannot be overlooked. In 2013. there were 37 million American student loan borrowers with outstanding student loans. Those 37 million American students hold an enormous $1.3 trillion in student loan debt. as my friend from Connecticut mentioned. Student loan debt is growing by $3.000 per second. The Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act would be a good first step in allowing students to refinance their loans and put some muchneeded money back in their pockets and back in the American economy. In 2012. Congress passed a bill to allow new student loan borrowers to receive a low interest rate. Unfortunately. students with existing student loan debt were left out of this fix. This bill would provide those students who borrowed before 2012 the same opportunities that new borrowers have. If student loan borrowers could get lower interest rates. they would be able to more fully participate in the economy. They could buy houses. eat out in restaurants. move out of their parents homes. or even just have enough money to save for a better future. This bill is simple. and it fixes a fundamental inequity.

The Bayfield Wolverines traveled to Kersey. Colorado and capped their perfect season with a hard fought 2820 victory over the Platte Valley High School Broncos. winning their first state championship in football since 1996. The last time Bayfield High School won a state championship in any sport was back in 2005. making this victory that much sweeter. and ensuring that the players and coaches of this season can look back and be proud of their hard work which ended the drought.

His success in providing highquality learning opportunities for students at Penn is nothing short of remarkable. Every year. the Indiana Association of School Principals (IASP) recognizes outstanding principals who have succeeded in providing highquality learning opportunities for students. Recipients are chosen based on their performance in showing leadership at the building level. at the district and community level. and at the state level. Every one of us depends on our teachers. and because of that. they deserve our support and appreciation. For nearly 20 years. Principal Hope has been contributing to the betterment of Indiana education. Since he became the principal of Penn High School in 2008. Indianas Department of Education has named Penn an Arated school and a 4Star Award winner. U.S. News and World Report also named Penn an Outstanding High School in 2009 and 2015. Because of leaders like Principal Hope. Hoosier classrooms are filled with future doctors. scientists. and entrepreneurs. Principal Hopes efforts have been instrumental in advancing Indianas education system. In 2010. he initiated the reorganization of Penn from a traditional high school to personalized approach through a $1.7 million dollar E1725 federal grant. This program begins with the Freshman Academy. which helps middle school students acclimate to high school. and offers six other academies which support college and career readiness. This includes Fine Arts & Communications. Management & Business. Health and Human Services. STEM. World Languages. and the Early College Academy. Contributions like these would not be possible without the efforts of passionate educators like Principal Hope. This smaller learning community structure is successful because of Principal Hopes dedication to both the students and the teachers. As a leader. he sees that students excel when they are taught by highly engaged and trained teachers and staff. Because of this. Principal Hopes vision also focuses on professional development for teachers. Quite simply. his work is bettering the lives of Hoosiers. I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Principal Hope for helping students and teachers at Penn develop their talents and become our future leaders. On behalf of myself and my fellow Hoosiers. I congratulate him on receiving this prestigious award.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. charitable remainder trusts present an opportunity for donors to transfer assets for the benefit of charity. Lack of certainty regarding the tax consequences of early terminations of these trusts has deterred early terminations. which has deferred the transfer of substantial assets to charity. Early terminations of charitable remainder trusts should be encouraged because they permit charities to access their share of the trusts assets earlier (and. in some instances. decades earlier) than otherwise would be the case. This is particularly compelling given that. under current economic conditions. many charities have been forced to cut back on many deserving programs. My bill provides that. on an early termination of a charitable remainder trust. the donor and the charity will apportion the value of the trust using the same methodology that was used to determine the value of the remainder interest on formation. The donor will recognize capital gain on the total value received. the charity will receive its share of the trusts assets. and the early termination will not constitute selfdealing or otherwise disqualify the charitable remainder trust. Today. Rep. RANGEL and I are introducing this bill which clarifies the tax consequences of early terminations of charitable remainder trusts and encourages the early transfer of funds in such trusts to charities. Mr. Speaker. I urge all my colleagues to support our bill to give charities earlier access to funds for use in their worthwhile endeavors.",

The global community continues to mourn the horrific terrorist attacks in Paris. These attacks remind us of the importance of our freedom and democracy in our turbulent worldthese values must be actively safeguarded each day. Ukraine has been doing just that: fighting for its democracy and freedom each E1726 daydenouncing Russian authoritarianism and combating Putins aggression. Ukrainians are on the ground battling Russian separatists and thugs attempting to steal their democratic freedoms and undermine their selfgovernance. As a result. Ukraine has suffered 7.883 deaths and 17.610 wounded citizens. according to OCHAs latest report. Five million Ukrainians have been affected by Russias aggression. It is shocking that this number is hardly discussed. One million Ukrainians have fled Ukraine since 2014. and 1.5 million Ukrainians are considered Internally Displaced People. And these numbers continue to rise. Ukraine needs more humanitarian assistance. and they need it now. Winter is fast approaching. Time is running out for winterization. Temperatures will plummet to 0 degrees and below. Eastern Ukraine has already experienced its first snowfall. We must act before it is too late. Today. many Ukrainians have little to no access to humanitarian assistance because very few humanitarian partners have received authorization from the de facto authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk to operate. Restrictions on freedom of movement have resulted in civilians waiting 24 hours before they can cross checkpoints across the ceasefire line which will be impossible to do in the winter. Additionally. a recent assessment has discovered that 20 percent of Internally Displaced People reside in destroyed or damaged homes. These homes need rebuilding materials now as temperatures continue to drop. These crucial humanitarian supplies need to be airlifted to Ukraine. and the United States should expand its efforts in helping to provide these supplies. It is becoming ever more critical by the day. Lets bring more humanitarian assistance to our partner in democratic freedom. Ukraine. immediatelybefore the death toll increases any higher.",

Mitchell and his compatriots came under fire by North Vietnamese troops in the early morning of May 5. 1968. A firefight ensued and. after a barrage of North Vietnamese mortar rounds. an American weapons platoon tent became engulfed in flames. Mitchell stormed into the conflagration amid exploding ammunition and carried a badly wounded Marine. who was trapped in the tent. to safety. Later that same day. Mitchells company was ordered to begin an assault on two villages. The platoon embarked on the mission and eventually encountered an open trenchwhich was riddled with North Vietnamese soldiers. North Vietnamese soldiers lobbed grenades at the American troops from the trench. in response. Mitchell and two of his fellow Marines fired their weapons into the trench. killing the entire line of North Vietnamese soldiers. With the trench cleared of enemy fire. the American platoon was able to proceed with the attack on the villages. Mitchell was awarded a Bronze Star for his actions. In addition. Mitchell also earned. among others. a Purple Heart. a Good Conduct Medal. a National Defense Service Medal. Combat Action Ribbons. and a Presidential Unit Commendation Ribbon.

The message from that hearing was unanimous and clear: it is time for Congress to act and advocate for solutions that not only address funding fixes. but more importantly advocate for solutions that improve the management of our national forests. H.R. 2647. the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015. which passed the House last summer. has been referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee. This legislation. while not perfect. includes provisions that attempt to address both the funding mechanism and incorporate meaningful forest management tools which are the paramount issues in the overall wildfire debate. I recognize the challenges that remain ahead with crafting such a legislative proposal that satisfies all interested parties involved in this larger debate. With that being said. I stand ready to work with my colleagues to find areas where common ground and consensus can be achieved to address the overall wildfire issues facing us today. I look forward to working together with Senator MURKOWSKI. Senator ENZI. and others to provide the necessary tools to expedite the much needed work on not just Western forests. but also nationwide. encompassing Federal. State. and private forest lands.",

    "speech": "I thank Senator ROBERTS. I look forward to working with him as well. And he is right. The wildfire problem is not just a budgeting problemit is also a management problem. Reforming the way we manage our forests is absolutely crucial. Healthy. resilient forests are fireresistant forests. yet despite knowing the value of fuel reduction treatments in mitigating wildfire risks. increasing firefighter safety. and protecting and restoring the health of our forests. active management is still often met with a series of discouraging and near insurmountable obstacles. High upfront costs. long planning horizons. and regulatory requirementsincluding what seem like unending environmental reviewsare impeding our ability to implement treatments at the pace and scale these wildfires are occurring. We must also work with our State agencies. local communities. and the public to increase community preparedness and install fuel breaks to break up fuel connectivity to keep fires small. As you can see here. the chairmen of the committees with jurisdiction over the wildfire budgeting and forest management issues are ready to roll up our sleeves in 2016. We are going to work through regular order. in a transparent and collaborative manner. to come up with a legislative solution. We look forward to the input of our colleagues. who also care deeply about these issues. My plan is to dedicate whatever time we have in February after this bill clears the floorand the entire month of Marchto producing this legislative product. I appreciate Members willingness to work with us and believe we are on a good track to find real solutions to our wildfire challenges.",

Weld was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today. Welds incorporation on February 8. 1816. was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years. Maines Western Mountains were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Weld today. The early settlers at what was called Webbs Pond Plantation were drawn by fertile soil. vast forests. and fastmoving waters. which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. The wealth produced by the land and by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. Weld is a town of patriots. Its namesake. Benjamin Weld. was a hero of the American Revolution. Ninetythree townsmen answered freedoms call during the Civil War. more than 20 gave their lives preserving our great Nation. The veterans memorials at the town library stand in silent tribute to those who have defended America throughout our history. Weld also is a town of involved citizens. The active historical society. volunteer fire department. and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into this yearlong bicentennial celebration are evidence that Welds spirit grows only stronger. This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before. Weld has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today. it has a bright future.",

Lieutenant Colonel Johnson passed away on August 29. 2015. and was laid to rest January 14. 2016. at Arlington National Cemetery. Born and raised in Minneapolis. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson enjoyed playing music with his garage band. the Commodores. and studying airplanes. Upon graduating from Roosevelt High School in 1955. Johnson enlisted in the Minnesota Air National Guard. where he served for 2 years before entering the U.S. Air Force Academy to become an officer. After he received his commission as a second lieutenant. Johnson went on to earn his wings and begin his career flying the F100 Super Sabre. one of the planes that he would fly during the Vietnam war. It was in this plane that Johnson earned the Silver Star. defending the Tong Le Chan Special Forces camp. heroically making nine passes at low altitude against intense hostile fire in support of our troops. Later in the war. after being forced to eject over North Vietnam. Johnson would spend nearly 15 months as a POW in Hanoi. Despite this trying time. Johnsons resolve and the love he had for his country remained intact. and he continued to serve for many years after his release in 1973. Our country will always need brave men like Lt. Col. Kenneth R. Johnson. He embodied our Nations most cherished values and served as an example to us all. Today my thoughts and prayers are with his family. including his brother Phil. his two sons. Bradley and David. and his sister. Delores. May we always remember and cherish his memory.*",

Today I wish to recognize the hard work and dedication of one of my constituents who played that role for countless Oregonians Ann Marion Furukawa Dondero from Forest Grove. Ann was raised in Sunnyside. WA. and graduated from Whitman College in 1966 with a psychology degree and a teachers certificate. She taught first grade for 3 years in St. Paul. MN. while her husband. Russ. completed graduate school and later taught second and fourth grade in Boiling Springs. PA. when Russ started his political science teaching career. When Ann and Russ moved their young family to Forest Grove. Ann continued her education and enrolled in night classes at Pacific University where Russ had started teaching. In addition to raising their two sons. Tony and Jason. Ann also began volunteering in Forest Groves library across the street from her classes. Eventually. Anns enthusiasm to share her love of reading turned into a career spanning five decades. The library became Anns classroom where she worked with parents and caregivers to help children become active readers. In 1975. Ann and her former colleague Barbara Dunnette organized BEAR monthBe Enthusiastic About Readingat the Forest Grove Library. and the tradition has continued ever since. January 2016 will be the 37th annual BEAR month at Forest Grove. Anns dedication and love of learning is an inspiration to our State and our Nation. and I have no doubt there are kids today who are better off because of Anns selfless devotion. I thank Ann for her many years of hard work and for the great things she has done to promote reading and literacy in the Forest Grove community.*",

While we were once living in an era of energy scarcity. we are now living in an era of higher energy production and lower technology costs. It is change that represents many opportunities but also challengesaging infrastructure. bureaucratic hurdles. outdated policies. and needless redtape. These are the kinds of challenges we will need to address if we want to support Americas rise as one of the worlds preeminent energy superpowers and if we want to support the accompanying potential for jobs. for growth. and for increased energy independence. That is why the Senate is considering the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It is broad. bipartisan legislation that will modernize our energy policies to keep pace with a changing world. It will help Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It will help Americans save energy. This bipartisan bill builds on technological progress in order to strengthen and sustain Americas energy advances while protecting our environment at the same time. all without raising taxes or adding to the deficit. It is the latest reminder of what is possible with cooperation in this Senate. A huge majority of the Senate energy committee supported the bill when it came to a vote. The top Republican on the committee supported it and the top Democrat on the committee supported it. They are the managers of this bill today. They have worked with Members of both parties and have lined up amendments already. They are working with Members of both parties to schedule even more. If you have an amendment you would like considered. please work with them. Lets get this process moving. Lets get this bill passed so we can support more jobs. more growth. and more energy independence for our country.",

We put taxpayers back on the hook for losses that are connected to certain derivatives trading. among the riskiest bets that banks make. Well. Christmas is over. and Hanukkah is over. but the gifts keep on coming for Wall Street. Within this bill is another provision that cuts at the heart of the DoddFrank Wall Street reform legislation. It delays a portion of the Volcker rule. which bans federally insured banks from making those risky bets or investing in risky funds. including packages known as collateralized loan obligations. or CLOs. Mortgagebacked securities brought our economy almost crumbling to the ground in 2008. and we are still recovering. Taxpayers bailed out the big banks. yet for millions of homeowners who were forced from their homes and millions of others who are still under water. there hasnt been any assistance. People are right to be angry about this. and they are right to object to this new giveaway to Wall Street interests. CLOs are similar to toxic mortgagebacked securities. The only difference is that instead of bad mortgages. these packages involve junkrated corporate loans and a mix of other risky assets. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month that the corporate debt market is overheating and becoming increasingly dangerous. and CLOs are the big reason why. This has all the markings of another economycrushing disaster. Who gets the upside if Wall Street is able to continue packaging and selling CLOs with taxpayer backing? Wall Street. Who loses if and when those bets go wrong? The rest of us. It is heads. Wall Street wins. tails. everybody else loses.

This research is critical for physicians and decisionmakers to more accurately assess potential health risks in this area. I want to thank my friend. Mr. HULTGREN. for introducing this legislation along with Mr. LIPINSKI of Illinois. A virtually identical bill passed the House by a voice vote this past November in the previous Congress. Many Americans are exposed to a broad range of low doses of ionizing radiation. These range from cosmic background radiation to medicallybased procedures which include x rays and CT scans. However. our current approach of radiation safety relies on an outmoded assumption that because high doses of radiation are harmful. it necessarily follows that much lower radiation doses are also harmful. This assumption is not based on a reliable scientific foundation. prevents patients from making informed decisions about diagnostic exams. and can lead to overly restrictive regulations. The Department of Energys Low Dose Radiation Research Program within the Office of Science focuses on the health effects of ionizing radiation and helps to resolve the uncertainties in this area that currently exist. Unfortunately. this program has not been a priority at DOE over recent years and has seen systematic deemphasis. H.R. 35 ensures the continuance and enhancement of this important research program. This legislation also directs the National Academies to formulate a longterm strategy to resolve uncertainties surrounding whether and to what extent lowdose radiation may pose health risks to humans. The bill stipulates that the academies must consider the most uptodate studies in this field of research. Finally. the bill requires the Department of Energy to develop a 5year research plan that responds to the Academies recommendations. I again thank the gentlemen from Illinois. Representatives HULTGREN and LIPINSKI. for their leadership on this issue. I also want to commend Congressmen SENSENBRENNER. POSEY.

Space. and Technology. Chairman SMITH. for helping me to bring this legislation to the floor. While it may sound scary. we come in contact with small amounts of radiation every day from the cosmic background which many Americans are probably unaware of. Of course. radiation has been a useful tool which has led to innovation for medical imaging. like x rays and treatments. Numerous processes used by manufacturers in my home State of Illinois. for instance. include lowdose radiation to carry out precise and accurate measurements. But it is time that the regulatory structure surrounding exposure to lowdose radiation relies on sound science. Currently. the assumption is that because high doses of radiation are harmful to human health. lower doses must be. too. This is similar to saying that jumping down one step in a flight of stairs is harmful to your health because we already know that it is harmful to jump down an entire flight of stairs at one time. While there is little doubt that there is a threshold above which humans should avoid exposure to radiation. this legislation will ensure that the Department of Energys Office of Science prioritizes the research necessary to understand what that level actually is. My bill directs the agency to work with the National Academies to formulate a longterm research plan to do this work. As I continue to represent my constituents of the 14th Congressional District of Illinois. I will always champion the things we are doing right in Illinois. Our State has a long history of innovation in this space. For many years we have led the Nation in nuclear power generation. and the work we continue to do in our national labs is pushing the boundaries in our frontiers of knowledge.

H.R. 23. the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2015. reauthorizes the activities of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program through Representative RANDY NEUGEBAUER. my Texas colleague. has championed this program for over a decade. In the last Congress. he and Representative FREDERICA WILSONs bipartisan efforts helped move this legislation through the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology and to successfully pass the House. It is because of their past work that we are able to bring this bill to the House floor so early in this Congress. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program supports Federal research and development efforts to help mitigate the loss of life and property due to windrelated hazards. Millions of Americans live in areas vulnerable to hurricanes. tornadoes. and other windstorms. The National Weather Service reported 91 deaths and 892 injuries in 2013 due to tornadoes. thunderstorm wind. and high wind. We all remember that in 2011 that was the year marred by loss due to windstorms. According to the National Science and Technology Councils biennial report to Congress. in 2011 only. windstorms in the United States took nearly 700 lives. injured nearly 7.000 people. and caused an estimated $11 billion in total direct property losses. In Texas. we are all too familiar with the harm that excess wind can cause. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Storm Prediction Center. 128 tornadoes and 1.366 windstorms were reported in Texas in the last 2 years. The effects of these disasters can be felt for a long time. Initially established in 2004. the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program supports activities to improve our understanding of windstorms and their impacts and helps to develop and encourage the implementation of costeffective mitigation measures. H.R. 23 establishes the National Institute of Standards and Technology as the lead agency for the program. improves coordination and planning of agency activities in a fiscally responsible manner. and improves transparency for how much money is being spent on windstorm research. I want to thank Representative NEUGEBAUER for his continued efforts to support this program. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

First I want to thank Representatives NEUGEBAUER and WILSON for their hard work on this important legislation that will benefit our constituents. Americans face significant exposure to windstorms. According to the National Weather Service. between the years of 2003 and 2013. thousands of Americans lost their lives from the impacts of windstorms. Along with the loss of life. windstorms during that time caused billions of dollars of damage to property. including a severely negative impact on agricultural crops. Although we cannot stop a windstorm from happening. there is much we can do to save both lives and property when windstorms and other natural disasters do happen. In addition to responding quickly and with sufficient resources in the aftermath of a natural disaster. we must also invest in preparedness and resilience. Studies of FEMAs PreDisaster Mitigation program have shown that for every dollar invested in mitigation activities. $3 to $4 in recovery costs can be saved. The National Windstorm Reduction Program Act is primarily a mitigation program. It has the potential to lessen the loss of life and economic damage by supporting research and development on windstorms and their impacts and helping to ensure that this research is translated into improving building codes and emergency planning. but this program needs robust investment to achieve that result. The bill today includes a lower total authorization level than was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008. We can and we should do better than that. One of our responsibilities as a government should be to assist our constituents with disaster mitigation and response and preparedness. and that means investing in programs we already have in place to carry out these responsibilities. Nevertheless. I understand the need to reauthorize this important program. and I thank my colleagues for agreeing to maintain the authorization levels negotiated last Congress. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

The last few years have been devastating years for natural disasters across the country. There were massive tornadoes across the Midwest that resulted in loss of life and significant economic damages. In addition. Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 caused widespread destruction and death along the Eastern seaboard. H.R. 23 directs NIST. NSF. NOAA. and FEMA to support activities to improve the understanding of windstorms and their impacts. We can use that knowledge to reduce the vulnerability of our communities to natural disasters. The NWIRP program helps our federal agencies and communities across the nation develop and implement many measures that help minimize the loss of life and property during windstorms and to rebuild effectively and safely after such storms. I was pleased that when this bill was considered by the House Science. Space. and Technology Committee last Congress. we worked in a bipartisan manner and made several improvements to the bill. We worked together to increase the authorization for FEMA. the agency tasked with implementing the research conducted by the other NWIRP agencies. Additionally. we added several social sciencerelated provisions to the bill. We cannot design effective disaster preparation strategies without understanding how people make decisions and respond to disaster warnings. This is a compromise bill and so it doesnt contain as much as I think should be done. In particular. I wish this bill included authorization increases for the NWIRP agenciesincreases that are justified by the important activities those agencies carry out. However. it is still a good bill and an important bill for us to act on. I want to thank my fellow TexansChairman SMITH and Mr. NEUGEBAUERfor working across the aisle on this bill and for bringing it to the floor today. And I want to thank Ms. WILSON for her efforts on this legislation. It was good to see Members of the Committee coming together. working out their differences. compromising. and ending up with a bill with bipartisan support. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support this important bill.",

Trade allows that to happen. When the American worker gets a chance to compete on a level playing field. we win. That is why we need trade agreements. The truth is. under the policies of this administration. paychecks are shrinking. For many workers. there is more month than money as they struggle to pay their bills. Killing this legislation does nothing to help those workers. In fact. it would only make their situation worse. Traderelated jobs pay better. And when 95 percent of the Earths population lives outside the United States. we cant afford to pull up the drawbridges and shut out the rest of the world.

Indiana and graduated from Covington High School. His service to our Nation began immediately after his high school graduation when he joined the United States Army. He later earned his B.S. at Indiana State University in 1951 and also attended Eastern Illinois University where he was a member of Sigma Pi. Though working in the Indiana banking industry. Myers never abandoned his farming roots as he continued to work a farm in Fountain County. Before long however. Myers returned his attention to public service becoming a member of this honorable House of Representatives. He first took office in 1967. winning fifteen consecutive elections and continuing his admirable public service for 30 years before retiring in 1997. During his tenure representing Indianas 7th District in the United States Congress. Mr. Myers became known locally as an essential player in the Lafayette Railroad Relocation Project. a three decades long project that moved the trains from city streets and into a dedicated corridor. The Main Street Bridge was in fact renamed in his honor after the pedestrian bridge was opened as part of the rail relocation project. As Indiana Governor Pence noted while paying tribute to Congressman Myers. \"The legacy of public service he leaves behind is unmatched. and we do well to strive to emulate his example.\" E147 Congressman Myers passed away in his Covington home leaving behind his wife Carol. daughters Carol Ann Myers and Lori Jan Kerns. seven grandchildren and several nieces and nephews. I offer my sincerest condolences to the Myers family. We grieve with you as we mourn the loss of a great Hoosier who lived a life of servant leadership while humbly representing our district in the U.S. House of Representatives for three decades.

Princeville is located in Edgecombe County in my Congressional District and was originally known as Freedom Hill when it was founded at the close of the Civil War in 1865 by newlyfreed slaves who sought protection in the Union Army encampments there. Following the departure of the Union soldiers. many of the former slaves stayed behind and formed a free community in Freedom Hill. The settlement grew and was incorporated on February 20. 1885. as Princeville in honor of Turner Prince. a former slave who used his carpentry skills to build many homes in the free community for his family and others who sought refuge there. The Town of Princeville and its residents have endured much over its 130 year history. Whether it was racial prejudice. social and economic isolation. or Hurricane Floyd that nearly destroyed Princeville. the Town and its proud residents remain resilient and dedicated to building for the future. Today. the Town has well over 2.000 residents and continues to grow. The Town of Princeville serves as a symbol of the selfdetermination. endurance. and fearlessness of the African Americans who braved the unimaginable horrors of slavery to reclaim their lives and build a lasting community for future generations. Today we celebrate Princevilles incredible survival and its unique place in African American culture and United States History. Princevilles story deserves recognition so that the historical and social significance of the E148 Town and the unwavering spirit of its people are widely known. Mr. Speaker.

Their commitment to helping the elderly population has also led to the sponsorship of two residential housing projects for lowincome seniors and an affiliated home attendant program that provides inhome attendant and care services. Building off their incredible success in the Bronx. R.A.I.N. has recently expanded its services to Manhattan and has licensed to provide Home Health Care in all five New York City boroughs as well as Westchester County. Today. R.A.I.N. has funding that accounts for 1.600 meals on wheels. 325 daily meals to the hungry and homeless. and 11 senior centers providing quality programming to over 100 seniors at each site every day. Thousands of New Yorkers have come to rely on R.A.I.N. as a lifeline. and as a Congressman representing parts of the Bronx it is always heartwarming and comforting to see one of R.A.I.N.s trucks on a block in my district. R.A.I.N. celebrated their 50th Anniversary on October 30th 2014. I want to personally thank their Board for all of the years of great service to the community. The work done by R.A.I.N. has literally saved lives and I am so proud to have such a caring organization operating in my district. Heres to many more great years.",

That has been the case with the Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church in the Bronx. which celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 2014. The Mt. Carmel Pentecostal Church has been a beacon of hope and source of strength for its parishioners for so long because of the incredible commitment made by its leaders. Pastors Moulton and Judith Esdaille. who have served their community unselfishly for over 30 years. Their work to advance and grow the church they loved started in roles like Sunday School Teacher. Choir Director and Evangelist among others. Over time. Pastors Moulton and Judith began working to expand their congregation by developing outreach programs. Driven by their creed. \"Each One. Win One.\" Pastors Moulton and Judith have made it their mission to help those in need. They created the Bronx Park East Home for the Aging Outreach program. the Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church Partners with Feed the Hungry program. a youth mentorship program. a monthly tract program to increase spiritual awareness in the community and a series of enrichment classes to uplift parishioners. They have also been able to partner their church with Mission to Africa and Haiti organizations. sending food. clothing and supplies to areas of the globe that are in dire need of assistance. In addition to all Pastors Moulton and Judith have achieved for their church. they are also loving parents who have managed to juggle three children and family responsibilities with two fulltime secular jobs by day. They are truly an impressive combination of leaders. who have done incredible work to reach out and touch the lives of countless people all throughout the world. In 2014 the Mt. Carmel Pentecostal Church honored Pastors Moulton and Judith Esdaille for all of their fantastic accomplishments and contributions. Id like to echo the congratulations of the church and thank Moulton and Judith for all theyve accomplished and done for the Bronx community and beyond.",

For several decades. the Riverdale neighborhood has benefitted from the hard work and dedication of Susan Goldy. one of the northwest Bronxs most respected citizens and my dear friend. Susans work in Riverdale began in earnest in 1981 when she established her own agency. Susan E Goldy Inc.. which specialized in the sale and rental of residential property. Her company immediately earned high marks for its professionalism. courtesy. integrity and reliability. As Susans agency grew she began to enhance her involvement in other real estate related ventures. including the Bronx Manhattan North Association of Realtors. an organization which she served as President of in 1995 and 1996. Later. Susan became a member of the New York State Association of Realtors (NYSAR) serving on and chairing many committees within NYSAR focused on growing communities through real estate interests. Not surprisingly in 2012. Susan was elected President of NYSAR. an obvious reflection of her outstanding work ethic and accomplishments within the organization and beyond. Susan has been recognized over the years with numerous awards and honors from different community groups and organizations. including the YMCA. the Kingsbridge Riverdale Van Cortlandt Development Corporation and the New York State Legislature. She has also done a great deal of volunteerism in this community and beyond. working with the Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity to help those who were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Susan moved to Riverdale in 1972 to raise her children. Jason and Lauren. The entire Riverdale community is fortunate that she did. I have known Susan for many years and I absolutely treasure the friendship we have developed over that time. In 2014. the Riverdale Neighborhood House honored Susan at their annual benefit. and they could not have found a more deserving honoree. Congratulations. Susan. on this honor!",

Every day the SSVF program makes a real difference in the lives of real people.

Fortunately. the homeless shelter was a SSVF grantee and was able to assist the veteran obtain employment and his family in securing affordable lowcost housing. There are thousands of similar success stories made possible by the SSVF Program that I could share but all of them share a common theme: they involve veterans who served their country proudly. fell down on their luck. picked themselves back up. and found affordable and sustainable housing for their families because of the assistance and support made possible by the SSVF program.

Mr. Chair. 36 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws that provide legal access to medical marijuana in some form. and over 1 million patients now use medical marijuana to treat conditions ranging from seizures. anxiety. chronic pain. nausea associated with chemotherapy. and posttraumatic stress at the recommendation of their physician. Over 213 million people reside in those jurisdictions. yet. according to Directive 2011004. the Department of Veterans Affairs prohibits its medical providers from completing forms brought by their patients seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veterans participation in a State medical marijuana program. The amendment I am offering ensures that no funds made available to the VA can be used to implement this prohibition. The amendment will not encourage doctors or patients to recommend or use medical marijuana. It would not authorize the possession or use of marijuana at VA facilities. It would simply free up VA providers to have an honest conversation about treatment options and recommend medical marijuana in accordance with State law if they think it is appropriate. It would not force veterans to not work with their primary care provider. I am joined in offering this bipartisan amendment by Congressman HECK from Nevada. Congressman ROHRABACHER. and a series of other Members. some of whom you will hear from. Over 20 percent of the 2.8 million American veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD and depression. They should not be forced outside the VA system to seek a simple recommendation about a treatment that might help them manage these conditions. I will say. while nobody has ever died from a marijuana overdose. we are watching veterans have prescriptions for opiates who suffer from PTSD. for example. more than others. and their suicide rate is high. There is real danger in not being able to provide balanced treatment. Our VA physicians should not be denied their First Amendment right to have an honest conversation about options and offer a recommendation they think could bring relief and wellbeing to a patient.

It simply prohibits VA clinicians from completing forms for their participation in such State programs or for providing or paying for marijuana authorized by a State program. Veterans are able to participate in State programs. They just cannot possess marijuana at VA facilities. Changing the VA directive does not change the DEAs interpretation of Federal law on marijuana.

That is $300.000 that could have been used to care for numerous deserving veterans who have served this Nation in uniform. but instead was spent to move someone 140 miles. At the request of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General is investigating this abuse. and here is what we have learned so far. Under the VAs Appraised Value Offer Program. the VA paid more than $80.000 to one of its government employees and $211.000 to a Federal contractor that was tasked with selling that employees home. At a time when the VA is struggling to meet the medical needs of our veterans. it is unconscionable that the VA would waste $300.000 in taxpayer money to move someone 140 miles. Unfortunately. this is just another disturbing example of the lack of transparency and accountability at the VA. The folks at the VA are already under scrutiny for their shocking failure to properly care for veterans. and now. to spend $300.000 on this is absolutely abusive.

H.R. 308. the Keep the Promise Act. introduced by a bipartisan group of Members from the Arizona delegation. would preserve an Arizona voterapproved gaming compact by prohibiting any Indian casino on land acquired in trust after April 9. 2013. in the Phoenix metropolitan area. This prohibition would expire on January 1. 2027. when the current gaming compact negotiated with the Arizona Governor expires. This bill helps to resolve public promises that were supposedly made in good faith to the voters in Arizona. In 2002. the voters supported the passage of Proposition 202. which limited the number of tribally owned casinos in the State. and it granted tribes exclusive rights to operate casinos in Arizona. During the Proposition 202 campaign. a public promise was made by a coalition of 17 Arizona tribes. including the Tohono Oodham Nation. to limit casino gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Unfortunately. one tribe is on the verge of breaking that commitment and more than a majority of the tribes in the State are upset. The immediate effect of the bill is to block the TO Nation from opening an offoperation casino in the Phoenix area. As I mentioned. the bill has bipartisan support. including a majority of the House delegation. the Governor of Arizona. and six of the tribes that took part in the Proposition 202 agreement. It is important to point out that it is not just Arizona tribes who support this bill. Tribes from other States are very concerned about what is happening in Arizona. They believe a dangerous precedent could be set if this legislation is not signed into law. leading to the expansion of offreservation casinos. Todays deliberations are not about stopping one casino or gaming as a whole. The Keep the Promise Act is about protecting the integrity of the States gaming compact. the future of gaming in Arizona. and. ultimately. the future of Indian gaming in this country.

This legislation not only shortchanges our commitments to our tribal brothers and sisters. but it will do so at exorbitant costs to taxpayers according to the Congressional Budget Office. Construction of the West Valley project has been an immense and welcome addition to communities across Phoenix and beyond. Once fully completed. the project will employ 3.000 people and support their families. jobs we need in our community as we continue to reel as one of the hardest hit areas in the Nation from the Great Recession. Millions of dollars have flowed into the region. More than 45 companies have been retained for the construction of this project both within Arizona and nationally. 1.300 construction workers are currently under contract. and those 1.300 jobs are just the beginning. [ 1515 If you want proof. look no further than the job fair the tribe recently held on September 28. It drew over 3.000 applicants from the community. 400 of whom were hired on the spot. That number will rise to 500 employees when phase one of the project opens in December. and it will eventually climb to 3.000 fulltime employees when the project is completed and staffed. These are new. permanent. goodpaying jobs that are badly needed in the West Valley. This bill will unnecessarily put these hardworking men and women out of work while costing American taxpayers as much as $1 billion. Mr. Speaker. our community supports these jobs and this project. We cannot afford to play politics when it comes to the bottom lines of our families and of our local economies. I urge my colleagues to stand up for local jobs and join me in opposing this jobkilling legislation.",

The DBE program was set up to assist certain classes of small businesses. and this bill does not affect those businesses. number one. Number two. the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act uses existing Small Business Act definitions requiring that businesses be 51 percent owned or controlled by veterans. The certification process and the screening was put in place by the Department of Transportation regulations. a similar process that would apply to veteranowned small businesses.

I would just indicate that this is not a bill that was just recently filed. This was filed and has been pending in the House since 2012. when I first filed the Fairness to Veterans Act. seeking to put our veterans to work as they are coming off the battlefield and coming back into a difficult economy. many of them starting businesses because they are entrepreneurial. because they are hard workers. and because they have those skills that they achieved while defending our Nation with our training. They want to put it back in the economy and help get their countrys economy moving again. Many of them found that. as they were competing for contracts. they were not on a level playing field. I indicated that for 5 years this policy has been pending and there have been too few meetings to try to forward the idea of helping our Nations veterans compete. For 5 years our Federal Government has been measuring the DBE program. On the 10 percent contracting goal that is set forth in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. for 5 years in a row. 25 of the 50 Stateshalf of the Statesnever met their 10 percent goal. So when we hear that we dont want our Nations veterans competing against others within the 10 percent setaside. first of all. half the 10 percent setaside is not being met. Number two. I think we do want competition. I think we do want our Nations veterans competing. It will not only be good for our Nations veterans. it will be good for all enterprises. all businesses. in this country. Competition is what built this country.

There are 250.000 veterans transitioning each year from military to civilian life. and they are looking for their next mission. A quarter of them say they want to start or buy their own business in the future. That is something that we should celebrate. encourage. and support. They join the nearly one in seven veterans who are selfemployed or are smallbusiness owners right now. The impact of veteranowned businesses and entrepreneurs with a veteran background on our economy is impressive. There are currently 3.7 million veteranowned businesses in the United States. accounting for more than $1.6 trillion in receipts and employing 8.2 million people. Of them. there are more than 380.000 veteranowned construction firms. 414.519 veteranowned firms in the professional. scientific. and technical services. and over 10 percent of all manufacturing firms are veteran owned. These are the people that would stand to benefit from this commonsense bill. Unfortunately. the numbers also show that 75 percent of current veteran business owners are over the age of 55.

I met with the gentleman more than once and then wrote an extensive memo on the problems with the bill. You just cant divide veterans the day after Veterans Day. You cant divide this House on the question of veterans. not when we have offered an entire program for veterans. So I dont know what is so sacred about being in this particular program. In fact. the gentleman mentioned that minorities and women were not. in fact. meeting all of their goals. Therefore. some of those goals are left on the table. That is a very important point. Because being a minority or a woman is not enough to qualify you for thisand I dont even want to call it a setaside for this goal is not a setaside. So these minorities and women have to show equivalent skills with others who are competing. It is not an easy thing to do. So it is not a question of whether there are some leftover points to be picked up by veterans. The DBE program has 30 years of history in the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker. even with that history. every time this bill is passed the DBE program is challenged. Each time the Justice Department. under Democratic and Republican Presidents. have defended it as a narrowly tailored program. Recognizing that history and the strict. narrowly tailored standard. the gentleman was offered a way for veterans to. in fact. be recognized in transportation and infrastructure programs. He was offered a way that is probably even better than the program that unites minorities. women. and.

Every day that passes without congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it. help prevent overdoses. and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. Recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible. and many Americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need.

I am very honored to have served on this conference committee for the bill. and I am thankful it is being considered today by the House. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I have seen the opioid epidemics effects on our Nations veterans. Veterans are more vulnerable to chronic pain. more susceptible to addiction. but some VA facilities still overprescribe these powerful drugs. I have seen the problem firsthand with veterans coming into my office. often carrying a large box or bag of pills. In my home State of Indiana. the DEA raided the VA Medical Center in Marion after noticing the volume of narcotics and opioids purchased by the facility. For too long. the VA has relied too heavily on opioids to treat chronic pain. This bill addresses that by requiring the VA and the DOD to focus on improving their prescribing practices. It includes my piece of legislation requiring the VA to report to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. which are important and effective tools for stopping overprescription. It also allows the VA to consider nonopioid treatments for veterans with chronic pain.

I just want to again point out that the effort here is not only bipartisan. but we are also working with the administration to try to address this epidemic. And one of the things that we were trying to do with the legislation. but it became unnecessary because of the Presidents executive action. was with regard to bup. This is a painkiller. if you will. that is used as an alternative to the addictive painkillers that cause the opiate problem. And until recently. under the law. a physician could only have up to 100 patients to whom he was administering bup. but now. in the last week or so. the President announced that that cap has been lifted to 275. Now. in the legislation. we do expand the types of providers who can treat opioid dependence using bup. but. at the same time. it was necessary. I believe. to raise that cap because there is a waiting lista rather extensive waiting listfor people who would like to take advantage of bup. So I just wanted to say that that is one of the most important things that actually was done by the President.

This recent violence serves as a stark reminder that relations between law enforcement and the communities they serve remains extremely tense. and we must do everything we can not to inflame this tension even further. We need to recognize the root cause of this tension and work to end the divisiveness between law enforcement and citizens. I do also want to commend the Dallas Police Department. Dallas Police Chief David Browna constituent and someone I work with very closelyand the Dallas Area Rapid Transit for their brave and swift response to the shooting. These officers are among some of the most capable and professional law enforcement officers in the country. and I commend them for their bravery during this incident. Mr. Speaker. I ask not just for a moment of silence but also for firm action. We need to bring meaningful legislation to the floor that will help bridge the divide between law enforcement and our communities.",

Many of my colleagues. I think. unlike the Senator from Kansas. in some ways fail to recognize that when we put the sanctions in place that brought them to the table. in the meanwhile they were going from 164 centrifuges back in 2003 to 19.000 centrifuges today. What Congress did in a bipartisan way was put four tranches of sanctions in place to begin putting pressure on them to stop and to get them to the table. We have done that. but in each of those cases. we gave the President unilaterally the ability to waive or suspend the sanctions ad infinitumforever. It is something that my friend Senator KAINE from Virginia recognized in our meetings as we had the Secretary come forward and talk to us about the fact that. yes. you are going to have a vote on this. But we all recognized that was 4 to 5 to 6 years down the road after the sanctions regime had been totally alleviated. I just want to thank the Senator for being so articulate in his comments. The fact is that without this legislationwithout this legislation passingCongress will have zero. The President will go straight to the U.N. Security Council with the suspensions in his hands that we have already given them and implement whatever kind of deal he wants to implement. I have had a great conversation with my friend from Virginia today. I think this bill obviously does give Congress. as the Senator from Kansas mentioned. its rightful role. But I think it also gives the President a backstop when he is negotiating so that people will understand that we are going to play that role. So I thank the Senator very. very much for his comments and for the constructive way he is on so many of the big issues we deal with and for his cosponsorship of this very important legislation.

Dr. Newman is excited to get to work and continue to make NASA competitive with other countries studying space exploration. A graduate of C.R.

Time magazine highlighted Dr. Newmans work as one of the best inventions of the year. She developed a new space suit. known as the BioSuit. to increase astronauts agility and movements. allowing astronauts to not only walk but also run and even climb mountains. Her track record of success and nomination to NASA serve as a way to encourage young Montanans to pursue careers in space and engineering. Dr. Newman is an incredibly accomplished Montanan who truly exemplifies our States legacy of public service. Her passion and dedication to NASA is clear. I know she will lead with honor and is prepared for whatever challenges may lie ahead. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of Dr. Newmans nomination. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Senator JON TESTER. my Idaho colleagues Senators RISCH and CRAPO and also my counterpart in the House. Montanas Representative RYAN ZINKE. Current uncertainty in the permitting process threaten sources of clean. renewable power in my State. My bills would allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend a license for nonfederal hydropower development on existing dams in my state of Montana. The first bill would extend for 3 years a contract for hydropower development on the Clark Canyon Dam in Dillon. Montana. The bill would allow for construction and operation of a project that would power about 1.200 homes each year with clean. renewable hydropower. while replacing 18.000 metric tons of carbon each year. The bill would help create 30 to 40 jobs during construction. Further. the project would produce $611.000 in State and Federal taxes over the first 5 years of operation and $37.000 in property tax contributions over the first 5 years. The second bill would provide a 6 year contract extension for nonfederal hydropower development on the Gibson Dam. near August and Choteau Montana. Once completed. the project will provide for decades of stable of tax revenues per year to each Teton and Lewis and Clark Counties. the state of Montana. and the Federal Government. Gibson Hydro project will benefit the environment as they are required by their FERC license to incorporate measures in their operations and construction that would enhance fish and wildlife resources. water quality. recreational and aesthetic resources. Further. the project would replace 40.000 tons of carbon per year and will strengthen the irrigation component of the Gibson Dam by providing a portion of the power sales to Greenfields Irrigation District to support irrigation improvements. operations. water conservation and usage enhancements. This bill will help create 1525 construction jobs. $1 million in local revenue over 2 years. and $45 million in wages during construction phase and over $200.000 per year for the Sun River Cooperative. Hydropower development must be a key component of our Nations alloftheabove strategy to meet our Nations needs.
