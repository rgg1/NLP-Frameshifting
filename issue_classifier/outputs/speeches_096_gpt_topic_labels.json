The opponents of reform have charged that reform would adversely affect smalltown service.

We made specific provisions in the bill to provide and maintain small town service. I am certainly willing to support the Senator in the amendment he has proposed.

The office was created by Secretary Bergland less than 2 years ago under his executive powers. At that time. there were some 14 agencies within the Department of Agriculture that had responsibility for one or another aspect of transportation. Duplication was rife. coordination virtually nonexistent. I heartily commend Secretary Bergland for pulling the transportation functions in those agencies together under one roof. But the fact remains that what Secretary Bergland has pulled together someone else could pull apart. I might add. too. that the Office of Transportation has performed a very fine job in a very short time in trying to fill the void in rural transportation policymaking. Moreover. the Rural Transportation Advisory Task Force. chaired jointly by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Transportation. recently released its final report to Congress. One of the very strong recommendations contained in the final report is the need for an ongoing effort to address and examine the essential needs of rural transportation. I believe very strongly in the need for an Office of Transportation in USDA to do just that. I believe that the problems and needs of rural transportation require the creation of an agency with statutory authority to deal with the Department of Transportation in the setting of national transportation goals. to insure that rural transportation problems are not ignored. I would find it very disconcerting if. in the future. the Office of Transportation were simply allowed to disappear. There simply are few areas of more importance to rural America than transportation. Furthermore. I hasten to point out a fact sometimes overlooked. Persons and enterprises within urban areas are also heavily dependent upon the costs and effectiveness of the rural transportation system. One need only point to the importance of agricultural exports to our Nations balance of payments to illustrate this fact. To underscore this point. I repeat an old adage that states that agriculture is the heart of our Nation and transportation its circulatory system. No longer can we afford. if indeed we ever could. to treat rural transportation problems as peripheral and incidental aspects of our national transportation network.",

I also would be willing to help work out any jurisdictional problems that might arise as to the appropriate setting for hearings. As the Senator knows. since this is in the Department of Agriculture. there may be a question as to whether the Committee on Agriculture has jurisdiction or whether the Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over transportation matters would have jurisdiction over this proposal.

All agricultural commodities. whether processed or not. whether shelled popcorn or unpopped popcorn or unshelled popcorn. would be exempted. The regulated common carrier will not be hurt by the exemption. It will affect less than 4 percent of total interstate truck traffic by revenue. Regulated carriers now handle over 27 percent of all exempt commodities. and they will still be able to do so. The new exemption need not divert traffic from them. It simply makes them compete for it. This provision is supported by the Department of Transportation. the Department of Agriculture. the Interstate Commerce Commission. the National Association of Manufacturers. the National Federation of Independent Businesses. the American Farm Bureau Federation and other farm and consumer groups. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that deregulation of truck transportation could reduce transportation costs by as much as $8 billion. this one step could cut inflation by nearly 1/2 of 1 percent. Regulation of the trucking industry has caused higher prices than necessary by encouraging inefficiency and waste. This amendment would perpetuate that regulation. This mornings Wall Street Journal contains a prediction that food prices will resume their rise by fall and will be up 10 percent by the end of the year. The article goes on to point out that 60 percent of the cost of food is added after the product leaves the farm. and that these cost&-for transportation. processing. and that these costsfor transportation. processing. and distributionare likely to rise by 12.8 percent. Deregulation will put downward pressure on food prices. as previous experience with poultry and frozen fruits and vegetables has demonstrated.

First. 1978 return on equity for the nine motor carrier conferences. and these are the bureaus to which all trucks that are regulated belong. ranges between 17.3 percent and 21.4 percent.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise 1.5380 in support of the Ashbrook amendmentto the Treasury appropriations bill. and I urge that my colleagues in the House also support it. I do not believe that it is the role of the IRS to dictate social policy. yet that is precisely what it is trying to do and what it has tried to do for the past 2 years. In August 1978. the IRS proposed regulations that would have revoked the taxexempt status of many private schools. Using strongarm tactics. the IRS attempted to impose racial enrollment quotas on private schools that were formed or substantially expanded during the period in which their local communities were forcibly integrated. If a school did not meet the quotas proposed by the IRS. its taxexempt status was at stake. Fortunately. these regulations never went into effect because we made it clear that they were contrary to the will of Congress. Last year we adopted the very same amendment to the Treasury appropriations bill that is before us today. The vote was a resounding 297 to 63. Mr. Chairman. I do not believe the issues have changed since last year: The function of the IRS is still to collect taxes. not to set admission quotas for educational institutions. If Congress wants to revoke the tax exempt status of private and religious schools then wenot the IRSwill do so. In short. it is the jurisdiction of Congress rather than the IRS to legislate tax policy. I am not saying that the goals of the IRS are wrong or that truly discriminatory schools should be tax exempt. But I am saying that this is a matter that should be left to the Congress. not the IRS. I am also concerned. Mr. Chairman. because this issue has been dragging on for more than 2 years. We were told during the debate on this amendment last year that the Ways and Means Committee was diligently working to come up with some sound recommendations to resolve this issue. But none have been forthcoming. Mr. Chairman. repeatedly we have been told to wait. But nothing has happened. I believe that we now must put an end to this inaction.",

Representative AsHBROOK made this comment: We are just saying do not go forward with these broad regulations or procedures. whatever you want to call them. until the Congress or a court affirmatively acts on that subject. That is all we are trying to do. Well. the courts have acted affirmatively. On May 5. 1980. the IRS received a new court order in Green against Miller (or Green II) which provides that private schools created or expanded in the wake of public school desegregation must show by clear and convincing evidence of objective acts and declarations that they do not. in fact. discriminate in their enrollments on the basis of race. Mr. Chairman. the court injunction explicitly spells out the standards which IRS is to use in determining whether a school should be denied tax exemptions. The court stated: Such evidence might include. but is not limited to. proof of active and vigorous recruitment programs to secure black students or teachers. including students grants in aid. or proof of continued. meaningful public advertisements stressing the schools open admissions policy. or proof of meaningful communication between the school and black groups and black leaders within the community concerning the schools nondiscrimination policies. and any other similar evidence calculated to show that the doors of the private school and all facilities therein are indeed open to students or teachers of both the black and white races upon the same standard of admission or employment. While these standards. specified by the court. apply only to schools in Mississippi. the IRS should now be allowed to implement them nationwide. The proposed amendment would prevent such a uniform national tax policy. and would force the IRS to apply two different sets of policies: One for Mississippi and one for the rest of the country. Mr. Chairman. the Committee on Appropriations. and specifically. the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury.

I appreciate this opportunity to join with my distinguished colleagues Mr. ALEXANDER and Mr. HEFTEL in introducing the Agricultural Renewable Energy Development and Management Act of 1980. This legislation is designed to enable the Department of Agriculture to assist the Nations farms and rural communities in achieving energy selfsufficiency as quickly and efficiently as possible by creating the position of Assistant Secretary for Renewable Energy Development within USDA. During the past year. I have been actively involved in the area of alcohol fuel production from grains and other renewable resources. As a result of my visits with people involved in this area. and as a natural outgrowth of representing a heavily agricultural district. I have been able to see firsthand how critical it is that the farm sector be equipped to produce its own energy. Perhaps more than any other sector. the agricultural sector is vulnerable to supply interruptions and skyrocketing prices. and it is in the interests of every American that steps be taken so that our food production capabilities are not compromised by our present dangerous dependence on foreign oil. I firmly believe that the legislation we are introducing today will help to bring energy selfsufficiency to our farms and rural communities by giving renewable energy the high profile it deserves within the Department. as well as helping to coordinate the Departments activities in this area. Duplication within the Department and among other agencies could be better avoided with an Assistant Secretary being responsible for overall oversight of the renewable energy program. The agricultural sector is uniquely suited to produce its own energy. The production of alcohol fuel. methane from animal wastes. and the use of windpower and passive and active solar devices are but a few of the renewable energy forms that can be easily integrated into the rural system. Certainly. this country does not have any time to waste in moving ahead with everything it can muster to free the Nation. and especially its most productive sector. from its dependence upon high prices and insecure supplies of fossil fuels.",

At that time. both he and his father. who was then executive director of the Democratic National Congressional Committee. visited the Fourth District of Wisconsin and demonstrated a direct personal interest in the outcome of that congressional contest (which was won. I must confess. by a Republican). Two years later. in 1948. that error was corrected and since then I have had the distinct privilege of working closely with Ken Harding. As Members are aware. Ken has served this House in various capacities: First as assistant to the chairman of the Democratic National Congressional Committee (194654). then as executive director of that committee (195472). and finally as Assistant Sergeant at Arms (195472).

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a former Foreign Service officer and former delegate to the United Nations. it is with real sadness that I read today of the mistaken vote cast by the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. According to the White House explanation issued last night. a mistake in communications occurred in transmittal of instructions from the State Department to our delegation at the U.N. It is difficult not to conclude that the way in which the State Department is being set up as having incorrectly transmitted the Presidents instruction is a red herring designed to cover up the White Houses own confusion. Secretary Vance and Ambassador McHenry are seasoned experts who. in my experience. are not likely to have misunderstood clear Presidential directions. It would appear. therefore. that either the Presidents instructions were imprecise or that the criticism of Senator KENNEDY and others caused retraction of the White House position. Unfortunately the issue at stake is not of slight consequence. Nor was it brought up and considered in a hasty fashion. The issue had been under consideration for weeks at the U.N. and the vote had actually been delayed for several days so the United States could get its act together. The unfortunate vote signals an abrupt change in U.S. policy toward Israel and represents another in a long series of White House diplomatic gaffes. This time. however. the administration abandoned its past corrective practice of announcing \"what the President meant to say was\" and \"what the President meant to do was\" in favor of bucking the blame to the State Department. The denial of personal responsibility is reprehensible and does little to enhance the already widespread perceptions abroad of an inconsistent and too often incoherent American foreign policy. What Ambassador McHenrys unfortunate vote and President Carters flaccid retraction underscores is the need for a Chief Executive who has a depth of experience in foreign policy.

It will not happen. It could happen now. There is no excuse. This is a privileged resolution. We cannot take more than 15 hours of the Senates time. The Senator from New Mexico has seen 5 years of budgeting. and every time we wait we end up approving more money. Any time we put off a resolution. we end up with higher numbers. not lower numbers. The opposition will argue that we do not know the exact facts. and they will ie in. and good. and we will save money if we do not act now. I believe that is absolutely another myth. If we cannot do it now. what we will do in November or February will be worse for the American taxpayers. The deficit will be higher and the day of reckoning. when we come in close to balance and provide a tax cut. will be deferred yet again. or the hoax will be perpetrated on the American people that we do not know enough to bring it about.",

But in a deeper and more significant level. it is the integrity of the budget process and the honor of the Senate. If we slink away. go home without taking up the resolution. what kind of Senate are we? What kind of a body of legislators are we? I believe that the public thinks they have a right to know where we stand on the most important unresolved issue facing this country. the rate of inflation. the rate of taxes. unemployment. and the economic future of this country. That is what is at stake in this. not just some procedural question.

Mr. President. in addition. a vote against the Baker motion almost makes certain a lameduck session. Surely. under the circumstances. a post election. lameduck session. would be a travesty.

We have today a clear chance to give the American people tax relief. And let me make it perfectly clear. Any Member of this Senate who votes against allowing the Senate to consider this tax cut is voting for a tax increase on the American people. Total Federal taxes will go up an estimated $86 billion next year. There will be a tax increase of roughly $600 on the typical American working family. Do not say to me we cannot do it. that we do not have the time. The Senate Finance Committee disproved that. We have reported out nearly unanimously a bill providing tax relief to the American people and provided tax relief .for business. It is important. as practically every member of the Finance Committee said. that we take action now to get this economy moving. I heard the distinguished Senator from South Carolina say that the economy is moving up. The only reason it is moving up is that it is so low it has nowhere else to go. I know of no American or no Delawarean that is satisfied with the economy. with unemployment at the high rate of almost 8 percent and with inflation increasing at doubledigit levels.

It has been said by some that too little time remains in this session to draft a tax bill. Mr. President. a bill has been written. The Senate Finance Committee has been working toward this goal for nearly 2 years. It has been said by others that a restrained and responsible tax cut bill could not be produced in the politicized atmosphere of a Presidential election campaign. Mr. President. the Finance Committee has reported a tax bill to the Senate. and it is a good bill. It contains the essential elements needed to put our economy on a healthy. longterm growth path. The Tax Reduction Act of 1980. H.R. 5829. is not a quickfix attempt to fire up the economic indicators just before election day. It is a carefullylaid plan to arrest the decade of decline in many crucial sectors of American industry. to improve the quality of jobs and job opportunities for American workers. and to boost the competitive position of the United States in the worlds markets. The Finance Committee has consciously and intentionally eliminated any superfluous tax provisions from this bill and. furthermore. has committed itself to resist such amendments on the Senate floor. The interests of all Americans would be served if the Senate would move this afternoon to the consideration of H.R. 5829. American taxpayers. both individuals and businesses. face an astronomic $86 billion increase in their tax bill next year. What we are proposing is to reduce that increase by less than half-$39 billion. The \"tax drag\" on our economy must be cut if we want to benefit from the strength of our free enterprise system. It is important that action begin today. Mr. President. because if it does not. I am afraid we will not see final passage of a tax cut package for 6 to 9 months. Even if such a delayed tax bill were made retroactive effective January 1. 1981. American taxpayers would be unable to make accurate financial plans or project the real costs of making much needed new investments next year. For these compelling reasons.

This would merely amend the provision we adopted as part of the Revenue Act of 1978 which extended this provision to homeowners age 55 and above. I am sure we will all agree that being disabled has many financial burdens that others do not experience in life. In many cases the cost resulting from their disability proves to be over 50 percent of their income.

It is one thing for all of us to acknowledge that the disabled people of this country are denied many basic rights. and also to agree that they have a right to participate in our society to the fullest possible extent: but. it is quite another thing for us to commit ourselves to these principles we espouse.

This is a comprehensive measure with a number of separable provisions. and I introduced it for study purposes so that interested parties can consider its impact on their organizations and their tax relationships. Tax problems in the nonprofit area are frequently complicated. although they often do not involve large amounts of revenue. Due to complexities. uncertainties and ambiguities. and the evolution of increasingly diverse functions. considerable manhours can be invested by both the Internal Revenue Service and the nonprofit groups themselves in assuring compliance with the law. H.R. 990 is designed to try to reduce the problems inherent in nonprofit status and to make the overseeing of such organizations by the IRS more definite and certain so that activities and programs can be planned with confidence. The law must change through redefinition and increasingly precise provision for changing institutions. including those in the nonprofit sector.

Some regulations have caused trouble. such as denying him the services of his anesthetist of 15 years. and other new laws have added much needed medical personnel to rural areas. such as the Rural Health Initiative National Service Corps. The article is a tribute to the dedicated work of a very special person. I offer my personal thanks to Dr. Dean for his service to the people in his South Dakota community. and encourage my colleagues to review his comments on our work. Mr. President.

After he left State service. he became the founder and director of the prairie mountain regional office of the childrens foundation. a Washingtonbased child nutrition advocacy organization.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the December 11. 1978. issue of U.S. News & World Report carries an interesting and thoughtful article exploring and explaining the stability and progressive growth of the Midwest. that stretch of America starting with Ohio and continuing westward to the Dakotas. Nebraska. and Kansas. It is that vast area which produces 86 percent of the corn and 55 percent of the wheat grown in our country. Livestock is grown. fed. and slaughtered in greater abundance here than in any other area of the nation. In addition to agricultural production. much of the regions stability comes from its reliance on small- and mediumsized irdustry. In the last 3 years. 128 new plants have been established in South Dakota alone. Most researchers and students on the subject attribute this solid economic growth to the productivity of American workers and farmersespecially the capability of American families who work the land. Most of the people who reside in the large. the medium sized. and small towns are only one or two generations removed from the early tillers of the soil. The farms themselves are oftentimes worked by third generation farm families. Hard work and selfreliance are the hallmarks of this proud region. There are seldom any great \"booms.\" but on the other hand. there are few \"busts.\" Raven Industries of Sioux Falls. S. Dak.. is cited as an example of the reliable and steady work force found in this area of our land. Its president. David Christensen. says the rural backgrounds of the work force in small towns make them ideal places to build plants. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently Washington has witnessed marches and countermarches concerning the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision on abortion. Since this is considered a landmark decision. and since it has been the source of polarization on both sides of the issue. a polarization that threatens to disrupt families. political parties. churches. and the U.S. Constitution itself. I would like to submit to the RECORD three articles from the Washington Post covering the marches and the issue itself. The first article. \"Abortion Passions Rise on Both Sides.\" appearing in the January 23. 1979. issue of the Washington Post points out the emotional dedication by opponents of the Supreme Court decision. The article also notes the invitation extended by other womens groups. who support the Courts decision. to meet together and discuss the issue. The second article in the same issue of the Washington Post deals with the demonstration directed by religious leaders who object to certain stands taken by opponents of the 1973 decision. A third article by Kathleen Newland entitled \"The Abortion Trend\" which appeared in the Washington Post of January 25. 1979. brings out the international. as well as domestic. side of the controversy and presents the situation for women in restrictive and liberal cultures. Ms. Newlands recommendations regarding abortion as a symptom of other problems and the need to address those problems. is in agreement with what I believe we should be considering in Congress. in the churches. in our families. and as individuals. Because this issue is so important. I would urge my colleagues to review these articles which underscore the complexity of the abortion issue. Mr. President.

Vice Premier Teng Hsiaoping handled the occasion and us with predictable skill. Before nationwide TV he kissed the little children who had sung for him and greeted the assorted entertainers assembled for his and our pleasure. When had we last experienced such euphoria? I can recall the date and the place. It was September 18 in the House Chamber when President Carter. with Begin and Sadat looking on. proclaimed the new spirit of Camp David. What drama. What coverage. What euphoria. A patient fears cancer. and is beside himself with joy when reassured that all is well. A nation fears the worst and is beside itself with joy when told. suddenly and dramatically-\"We interrupt this program\"-there will be a new era of peacein the Middle East. No. forget that one. today it is Asia. The patient. thought sick. is miraculously cured. But wait. was there not something about the treatment? Was there not something unpleasant. something we want to forget? Was there not some pain involved? Perhaps an amputation. Something about Israel being pressuredor Taiwan being cut off. And is the patient really cured. or is the sickness still therein the Middle East? In Asia? In our own Government? Perhaps the patient has not been cured. Perhaps the euphoria is induced by drugs. Jeremiah knew the difference between false and true prophets. False prophets tell the cheering crowds what they want to hearthat their problems are solved. that their deliverance is at hand. that there will be peace. True prophets annoy us by pointing out the defects in ourselves. our land. our world. False prophets have all the fun. They make the electrifying announcements. They win the standing ovations. They speak to the radiant faces at Kennedy Centerin the House Chamber. They wear tuxedos. not sackcloth. It is not fun to hear from Jeremiah. He is not happy like the others. He speaks of purpose and responsibility. of Israel and Taiwan. He calls a people to see their problems and meet their destiny. His message is not euphoric. But tell me. what should be the place of euphoria in the foreign policy of America?",

I know the doctor when he told me in Cedar City just about had to pick me up off the ground. I couldnt believe what I heard. My wife is a strong lady. Her health was good and it was almost disastrous to the whole family. In fact. it was.

Senator. is because one of the hardest decisions I had to make was to let them do an autopsy on my wife. Two weeks later when I was in Salt Lake. the doctor confirmed with me on the autopsy report.

Many times I witnessed the cloud that has been talked about. I often asked why they picked this particular area and the only reason I have got was because of the population. And to meI lost my only son through carcinogenic carcinomaregardless of the population. there is no father that thought any more of a son than I did of him. In 1968. they detected a tumor in his leg which was an osteogenic carcinoma. We ended up with him in Salt Lake. At that time. a week later they had to amputate his leg. It is tough to tell a young man at 15 years old that they are going to have to take his leg off. This went on and we made some 28 trips back for chemotherapy and then it spread to his lungs. One evening I took him to the bathroom and went to help him back and as he got up. his other leg broke. It had another tumor. Like I say. there is no money in the world that would compensate for what he went through to me. My main concern is that we dont let this happen anymore. Anything I could do to stop it so other people dont have to go through what we have gone through and what he has gone through and what all the people here this evening have gone through would be my only concern. Senator. Senator HATCH. We sure appreciate you. Mr. Stones. you and your good wife coming and chatting with us about these problems. These have been a series of stories of tragedy here this evening.

Since that time. our community has increased to about 15.000 or so. 16.000. At this time there isnt enough retarded children to make a classroom unit.

The unprecedented act of violence and cruelty that took place undoubtedly prepared the psychological terrain that made possible the mass murder of people whose crime was to belong to ethnic. national or religious affiliations deemed undesirable or \"inferior.\" It is therefore fitting that we link in a common remembrance the victims of the Armenian tragedy and those of the holocaust of World War II. Both stand as infamous monuments to human barbarism. It was as if. in the words of the philosopher Martin Buber. \"God had hidden his face\" from the world and permitted the unthinkable to take place. The horrors that were perpetrated during the Armenian episode as well as during the Nazi regime must serve as a reminder to the free world of its responsibility to insure that such a scourge is never repeated. Millions of men. women and children were murdered. The uniqueness of each human life makes our loss irreversible. We will never know how many writers. thinkers. scientists. and musicians might have enriched the universe with their ideas. their discoveries. and their talents. Has the world learned from the tragic experiences of the past? The recent holocaust in Cambodia. the killing of Christians in Lebanon. that of Arab and Jews in the Middle East. are but a partial answer to this question. Yet. a lesson has been reaped. The World has demonstrated a greater willingness to assume responsibility over collective tragedies. Efforts are being undertaken by nations to try and devise peaceful solutions to conflicts. and ways to bring better understanding in the community of men. But the road is arduous. and the history of mankind has proven that we are engaged in a constant struggle between the forces of darkness and those of enlightenment. It is therefore essential that we use occasions such as this to pledge our continuing efforts to try and achieve the establishment of a world where tolerance and understanding replace bigotry and hatred. a world where freedom replaces slavery.*",

I congratulate the conferees on this breakthrough. Creation of the Energy Mobilization Board is one of the three pillars on which our national drive to achieve energy security rests. This legislation will allow the construction of priority energy projects. such as refineries. pipelines. synfuels plants and coalburning powerplants. to be expedited. It is critical that we begin to untangle the regulatory maze if we are to make better use of our own plentiful energy resources. This legislation presented highly complex and controversial legal issues. In particular. the difference between the Senate and the House on whether or not to waive substantive provisions of Federal law was most difficult to resolve. Each position had merit and the balance between this Nations energy needs and environmental protection had to be carefully measured. The conferees have agreed on a bill which will give the Energy Mobilization Board broad powers to speed key\" energy projects. while retaining. under most circumstances. environmental safeguards. This is the type of compromise which is in the best interests of our Nations future. It is my understanding that the conference report will be completed within a short period of time. allowing this measure to come before the Senate for final approval within the next few days. I hope my colleagues will act expeditiously on this matter. They will take a great step toward energy security by final passage of this legislation.",

April 24. 1980. the day which marks the 65th anniversary of mans inhumanity to man. it was on this date that the genocide of the Armenian people was promulgated and begun by the Ottoman Turkish Empire. A mass program in which nearly 2 million old men. women. and children were massacred. it was the first and cruelest genocide of the 20th century. Unnoticed and uncondemned by the world. the Ottoman success in attempting to wipe out the Armenian people from the Turkish Empire was a terrible precedent that gave a future demented leader. Adolph Hitler. the courage to orchestrate the Nazi holocaust of 6 million Jews and the murders of millions of other nonAryan ethnic minorities. Numerous Armenians. tough and resilient. who survived the genocide came to this country. The pain of the memories of 1915 have hardly diminished over the years. I represent the largest ArmenianAmerican community in the United States. and I am well acquainted with the sufferings. the anguish and the atrocities that were committed against the grandparents and parents of my constituents.

The burden of this new fee on consumers. particularly in the Northeast. will be extremely heavy. The price of gasoline has already doubled since 1977. a mere 3 years. The oil import fee will lift the skyrocketing price of gasoline another 10 cents per gallon. at a cost to consumers of at least $11 billion annually. The threat posed by the import fee does not stop with gasoline prices. More disturbingly. recent reports suggest that it may not be possible for the administration to insure that the impact of the import fee is restricted to gasoline. The prospect that this fee will trigger higher home heating costs. at the very time when we are spending millions of dollars for emergency fuel assistance to needy homeowners. is both tragic and absurd. Mr. Speaker. higher prices are not the answerthey will only penalize American commuters and homeowners who are already trying so hard to conserve energy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since the passage of title IX of the Civil Rights Act our Nation has sought to equalize womens opportunity in all federally funded educational activities. One area that has received considerable attention is womens athletics. The Department of Health. Education. and Welfare recently published regulations to assist schools in complying with the requirements of title IX. While many institutions have not placed equal emphasis on womens athletics. the institutions and school districts which have established quality programs should be commended. In this regard. I am proud to bring to the attention of my colleagues the accomplishments of my alma mater. St. Paul Johnson High School. It is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulation to the 1979 Minnesota AA wom. ens volleyball champions. the St. Pau Johnson Governors. The St. Paul school district has a longstanding commitment to equality in al athletio programs. This volleyball tearr follows the distinguished tradition ol many Johnson championship teams. Th Governors compiled a 21 and 2 record for the season. The competitive nature o1 St. Pauls womens athletic programs is demonstrated by the fact that their only loses came at the hands of other St. Pau] area teams. The strength of the conference is further Illustrated by the Governors victory in the traditional St. Paul/ Minneapolis metro championship game against Minneapolis South West High School. Head Coach Marcia Hulstrand attributes this years success to teamwork rather than the efforts of a few individual stars. This is especially significant in a sport that places an emphasis on height. The Governors tallest player was only 5 feet 9 inches and the team averaged less than 5 feet 7 inches. This years champion was the shortest team in the State tournament. Congratulations are in order for all members of the 500 Minnesota teams that participated in this years interscholastic womens volleyball competition. Special recognition should be given to the coaching staff and the players of the Johnson High School State champions. Coaching staff: Marcia Hulstrand. head coach. Mary Hoisser. assistant coach. and Chris McLay. assistant coach. Players: Capt. Lucia Wrobleski. senior. allState selection. Julie Blossey. junior. allState selection. Lisa Spannbauer. junior.

This report has grown out of a 14month effort by the Commission to define the problem of world hunger and malnutrition. to identify the problems root causes. and to develop recommendations to significantly reduce hunger and malnutrition. This 20member panel. created by the President at the urging of Congress. is also charged with helping to implement its recommendations and focus public attention on the extent and nature of hunger and malnutrition. The Commission will soon be launching a public outreach program designed to solicit comment on this report. and I am hopeful that a heightened level of concern can begin to move our Nation toward the type of concerted international effort needed to eliminate the worst aspects of hunger and malnutrition by the end of this century. While my colleagues have been provided with a copy of the preliminary report. I would like to share with them a brief summary of the report outlining: why the United States should be concerned about world hunger. the nature and extent of world hunger today. the causes of hunger. prospects for overcoming world hunger: the challenge ahead. and the Commissions initial conclusions and preliminary recommendations.

Perhaps all that says is that \"where there is smoke. there is fire.\" The smoke and fire have been apparent on the FTC issue for several years now. evidenced by the fact that the Agency has been operating without authorizing legislation. and evidenced even more by the intense lobbying pressures which have surrounded the issue and each of the various subissues incorporated in S. 1991 and the amendments under consideration here in the Senate over the past few days.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Federal Trade Commission authorization bill had become the focus of an intense campaign to curtail Government regulation and place a rein upon the power of independent regulatory agencies. Congressmen have been beseiged by industry representatives seeking to exempt certain businesses from FTC scrutiny. In many instances. the purpose of the FTCto encourage competition and deter business misrepresentationbecame lost in a barrage of charges and countercharges over the propriety of agency action. In particular. small businessmen expressed genuine concern over the tangled web of Federal regulation which cuts into profits and inhibits economic growth. Some mechanism was sought to bring the agency under congressional review without detracting from the FTCs charter to investigate and prohibit business abuse. Overregulation. with its mountains of meaningless paperwork that adds unnecessary burdens and costs to small businesses. needed to be brought under control while leaving intact the integrity of one of our most important independent consumer agencies. The legislative review procedure which is incorporated in the FTC authorization bill now before us is a real step in the right direction. Legislative review provides the proper mechanism for congressional oversight of the agencys actions while allowing the FTC the discretion to pursue those rulemaking proceedings which are deemed to be in the public interest. This is the proper balance if the agency is to carry out its mandate as both a consumer advocate and business regulator. I want to commend the outstanding efforts of the distinguished chairman of the Consumer Subcommittee . who managed this bill. This was not an easy task and it was carried out in the midst of an intense campaign to subject the FTC to stringent and inappropriate constraints. Senator FORD guided this debate over the course of several months with the greatest integrity and wisdom and he is to be congratulated.

Surely nobody can oppose the convention on philosophical grounds. As despicable as it is. the murder of an individual cannot compare with genocide. Genocide is the most heinous crime because it is committed with the intent to destroy a national. ethnical. racial. or religious group. A person who commits genocide has decided that an entire group does not have the right to survive. His contempt and intolerance transcends hate for separate individuals to encompass an entire group. Such blind prejudice is despicable. but when an individual decides to act according to that prejudice. he violates every value we hold true. No single murder can compare morally with the coldblooded attempt to eradicate an entire group. We have no trouble condemning murder. an individual is entitled to life. But on this more serious issue. the right to life of an entire group. we are curiously silent. I call on my colleagues to consider the philosophical implications of continued inaction.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing a bill. which I also introduced in the last Congress. to provide for a Federal tax deduction for tenants for that part of their rental payment which is in fact a payment of local property taxes. Under present law. landlords pay State and local property taxes. They are in turn entitled to deduct such payments in the computation of their Federal income tax liability. Landlords generally pass their property tax liability on to tenants in the form of rent. However. inasmuch as tenants are not legally liable for payment of property taxes under State and local law. they are not eligible to deduct this portion of their rent for Federal income tax purposes. In other words. while tenants indirectly pay State and local property taxes. they are not entitled to a commensurate deduction in computing their Federal income taxes. This present situation is unfair to the increasing number of American taxpayers who rent rather than own their homes. It has the effect of imposing double taxation on that part of a tenants income which is spent for rent. Landlords. on the other hand. are permitted to avoid such a result by deducting local property taxes in determining their Federal tax liability. The present situation has a regressive tax impact in that most of those who are caught in this doubletaxation trap are in lower income brackets. Over onehalf of all taxpayers earning less than $5.000 per year now rent their dwellings while only 13 percent of those earning more than $25.000 do so. The tax liability of the landlord would remain unchanged under the bill. The bill would simply insure that the tenant. like the landlord. will not be taxed on income which has already been used to pay taxes. Mr. President. in some State legislatures there are efforts to transfer the State or local property tax from the landlord to the tenant. If this happens. the States will by their own initiative have shifted the property tax and the property tax deduction to the tenant. However. because it is impossible to predict what State legislatures may do and because many renters are suffering unfairly from the present tax structure. I think it is important for Congress to take action. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill I am introducing be printed in the RECORD.",

Teachers across the country are beginning to realize the importance of this event and are seeing to it that the pupils understand what transpired. I commend these individuals who are making a point of teaching about the holocaust. The details. while horrible. can only add to the understanding of the mass slaughter. I only wish that more educators would see fit to find a place in the curriculum for this historic event. But why. you may ask. should we want to continually remind ourselves of the details? The importance of the holocaust as an historic event lies not in the specifics of the crime. but in what we can learn so as to prevent such an event from happening again. It is said that history repeats itself. In this case I certainly hope it does not. Mr. President. we must keep the memory of the holocaust alive. Only then will the need for treaties to prohibit crimes like these be evident. Mr. President. the Genocide Convention of 1949 does just that.

Not only did parent locator benefit 1 million families in 1978 alone. but it saved Federal and State governments almost $500 million in welfare costs. In 1978. it also saved families who were above the poverty line $578 million. The billiondollar phls savings to the Government and families compares to administrative costs of $320 million. an excellent costbenefit ratio. I would commend HEW for its aggressive efforts to reduce needless welfare costs. I particularly wish to recognize Senator RUSSELL LONG. who had the foresight to push for this programs creation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I report from the Banking. Housing and Urban Affairs Committee a bill titled the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act . This landmark legislation will phaseout interest rate controls (regulation Q) over a 10year period while giving thrift institutions the powers they need to compete in a market for deposits without Government controls. Government controls of deposit interest rates are counterproductive. regulation Q. enacted as temporary authority in 1966 and extended 11 times. mandates discriminatory and low rates on savings deposits. Because of these low rates individuals are discouraged from saving and encouraged to borrow. This policy of encouraging consumption and discouraging saving is inflationary and wrong at a time when we should encourage savings and capital formation. At the same time. regulation Q particularly hits the small saver the hardest. No wonder the United States has the lowest savings of the western democracies and an unacceptable productivity growth rate. It is clear that regulation Q must be phased out. This legislation does it in a time frame which will enable thrifts to maintain their viability and commitment to housing. Thrifts are given checking account authority as are credit unions. These accounts. called NOW accounts and share drafts. will also enable consumers to earn interest on their checking accounts. Commercial banks too may offer NOW accounts under the bill. Along with checking accounts. thrifts will be authorized to offer consumer loans and trust services. Thrifts are therefore given the powers they need to fully serve all of the needs of household depositors and borrowers and to compete in the market. This legislation also preempts State home mortgage lending limits which are responsible for mortgage money drying up in many areas of the country. Mr. President. this legislation culminates a long effort by the Banking Committee to update our financial institutions. The ranking minority member of the committee (Senator GARN) and the chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee (Senator CRANSTON) are particularly to be commended for their cooperation in bringing this legislation to the Senate. This legislation does the job that needs to be done now and I commend it to my colleagues in the Senate.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the last 2 weeks have been a disturbing lesson in American Government for many citizens. While Congress debated and delayed the continuing resolution funding the Department of Defense and several large Federal agencies. millions of Federal employees and members of our armed services faced the threat of no pay. This neardisasterfinally averted by a compromise on the billcannot be allowed to occur again. Military and Federal payrolls should not be used as hostages for other. unrelated issues. Today I am introducing the Federal Employee Paycheck Protection Act to insulate Federal paychecks from the kind of legislative controversies which have. for 3 years running. left some Government and military employees in the dark as to when their next payday would be. This legislation. similar to that introduced earlier this year by Senator MATHIAS. would separate the appropriation for a Federal agencys operation and programs from the appropriation for its employees salaries. As a result. congressional disagreement over an agencys operations or policies could delay only the agencys operating budgetnot its payroll. The need for this kind of legislation should be clear to everyone after this week. Had the Congress not agreed on a compromise last week. 1.6 million military personnel and thousands of Federal employees would not have been paid on time. Although Federal workers would have received paychecks for half of the most recent pay period. this is still a severe hardship for middle- and lowincome wage earners. Landlords must be paid on time. grocery bills mount up. and money for other necessities becomes scarce. Delay and disruption also cost the Government money. Last year. when over 145.000 employees of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare received two halfsize paychecks instead of the one they normally receive because of this same problem. it cost the Government an extra $70.000 to run the payroll twice. Congressional disagreements over some aspect of an agencys operations. which delay or prevent enactment of an agencys operating budget. should not affect noncontroversial salary appropriations. If this bill is enacted promptly. congressional stalemates over appropriations bills will have caused unnecessary hardship for the last time.O By Mr. DECONCINI:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing a bill designed to provide relief to the Jefferson County Mental Health Center in connection with certain social security tax payments. The Jefferson County Mental Health Center. located in Colorado. is a nonprofit organization which is exempt from employee participation in the social security program. However. employees at the center elected to parti:ipate in the program and in 1963 proper forms were filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Subsequently. FICA taxes were withheld to effect such participation. In 1975. the Jefferson County Mental Health Center. in response to a survey initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. was unable to find any indication that it had waived its immunity from social security taxes. As a result. the IRS directed the center to refund those taxes for the prior 3 years to any employee who did not elect to have his/her social security coverage continued. The Jefferson County Mental Health Center then reimbursed a total of $74.128 to 133 employees. and applied to IRS to have the amount of those taxes repaid to it. Shortly thereafter. the IRS discovered that a valid waiver of immunity had. in fact. been filed. Even with this evidence. the center was unable to receive the reimbursed taxes since the IRS does not have the authority to expend funds without a legal obligation or statutory authorization. Mr. President. the center is seeking relief solely for the employee share of the social security taxes involved and only for the period prior to time the IRS notified the center of its error. This legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the amounts withheld and treat those amounts as tax overpayments. reimbursable to the center. The measure also allows the employees the option of repaying their social security over a period of time if they wish to be covered for the period during which FICA taxes were originally withheld. During the 95th Congress. the Senate passed this legislation as an amendment to an authorization bill. Unfortunately. that authorization bill was not acted on before Congress adjourned. Relief to the Jefferson County Mental Health Center is most certainly appropriate. and I look forward to the Senate Finance Committee and the full Senate acting expeditiously on this necessary measure.*",

For example. the gentleman from Iowa comes from an agricultural producing State. a very good agricultural producing State. And as you know. this country exports onethird of its agricultural produce. something which is absolutely vital to our economic wellbeing. Approximately 50 percent of our agricultural exports go to the Third World. and the greatest opportunity for expanding those exports from States like Iowa reside in the Third World. So. I suggest that in Iowa. as in New York. that we make some arguments related to our own economic interest as well as our humanitarian concerns. We also have imports from the developing countries. including many in Africa. For example. we import 50 percent of our tin and manganese from the Third World. a clear connection to our economic selfinterest. So. Mr. Chairman.

I simply want to. as the gentleman from Maryland suggested. try to put this in perspective. The gentleman from Maryland has indicated that in the period in which the gentleman discussed the past 30 years we have spent $215 billion in foreign assistance. I think the gentleman ought to understand that is approximately the amount we spend on defense in 11/ years. When we are trying to defend the interest of this country. are we sensible in concluding that the only effective measures by which we defend the country are military measures. or are there other measures which also give us additional political and economic influence around the world? I think we know what the answer is. Also. I want to make the point that out of that $215 billion in that time period. a total of $6.3 billionI will repeat that. $6.3 billion of the $215 billion has gone to Africa. That is a very small amount. That is less. incidentally. than we have given the Republic of China (Taiwan) in that time. which is $6.5 billion. It is less than we gave France. It is less than half of what we gave Israel. It is less than half of what we have given Korea and less than onefifth what we gave Vietnam. So I agree with the gentleman from Maryland. we ought to put these things in perspective.",

To try to help them improve their capability to administer their funds. Now. until such time as they create that capability. then I am afraid they cannot even effectively handle the $25 million.

Basically. it was because of the concern which he instilled in me probably 10 or 15 years ago. and which we were previously discussing in relation to the StevensonSchmitt amendment that led the supporters of S. 414 to limit its coverage to small businesses. universities. and nonprofit organizations. To address the concerns which the Senator from Indiana shares with the Senator from Louisiana. that we provided a recoupment provision in S. 414 so that whomever gets the patent. even if it is the Red Cross or Louisiana State University or Purdue University. whoever might get it. they have to repay the cost of that research if they begin to make substantial profits from the discovery.

Would not striking this section take the very heart out of the kind of program we conceived of there? This section aims funds at the targeted areas with the highest unemployment. Those are the areas. such as East St. Louis. the city of Chicago. and Williamson County in Illinois. which need the help the most.",

    "speech": "I completely agree with the Senator from Illinois. I think that if we believe that. at least under some circumstances. the Federal Government should provide assistance to local government. this particular form of targeted assistance is the most rational helo the Federal Government can provide. Why? Because it does not just spray the money all across the countryside. It puts the money in those communities which have their own tax bases eroded. When unemployment occurs. it is not only a tragedy for the individuals involved. it has an effect on the local community. It puts a greater drain on the local community in providing services for people in need. which the local communities do. and it also tends to erode the tax base. Therefore. if the Federal Government. under any circumstances. is going to provide aid to any local community. it would seem to me that it would want to concentrate its attention on those communities which are having a hard time keeping up with their governmental services. Second. it would seem to me that if the Federal Government is to provide help to local communities. it should do so in the way of distributions of cash. Why not let those communities in times of distress make their own decisions as to where their needs are. rather than to have somebody in Washington say. \"Well. we know youre hurting. but we onlv want to provide relief from your pain in this little area or that little area.\" So I think from the whole standpoint of the operation of the Federal system. it makes sense. I do believe that this amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma really goes at the whole concept. destroys the whole concept of what this bill is about.",

Those communities are specifically small. under 25.000. with perhaps one industry. an industry which goes bankrupt. goes out of business. and creates severe hardship in that community that leads to unemployment of 6.5 percent.

Now the White House has just revised. according to an internal memo. its own predictions of the unemployment rate. In 3 weeks from July 12 to August 2 the White House revised its expectations on the unemployment rate from 6.9 percent at the end of 1980 to 8.2 percent at the end of 1980. 8.2 percent. which is their current expectation. would be the worst recession the country has had since the Derression of the thirties with the exception of the recession of 197475. In that recession. as I noted earlier. within 9 months we went from an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent. which is better than what we have at the momentthe July rate just announced is 5.7 percent. And in 9 months we were at 9.1 percent. to an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent in 9 months. the worst unemployment figure since the Depression of the 1930s.

    "speech": "Mr. President. obviously. any time a percentage trigger is set for a program there is room for debate as to precisely what that figure should be. Last year we had just such a debate on the floor of the Senate. At that time the bill that had been reported from the Committee on Finance had an unemployment trigger of only 41/2 percent. The argument was made that 41/2 percent really does not constitute fiscal distress under most economists definitions of what local fiscal distress is. Therefore. it was worked out at that time in the bill that was on the floor that we would move it up to a 6 percent trigger. and again in the Committee on Finance this year when we went through exactly the same drill we discussed the same question and again set it at 6 percent. The effect of moving it from 41/2 percent to 6 percent. and putting a de minimis rule in was that instead of funneling a limited amount of funds or spraying a limited amount of funds out to 18.000 communities. as was true with the committee bill a year ago. we have in this bill reduced it from 18.000 to 2.100 communities. The Senator from Oklahoma says. \"Well. 6 percent is too low. We should move to 7 percent.\" I do not know how many communities would be covered by 7 percent. but my guess is it would very substantially reduce the constituency for this bill and. perhaps. turn it into a very regionalized approach to targeted revenue sharing. The second thing I would say about the Senator from Oklahomas amendment is that. to say the least. it is a complicated kind of formula. It lacks the kind of clarity and ease of explanation that I think the bill in its present form has. As I understand the Senator from Oklahomas position. if a community has 4percent unemployment consistently over a period of years. and suddenly moves up to 6percent unemployment it is for some reason covered by targeted revenue sharing. However. a community with 6/2percent unemployment consistently which continues to have 6 percent unemulovment is not covered. If I understand that correctly.

I would like to point to. perhaps. a serles of events we do not normally think of when we think of countercyclical assistance stopping or lessening the impact of a recession. During our hearing process we have testimony from Mr. James Howell. who is a senior vice president of the First Boston Corporation. who has done a very extensive survey on municipal finances. and he revealed that in 1975 at the height of the recession between April and October that 106 municipalities in this country withdrew from the municipal bond market because of the recession. The startling thing was that these communities were not only in the Northeast but they were also evenly distributed through the South. Midwest. the Southwest. the West. and High Plains. So it is. perhaps. impossible to conclude that x amount of dollars will prevent a recession if it is administered in a countercyclical fashion. But I think it is sufficient to say that in many communities. some we think are not distressed. that they could use this money effectively so that their fiscal condition would allow them at least to go into a municipal bond market to obtain money they need for essential capital improvements.",

I really do not think we are moving in the right direction unless we support the gentleman from Michigan . Let me point out that the very difficulty of this lies in the understanding of what transpires in the Foreign Service. In an individual divorce case. under all circumstances. courts will take into account the individual financial factors. the decision as to who was or was not at fault. the contribution or lack of a contribution of an individual. the individual financial position of one or the other parties. That is what the divorce court is for. I am not aware that Foreign Service personnel are in any way shortchanged in the courts. So the whole thrust of this amendment. as I see it. is to see to it that the decision as to how to divide the annuity properly be left to the court at the time of divorce settlement.

It allows the laws of particular States to legitimately prevail. The only possible concern that someone should have is that somehow. by the very virtue of being in the Foreign Service. a divorce proceeding involving a Foreign Service officer somehow would not have the legitimate attention of divorce authorities in any State. That is not so. We have to assume. and I think properly so. especially in the case of negotiated settlements. that the legal rights of everyone are going to be fully protected.

    "speech": "Well. I would like to point out. and I realize that bad examples make bad law. To recap. Mr. Chairman. this amendment authorizes the courts to divide the retirement and survivor benefits of a member of the Service to provide an annuity for a former spouse as part of an alimony or property settlement. Divorce in the United States has always been a matter for State legislatures and the courts. For civil servants. the Congress limited itself to obligating the Office of Personnel Management to pay annuities to former spouses under State divorce decrees on a casebycase basis. Under this amendment we are extending this requirement of law to the Department of State and the Foreign Service. Perhaps the most emotional and misunderstood controversy in the Foreign Service Act. concerns annuities for former spouses of Foreign Service personnel. The Ford amendment. -adopted by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. logically and compassionately allows the divorce courts in each State to divide both retirement and survivor annuities in order to create separate annuities for former spouses in those cases where they are justified. Neither the Ford nor the Schroeder language is going to make divorce less expensive or traumatic. The issue is whether we will defer to the State courts which examine these important matters on a casebycase basis. or whether we plunge into legislating a national divorce law which blissfully ignores such crucial divorce factors as the independent wealth. desertion. or previous settlement advantages of the spouses. For this reason. the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). the only major Foreign Service union. rejects the Schroeder amendment and supports the Ford approach. Military personnel are also alarmed at the Schroeder amendments precedent of partitioning annuities without regard to the circumstances of each case. The Ford amendment lets the equities of each case dictate the existence and amount of any annuities. and I feel it is the only practical solution to a difficult issue.",

In the social security law. the amendment originally was put in by the same gentlewoman who passed the ERA in this House. the gentlewoman from Michigan. Martha Griffiths. We from Michigan are very proud of her contribution in this regard. That provided that a woman who was unable to acquire a vested right in social security benefits because of years of taking care of children while the husband was out working would be able to draw as if she had been working during those years. but here is a distinct difference. In the case of a woman who is divorced from her husband after 10 or 15 or 20 years and then collects social security. if there is a second family and children in the second family. they also araw social security. Under the gentlewomans amendment. the Foreign Service officer would have half of his money go to him and his present family and half go to his former spouse. regardless of the circumstances that destroyed that marriage. regardless of fault. regardless of how many years they have been separated and what the equities might be. That does not happen with social security. I suggest to the gentleman from Alabama. There is no problem. because both the former spouse and the present spouse have equal rights and both of them get a full social security benefit. The taxpayers paid for that treatment. but in this case you are taking away from the annuitant a part of his annuity and giving it to somebody as a property right.

First of all. let me respond as to why I believe equity would demand some consideration for the Foreign Service spouse. As too ofRen has been the case. the wife has accompanied her husband on a tour overseas. giving up opportunities for a career of her own. Frequent transfers to posts around the world mitigate against the establishment of careers or the opportunity to develop marketable skills. At the same time. this wife is expected to do things like planning and hosting social functions. attending various official functions and other duties that might interfere with an independent career. A survey within the Department of State. I would point out to the gentleman. indicated that the wife of an Ambassador or Charge often devotes an estimated 167 hours per month. or more than a 40hour week to official functions. for which she receives no compensation. As the law now stands. this spouse can provide all of these functions for years and then. upon divorce. be left with nothing. Up until 1972. the wives. although not the husbands of Foreign Service officers. were considered in the efficiency reports of those officers as a part of how they were rated in their own careers. I would say that equity says these spouses should be covered and there should be a presumption that after 10 years they would begin to be vested with pension rights of their own. I would point out that we in no way interfere with the divorce process or the actions of the courts. Indeed. the language which is stricken by the Post Office Committee language states. and I quote. in section 814(A) (1) : Unless otherwise expressly provided by any court order under section 820(B) (1) a former spouse or participant is entitled to an annuity.

The creation of OFPP showed the Congress recognition that effective management of the procurement process requires a high degree of direction and control of basic policy. Except in isolated instances. executive agencies had never been able to achieve that central direction on a voluntary basis. In a system which accounts for close to $90 billion of expenditures each year. this vacuum in central policy direction and leadership inevitably lead to inconsistencies. inefficiency. and waste. OFPPs creation underscored the importance Congress attached to the efficient spending of these funds. OFPP was charged with providing overall executive branch guidance and direction of Federal procurement policy. It was located in the Executive Office of the President to put it on a level above the procuring agencies and to enhance its stature and effectiveness. It was specifically placed in the Office of Management and Budget to assure that procurement policy could be integrated into the other management and program review activities OMB is supposed to carry out. These basic features. coupled with the specific responsibilities set out in Public Law 93440. provide an expression of what OFPP should be: A small group of experts placed at a high level in the executive branch. charged with leadership in basic procurement policies.",

Both Sadat and Begin desperately needed American military strength. American economic assistance. and American political commitment. Only by leaning on Washington for necessary support could they gamble to end three decades of bloodshed on terms acceptable to the main parties. Israel exists on the thin margin of survival.

He responded. \"I have learned a whole lot since we last met. too.\" He said that he had given considerable time and serious thought to public broadcasting. has read numerous reports on the subject and studied in depth letters from Henry Loomis. He said that he thinks the difference between his viewpoint and yours are a lot narrower than he once thought. He called you a successful commentator in the area of checks and balances. He said there may be some differences in the philosophical approach concerning some kinds of programming but he knows a lot more. for example. what a CSG is.

I think ours was a good conversation that revealed an information maturation. that we should welcome. I am having lunch at the White House with Jagoda on August 16. and I suspect we will hear more. Two footnotes: 1. When Jagoda said he heard about Elsons involvement in NPR programming he said he got incensed and spoke to Elson about such situations which are more serious for what they appear to be as opposed to what they actually are. 2.

My colleague from Vermont (Senator STAFFORD). has introduced legislation which I am proud to cosponsor. His bill. S. 460. would assure safe bicycle parking facilities at Federal buildings across the Nation. As the weather turns warm again. we are reminded that the bicycle is not just a form of exercise. Thousands of people each day use the bicycle as a serious transportation source. We must encourage this use. It is estimated that every mile biked \"earns\" about 17 cents. For every mile pedaled. no automobile fumes are generated and precious gasoline is conserved. The air remains clean and we are healthier for It. The benefits of bicycling. then. redound to all of us. even If we do not ourselves ride. I feel very strongly that the Federal Government needs to take the lead in promoting energy conservation and developing innovative solutions to energy shortages.

Adolph Dubs. was murdered there. The present regime in Afghanistan has shown little or no regret over its obvious mishandling of his attempted rescue. and our own administrations response has been inadequate to express the depth of our concern over this event. Mr. President. it will be said that we ought to do no more than express our displeasure with such an event. It will be said that we must continue various forms of foreign assistance to the current regime in Afghanistan in order to maintain some \"leverage\" over it. But I would submit that the kidnaping. botched rescue and murder of our Ambassador demonstrates that we have very little leverage there at present. Without a vigorous response now. we are unlikely to be able to purchase more in the near future. Ambassadors are not political pawns whose lives are expendable. Ambassadors are representatives of their countries and of the timehonored traditions of international discourse. There is simply no reason whatever to continue to fund a regime which does not subscribe to even the most minimal rules and practices of international relations. Mr. President. Senator PELL has proposed a series of very reasonable and moderate responses to the Afghan regime. He has introduced a resolution for the Senate to withhold its advice and consent on a new Ambassador to Afghanistan until responsibility for Mr. Dubs murder is assumed. apologies offered. and adequate protection in the future guaranteed. Beyond this. Senator PELL has urged an end to all economic aid. military aid. and military sales until these conditions are met. Senator PELLs proposals do not represent vindictiveness or national assertiveness they represent our insistence upon what ought to be a matter of course in foreign relations. These are reasonable proposals.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the recent action recommended by the Amtrak Board of Directors and carried out by the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee with regard to the San Francisco Zephyr was a positive step forward in clamping down on the already escalating energy crisis. I would like to express my support of the recently passed authorization bill to extend the appropriations for Amtrak for an additional 3 years. Included in this authorization bill was $20 million to provide for the continuation of five major trains. including the Zephyr. which services five communities in Nebraska. Omaha. Lincoln. Hastings. Holdrege. and McCook. Maintaining these routes is one of the bright spots in an otherwise disastrous restructuring of the Nations passenger rail service by the Department of Transportation. It is my belief that we have grossly overlooked the fact that Amtrak can become one of the best energy conservation measures we now have at our disposal. To eliminate much of this system will only increase our dependence on automobiles. thus hindering our efforts to conserve energy. The good people of Nebraska and the Midwest are increasingly showing their support for Amtrak. and it is attracting many crosscountry riders. In fact. the number of passengers riding the Zephyr rose from an April 1978. figure of 142.384 to 157.469 in April 1979. an increase of 10.6 percent. This figure does not even reflect the tremendous recent surge in passengers brought about by the scarcity of gasoline in some areas and the increase in summertime tourist travel. During the month of May 1979. according to Amtrak. 6.8 million calls were attempted in trying to make reservations nationwide. Of those calls attempted. 440.000 callers received a reservation and 756.000 were turned away. These figures also constituted an overall increase in revenue by 28 percent. and the increase for June is even larger.",

As Senators remember. yesterday we voted on two of my amendments that were attempting to do this very thing. One amendment put a real cap on the kind of acreage that would qualify for this subsidized waterand I think a realistic cap at that. 1.280 acresby eliminating the loophole that provided for unlimited leasing. The second of my amendments to keep this bill truly equitable was one that was justified in the matter of making land available for sustaining the small farm and for those not now in farming but who would like to get into farming. It plugged the loophole on the accelerated payout of water districts in order to escape the limitation of acreage we established.",

It has not been an effective limitation for the past 50 years. It was circumvented by the leasing of additional land. and this bill would prevent any form of leasing. any form of circumvention above the cap that is now established. a maximum of 1.280 acres of land. For those who say that this cap is too large. let me first put to rest the argument that large corporations have occupied vast tracts of reclamation land and that this has represented a serious abuse of the public policy objectives meant to be served by the reclamation law. This bill ends those abuses. Under its provisions no large corporation can own more than 160 acres. The 1.280acre cap applies to qualified recipients of reclamation water and those qualified recipients are going to be family farmers. So we restore in this bill the original objective that I strongly endorse as does the senior Senator from Oregon. Mr. HATFIELD. which is the maintenance of a pattern of family farms on reclamation projects throughout the West. It is said the cap is too large. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska can speak to the conditions in Nebraska. and I would not dispute him. I know that he is well aware of the pattern of farming in his State. But I am well aware of the pattern of farming in the intermountain West which depends even more heavily than Nebraska on irrigation water. And I can say to you that the 1.280acre limitation that now exists in the committee bill is reasonable and representative of the present and future needs of the pattern of farming that does exist in the Western States.",

We know that. as these investment costs increase. it has been necessary in order to maintain a viable family farm to expand it in the past. This is the first chance in 77 years Congress has had to bring the Reclamation Act uu to date. and we want this to be the kind of reform that can withstand the test of time. I hope it will be possible for us to reform this law in such a way that it will preserve viable family farms for the remainder of the century and that we will not have to come back here every year as we do in the case of the national debt to increase the maximum limit.

But I think any disinterested party. someone who had spent the last 6. 8. or 10 years on the Moon. for example. would have to understand that there are some rather devastating consequences occurring under our present political system. the one that exists in this country today. If the electoral college system is so important to the structuring of our political system. why is it that by any barometer you can imagine. the political parties are at their lowest ebb today? Why is it that the participation in the political process is lower than it has ever been before? Why is there a kind of disenchantment about our political institutions such as we have not observed in ages? I cannot honestly say I know all the answers. but certainly the electoral college has not protected us from any of those particular faults. I suggest that anyone who studies this matter carefully will find that. rather than being some sort of a revolutionary vehicle that the proponents of direct election are trying to foist onto the poor unsuspecting people of this country. the direct popular vote is really the rule. The electoral college is the exception. I see in the Chamber my distinguished friend from Arkansas. who prior to coming to this forum served with distinction in the other body. with a little detour in between through the Governors mansion down in the great State of Arkansas. but he has been a longtime student of the political process in this country.

However. a \"Review and Outlook\" editorial of the Wall Street Journal on June 13. 1979. illustrates that even a business giant such as Chrysler Corp.. the countrys 10thlargest industrial firm. can have its competitive position in the marketplace substantially weakened or even destroyed by the harsh inequities of Federal regulations. It is shocking that Congress and the Federal regulatory agencies have failed to anticipate the crushing blow of Federal regulations. The demand for increased regulation of business on the one hand. and the dire predictions of a monopolistic society on the other. are both made without recognizing the correlation between the two. The farreaching impact of any regulatory scheme on the business community must be carefully balanced with its possible benefits before rushing forward with bandaid solutions to temporary dislocations in the marketplace. In spite of the antibusiness rhetoric of certain sectors of our society. a vigorous business sector oriented to the freeenterprise system remains the key to preserving our economic position in todays world. Governmental interference with the private business sector slows down the creation of jobs and lessens the high standard of living we all enjoy. We cannot continue to bite the hand that nourishes us without stunting its growth. Unfortunately. the adverse effects of Federal regulation of the marketplace often go unnoticed because its impact falls heaviest on small businessmen. who are not as visible as big business. Hopefully. knowledge of how regulations have contributed to the economic ills of such industry leaders as Chrysler Corp.. will help awaken us to the fact that we are stifling efficiency and destroying the competitive forces in our free market system by attempting to control the marketplace.

The Paperwork Commission estimated 2 years ago that Federal paperwork burdens amount to $100 billion a year. That is a huge figure that represents not only big bucks in hidden taxes but much wasted time and citizen frustration as well. I recently held a hearing in Jacksonville where people from various walks of life talked about the paperwork in their lives. A small business counselor told me that many of his clients refuse to expand their businesses because of the added paperwork they would face. He unwound a 60foot strand of taped together forms to show me the material any small business person has to know to even think about getting into business. Two elderly widows read instructions to me from tax forms that neither I nor they could understand. A pharmacist showed me how it takes some 7 minutes to fill a prescription and get paid if someone walks off the street. but as a medicaid provided to nursing homes he is lucky to get paid in 7 months because of the paperwork shuffle. He spends more time on paperwork than delivering the services he was trained to do in 6 years of higher education. A young doctor. just entering practice. told of the difficulty of being paid for services to a medicaid patient and estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the doctors in Jacksonville will ever accept medicaid patients in their office. Frightening was the testimony of several people who said they were \"afraid of their Government.\" They had been bombarded with Government forms. neglected or wrongly answered some particular form. and were afraid that the \"Government\" was going to \"get\" them as a resulta nagging feeling of fear. Federal paperwork requirements. whether they be tax forms. medicare forms. financial loans. or job applications are something each individual in this country touches. feels. and works on. The cumulative impact is excessive. Too many paperwork requirements are an unnecessary hassle and wasteful. It is important to recognize that every 1percent reduction in that $100 billion total is a billion bucks. Perhaps more significant is the need to get a handle on and control the growth rate in paperwork requirements. Paperwork is one thing that is rising faster than inflation.",

The point is that it is a legitimate function of a State government to try to find an opportunity for its people to support themselves. and to survive without being a welfare burden on the other States of the Nation. The Senator would seek to curtail the States in the proper exercise of their function. in what they regard as the proper exercise of their duty. with a Federal tax on the States. Here is what Chief Justice Stone said in the New York casethe only one. to my. knowledge. that would give the Senator any reason to think the Federal Government has a right to tax the States in this way: But neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers. Hence the limitation upon the taxing power of each. so far as it affects the other. must receive a practical construction which permits both to function with the minimum of interference each with the other. and that limitation cannot be so varied or extended as seriously to impair . .. the appropriate exercise of the functions of the government affected by it.

He said: They pay (oil companies). on an average. 43 percent of their profits in income taxes. They are also taxed on their payroll for social security and unemployment insurancefederal and state. This would have the effect of increasing the tax bite to around 50 percent of their profits. In most states the tax at the pump includes federal and state assessments totaling 11 cents per gallon. almost twice as much as the profit realized by the oil companies.

TVs coverage of events within Iran in general and NBCs \"interview\" with the young Marine corporal at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. in particular. have raised some serious questions about TV journalism. During the Vietnam war. television helped to bring home some of the reality of that unfortunate conflict. and during the Watergate crisis. television informed millions of Americans about most of the details of that sorbid episode. As the state of the art progressed in terms of advanced telecommunications and the increased skill of correspondents. some commentators. like Marshall McLuhan. predicted that television and other electronic media would soon replace the printed media. However. the crisis in Iran has revealed some of the problems inherent in television journalism. which are to some extent unique to television. From the very beginning. the networks have been somewhat at the service of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the socalled students at the U.S. Embassy. as both have employed the new technique of television diplomacy. NBCs decision to interview the Marine corporal hostage demonstrated a marked lack of sensitivity and a failure to consider the very probable possibility of brainwashing by the terrorists at the U.S. Embassy. Most importantly. the networks fixation on the contrived mob scenes outside the Embassy. which have approximately the same importance as a pep rally. are conveying a rather selective reality. and a small slice at that. of what is happening in Iran at the present time.

The fiscal year 1980 budget was the subject of a hearing by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on February 5. 1979. The Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation has tentatively scheduled further hearings for late March to examine the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions budget request more closely. The Committee on Environment and Public Works will report an authorization bill to the Senate in due course. This is a watershed period for nuclear power development in our Nation. The public is focusing everincreasing attention on. such issues as nuclear waste management. siting and licensing of powerplants. and health effects of lowlevel ionizing radiation. We must insure that the Commission has the resources and support to carry out its responsibilities in these crucial areas. The committee intends to determine the extent to which program priorities outlined in the NRC proposal reflect the directives authorized in the Commissions fiscal year 1979 authorization bill. public law 95601. Specifically. such initiatives as research planning on health effects of lowlevel ionizing radiation. improved safety systems research. and studies on the respetive regulatory roles of NRC and the States in the Federal nuclear waste management program will be reviewed for the adequacy of resource allocation in the coming fiscal year.

At present. there is no national cemetery in Nevada to provide for the burial of deceased veterans. Although national cemeteries came into being during the Civil War to provide for the burial of soldiers who had died in service. most of them are situated where battles occurred and therefore are not evenly distributed in the 50 States. For this reason. the western part of the United States has few national cemeteries. and the many veterans who served during World War II have no place within reasonable proximity to their domicile for burial. During the last World War we had approximately 16 million men under arms. and when you consider their dependents. we have a total of about 50 million people who are eligible for burial. Due to the march of time: the need for this legislation is increasing in urgency. Early in the 2d session of the 92d Congress the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs considered the proposal to establish a national cemetery in Nevada. Unfortunately. the bill was not adopted.

This bill would renew the program popularly known as countercyclical revenue sharing for 2 yearsfiscal 1979 and fiscal 1980. But it is important that we be clear about how this drastically revised program would work. for it is revenue sharing only insofar as it transfers certain moneys from Washington to local governments. The underlying principle is substantially different from that embodied in prior antirecessionary fiscal assistance programs. It is that the Federal Government has an ongoing responsibility to provide temporary fiscal assistance to localities plagued by high unemployment and other problems associated with economic distress so that they can maintain essential services for their residents. This program is highly targeted on the Nations most distressed localities as signified by local unemployment rates. It would provide them with $250 million in fiscal 1979 and $150 million in fiscal 1980. Should the national economy fall into a recession during this period. there is a second title in the bill to provide additional antirecessionary funds. This is not the only formula that could be devised. I have already joined with Senators DANFORTH and WILLIAMS in introducing S. 200. which embodies the formula agreed to by the Senate last autumn. In the administrations judgment. however. this new bill provides a well targeted and reasonable level of funding for localities most in need. Almost 40 percent of the assistance would go to the 10 cities with highest strain as measured by Richard Nathan and associates at the Brookings Institution. There will be ample opportunity to consider alternative distribution formulas and overall funding levels. But there is surely no doubt that some form of direct intergovernmental aid is needed. and I intend to fight vigorously for its enactment. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill I introduce today would permit the U.S. attorney and the assistant U.S. attorneys appointed for the eastern district of New York to reside within 20 miles of the district. Under section 545(a) of title 28. U.S. attorneys are required to reside in the district to which they are appointed. This section represents a codification of the policy that law enforcement officials should reside in the same community in which they enforce the law. Exceptions to this rule. however. have been made for the District of Columbia and the southern district of New York because of their peculiar geographic composition and location. New York City is the only city in the United States which is divided between two judicial districtsthe eastern and the southern. Thus. as applied to New York City. the effect of section 545 is to carve out parts of the city as offlimits to the U.S. attorneys who live and work there. Congress has already recognized the arbitrary effect of applying the residency rule to New York City by including the southern district of New York in the 20mile exemption originally created for the District of Columbia. This bill would eliminate the remaining glaring inconsistency by also including the eastern districtwhich encompasses the other half of New York Citywithin that 20mile exemption. This bill has the approval of the distinguished Senators from New York. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN and JACOB JAVITS. and the Department of Justlce.O By Mr. KENNEDY:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation which would insure that regulations promulgated by the executive branch conform to congressional intent. This proposal requires that when a governmental agency drafts regulations in order to implement Federal legislation. the congressional committee of origin has 60 days to either disapprove or approve of said regulations. There is a pressing need for this legislation. The cost of excessive Federal regulations alone. in this time of trimming the Federal budget. makes such legislation imperative. Murray L. Weidenbaum. Director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis. pointed out the need for this bill in an article appearing in the Washington Post. February 3. 1979. He states: Part of the problem in setting regulatory policy is that the benefits at times are more visible than the costsnot necessarily greater. but more evident. If the required scrubber for electric utilities is resulting in cleaner air. we literally see the benefits. But the costs are merely part of the higher electric bill we pay. Thus. the cost of regulation takes on the characteristics of a hidden sales tax that. like sales taxes in general. are ultimately paid by the consumer. The concern takes on the characteristics of a hidden sales from the fact that they are imposed initially on business. but the knowledge that the costs ultimately are borne by the consumer.

They are going to be paid for by Federal funds. State funds. or foundation funds. And the question here is. to what extent does the Federal Government maintain its commitment to those people to whom we have made a commitment that they are entitled to Federal medical services or payment for medical services from the Federal Government? What is more precisely this. Nothing in this is going to affect an unborn child. Those abortions are going to take place anyway. The question is. Who is going to pay for them? That is why we do not see any reason why we should be debating year after year after year this abortion issue on these appropriations bills. If the Senator does not like the laws. go change the State laws. If he does not think the Federal Government should have a Federal abortion law. then pass a Federal antiabortion law. But currently this is a matter of funding. In my State. if this Hyde language were to pass. all it would do would be to shift the burden to the State or local government to pay the bills because the State law says those abortions are legal. It is not going to be changed at all by an appropriations bill. That is the same thing throughout the country. Unfortunately. when you put it on a continuing resolution and it affects peopIe overseas. then you do affect the lives of people to whom we have made a commitment. The dependents of military personnel and of civilian personnel abroad do not have any State funds and their payments are in these bills. That is why we took it out of the one bill. I think we should take it out of all appropriations bills because of the impact on dependents. Personnel of the Armed Forces and of the State Department throughout the world are affected by this language adversely as there are no moneys available for them and they are people to whom we have made a commitment that we will provide medical services. and I do not see any inclination to change that law.",

As you know. Mr. President. the need for NATO force modernization is to endow the defense of Western Europe with sufficient counterstrength against the whole range of Soviet intermediaterange missiles--in particular. the powerful SS20.

I request that the following letter from organizers of Buffalos demonstration of unity sent to President Carter be printed in the RECORD: President JIMMY CARTER. The White House. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The teachers of Buffalo. New York have initiated what appears to be building into a massive and united show of compassion for our fellow Americans in Iran. We ask that all Americans join with us on December 19th from 11:00 to 11:02 for two minutes of silence. We also ask that this silence be so complete that all people will realize that in no other country do the words \"united we stand\" mean what they do for the people of the United States of America.

I had requested these hearings because of my continuing concern for the farm credit situation in rural America. The hearings were chaired by our distinguished colleague from Nebraska. Mr. ZORINSKY. Though. in my opinion. this question is not given the attention it deserves. nevertheless this particular hearing produced some exceptionally well prepared witnesses who addressed the problem with unusual familiarity and frankness. Their insights should not be limited to the audience in the committee room. One witness. Mr. Reuben L. Johnson. Director of Legislative Services for the National Farmers Union. told the subcommittee thatInterest outlays of American farmers are expected to reach 14 billion dollars in 1980. almost twice the level of 1977. Another witness. Mr. Charles L. Frasier. Washington representative of the National Farmers Organization. expressed deep concern for the effect of the highinterest policy during the coming year.

It is rare. however. to find in one person both a depth of learning of the law. a tactical sense of how to apply the rules of law. and a zeal for justice. Such an unusual man was Judge Joseph Sherbow. In my years of public service I have had many occasions to observe Judge Sherbow in action. He always inspired both admiration and respect by the way in which he tackled a legal problem. In the first place he knew the law in depth and stated it accurately. He would then relate the cause he advocated to the general interests of the public. Finally he would argue the basic equities of the relief he sought. It was a powerful exercise of professional talent and responsibility. Not the least of the legacies left by Judge Sherbow is the valuable education he provided to young lawyers. Law may be learned in law school. but the practice of law is generally learned from other more experienced lawyers. Judge Sherbow was one of those highly visible members of the bar who can inspire and teach their younger colleagues. and he clearly did so.

I would like to commend the members of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee for reporting legislation that makes commonsense improvements in the Federal Election Campaign Act. In particular. I want to highlight one issue on which I have received correspondence from the secretary of the State of Arkansas. Paul Riviere. who must abide by the regulations Congress imposes. Under current law. the retention period for which States must keep multicandidate and candidate committee reports on hand for Senate and Presidential candidates is 10 years. The period for reports relating solely to House candidates is 5 years. From 1976 through October 26 of this year. there were only three requests to review the multicandidate committee reports in Arkansas. while there were 189 requests to review Candidate Committee reports. The State of Arkansas must keep on hand 5.200 multicandidate report filings when the public is clearly not sufficiently interested in them. and which will probably never be looked at by more than a dozen people. If other States experience is similar to Arkansas--and I suspect it isthen Congress should take steps to reduce this administrative burden. The House has already approved legislation that contains provisions to reduce the retention periods for these reports. Candidate committee reports would be kept on hand for 2 years. and all other reports would be kept through April 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the report was filed. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee has agreed to use this approach by requiring all committee reports to be kept for 2 years. which I think strikes the proper balance between the publics right to this information and manageable paperwork requirements on State election officials.S",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of the Committee on Rules and Administration. Mr. HATFIELD and I. as ranking minority member and chairman. respectively. have submitted an amendment in the form of a substitute bill for H.R. 5010. a bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. In September. the Committee on Rules and Administration reported S. 1757. a bill designed to correct certain inequities in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. At the time S. 1757 was reported. the House had passed and sent to the Senate H.R. 5010. which also revised the Campaign Act of 1971. Since the House bill was similar in purpose to the Senate bill. and included a number of like provisions while being somewhat more comprehensive in scope. Mr. HATFIELD and I prepared a substitute measure in amendment thereof which uses the House bill as a basis and adds some provisions of the Senate bill. In an attempt to achieve a bill acceptable to both Houses of Congress. sections of the two bills that were not similar were either deleted or modified. It is the purpose of this statement. and that of Senator HATFIELD. to explain the intent of the provisions so modified where such intent is not clearly evident from the respective committee reports. By way of introduction and background. the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (the act) was last amended in 1976. In 1977 a bill. S. 926. did pass the Senate by a vote of 88 to 1. but was not considered by the House. That legislation was an attempt to correct many of the problems that candidates had experienced during the 1976 elections. The need for campaign reform was again expressed after the 1978 elections. In response to the continued and demonstrated need for corrective legislation in this area. the Committee on Rules and Administration. in September. considered and reported S. 1757 which incorporates many of the provisions of the 1977 bill. The House then considered and unanimously passed H.R. 5010. Both bills seek to simplify the reporting and recording requirements. expand the role of political parties. and increase the \"grassroots\" participation in Federal election campaigns.",

Mr. Lagather makes mention of MSHAs recently initiated compliance assistance visit (CAV) program. Under this program. inspectors visit mines for the purpose of pointing out any conditions or practices which are in violation of the Mine Act so that they may be corrected by the operator without him being assessed civil penalties. Since these visits are conducted when mines are not in operation. this program should be beneficial to Alpha Industries which operates on a seasonal basis and is thus eligible for such visits.

During his confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate. it was my pleasure to speak out in his behalf and support. Previous to his term as chief executive of the territory. he also served in the Eighth Guam Legislature. It was to his credit that the Governor became the islands first chief executive to visit Guamanian soldiers during the Vietnam crisis. He took to our fighting men and women messages and gifts from their families. This generous gesture of deep concern for his fellow islanders won him lasting respect and affection among our people. Before entering politics. the Governor won considerable renown for his able skills as a dentist. He served in the U.S. Army for 2 years in the rank of captain. Governor Camacho was one of the founders of the Republican Party on Guam. He struggled hard to win an education. having been forced to cut short his schooling during World War II. Following the war. he went to Aquinas College and later graduated from the School of Dentistry at Marquette University ir Milwaukee. Wis.

Coal. at present the cheapest and most abundant energy source. is in danger. as the following table shows. Illinois coal production has been decreasing. while the demand for coal has been growing. The blame for this frightening situation can be laid on the doorstep of governmentspecifically the existence of an unreasonable Clean Air Act which threatens to push the cost of coal production so high as to make it virtually uneconomical. If all the OPECdependent oilfired boilers in the country were to convert to coal we would reduce our oil imports. and consequent dependence upon OPEC. by about 200 million barrels per year. Apart from the significant liberation from OPEC dependence that such a switch would encourage. we would also see an increase in employment in the American coal industry. There are about 14.000 miners in Illinois. Between 5 and 10 percent have lost their jobs because of the decline of the coal industry. In some towns which base their economy on the coal industry. this is a devastating loss.

I asked Chairman JAMES HANLEY to call these hearings in my district to investigate the problems that are caused by excessive paperwork requirements by the Federal Government. We held 3 hearings on that day. and took testimony from 40 witnesses from many different backgrounds. The message from my constituents was clear on this subject that they have had enough paperwork requirements from the Federal Government. and that Congress and the bureaucracy must work to reduce and eliminate this burden. A fact was generally accepted that many of the paperwork requirements are the product of regulations issued by the various agencies but are not necessarily mandated in the legislation that passed Congress. I have thus concluded. as have many of my colleagues. that more congressional oversight is needed to insure that the intent of Congress is met by the bureaucracy. Upon further study of this paperwork problem. it became evident that Congress. through the years. is also guilty of placing a paperwork burden on the American public. It may not appear so directly. but when Congress requires a Federal agency to continually make a report to Congress. these reports translate into additional information requirements from our already exhausted public. The real problem is. however. that many of these reports are either not needed because of changes in the law. or represent duplication of information already compiled by other sources. As I have been involved with this issue since coming to Congress. I was pleased to note that the Office of Management and Budget has been working. for the past year. on legislation that seeks to eliminate unnecessary reports of this nature. and modify those that. while still needed. may represent excessive reporting requirements placed on the American public.

I am introducing legislation to include a new category of nuclear waste under the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions licensing authority and to clarify the Commissions authority to license highlevel waste disposal facilities. These steps are necessary to provide for thorough health and safety review of repositories for nuclear wastes which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years. The administration and the Congress are at last addressing the need for a coherent and reliable plan for the development of facilities for the permanent disposal of highlevel nuclear wastes. The best nearterm solution for the nuclear waste disposal problem is burial of the material in very deep geologic structures. It has become clear that finding appropriate geologic sites for this purpose will be one of our toughest challenges. Each prospective site we find. therefore. will be an extremely important natural resource to be carefully explored and developed. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. a rare prospective site could be ruined by inadvertent exploratory mistakes. It is essential. according to the Commission. that the Department of Energy begin to work within the licensing process early in the site development stage to insure the safety of the facility and the integrity of the host rock. Three principal kinds of nuclear materials have been determined to require",

The intent of the 1975 legislation authorizing these centers was to provide a 5year funding base for each center. I would like to share with my colleagues some of the marvelous programs of the National Health Care Management Center at the University of Pennsylvania. This center. designated in late 1976 is now in its 3d year of funding. In this time. the NHCMC has shown itself to be a major regional and national resource. and has made significant accomplishments in addressing problems faced in the health field. Indeed. many hospitals. institutions. organizations and health care providers in my own State of New Jersey have benefited directly from the work of the center. Following are some specific areas of accomplishment that are illustrative of the contribution of the National Health Care Management Center: Development of a plan for corporate monitoring of cost and utilization of hospital services of employees and their dependents. This effort. undertaken with the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and 30 Philadelphia area employers. has been instrumental in developing a fundamental means by which corporations can monitor health costs. The monitoring is leading to a better understanding of the causes of costs and means for their rational control. Development and administration of a management audit tool for home health agencies for use in assessment of management practices. financial control and problem analysis. This effort. undertaken in cooperation with home health agencies in New Jersey. has resulted in an audit tool that can be selfadministered by agencies. data that can be used to compare agencies. and a set of man-",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have been debating a familiar topic. namely. whether or not to supply U.S. taxpayers funds to a Communist government in the hope of strengthening the private sector. I think the situation may be summarized in this way. The Sandinista movement. which has explicit ties with the world Communist movement. which has signed agreements with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. and with the Cuban regime. is in total control of the instruments of government in Nicaragua. Now I recognize that the instruments of government in Nicaragua still do not have total control of the population. There is strong resistance in Nicaragua to the totalitarian takeover. I believe that we should encourage that resistance. But we will discourage that resistance if we provide assistance directly to the government. The question is simply one of credibility. How can we use the Sandinista government as a vehicle to strengthen the private sector when that government is committed to a Marxist program? The vehicle itself is fundamentally skewed. It may be part of the Sandinista program to retain a docile private sector while it is consolidating power. but we can be sure that it will never retain a vigorous free market system providing economic and political freedom to the people. Any money we give to the Communist government will be used for Communist purposes. The Communists will use the money to entrap and tame the private sector. Marxists fundamentally believe that economic priorities should be set by the state. Thus. there can be no truly private sector. So the question comes down to this: Should we give $75 million of the U.S. taxpayers money to a Communist government to help that government capture and destroy the private sector. and eliminate resistance to the revolution? If any Senator votes to continue these funds. that Senator is voting to support Marxism and Marxist revolution. It is as simple as that. Thank you. Mr. President.",

I see that the Senator from South Carolina is not on the floor. so I will dispense with my question to him. Very briefly. Mr. President. the situation is as follows: In December of last year. we passed H.R. 3434. the social services and child welfare program. Under that bill. there is an entitlement referred to in title XX. 4 percent of that money is used for training. so that the other 96 percent may be used effectively. The rationale. I think. is really quite clear. In August of last year. we began to operate under the continuing resolution that had a $75 million cap. In December. we passed H.R. 3434. and States were then entitled to $137 million. The bill only has $75 million. so there is a shortfall of $62 million. We have determined the amount of exposure being incurred by the States is less than the entitlement. It is $39 million. My amendment seeks to put that $39 million back in. It does not seek to add the $62 million. The issue here is whether States operating under the entitlement in good faith should be dealt with equitably. given the fact they have already incurred these expenses. I would also point out that these obligations are there no matter what we do. The final point I would make is that the budget resolution. when passed. had an entitlement section. and this $39 million does not violate that section. I yield to the Senator from New York.",

We said that in spite of some of these entitlement programs. the money does have to be appropriated. So far as this being an entitlement is concerned. the last 2 years the Appropriations Committee has capped this particular entitlement program with a ceiling. and it is under what the entitlement should be. So the States are on notice that regardless of what the authorizing legislation says. they do not automatically get that. Being on notice. they should wait until the money is appropriated. The bill just became law. the conference was just worked out about the time we went to the supplemental markup. Now we are told that the States already have committed this money. Mr. President. if we are going to try ever to do anything about some of these programs. we have to be able to see where there is overlapping. If you have six programs in a pot and they are all spending money and it is going at the rate these have been going. at some stage you have to try to do something about it. I want to meet all the pressing needs we have. but another $39 million on top of $161 million for the training of social workers. when we have more social workers than we have work for them to do. does not make sense. It does not make sense to appropriate more money when we have told the Department to come up with a comprehensive plan. and if they have six programs. we know we do not have that. Under the circumstances. I think it would be foolish for us to edd another $39 million in this particular area. when there is $161 million out there for this now. when we just passed that bill.

Historically the people who are dependent upon oil in the Northeastern States have had 30 days in which to pay their bill and if that bill was paid within 10 days they would have a 1percent rebate. However. the crisis we face now is that many dealers and many consumers have to pay their bill either within 10 days with no rebate or pay with cash on delivery. Specifically. Mr. Chairman. the study will look into how credit terms affect the competitive viability of the independent refiners. small refiners. nonbranded independent marketers and branded independent marketers of middle distillates. to see if his credit is justified by the current market conditions and other current credit terms between refiners and their wholesalers and retailers consistent with the public interest. Further. it will look into the differences of credit and purchase restrictions in effect between the refiners and their wholly or partially owned subsidiaries. and for those between the refiner and the nonaffiliated. independent. small business petroleum marketer.",

Mr. Chairman. earlier this year at a hearing in Waterbury.

Mr. Chairman. we had as one of the witnesses the spokesman for the independent retailers in the State of Connecticut. One of the statements he made is as follows: There is in New England an estimate that as many as 300 fuel dealers may go out of business this year. The spokesman. Mr. Berson. went on to testify as follows: I would like to put on the record some of the problems of the marketing segment of the oil industry. We are the ham in the sandwich. We are between the refiners who sell it to us and the consumers who buy It from us. The witness said that this year the companies have become extraordinarily rigid in their payment terms: You must pay for that oil to be in good standing within 10 days. If you dont pay for that oil within 10 days you just dont get the oil. So a lot of the people who depend upon their good old friendly oil dealer will find that they still have the desire to help them as he always has in the past but the oil dealer simply does not have the ability to help them.

The target of 240 million barrels of home heating oil in storage by October 31. 1979. appears to be in reach now. Since the supply problem apparently has been resolved. the question of price and credit must be addressed. The price of home heating oil has risen dramatically by 60 percent since January of this year. In addition. many dealers have seen their credit reduced from a 30day payback period with a 1 percent discount if within 10 days. to a 10day payback limit with no price discounts for early payment. These unreasonably stringent credit terms and purchase restrictions are being imposed on dealers. who in turn. must pass this credit on to their customers. Without question. this tight credit policy is placing severe hardship on the small business fuel oil dealer as well as the consumer of that necessity. The 10day payback period presents serious budget problems for low- and middleincome households who will be forced to pay their bills or face the termination of essential fuel oil deliveries. Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment which instructs the Secretary of Energy to initiate an investigation into the credit practices within the fuel oil distribution system.",

In the previous amendment that vie passed. in our eagerness to get on with the job of deregulating gasoline so it might be viewed on a par at the refinery level and by consumers with heatirg oil. we stripped away the whole allocation program. As a result. we have exposed the farmer to the possibility that during the harvest season and during planting he might not have sufficient fuels. and as a result the farmer might find himself in a position where nature does not wait on him and because of the inability of the President to designate priority use. the farmer might not be able to get relief. We also. in the process of eliminating the allocation program. eliminated the assurance that we will have police protection. fire protection and all of the other vital services that are outlined in section (b) (1). The purpose of my amendment is to simply put back priority allocation for agriculture and for essential services as outlined in the existing law. but not reimpose the allocation program itself. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is designed to provide the Secretary certain emergency authorities for allocating motor gasoline for certain high priority users in times of a severe gasoline supply interruption. It does not permit the Secretary to institute a general allocation scheme for other than high priority users. It only permits the Secretary to allocate to certain important categories of users such as agricultural users and users which help assure public safety and health. Most importantly. my amendment does not permit the Secretary to reimpose any price controls.

It reminds me of my own State where we were a depository for nerve gas. and over a period of time there was leakage that occuTred in those canisters. The Governor and other public officials had to find this out by actually digging into the bureaucracy of the Federal Government to inquire. taking public rumor and trying to nail it down to clarify and to assure the public that everything was being done that should be done and. therefore. we have had some prime examples of what happens when the Feds operate in a vacuum unrelated to the role of leadership at the State level that can be so helpful in implementing and furthering a public policy. I might amend my previous comment to observe that even the Presiding Officer at this time (Mr. ExoN) is a former Governor. so I guess we are in the majority at this moment.

So that would. by the very nature of it. by the nature of the requirement to exclude access of the population to it. exclude the area from a place of high population density. Of that I am totally satisfied. convinced. and certain. The problem would be if we tried to define high popuiation density. It would be very difficult to do so. I think the Senator has greater protection by relying on the present law which deals with health and safety. One of the problems might be if we tried to define the number of persons per square mile within such and such a distance from the fence. the mine mouth. from whatever. Then. if we could ever appropriately define it. we would tend to say it is OX to have such facilities if they are not located within such population density. and. actually. the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may want to be much more strict than any definition we might want to effect.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I do not believe that would be possible under the bill. The bill provides for monitored retrievable storage. One of the advantages of monitored retrievable storage is that we are not restricted to geologic formations. It seems to me. the ideal kinds of places to store nuclear waste for monitored detrievable are in areas where we already have a large Federal reservation. totally sealed off from public access. My own personal choice at this time. which has not been engrafted on the bill. would be an area like the Nevada atomic bomb test site. where we have tens of thousands of acres of Federal reservation. totally sealed off from public access. with tunnels actually already built. It is that kind of reservation to which monitored retrievable storage is best adapted. That. frankly. is one of the biggest reasons for going to monitored retrievablethat we are not restricted to these geological formations. Geologic formations. as the Senators question suggests. do not occur at the places where we would like them to occur. They do not occur on Federal reservations. necessarily. They occur in populated areas and elsewhere. For that reason. this bill makes it inappropriate to store the waste in the kind of geological formation the Senator describes.",

The House must vote to keep reconciliation if we hope to keep the budget real.0",

I am aware of his contributions to our community. I am taking the liberty of sharing his story. Frank Batten is chairman of Landmark Communications. Inc.. which publishes the VirginianPilot and the LedgerStar in the Norfolk. Va.. metropolitan area. He has not only been an eminently successful businessman but has given unselfishly of his substance and himself to his community and State. Not long ago. he was honored as Norfolks \"First Citizen.\" perhaps the most coveted honor in the city. Mr. Batten has battled cancer of the larynx for 2 years. and some weeks ago he had no choice but to submit to a laryngectomy in order to save his life. I am happy to say that he has completely recovered from his surgery and is now adjusting as one must do following such an operation. To anyone unfortunate enough to have suffered the same experience. Frank Battens article. which appeared in the November 2. 1979. VirginianPilot. will be an inspiration. Anyone who might have to face such an operation can draw hope and strength from it. and the vast majority of us. who take our voices for granted. will be moved by his courage. selfconfidence. and unfailing sense of humor.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues some correspondence I had recently with the Department of State regarding the cost of relocating Israeli airbases in the Negev Desert. Concern had been expressed by members that the State Department had underestimated the actual costs of this redeployment and that it might cost $1.5 billion. It was never the intention of the U.S. Government that the $800 million in grants provided to Israel as part of the Special International Security Assistance Act of 1979 would cover all costs involved in the redeployment. but it is reassuring that current estimates indicate the redeployment will cost $1.04 billion and the $800 million in grants will cover most of the construction costs. The correspondence with the State Department follows: Hon. CYRUs R. VANCE. Secretary of State. Department of State. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I noted in the Congressional Record of September 17. 1979 a statement by my colleague. Congressman Kemp of New York. stating that the costs of relocating two alrbases in Israel. as a result of the EgyptianIsraeli Treaty. were seriously underestimated by the Department of State and that the actual cost will be close to $1.5 billion. I would like the Department to clarify this matter and comment on the assertions made. It was my recollection from testimony before the committee that it was never intended that the $800 million in grants provided would cover all costs of airbase redeployments but that it would cover most costs. I would appreciate your consideration of this matter and your current estimates. if revised. of the costs of this redeployment. With best regards. Sincerely yours.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we are struck with a sense of deepest concern when we see pictures of American citizens. military and civilian. being led blindfolded from our own Embassy in Tehran. The events in Iran during the last 3 days underline the true character of the Ayatollahs regime and the animalistic mob actions which he incites. The Iranian students and revolutionary guards who are holding some 60 Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran are demanding the release of the deposed Shah. who is critically and perhaps even terminally ill in a New York hospital. Even the Prime Minister has resigned because of these lawless acts. This is a shameful day for Iran. Of more concern to me. however. is that this is an even more shameful day for the United States of America. In recent weeks I have voiced on a number of occasions increasing alarm over our deteriorating image before the eyes of the world. Everyone kicks us around. confident that we will do nothing in return. We have. in large measure. invited the contempt that other nations feel unrestrained in demonstrating toward us. Even the leader of another nation now feels free to encourage openly hostile. barbaric acts toward our people and our property. It is interesting that no action was taken against the Mexican people while the Shah was residing in Mexicowhen he supposedly enjoyed good health. no less. I recognize the delicate nature of the present circumstances and in no sense suggest precipitate action. Nevertheless we must keep all options open to assure the release of our people. We must be prepared to back up our position with military action if necessary. A number of other actions suggest themselvessuch as closing the Iranian Embassy in Washington. closing our Embassy in Iran. putting sanctions on Iran like we do on other nations. and sending Iranian students home who lack the proper credentials. All of these have much to recommend them and should be considered. However. for us the most urgent step is to convince the world that we are determined from this moment forward to respond appropriately to the provocations of any nation or mob. Failing in this. there will be more Tehrans. It is time to show the world that the United States cannot be blackmailed.",

I have been troubled by the haste with which this matter is being considered. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the minds of many of our colleagues are already made up: It is no longer a question of whether Federal assistance should be provided at all. but rather of how much and with what conditions. I do not share this view. My mind is not made up. In fact. I have some very real concerns about Chryslers request. There can be no doubt that Chrysler is in serious trouble. and that corporate failure is a real possibility. If Chrysler is to survive. it must undertake a painful reassessment of its place in the American auto industry. It must also achieve commitments of assistance and support from those most seriously affected by its problemsin particular. its employees. In this regard. I am certainly not convinced that the wage agreement recently concluded between Chrysler and the UAW is consistent with the spirit of sacrifice and hard work which all involved must share if Chrysler is to survive. Mr. Speaker. I am afraid that we in Congress are in danger of letting political considerations outweigh common economic sense. This approach may be the path of least resistance in the short run but. in the long run. may well result in policies which are later regretted. I would like to commend to my colleagues an article by Robert Samuelson which bears lucidly on this subject.",

This week marks the 150th anniversary of community newspapering in the village of Skaneateles. N.Y.. and the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Marcellus. N.Y.. weekly newspaper. Two great institutions in two neighboring communities are now one. and the staff of the combined Skaneateles Press and Marcellus Observer will celebrate the two anniversaries with a special edition November 14. Throughout the history of our Nation. weekly newspapers have been the anchor of our free press. providing information. sharing opinion. stimulating thought. and fulfilling the public trust inherent in a democracy where freedom of speech is a treasured jewel. In the village of Skaneateles. the 150year unbroken chain of weekly publishing began with the first issue of the Telegraph. July 28. 1829. Two years later. it merged into the newlystarted Columbian. which in 1847 merged into the Democrat. a competitor since 1839. In 1874. the Skaneateless Free Press appeared. providing lively competition until 1926 when the Democrat and Free Press were merged into todays Skaneateles Press. The chronology in nearby Marcellus involves but a single newspaper. the Observer. which circulated for the first time on April 6. 1879. and which was combined with the Skaneateles Press in 1972. As the Skaneateles Press and Marcellus Observer celebrate the twin anniversaries of public service. I am pleased to extend my best wishes to publishers George C. Wortley III and T. Elmer Bogardus. executive editor Barbara S. Rivette. editor Kathy J. Corhalls. contributing editor Wesley C.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. officials from 14 of the Nations major metropolitan airports visited Washington today to urge the Congress to support the Federal commitment to intelligent aircraft noise reduction. In 1976. after 7 years of extensive study and debate. the Federal Aviation Administration issued a landmark ruling which required that older generation aircraft be retrofitted or replaced so that there would be a noise certified fleet by This ruling represented a compromise which was overly generous to the airlines as noiseimpacted communities were told to wait 9 long years for relief. Any further delay in implementing these noise standards would be an unconscionable breach of faith. While excessive aircraft noise clearly diminishes the quality of life for 6 to 10 million Americans. it also seriously endangers their health. Excessive aircraft noise has been linked to damaged hearing. cardiovascular disease. diabetes. fetal damage. increased heart rate. and high blood pressure. Excessive aircraft noise has a devastating impact on property values. often affecting communities which were In existence long before the airports were constructed. Further delay in implementing the FAA noise standards would be an affront to noiseimpacted communities and to those carriers who. in good faith and enlightened corporated decisionmaking. have undertaken the costs of complying with the FAA rules.",

Under the leadership of our colleague from Connecticut.

It may. perhaps. be pointless to pick out one individual from the hundreds who deserve global attention. but congressional action on House Congressional Resolution 202 puts the Soviets on notice that they have a long way to go to live up to their obligation to observe basic human rights. including the freedom to emigrate.

Initially it was said that the explosion was caused by a nuclear detonation. The South African Government denied this. Now there are different theories to account for the explosion. chief among which is that it was caused by a superbolt with 100 times more energy than an ordinary lightning bolt. Those of us who are not scientists are content to leave the inquiry to specialists. But in an important sense this debate over the origin of the explosion concerns us all. If the most sophisticated technology in human history cannot conclusively prove that an explosion of such magnitude was caused by a clear weapon. how can we expect such technology to do the sophisticated and intricate monitoring of the SALT II treaty? We are told by the President that we have the technological means to verify Soviet compliance. But as we have seen in recent months. we cannot even tell if Soviet troops have increased their numbers 90 miles from Miami and. now. we learn that our space satellites cannot verify with any degree of accuracy the origin of a super explosion. At this point I wish to insert in the record. \"South Africa Blast May Have Been Bolt.\" by Walter Sullivan. from the New York Times. November 1. 1979. \"The Flash Seen Round the World.\" by John K.

I think the Members would like to know that today the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs approved a bill to expedite the southern tier pipeline running from southern California to Texas. the socalled Sohio pipeline. Hopefully that is going to resolve one part of this problem. namely. how to utilize the surplus on the west coast resulting from the flow of oil from Alaska. The amendment of the gentleman from Oregon and the amendment of the gentleman from Texas and the discussion we had here today reveal how we feel in our bones that we are in a terrible dilemma. On the one hand. we simply cannot afford. either from a strategic standpoint or an economic standpoint. to go on depending upon the precarious middle east for half of our imported oil. which. in turn. is half of our total oil supply. On the other hand. there is no prospect of developing sufficient petroleum in the United States to supply our current demand. Obviously. we need an emergency reserve. for economic reasons. as well as military ones. If we had only enough oil to run the military and the rest of the country ground to a halt. we would not be able to sustain an effective military operations very long. We have to do something to reduce not only oil imports but the drain on such domestic oil resources as we have. Obviously. conservation is the only shortterm solution. It cannot be debated effectively on the basis of a bill dealing with the very narrow subject range of this bill. But it certainly is time we did. and I hope. in connection with a bill to extend oil price controls. we can have a fullfledged debate on what should be our national oil policy and our national energy policy. In my opinion gasoline rationing is the most effective way to achieve conservation in the short run. I think that this has been a healthy debate. I commend both the gentlemen who offered the amendments for bringing it about and for stimulating our thinking on the broader issues surrounding our precarious national energy situation.",

It is plain to me that the Carter policy toward Rhodesia has failed miserably and that discredited policy must now be changed. The President should now exercise the mandate Congress gave him last year in the socalled CaseJavits amendment and lift economic sanctions against Rhodesia immediately.

I commend to the attention of my colleagues an editorial which appeared in the New York Times during the recent recess. and which. therefore. may have escaped the attention of many of US. The editorial praises the Carter administrations decision to cut off aid to Pakistan. given that countrys apparent nuclear ambitions. But the editorial also points out that we continue to give aid. and to ship uranium to India. despite Indias detonation of a nuclear device 5 years ago. Mr. Speaker. the issue of proliferation of nuclear weapons on the subcontinent is critical. Neither Pakistan nor India has signed the NonProliferation Treaty. And while both countries have placed some of their nuclear facilities under international safeguards. there is no assurance that all of them are safeguarded. As a result. the distinction between peaceful and military applications of nuclear power becomes increasingly hazy. and the risk of \"letting the nuclear genie out of the bottle\" grows even higher. The alternative appears to be to pressure India. as well as Pakistan. to open its nuclear facilities to inspection. MCPL was formed in 1966 to help Members of the House and the Senate. on a bipartisan basis. coordinate their efforts to move to a more secure and peaceful world. including efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear armaments. With worldwide attention focusing on bilateral SALT negotiations between the United States and the U.S.S.R.. we must not forget that other countries are \"catching up\" with the nuclear powers. and that without massive international efforts to control proliferation. our survival. and that of our children. will become ever more precarious.

Presently. with the establishment of a facility for handling export shipments of grain at Morehead City. the North Carolina Department of Agriculture wishes to once again be authorized to inspect grain for export. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture has enjoyed an excellent reputation during the approximately four decades it provided inspection services on inland or export grain. North Carolina now finds it may no longer inspect grain for exportnot because it is unqualified but because it was not inspecting grain for export on a certain date. The most important justification for North Carolina to be allowed to again inspect export grain is that USDAFGIS fees for inspection are substantially higher than those currently being charged by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as sponsor of the Equal Access to Justice Act. I am pleased to join Senator THURMOND as a cosponsor of this legislation which would apply the underlying principles of S. 265 to OSHA. OSIA has unquestionably been the favorite example of an agency which has overregulated. been capricious and arbitrary and often forced small businessmen to buckle under becaiuse it was cheaper to give in than fight. The agency itself has recognized some of its deficiencies and attempted to eliminate many of its regulations. But this is not enough. In order to restore the proper balance between the agency and those it regulates. those cited must be able to fight when right. Under this bill if they prevail. and the agency cannot substantially justify its position then they will be entitled to attorneys fees and costs. And the costs will come from the agencies budget and the cumulative agenzy costs will be reported to the Congress annually. Not only will this force the agency to be more judicious in its approach but it will also be an inducement for the agency to work for a quick. reasonable settlement. The philosophy of this approach is that there is no one more qualified to protect the rights of an individual from arbitrary and capricious government action than the individual himself if we remove the economic disadvantage from doing so. Given the incentive to fight. Americans will individually seek to redress government encroachment of individual rights. The proper balance between the regulators and the citizenry can be restored. Mr. President. I believe this is a reasonable and practical solution to government overregulation. The Senate has spoken on this approach consistently. S. 265 passed this body 94 to 3. and was also included in S. 1991. the recently passed FTC legislation. Enactment of this legislation will be entirely consistent with the Senates approach to regulating the regulators.* By Mr. MOYNIHAN:",

I am today introducing a bill entitled. \"Local Government Fiscal Assistance Amendments of 1980.\" I am pleased to introduce this bill to extend the general revenuesharing program through fiscal year 1985. I want to note that I am doing so in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Finance. and I am not endorsing any particular revisions contained in the administrations proposed extension. Our Subcommittee on Revenue Sharing. Intergovernmental Revenue Impact. and Economic Problems. chaired by Senator BRADLEY. will hold hearings on this measure. His subcommittee will attempt to elicit a broad range of views on the merits of the various changes proposed in this bill. As proposed. this measure would eliminate general revenue sharing for State governments. It also would include an additional $500 million in transitional assistance which would be distributed to States based on their prior distributions of State aid to generalpurpose local governments. These are proposals which the Committee on Finance and the full Senate will have to review thoroughly before taking final action. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill. a sectionbysection analysis of the bill. and the statement of the President transmitting this legislation to the Congress be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing a joint resolution to block President Carters oil import fee. Under President Carters plan. the price of gasoline is destined to increase 10 cents per gallon. and even the White House acknowledges that the inflation rate will ultimately rise by at least threequarters of a percent as a result of the oil import fee. Mr. President. New Hampshires hard pressed. hardworking families need a tax cut. not a tax increase. Imposing a price increase on gasoline is really rationing by price. As a result New Hampshires lowand moderateincome families as well as our tourist industry and small businesses are unfairly discriminated against. A gasoline price increase such as this will have a devastating impact on all New Englanders. Many residents of New Hampshire must travel long distances to work or school each day. In the absence of adequate. public transportation. we have no choice but to depend on our cars for commuting. New Hampshires tourist industry. which is still trying to recover from the disastrous effects of last summers long gas lines and this winters short snowfall will be crippled by the oil import fee. Tourism is the second largest industry in the State of New Hampshire. A reduction of tourists. which will surely follow an increase in gas prices. will have serious reverberations throughout our economy. Since coming to the Senate. I have worked hard to provide relief from high energy costs. because in New Hampshire and New England we are never going to get inflation under control until we get our energy costs under control. The cost of the food on our table. the gas in our tank. and the oil in our furnace. are all the result of exorbitant energy costs. the major cause of inflation in the Northeast. For too long Federal energy policy has unfairly discriminated against the people of the Northeast. As chairman of the Senate Energy Conservation and Supply Subcommittee. I will continue my efforts to change Federal energy policy and reduce our energyfueled inflation. In this spirit I introduce my resolution today to block this inflationary oil import fee. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me and promptly pass this resolution before the devastating impact of an oil import fee crashes down on consumers and businesses alike.0",

I ask my colleagues to note in particular Mr. Lamonicas claim of possible modifications of the Soviet MIG23 to enable them to deliver nuclear weapons. and the report that Soviet TU95 Bear bombers which regularly fly to Cuba could easily carry nuclear weapons. If there are nine airfields in Cuba capable of handling the Soviet Backfire bomber. then we really are in trouble.

    "speech": "Mr. President. rapidly rising energy costs have affected all Americans in one form or another. But. older Americans have been especially hard hit. Hearings conducted by the Senate Committee on Aging have made this point abundantly clear. Many older Americans must make difficultand sometimes impossibledecisions affecting their daily personal lives. Should they spend their money on fuel or food? Should they use their meager resources to purchase necessary medicines to maintain their health or should they pay the utility bill? The harsh reality is that a substantial number of the elderly simply do not have enough income to absorb rapidly rising energy costs. In addition. energy represents a greater portion of the elderlys budget than for younger families. even though older Americans consume less energy. This is because millions of elderly persons are struggling on limited incomes. Practically all of their income must be spent on basic everyday necessitiesenergy. shelter. food. medical care. and transportation. These items typically account for about $4 out of $5 for low- or moderateincome older Americans. The National Retired Teachers Association and the American Association of Retired Persons collectively represent 12.6 million older Americans. The legislative council of the NRTAAARP has developed an energy policy statement that expresses the views of the associations on this subject. Although I do not necessarily agree with every point made in the councils statement.

She initiated and now serves as program coordinator of the highly successful delinquency prevention recreation program. NYPUM (national youth project using minibikes). as part of a national YMCA project. Miss Burwell is the first black woman in the history of the borough to serve on the Council of the borough of Homestead. Pa.

This bill is necessary to extend OPICs programs to China and to permit the State Department to begin negotiations on a bilateral investment guaranty agreement without which OPIC cannot begin such operations in China. The importance of OPICs programs in facilitating the expansion of economic relations between the United States and the developing countries was recognized in Vice President MONDALES announcement during his visit to China in August 1979. that the United States intended to make the OPIC programs available in that country as part of the U.S. policy to support U.S.-PRC trade relations. Subsequently. in October. Senator PELL and I introduced S. 1916 while Congressman BINGHAM introduced companion legislation in the House. H.R. 5252. in order to authorize these OPIC operations in China. There is already considerable interest in OPIC services as to the PRC. both on the part of U.S. investors and PRC officials. I understand from OPIC that eight U.S. companies have formally filed letters of intent to purchase such OPIC insurance. Also.

I understand that Chinese officials are aware of the requirement that a bilateral investment guaranty agreement must first be negotiated before OPIC can operate in the PRC. I further understand that OPIC and State Department officials do not anticipate any undue obstacles to the satisfactory conclusion of these investment guaranty agreement negotiations.

On this issue two things appear clear: the plan is not perfect. but a plan is essential and this is an acceptable one. I listened closely to the debate on whether the Commerce Committee should be discharged of the resolution to disapprove the plan. Certainly. there are questionable aspects to the proposal. For one. the distribution mechanism of sending the ration rights through the mail and redeeming them at banks will involve inefficiencies and delays. However. given the massive nature of the task in a country with over 100 million automobiles. it is not an unreasonable approach. That should be the guidenot whether it is perfect. but whether it is reasonable under the circumstances. And the circumstances under which this plan would be implemented with the final approval of the Congress would have to be dire. A 20percent shortfall in gasoline supplies would be at least four times as large as the Iranian shortfall of last year. It is impossible to forget the utter chaos which that led to in many areas of the country. including my own district. To have that memory. to know of the potential for its repetition in greatly aggravated form. and not to have a rationing plan on the shelf ready to be implemented would be totally irresponsible. In addition. the plan is not forever cast in concrete. it can be modified and improved on the basis of new insights and experience.

I said: I think it is vitally important * . that we begin to develop a groundswell of support for the national development bank concept as the centerpiece in a strategy to revive and to assist communities through the nation. The continuing decline of the countrys industrial base and the persistence of chronically high unemployment levels make such a strategy imperative. Now. 31/2 years later. with the Nation in the throes of a disastrous recession and with unemployment climbing. the need for a National Development Bank is all the greater. My legislation would provide an ongoing loan program to meet the pressing needs of local governments throughout the Nation. \ufffd The proposed bank. financed initially by a $5 billion Federal Government purchase of its stock. would also provide a flexible and muchneeded tool to stimulate the economy. The National Development Bank would be authorized to make direct and guaranteed loans to State and local governments for public works and facilities. In addition. individuals and small and mediumsize businesses unable to secure credit in the marketplace could also apply to the bank for jobcreating loans. Primarily. however. the bank would serve to meet. on a comprehensive basis. the urgent financial needs of local governments throughout the country. Many communities are in dire need of this type of instrument to adequately finance essential local services. Most importantly. this legislation would be aimed. at creating jobs in order to lower our high and completely unacceptable unemployment level. The availability of credit on a continuing basis. as with the National Development Bank. would have an enormously beneficial impact on the jobs market. This bill is one of many that have been introduced over the past few years to create banks or corporations with capital to finance public works activities. support small business and create jobs. Each bill takes a slightly different approach to the problem. but all should be examined now with renewed seriousness to see how we can best put our unemployed back to work on these vital public works projects.

President Carters decision to cancel this magnificent defense system on June 30. 1977. was. in my opinion and the opinion of many distinguished foreign policy and defense analysts. including Mr. John Taylor. editor of Janes All the Worlds Aircraft. the greatest single error of his public career. As a result of that decision. the United States has lost precious time in its desperate race to maintain and secure the strength of the airbreathing leg of Americas defensive strategic Triad. The weakening of the airbreathing leg of the strategic Triad. along with a correlative weakening in our landbased missile system. is disputable. The consequences of that slippage are profound. not only in terms of reducing Americas options in pursuing its just geopolitical interest. but also in terms of the future safety and security of our own citizens. As a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot. a student of military aviation. and as one who has personally piloted the BI. I can attest to the sophistication. the versatility. and the aerodynamic superiority of this remarkable aircraft. For that reason. I have taken every opportunity. since that fateful day in June 1977. to rally my colleagues in this House in attempts to reverse the administrations cancellation of this desperately needed aircraft. What is the future of the Bi? The answer to that question will rest with this Congress. One of the most remarkable statements I have ever read. since I entered this House 32 years ago. can be found in the report on H.R. 6974 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1981: \"The United States faces a window of vulnerability the closure of which. in the absence of a plan presented by the executive branch. requires the initiative of the Congress.\" In other words. the administration. the executive branch. can no longer be trusted to outline the pressing needs of the armed services and the initiative must perforce pass to us.

I think this publicity is _good. but we are not hearing enough about what effect Government regulations are having on the increased cost of living. Recent studies have shown that Government regulations are costing the American consumers over $100 billion a year. Of course. the consumers are paying twice.

The cost. of course. is being passed on to them by business and industry. We can do something about this. There is legislation pending that would require the regulators to submit their regulations to economic impact analysis. It would require the regulators to give a careful analysis to other alternatives to achieve the same goals and also it would submit these regulations to the Congress for a careful review before they go into effect.

It is called isoprinosine and is manufactured by Newport Pharmaceuticals International of Newport Beach. Calif.

Somehow the paperwork on it always gets lost or placed on the bottom on the \"in basket.\" Why? Something is rotten in the very separate state of FDA. Originally. FDA refused to consider a new drug application until a \"double blind\" study had been undertaken. Such a study would require that one group of patients receive the drug and a \"control\" group. without knowing it. would merely receive a placebo. I ask: How can FDA morally condemn children in the control group to die when it is possibly. even likely. that they could be saved? What kind of a government agency would advocate such an amoral practice? Under pressure. apparently FDA has now quietly modified its position to insist only on controlled studies that need not involve a placebo. however. the agency is still dragging its feet.

My bill. which is similar to S. 2923 introduced by Senator CRANSTON. continues the process started by the Congress in the Revenue Act of 1978. At that time. the effective capital gains tax rate was lowered from 49 percent to the current 28 percent. I now feel that it is time for the rate to be lowered further. to an effective rate of 21 percent. Such a move promises to have a significantly beneficial impact on the rates of savings and investment in the United States. Reports show that as a result of the 1978 changes: The amount of new venture capital increased from $39 million in 1977 to $570 million in 1978 and $319 million in 1979. Disbursements by venture capital firms increased from $400 million to $1 billion. and New stock offerings increased fivefold. Mr. Speaker. at a time when the Congress is looking for ways to encourage capital formation and increase the rate of savings and investment in this country. I can think of no better place to start than a capital gains rate reduction. If we really want to create jobs for our future. this is one of the most effective ways to do it.

There will surely be ample testimony to his outstanding record and there is a great deal of evidence of the respect in which he is held by his colleagues. His election as President pro temnore of the Senate for the remainder of this session is proof enough of the high esteem which Senator YOUNG commands in these Chambers. It is also necessary. I believe. to recognize MILTs comnassion. his basic fairness. his thoughtful concern. and his continuing desire to serve the people of North Dakota who sent him time and again to Washington. D.C.. to represent them. These many years that I have known him and his dear wife. Patricia. and that I have been proud to call him a friend. MILT YOUNG has never fallen short of our expectations. We always expected a certain high standard of work and achievement from this fine gentleman. and I daresay we were never disappointed. It Is with deepest regret and heartfelt best wishes that I say goodbye to my friend and colleague of many years. Senator MILT YOUNG.",

There can bi no effective competition while Mexico shrimp fishermen enjoy such an unfai: advantage. Mr. President. my amendment woulc have. simply put. imposed a duty of 2( percent on the value of all shrimp imported into the United Statesshrimr that now enter- our country free from all import duties.

The announcement by Presidentelect Reagan on yesterday that he would appoint our colleague DICK SCHWEIKER to be the new Secretary of HHS is such an occurrence. Senator SCHWEIKER and I came to the Senate on the same day. We have served together both on the Human Relations Committee and on the Appropriations Committee. I have been impressed by the rare. yet invaluable combination of capabilities and attitudes which Senator SCHWEIKER has demonstrated. On the one hand. he is a dedicated humanitarian deeply concerned with equity and social justice. At the same time. he is a responsible fiscal conservative who abhors waste of public funds and who refuses to be pressured by special interests intent upon feathering their own nests. Additionally. DICK SCMIWEIKER has strong managerial capabilities developed from a successful career in the private sector. These will be challenged to the ultmost in his new position but I am confident he fully qualified for the test he will face as head of the department in Government which has the reputation of being virtually unmanageable. Independently. but almost simultaneously. DICK SCHWEIKER and I reached the conclusion to terminate our Senate service at the end of this session. Neither of us could have known at that time what the outcome of the recent election would be. I feel it is extremely fortunate for the country and for the Reagan administration that former Senator SCHWEIKER stands ready and unencumbered at the time his services are so greatly needed in this new and great responsibility.

I have received a number of requests from individuals and groups within the State of Idaho asking that I look into grants made by the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare to an Idahobased nonprofit organization known as SIFMES (Southeast Idaho Family Medical and Educational Services. Inc.). On the basis of these requests. I made several contacts with HEW offices at all levels with little more than token response at best and in many cases. no response at all. Under these circumstances. I decided to assign a researchoriented staff member to investigate the matter fully and the results of his inquiries into these questionable operations are. indeed. shocking and demand your immediate attention and response. The investigation began in earnest on December 14. 1978. when this staff member was dispatched to region X headquarters in Seattle with a Freedom of Information Act letter requesting all of HEWs files relating to SIFMES operations and grants. A sizable amount of information was received which included documents which clearly indicated that SIFMES had recently come under considerable HEW review and that the agency had in fact threatened to cut off funds from the organization. because of serious questions of \"integrity.\" managerial incompetence. waste. and possibly fraud. A letter to SIFMES from HEW dated November 30. 1978. listed specific steps that SIFMES had to take in order to avoid having their grant moneys terminated at the end of 1978. In a telephone conversation on January 16. 1979. my office was informed that SIFMES had still not met the guidelines set by HEW. but that the deadline had been extended in order to allow SIFMES time to draw up a new contract. Then in a letter to my office dated January 26. 1979. HEW claimed that problems identified in the areas of budget. contracts. verification of payment. and clarification of medical services rendered had been rectified by SIFMES and that all areas of concern are now considered acceptable by HEW. It is obvious that HEW considers this case closed. but let me assure you that it is not.

Now. barely more than 30 years since Cardinal Mindszentys sentencing. and 5 years since his removal by Pope Paul VI as Primate of Hungary. the situation confronting the church in Hungary is the same as it was in 1949. Neither the church nor the people of Hungary are free from the heavyhanded state intrusion in their affairs. In fact. according to Cardinal Mindszentys statement in February of 1974. the dioceses of Hungary are governed by a church administration created and controlled by the Communist regime. On this. the 13th anniversary. several Hungarian organizations in the United States. such as the Hungarian Freedom Fighters Federation and the President of the Hungarian Catholic Priests Association. have issued statements in respect of the memory of Cardinal Mindszenty. At the head of those groups participating in the anniversary commemoration is the Coordinating Committee of Hungarian Organizations in North America. chaired by Jozsef Kovago. He and Executive Secretary Istvan B. Gereben. have prepared a statement which I would like to insert strongly commend it to my colleagues. The text follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently the New York Sunday Times ran an interesting article discussing perhaps the most important demographic fact for the present and futureAmerica as a people is growing older. The article written by Steven Roberts parallels much of what the Subcommittee on Human Services of the House Select Committee on Aging has been researching In its series of hearings on the future of aging. As chairman of the subcommittee I can assure my colleagues that future policy in this Nation will have to be more receptive to a growing elderly population. My subcommittee in its work has held five hearings on all aspects of the political. social. and economic implication of an aging society with the last hearings conducted in California to assess the impact of proposition 13 on services to the elderly. Presently a report is being written which will not only summarize the main points of the hearings. but will offer a number of policy recommendations for the future. The distinction between the young old and old old offered by Mr. Roberts is extremely important to understanding the future of aging. While the overall over 65 population is expected to increase dramatically during the balance of this century. the fastest growing group will be the 75 and over group. the socalled frail elderly who will demand a great deal of the future health and social service dollar. Therefore. it is essential that we begin to plan to develop more comprehensive services for this element. In addition we should provide for more realistic service programs for the remaining elderly population so we are not giving what is not needed. The issues presented in this article are real and deserve very close attention. The House Select Committee on Aging will continue to focus its attention on this important phenomenon and the upcoming report on the future of aging will present additional consideration of this matter.

Mark served Californias 34th Congressional District for 4 years. Both of us were elected to Congress in 1974. Prior to his election to Congress he served as councilman and mayor of the city of Lakewood. He also taught school for 25 years and was a political science professor at Long Beach City College when he was elected to Congress. Marks academic achievements are best exemplified by the John Hay Fellowship he won in 1961. The fellowship enabled him to study advanced work in economics and political science at Yale University. In Congress Mark established himself as a true friend of American working men and women. His support for labor issues. which concern the average citizen. was consistently displayed by his voting record. Marks support for labor was unbending. even in the face of criticism from local forces who view the rights of working Americans as secondary to their peculiar interpretation of what is good for America and society. Mr. Speaker. Mark Hannaford is truly deserving of the honor bestowed upon him by the UAWs Local 148.

It was enabling legislation. putting into action onehalf of the eighth clause of section 8 of article I of our Constitution. The second half came a month later. when the first Copyright Act became law. Both of these laws were enacted at a time when our struggling young Nation needed a surge of new technology to help it catch up with the rest of the world. with stronger nations already well established. The inspired men who drafted our Constitution knew that the only hope of achieving this kind of speed lay in the creative minds of our own authors and inventors. and empowered Congress to give special inducements to them. Our need for new technology. to help us compete with the rest of the world. is very urgent in the United States of America today. as I believe we all realize. Now as in 1787 we must look to our American inventors to supply that need. so it is necessary and proper that we should make an earnest inquiry of the inventors themselves. to learn what it is they are looking to the U.S. Govemnment to supply. to speed their work in meeting the technology challenge of today and the years ahead. It happens that I have in my district the headquarters of a large and growing organization of inventors. named Inventors Workshop International. the IWI.

When the President has asked Americans to hold their wage and price increases to a paltry 7 percent a year and when Congress is considering cutting many important social programs or holding them at no growth levels. I find it hard to believe that the American people will sympathize with the Senators complaints about the impact of inflation on their standards of living. The pay raise granted in 1977 amounted to an 18 percent pay increase. Retaining the existing ceiling of $25.000 in outside income. instead of the proposed $8.625 limit. raises this percentage figure far higher. Recently. the Los Angeles Times reviewed the Senates action in an incisive editorial. which I would like to insert for the benefits of my colleagues. I share the editors view that the Senate acted inappropriately both in removing the outside income limitation and in acting without so much as a rollcall vote on the subject.

During his remarkable career. Mr. Walson has proved that an energetic person can. through hard work and imagination. make a mark for himself in a way that benefits countless other people. In his chosen field of communication. Mr. Walson has done just that. and March 2 was declared John Walson Day in Lehigh County in honor of his 30year career. Mr. Walson. a native of Forrest City. Pa.. combined his education in the field of engineering with a longtime interest in electricity to build a career that started with electrical appliances and eventually led to a realization of the problems faced by communities surrounded by mountains and unable to receive television signals. His early efforts in Mahony City. Pa. to demonstrate television receivers by picking up signals from Philadelphia stations on a mountaintop antenna and running the signals by wire to his warehouse in the valley below led to a realization of the vast potential for using cables to relay television signals that had previously been inaccessible. By adding new antennas and boosters. and by stringing wire to individual homes. Mr. Walson was able to create the Nations first cable TV system in 1948. From that beginning. Mr. Walson worked tirelessly to expand the cable TV concept. eventually building the largest individually owned cable TV system in the Nation. operating in 150 communities. During the past 30 years Mr. Walson has served as director of the National Cable Television Association. the Pennsylvania Cable Television Association and numerous civic organizations. Mr. Speaker. the career of John Walson is cause for great pride on the part of the Lehigh Valley. I would like to repeat my congratulations to Mr. Walson for his impressive accomplishments.

I strongly urge my colleagues to approve UP amendment No. 1495. which is the language of Senate Joint Resolution 191. to provide supplemental appropriations for the ExportImport Bank of the United States. Eximbank has run out of lending authority. and our exporters. our businesses and labor. indeed our whole economy will suffer as a result. We must keep this institution in business by providing additional funding if we are to enable our exporters to compete in the international marketplace. Eximbank has been a success story in our Nations export effort and has contributed to improvements in our domestic economic health. In fiscal year 1979. the Banks program supported over $13 billion in U.S. export sales. which. in turn. generated employment for over 550.000 American workers. By helping build and maintain employment. the Bank improved the welfare of workers in our economy and helped generate increased tax receipts. Moreover. Eximbank is a profitmaking operation that pays dividends to the U.S. Treasury out of its earnings. Since its establishment in 1945. the Bank has paid over $1 billion to the Treasury. We should view the Bank not as a drain on our economy but as a vital contributor to our Nations economic strength which deserves our active support. This joint resolution would help put Eximbank back in business for fiscal year 1980 and would help it remain active in the future. While the resolution would also increase budget outlays by over $540 million in fiscal year 1981. we can make room in the budget for the Bank to expand its good work. Earlier this year. I submitted a number of proposals to the Budget Committee which would more than compensate for increased Eximbank authority. Through grant consolidation and reductions in Government regulation. travel and filmmaking. we could save 10 times the amount of additional funding required under this resolution. We must place increased Eximbank authority high on our list of national priorities. We must support our exporters efforts to secure lucrative contracts overseas which will. in turn. help improve our economy at home.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the expanded use of alcohol fuel will benefit all Americans by stretching our supply of motor fuels and reducing our dangerous and excessive dependence on foreign oil. In addition to providing a new source of income. alcohol fuels offer the farmer a stable. renewable supply of energy. In a larger sense. alcohol fuels bear the promise of energy selfsufficiency for rural America. It does not take a genius to recognize the elementary logic of refining raw agricultural materials into precious fuel and enriched feed. Raising the production process to a new and higher level of economic activity means jobs. wealth. and an increased standard of living for all. Unfortunately. simply logic and plain commonsense do not always carry a lot of weight around here. One Member of the Senate who has never had any difficulty in recognizing these simple truths about the enormou potential of alcohol fuels is GEORGE MCGOVERN. It has been my privilege to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator McGOVERN on the Agriculture Committee and battle for the interests of the family farmer who has such a significant contribution to make in this area. One of the most appealing aspects of alcohol fuels is that there are distinct economic advantages to smallscale. on farm operations. The cost of transporting raw materials and the mechanics of utilizing the protein byproducts produce certain diseconomies of scale which favor the small farm and community scale plant. There is a viable place in our future energy universe for alcohol fuel producers of many different sizes. I feel strongly. however. that the smallscale plant has a central role to play in bringing the farmer real energy selfsufficiency. and in serving as a building block and feeder to largesized alcohol fuel plants. At this point. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a guest column authored by Senator MCGOVERN which recently appeared in Rural America. This lucid article discusses the grassroots contribution alcohol fuels can make toward revitalizing our rural communities and liberating our farmers from their hopeless dependence on powerful outside groups to meet their energy needs. I commend this article to all of my cclleagues.",

This week we have the good fortune to be able to greet Father Edicio dela Torre. a Catholic priest from the Philippines who was released from prison just this April. after spending more than 5 years in prison on charges of conspiring to commit rebellion and possession of subversive materials. He was never tried on any charges and he actually served more time in prison without a trial than he would have had he been sentenced to the minimum sentences to which he would have been subject.

The Senator undoubtedly knows that people who were buying oil from Saudi Arabia did very well. because Saudi Arabia was selling their oil at about $18 a barrel. while other people were selling oil for maybe $10 a barrel more than that. If one was fortunate enough to buy his oil from the Saudis. he had a builtin profit of about $10 a barrel. When they brought it in the United States. it is my understanding. under our laws and our price controls. the consumer was getting the benefit of it here. But when they sold oil bought in Saudi Arabia by an American company in Western Europe. for example. they would make whatever profit they could. So they made a lot of profit. but that did not cost the American consumer anything. it did not cost the American taxpayer anything. As a matter of fact. it should result in perhaps more taxes being paid to this Government because dividends came back in and they paid taxes on that. But the American producer. at least. the American taxpayer. and the American consumer had nothing to worry about. But to read the report the way it came out. one would think that he is being ripped off. to use a colloquial term. because someone made a lot of money picking up some oil in Saudi Arabia. selling it in Western Germany.

It has become a dirty word. I talked to a business group last night in New York and castigated it for not making more money and not being proud of the fact that they make a profit. Profit is the only reason we go into business. and we try to make all we can because there are years when we do not make any. I remember in my business. I went for 5 years and did nothing but lose money. But. by golly. I stayed in business. But to get back to this question of what is a windfall profit. I do not like the term because the President. at the same time he invented this term. did not tell us what he meant. As I say. we will find most of our major oil companies receiving more income from nonoil than from oil. I remember 2 years ago when I was at the island in the gulf off Iran. I saw 56 tankers lined up before 13 different loading docks to receive all the way from 50.000 tons to 250.000 tons of fuel. served by two lines coming from the mainland. 70 inchesthat is just about 2 inches shorter than I amfull of oil all the time. The surprising thing to me was that I did not see Esso. I did not see Sohio. I did not see any of the socalled big oil companies. I saw American oil companies. so help me God. I never heard of before. little companies. Now. these are the companies that furnish most of the oil that this country uses for energy purposes. Yet we are hearing nothing but the big companies. and we are trying to shoot them down. putting tax on them they cannot hear. I recall reading about the same time a headline which said that X oil company has a 100percent increase in profit. The Washington Post had that much increase in profit. Now.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to call the Senates attention to recent hearings held by the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on the problem of \"hurryup spending\" in the Federal Governmentthe lastminute rush by Federal agencies to obligate their funds at the close of a fiscal year. Late last summer. at the request of Senator COHEN. the minority staff of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management began an investigation of the phenomenon of \"hurryup spending.\" Based on the results of this study. Senator COHEN. with the cooperation of Senator CARL LEVIN. the subcommittee chairman. scheduled hearings to explore. for the public record. the origins of the disturbing yearend spending problem. Witnesses from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. and the Department of Commerce told how lack of planning and. sometimes. disregard for the public interest have resulted in inefficiencies in yearend purchases. Regrettably these practices have continued as recently as September 1979. the last month of the fiscal year that just ended. Although representatives of the Office of Management and Budget. also present at the hearing. claimed that the amount of waste can be exaggerated. they promised to examine more closely the planning tools and controls that are available to insure that Government funds are spent in a wise and prudent manner. A system already in operation at EPA has produced savings in the last fiscal year of $1 million in staff costs alone. These hearings by the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee coincided with the same concern being addressed in the congressional budget process. At my suggestion the conference report on the second concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1980 contains a strong statement urging both the Congress and the President to provide limitations in fiscal year 1981 spending legislation or alternative legislative remedies to curtail wasteful endofyear obligation of funds. A copy of that statement by the budget conference is attached for inclusion in the sion of my comments. I applaud Senator COHEN and his staff for taking a serious and thorough look at the \"hurryup spending\" dilemma. Mr. President. I submit for the RECORD Senator COHENS opening remarks on the hearing and articles which appeared in the Washington Post. the New York Times. and U.S. News and World Report concerning the hearing.",

The present limit is $879 billion. of which $479 billion is the expiring temporary limit. After Monday. the permanent debt limit of $400 billion will be the only debt limit in effect. if this resolution is not enacted in time. House Joint Resolution 569 provides a $525 billion temporary debt limit through February 28. 1981. which will increase the total limit to $925 billion through that period. This amount was specified in the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1981 as an amount sufficient up to that intermediate date in the fiscal year. In midMay. the Committee on Finance agreed that an appropriate intermediate point debt limit would be $905 billion. Since then. Congress has disapproved of the oil import fee and its $10 billion in revenue. and the conference committee on the budget resolution made other changes affecting the budget surplus and financial assumptions. As a result. $925 billion now is the appropriate debt limit through next February. and the amount is consistent with the budgetary. financial. and economic assumptions embodied in the budget resolution. The Senate should approve this resolution today without amendment. There is no threat of imminent insolvency if the resolution is not passed today. as has been the case so often with recent debt limit bills. By passing the debt limit today. the Senate will permit the Treasury to maintain its routine financial schedules that involve such things as an announcement later this week about the regular Monday auction of Treasury bills. That announcement could not be made unconditionally in the absence of this legislation because the Treasury would not know when it would be able to deliver the debt obligations. The debt limit increase is needed before any rollover or new debt is issued after Monday. June 30. I urge the Senate to approve ths legislation. without amendment. today.",

I also serve on the Forestry Subcommittee. and I can say that this legislation is long overdue. \ufffd I would like to add to my remarks in support of the reforestation provisions contained in the Boat Safety and Facilities Act. By providing through tax credits an incentive to replant forest lands. Congress has put in motion events for which our children and grandchildren will be grateful. Recent surveys reflect that in the next few decades the demand for wood in this country will double. Those same studies show that the share of that demand for timber grown in our southern States will be disproportionately high because forests can be replaced in the South much quicker due to a faster growth capability. Therefore. it is absolutely imperative if we are to have the wood products we need. that the harvested timberlands be replanted. Unfortunately. in the past they have not been adequately replanted. This is particularly true with nonindustrial. private timberlands as opposed to industry owned lands or publicly owned lands. In my State of Arkansas and in the South. in general. over 60 percent of the timberlands are owned by private individuals. When many of these landowners harvest trees from their lands they do not replant. The reason is simple. There is no economic incentive for them to do so. If such an individual has to wait 30 or 40 years to recoup the expense of replanting and other sound forestry practices. he simply will not do so. In Arkansas only 1 acre of private nonindustrial timberland is being seeded for every 20 acres harvested. while for industry owned land. 1.1 acres are replanted for every 1 acre harvested. In the South there are over 1 million acres of timberland every year that are harvested and not properly replanted. Mr. Speaker. the provisions of this bill which encourage reforestation will address this problem and hopefully reverse the existing trend.",

It is these kinds of tax incentives that will bring about much of the environmental changes which we all know are needed.

I am especially enthusiastic about title I of this bill. the continuation of the boating safety program. Over the last year. I have heard from a number of boaters. both groups and individuals. urging me to support and promote this legislation. But more importantly perhaps. I have heard for a much longer period of time very favorable comments about this program from boaters when there was no legislation pending. I think those kind of unsolicited positive comments are testimony to the success of this safety program. While it is not hard to compile statistics on the number of lives lost through boating accidents. it is impossible to calculate the lives saved by this program. But there is no one in the boating community who doubts that the number of lives saved would be high over the 20 years of Federal assistance in education and enforcement in boating safety. With the continued growth in recreational boating in this country. the need for this program grows. rather than diminishes. The funds for this program come from the taxes paid on fuel used by motorboats. Federal program of holding money collected in trust funds. in effect rebating taxes collected through a program to benefit those who paid the taxes. which have such undisputably worthwhile results. With all of the controversial legislation we must consider. with all of the decisions we must make when the results are less than guaranteed. it is indeed rewarding to continue a program in which the results are so clear cut and valuable.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Boating Safety Act conference report. This bill. like the prior grant program. is crucial for the safety of the boating public. Under the previous grant program. there was a reduction of more than 50 percent of boatingrelated fatalities. In 1972. there were 20.2 fatalities per 100.000 boats. In 1978. 6 years after enactment of the program. there were 9.4 fatalities per 100.000 boats. There was a decrease in the number of accidents. despite the fact that there was a tremendous increase in the number of boats owned and used in the Nations waters. This conference report represents our continuing commitment to the improvement of boating safety. Every State and district will gain the benefits of improved safety in their waters. I urge all Members to join together and support this measure.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 4310. the Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1980. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the boating safety bill. I especially want to recognize the leadership of my friend and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation. Mr. BIAGGI. in guiding this bill through the legislative process. My primary interest in this legislation Is the continuation of Federal support for a boating safety program that has proved to be a model of FederalState cooperation. The boating safety programs which most States have established with assistance from the Federal Government have paid off in terms of lives saved. Boatingrelated fatalities have actually declined. in spite of the fact that the number of registered boats has dramatically increased. Few programs can claim such clearcut results. H.R. 4310 as approved by the House also contained a $20 million authorization to initiate a joint FederalState boating facilities improvement program. The Senate chose to delete this provision. but in conference it was restored to an annual authorization of $10 million. While I believe we must move slowly In establishing any new Federal programs. I believe this is a modest and appropriate compromise which recognizes the millions of dollars that the boating public contributes to the land and water conservation fund each year through the motorboat fuels tax. Creation of a safety and facilities fund will more directly benefit the user group which bears the brunt of this tax. Let me also note that I contributed several amendments in committee which have been retained in the conference report. These amendments are intended to minimize duplication with expenditures from the land and water conservation fund. to assure consistency with State coastal zone management programs. and to prevent States from using Federal funds from one source as their matching fund contribution to meet the requirements of the Boating Safety Act. When the Senate acted on our boating safety bill. they attached an amendment concerning financial incentives for reforestation efforts on private and national forests. While this matter is not a concern of the Merchant Marine Committee. the health and productivity of our Nations forests is a matter which concerns us all. and I support the Senates efforts in this regard. Mr. Speaker. I support the conference report on H.R. 4310. and urge its adoption by my colleagues.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to address the attention of the gentleman. chairman of the conferees on the part of the House.. One of the provisions added by the Senate amendment to the bill. H.R. 4310. included in the conference report. is unrelated to the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 and affects a matter under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture. Section 303 of the conference report provides for the establishment of a reforestation trust fund and authorizes for each of the 5 fiscal years beginning October 1. 1980 amounts to be appropriated for reforestation and other treatment of acreage in the national forests. The amounts are to be devoted to reforestation and other treatment as set forth in a report transmitted by the Secretary of Agriculture to Congress under section 3(d) (2) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. as amended. Mr. Speaker. that legislation originated with the House Committee on Agriculture and amendments to that legislation likewise have originated with the Agriculture Committee. While I am in support of the provision in question. I wish to point out that under the rules of the House. the use of funds for these purposes affects matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture. Rule X. clause l(a) provides the Agriculture Committee with jurisdiction over forestry in general. I wish to establish a record today that the action being taken on the conference report does not in any way prejudice the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture over the matter in section 303 of the conference report and that further the Agriculture Committee would continue to have jurisdiction regarding any amendments that may be made in the future to this section. as provided in the rules of the House. The provisions of the conference agreement authorizing appropriations for reforestation programs properly lie within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture. Unfortunately. the Committee on Agriculture was not represented on the conference committee. I appreciate the courtesy of the gentleman from Washington in interposing no objections to the consideration of this conference reoort and I want to assure him and the other Members of the House that I recognize the legitimate jurisdictional interest of his committee over this issue.*",

Congress must live up to its commitment to provide sufficient funding for this vital program. At a time when imports have contributed to putting hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. Congress must not tamper with funding for a program designed to assist those who are now feeling the consequences of trade liberalization. Trade adjustment assistance is a program of vital importance to these workIng men and women. It provides them with temporary help in the form of cash payments. retraining. job search and relocation assistance. In my State of Ohio. this program has helped about 70.000 workers. Trade adjustment assistance has been an important part of our Nations trading policies since the early 1960s. The Government knew then that efforts to liberalize trade with foreign nations would translate into importcaused injury for some domestic industries. That is why Congress in 1962and in 1974promised American workers the opportunity to receive relief because of injury and not just limit them to seeking relief from injury. But. Mr. President. the funding for this important program is about to run out. The Department of Labor estimates that $1.1 billion in additional money is needed to meet current. obligations for fiscal year 1980. and that $400 million in additional funds will be required in fiscal year 1981. As I understand it. the House budget resolution assumes this increase for trade adjustment assistance. The Senate must make certain that this increase remains. We cannot pull the rug out from under thousands of workers in such mainstream U.S. industries as auto. steel. and textiles who are counting on trade adjustment assistance to help cushion the blows that they and their industries have sustained in recent years. Congress promised these workers this assistance back in 1974 when it set up the trade adjustment program. Now is certainly no time to renege on that commitment.",

I agree with what the Senator from Pennsylvania is attempting. I would be prepared. and I think the appropriate committees ought to get at the question of depreciation. I agree with the Senator that it may very well be. under the circumstances. too expensive on a shortterm basis in the next 5 years to adopt 1053 across the board. because the static analysis of that cost is some $49 billion 5 years out. The dynamic analysis is about $10 billion a year 5 years out. But I think we need to address exactly the question the Senator from Pennsylvania is raising and we need to address it fast. specifically to steel and auto industries. because that circumstance is serious. We may very well. in the next 3 or 4 years. see the exportation of two major basic industries if we do not do something soon.

In a longer opening statement I would have more explicitly outlined my intent that automobile manufacturers should have the option of using the present system for the 3year write off of special tools or the 1053 method. That is the simple and easy answer to the Senators objection. Let us not sabotage the whole program because of some technicality. Let us simply give the company the option of taking the faster system. It is true they now have a 3year write off option. but it is only on 50 percent of their assets. So 1053 is still a very viable thing. The auto companies need $50 billion worth of capital and they are not going to get in from special tool 3year writeoffs. Let us not shoot this proposal down because we misunderstood what it would do. The issue is clear. It is whether we are going to move ahead on the issue of more rapid depreciation. I just talked to one of the Senators who came back from England. He just saw a new steel plant. The owners wrote it off in 1 year. In just 1 year they wrote it off. That is the kind of competition we are up against. It is no wonder we are getting creamed in the markets abroad. no wonder the automobiles are being made in Japan. no wonder steel is coming in from Western Europe and Canada. when you can write something off in 1 year.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. they have made some dramatic improvements in the modernizing of their industry in Canada. There are a number of proposals respecting depreciation that are pending now. Congressman ULLMAN has one. There are three or four proposals. His is different from the 1053. I do not want to recite the dates. We have introduced 1053 on this side. I have a proposal I will be introducing for a 3year straightline depreciation. I do not think this will solve the problem for steel and auto. although it may help. I think that circumstances Is so desperate that it needs special attention. I would be prepared on the floor of the Senate to support a 2year writeoff. a 1year writeoff. on any machinery equipment designed for building the auto industry. for the construction of fuel efficient automobiles. to meet a certain standard. and give them any writeoff they want. In the long pull. it will not cost the taxpayer anything. because it comes out of the business. If they are profitable. then they are going to pay taxes and do not have anything to deduct once they have written it off. But I am concerned that we are coming in with a very significant. very dramatic change in the depreciation schedule. which may not be targeted to do as much good for auto and steel as we ought to be doing.

As chairman of that subcommittee on the Finance Committee. he indicates his intention to try to push ahead on some kind of provision that will allow capital recovery to take place faster and get us back more in a competitive position with other industrial nations. Could one infer from what the Senator said that we might see some action this year? In other words. is there a plan at this time either to hold hearings or begin a serious effort to see what we can do? If so. I think that would be a very important signal to come out of here this evening. I. for one. would like to participate constructively with the Senator as chairman of that effort to see what we can determine here.",

I wonder if it would be possible to have a hearing at an appropriate time. not too far down the track. with regard to that particular industry?

As the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. I will be happy to start hearings as soon as we can on the 1053 across the board. or some other way. to accelerate depreciation. I am not certain the auto industry is really helped much by that because I understand the bulk of the auto depreciation comes from special tools that already have a 3year depreciation. If we do not give this 1053 to other companies. we will not help capital formation in the very companies thai want to use steel products. and that ma3 not be an answer.

We could open up the questions raised by the Senator from Washington. and others. and maybe other ideas than the 1053 depreciation. But barring that. I will support the Senator from Pennsylvania.

Almost every leading economist in America has proposed this idea. When William Miller was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. he proposed and supported 1053 before congressional committees. The majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate have joind as cosponsors of 1053. Every Member on this side of the aisle has joined in cosponsoring 1053. The problem has not been the Congress. The problem has been the President. The fact of the matter is that it is a very difficult matter. I think probably impossible. to pass a tax law without Presidential approval and support.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the world food problems become more and more intense. the utilization of the worlds fishery products is becoming more and more important. The world is beginning to fully appreciate the necessity of seafood in their diet. World trade in fishery products continued to show impressive gains in 1978. The United States also showed impressive increases in these world trade statistics. The United States has risen to second place. behind Canada. in the world exporting market of fishery products. These U.S. exports have vastly contributed to the fact that Japan is now the leading importer of fishery products. Japan imports great quantities of fishery products from the United States. and more specifically. the State of Alaska. This is due to the fact that Alaska is the largest producer of seafood products in the country. Alaskas success can be directly attributed to the passage of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. and the enforcement of the 200mile limit. The fishing industry in Alaska is alive and well. However. at this point. there are many other species that should be utilized for the worlds diet. What is now necessary are sound management proposals for the harvesting and marketing of these species. As the world becomes more in tune with the hunger problem. the producing of such species is imperative. With the establishment of seafood products in the worlds diet and with sound management proposals for underutilized species. Alaska and the rest of the United States can continue to excel in the worlds fishery products markets. The United States must be made aware of the fishery product potential that lies within its borders. It must realize the worth of that potential. and then it must manage and produce that potential in an intelligent and sound manner.*",

First it was the Department of Education. an agency which will replace parents and local authorities with Washington bureaucrats and social engineers from the NEA mold. Then it was the IRS proposal to deny taxexempt status to private schools throughout the country. Fortunately. many of us in Congress concerned about this blatant attack were able to block it. Unfortunately. we had no such luck with the Department of Education. Now the President has insulted the concept of the family once more with a proposal which would create an Office of Families within HEW. Apparently. Mr. Carter does not find parents capable of coping with the rigors of family life. His solution. of course. is to bring the Federal Government into the home. This Is preposterous.

It was 10 years ago today that WYSU began to offer residents of northeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania a dramatic alternative to the programing available on commercial radio stations in that area. For the first time. a local station began offering shows featuring symphony music. national public affairs. and even book reviews. Since its beginning 10 years ago. WYSU has provided the residents in its listening area with cultural programing that is unequaled. Truly. WYSU has been a boon to the listeners in the 19th Congressional District. Special credit for WYSUs success must go to: Dr. John Coffelt. president of Youngstown State University. Stephen Grcevich. director of telecommunications at YSU. and Donald Elser. chairman of the YSU speech and drama department at YSU when WYSU first went on the air. I take this opportunity.

I know those three and the staff would be the first to point out that they could not have made WYSU successful without the help of many others. So. I also salute the YSU board of trustees and the community advisory committee for their tireless efforts to make WYSU the tremendous station it is today. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I wish WYSU good luck and Godspeed in whatever the future may bring.

In that spirit I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one family who is extremely deserving of recognition for their abiding concern for needy children During the past 25 years. Maurice Kraines and his family have built Kraco Enterprises into one of the Nations largest manufacturers of autosound equipment and automotive accessories. with annual sales exceeding $100 million and employing more than 500 people at their facility at Compton. Calif. Throughout the growth of his business. Kraines and his sons Larry and Steve. who serve as the company president and vice president. respectively. have gone to great lengths to lend a hand to organizations dedicated to children in need of assistance. Following the tragic kidnapping of 26 schoolchildren and their bus driver in Chowchilla. Calif.. the Kraines family donated 24 CB radios and antennas to the Chowchilla school district to help provide protection for the children through easier communication on buses in the future. The Kraines have also been involved with the education of the physically handicapped through their donations of CB equipment to Widney High School in Los Angeles. The school officials use the equipment to help alleviate nuero and physical related speech handicaps among young people. The Kraines are hoping that their contribution will evolve into a nationwide program designed to benefit the speech handicapped. Furthermore. earlier this year. a plea was made by Headstart officials in Ross County. Ohio. to the Kraines to donate whatever CB equipment they could spare to install in the Headstart vans. The Kraines immediately responded by supplying enough complete CB equipment to cover all seven vans of the Ross County Headstart program. I would like to express my own personal thanks to the Kraines for their generous deeds and I hope that their actions will serve as an example for all of us in commemorating this. the Year of the Child.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing today a bill to provide that adjustments in the rates of pay for Members of Congress shall be considered separately from the adjustments for other Federal employees and judges. The bill also provides that adjustments in Members pay shall take effect at the beginning of the Congress after the one in which they are approved. after an election has taken place. By providing separate procedures for pay adjustments for Members of Congress and for other employees. the bill makes it possible for Members to turn down or reduce a pay adjustment for themselves while allowing the employees to get the full adjustment. In addition. the effective date of any adjustment for Members would be deferred until after the next election. This would allow an opportunity for the Members constituents to vote on his record. including his stand on pay issues. before he could get the new rate of pay. I think that both the separation and the deferral are needed changes in the pay adjustment procedure. Because the pay rates for high Government officials have been linked to the rates for Members of Congress. the officials have been denied pay increases every time that Members have decided against raises for themselves. The people who make the highest level decisions in our Government have had only two pay adjustments since 1969. a period that has seen high inflation and annual raises for the majority of Federal workers. A situation like this is not conducive to effective government. My proposal. by breaking the pay linkage. offers a way out of this problem. The provisions of my bill affect both of the pay adjustment proceduresthe quadriennial adjustment in base pay and the annual adjustment for comparability.",

I do not understand this change of position. I say to the chairman. and I think this body ought to see that they are consistent on it and they ought to vote for the continued exemption. Another category exempted was newly produced oiloil produced from properties not drilled in 1978. It seems to me. Mr. President. that any new oil we can produce in this country at world market prices is a windfall not for the producer. but for the United States of America. The money we would spend for a barrel of newly produced American oil does not go into the OPEC coffers. it remains in this country. It pays wages in this country. it pays dividends in this country. it contributes to our economic wellbeing. The single most effective way to encourage domestic production in America is to pay world prices for the productthe socalled replacement price. Any tax on newly found oil is a disincentive to production. We are debating something called the windfall profit tax. \"Windfall\" by any definition is an unexpected piece of good fortune. The wind comes along. blows the fruit off the tree. and all of a sudden. you get to harvest it with much less time and effort. There are thousands of wells in this country that have been producing oil for years. that have been making a profit for years under controlled prices. while world prices have gone through the roof because OPEC has decreed it. With the decontrol of domestic prices. the value of the product will increase enormously and I concede that there is an element of windfall involved. You have a going profitable enterprise that stands to benefit excessively from OPEC control of the world market. But the concept of windfall profit simply does not apply to newly discovered oil. There is a situation down there in Louisiana. where they are drilling to incredible depths today. I ask the Senator from Louisiana how deep some of the wells are.",

The $42 million dry hole the Senator from Alaska spoke of was somewhat more spectacular than a small company in Wyoming with a $27 million dry hole. That is a lot of money in terms of windfall loss. One of the effects of all this. is that the small producers of the country that take those kinds of risks and fail get absorbed by bigger companies who can finance their production equipment and go on with their leases. By adding further disincentives through this tax we are concentrating the production capability of the country in the hands of the very people who we say do not handle it correctly. I share the Senators frustration about not having any luck where the administration now comes in. having arrived at somebodys symbol. They are no longer interested in production. they are interested in achieving revenue. windfall to the Treasury. They are not interested in achieving what the country needs in terms of energy. I would not mind losing a minimum tax debate if we could debate it on the terms the Senator is trying to do here. in terms of a commonsense tradeoff between billions of dollars in tax or millions of barrels of production.

We extract the oil from that well. the pressure subsides. we have to then pump the oil out. The next thing. we come along and do water flooding. That is a more expensive process. Finally. we go to the tertiary recovery. the exotic chemicals. and some things that call for extraordinary investments. I know of one tertiary recovery process they are talking about putting in now where they will make a major capital investment of over $400 million and not start recovery for 2 or 3 years. It does not make sense to put a disincentive on that. to try to turn them off on that. put a tax on them for trying to do that.",

But if. on the other hand. we believe. as I do and I believe the Senator from Texas does. that there are frontiers to explore and there are barrels of oil to produce that we cannot get by conventional means. then it really makes absolutely no sense to impose a disincentive on them to the extent that it still becomes more attractive to perpetuate our drastic and severe dependence on unstable supplies overseas. We either ought not have any facts. as the committees position was on these barrels of oil. or we ought to throw in the towel. that we have found all there is. we know where it all is. and it is in the national interest that the Government take it all. because only then will we be able to parcel it out in total social justice.

    "speech": "I am familiar with the problem which has just been described by the Senator from Wisconsin. During the multilateral trade negotiations which were recently concluded. the duties on some 500 selected items were converted from a specific or compound rate of duty to ad valorem rates. It is my understanding that these conversions were not intended to significantly increase the amount of duty collected by the U.S. Customs Service. However. in the case of the ad valorem duty on unwrought lead which is scheduled to go into effect January 1. 1980. the conversion represents a substantial increase in the amount of duty that will be collected. This is because the price of lead has more than doubled within the last year. In fact. quoted New York spot prices indicate that in August of 1978 lead was selling for approximately 33 cents a pound whereas in September of 1979 lead was selling from between 63 cents and 67 cents a pound. This dramatic increase in the world price of lead means that duties collected on an ad valorem basis will be significantly higher than they otherwise would have been under the current specific rate. I would hope the Senator from Wisconsin could agree that this windfall tax bill is not the proper place for the amendment he intends to propose. It is my understanding that similar legislation has been or will soon be introduced in the House of Representatives. The Senate Finance Committee will be conducting hearings on tariff and trade bills next year. and I assure Senator NELSON that the committee will give his proposal expeditious consideration at that time.",

The first is that it relates to matters other than energy. in that it directs a study with regard to tax credits. Nowhere in the proposal before us. Mr. Chairman. do we find anything relating to tax credits in the legislation. Now. without denegrating the able author of the proposal. and I am sure the gentleman is very sincere in this matter. there is another defect yet also in the amendment now pending. I would point out that the Secretary of Energy. according to the language of the amendment in paragraph (b) is directed to conduct a study to assess various proposals for Federal tax credits for residential coal heating equipment as contained in the legislation in the Congress. I now quote: \"During the 96th session.\" Now. I assume that refers to the 96th Congress. The 96th Congress will be for this fiscal year. plus portions of the succeeding fiscal year. I would observe that if the study includes matters which were introduced during the 96th Congress. It will include matters which were introduced after the conclusion of the fiscal year in which we find ourselves and after the conclusion of the period covered by the authorization proposal. The amendment further in its last three lines says as follows: Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.... That mandates actions by the Secretary of Energy 1 year after the date of enactment of this statute. which would be whatever date it might be. but it would be 1 year after at least probably the conclusion of the fiscal year in question. Again I recall to the Chair the fact that the proposal before us is a 1year authorization bill and that this mandates actions by the Secretary well after the conclusion of the period covered in the 1year authorization bill which is before the committee.

The Secretary shall report his findings not later than 1 year after enactment. The possibility that the study might not be completed within the fiscal year 1980 does not seem to the Chair to be crucial in this case. since the study is only to be funded by fiscal year 1980 funds and since other activities of the Department of Energy funded by the bill for fiscal year 1980 are ongoing in nature and could also involve continued participation beyond September 30. 1980. A more central question is the issue of the tax study. While ordinarily revenue matters are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means and would not be germane to a bill reported by another committee. in the present case the Department of Energy is mandated by its organic statute (Public Law 9591) to annually study and recommend changes in all laws and regulations needed to encourage more conservation of energy. The Chair would also observe that title III. which the committee has already dealt with. does address the issue of energy conservation programs in the Department. As a new title. the amendment imposes upon the Secretary of Energy for fiscal year 1980 a more specific responsibility to study energy conservation consequences of certain tax proposals than those currently required by law. but nevertheless a responsibility within the ambit of the Secretarys existing authority and confined to the fiscal year covered by the titles of the bill read to this point. 0l 1110 The Chair would further observe that the observation made by the gentleman from Texas are addressed to the merits and the substance of the amendment rather than to its germaneness.

It is intended to make sure that this country does not have to shut down nuclear powerplants in the 1980s for reasons other than normal refueling or conventional operating problems. The interim storage of spent fuel. which would be done in the awayfromreactor storage facility. cannot possibly be accomplished by the 1985 date. And. even if that timetable could be met. we could face the domestic emergency of shutting down nuclear plants in the meantime. The present legislation provides for retrieval of U.S.-supplied spent fuel from foreign reactors because of weapons proliferation concerns. In this amendment we are simply providing similar coverage for our own utilities. Given our tight energy supply problems. it would be criminal to do otherwise. We cannot condone the neglect of our own utility industry. It would require roughly a year leadtime to modify an existing DOE facility to prepare it for transitional storage. But doing this in a timely manner will preclude the eventuality of losing hundreds of millions of barrels of oilI repeat that: hundreds of millions of barrels of oilbecause of nuclear shutdowns. I think that should be a very clear and present danger to the Congress today. since we are hearing the message from the Middle East oilproducing countries that they want to cut back their oil production. they want to increase the price of their oil and to do it on a continuing basis.

I also support this original section. However. there is an oversight contained in these two sections of the bill. They fail to similarly provide transitional storage for U.S. spent fuel until the awayfromreactor facility is completed. This amendment is a simple correction of that oversight. This amendment provides the same transitional storage for U.S. fuel as H.R. 3000 provides for foreign fuel. This amendment does not result in any abrupt change in current U.S. practices with spent fuel. We customarily ship spent fuel in the United States and store it in different places. both in the Department of Energy facilities and private facilities.

    "speech": "I think we and Members of this Congress have to really get it clear in our minds that although the two situations may not be exactly the same. the emergencies that occur are likely to arise. and the emergencies are really the problems that will be faced by perhaps 16 currently operating nuclear plants which are supplying electrical power to the consumers of our country having to shut down for some inspections. It may or may not happen. but possibly needing some place to temporarily store some spent fuel. That would be an emergency in my judgment. because the result would be. if that storage space was not available and it could not be done. these plants would have to close. Tiat would mean that the electrical rates in those areas would go way up. It means we would have a shortfall in our electrical production capacity. It means we probably would have to use more foreign oil. I call that an emergency. It is not exactly the same kind of emergency. It is an American emergency. if utilities are not allowed their flexibility in managing these plants but it is a serious problem we all are trying to face here in the Congress. I hope that the Members will give to the American industry at least the same protection that they are now going to offer to foreign industry.",

Mr. Chairman. I would hope that the House would sustain the wise judgment that we made last week. I hope we will not be misled by that wild. exaggerated predictions that have been made about price.

Mr. Chairman. the issue that is being raised in the Courter amendment and the attempt now to repeal the previous action will have an intimate impact on every one of our constituents. Any Member who votes to continue the gasoline allocation system that has messed up this Nations economy for 5 years will feel the retribution of every person who sits in a gas line henceforth. The gentleman from Maryland. together with Members from the other States in the Washington area. sat through repeated meetings with the officials of the Department of Energy who candidly admitted that one of the reasons the Washington area and southern Maryland. suffered so much. was the allocation system and its inability to respond to the needs of the marketplace as well as the months and months of delay in changing allocations. We have seen thousands of small businessmen. independent gasoline station operators. wiped out over the last several years because of this system. We know the major oil companies do not suffer. but the small businessman suffers. the person who needs gasoline to bring his groceries from the store. his kids to school. to go back and forth to work where there is no mass transit. they are the ones who suffer. All of the experts admit. with a few apologies from some of our friends here who like big government. that it is the Federal gasoline allocation system that is at fault. Mr. Chairman. if the Members will vote to reverse themselves on this amendment they will have to go home and explain to the people who will suffer that we were willing to continue a system proven false. proven a failure and a system that has harmed this country. harmed individuals and made them suffer.

That is in section 810 of the bill before the committee. For instance. it provides that the Department of Energy is required to reduce its consumption of gasoline by not less than 15 percent during this 1980 fiscal year. That is the very thrust of this proposed amendment. It is designed also to reduce the quantity of gasoline that is being consumed by the Department of Energy through the medium of soliciting alternative sources of supply. It is not specific. it just says. \"alternative fuels\" in the proposed amendment. It is submitted that the reduction of gasoline by 15 percent which is mandated in .the committee bill is consistent with the thrust of the amendment which seeks delaying of the funds for making available alternative fuels. In a nutshell. Mr. Chairman. there is little difference between reducing the use of gasoline by 15 percent. either by cost or other means. and achieving that reduction of gasoline consumption by the use of alternative fuels.

Mr. Chairman. sometimes. and I guess the public thinks many times. we do not realize the full implications of what we do. I do not know that any of us can. at this time. fully recognize what we have done to ourselves in imposing a budget ceiling. If the gentlemans amendment should prevail. it would. to a great degree. be cutting out those things essential to protecting our own country. It will be cutting out those programs where we have already overridden the President 28 consecutive times to save the wealth of this country. Whatever our financial problems are. we are fortunate in this country to be backed up by a land rich in physical resources. Our committee met in conference with the other body from 2:30 in the afternoon until 2:30 the following morning trying to bring the supplemental appropriation bill forth for the current fiscal year within the limits fixed by the ceiling. We were able to do that despite a whole lot of problems and a lack of total satisfaction on all our parts about the end result. But if the gentlemans amendment should prevail here. he will not necessarily save money because in the other instances. while we have saved the money in the one place. then bills have come to the floor and taken it and given it for increases for foreign aid. So if the gentleman should prevail here he is cutting money for programs that are essential to supporting all of the Government. including our people. food. economy. and just about everything worthwhile in the world. And he is cutting it. What he cuts is available then under the ceiling and is likely to be spent on items which are not basic and essential. So I respectfully submit that we should certainly defeat this cut. Let us keep looking after our own country and try to hold these other things down. Otherwise somebody will come in here and take what the gentleman from Ohio has cut here and use it for foreign aid or something else. That is the condition we have here. and it is an additional reason why. by all means. we should vote this amendment down.",

Even if refiners were able to shift supplies. price controls would still interfere with the normal signaling process in the marketplace that refiners and marketers depend upon to tell them where the supplies are most needed. This signaling process that I am referring to is also known as the price mechanism. and that mechanism only works when consumers are allowed to vote in the marketplace with their dollars. The more consumers are willing to spend on any particular product. the greater is the profit incentive for producers to expand output to meet consumer needs. Unfortunately. this mechanism has not been working lately. The reason? The DOE is trying to \"determine the precise street corner destination of each of the 300 million gallons that move through the system daily.\" And as we know from the gas lines. it is not doing a very good job. This observation was aptly made by my colleague in the House of Representatives. Representative DAVID STOCKMAN of Michigan. in the recent editorial in the Washington Post that follows.

JIM BROYHILL of North Carolina. and other members of the Consumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee as a cosponsor of H.R. 3991. the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1979. This act would make certain specific and muchneeded changes in the securities laws so as to allow venture capital to flow more easily into new and growing firms. It is certainly timely that these changes be made since the problems date back to as early as 1940. H.R. 3991 would remove impediments to venture capital formation in four areas. First. it would remove certain unnecessary private purchase and resale provisions for investors who are clearly able to fend for themselves. for example. banks and insurance companies. Second. it would prevent a single investor with standing to sue from collapsing an entire financing. Such investor could sue only for his or her money back. Third. the resale restrictions on rule 144 stock would be removed from affiliates of an issuer after a 5year holding period (the SEC has recently removed those restrictions for nonaffiliates after a 3- or 4year holding period. depending on how the stock is traded). Fourth. H.R. 3991 would remove the jurisdiction of the Investment Company Act of 1940 from venture capital firms who meet the restrictive definition contained in the bill. All disclosure. reporting. and antifraud provisions of the other securities laws would. however. remain in effect. I am certain that the passage of H.R. 3991 would result in the financing of many small firms which today cannot receive capital. Not only is that a desirable social goal. but it is also a necessary economic objective for small businesses in this country that produce nearly half of the gross national product and employ 55 percent of the private work force. Indeed. a recent study by MIT showed that growthtype small business in this country (the type which is perpetually capital starved) provided 66 percent of the net new jobs from 1969 to 1976. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the small business community and of H.R. 3991.0",

I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to amend medicare to eliminate the coinsurance which the elderly must pay beginning with their 61st day of a stay in the hospital. This bill was developed in the course of our recent hearings on abuses in the sale of health insurance to the elderly. Our investigation. conducted in nine States and the District of Columbia. proved conclusively that abuses are serious and widespread. Senior citizens are being sold multiple and unneeded insurance policies by some unscrupulous agents. Last week the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee conducted hearings on my bill H.R. 2602 which is aimed at eliminating these abuses. My bill has been cosponsored by Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. SCHEUER. chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs. and more than 250 additional Members of the House. The bill essentially does three things: First. sets up a program of voluntary certification so that insurance companies may obtain a \"Good Housekeeping\" seal of approval if their policies meet or exceed Federal minimum standards. second. makes it unlawful for an agent to represent himself as a Government official or to sell insurance which substantially duplicates existing coverage. and third. would require that policies sold by mail first be cleared with the State insurance commissioner of the respective States before they are mailed into each State. H.R. 2602 has wide support from Members on both sides of the aisle. The bill will not create a new bureaucracy or otherwise result in significant new Federal expenditures. The benefits to senior citizens will be great. For the first time the elderly will have some way of gaging what is and what is not an acceptable health insurance policy. I asked the General Accounting Office to evaluate my bill and to give me any additional suggestions they might have to remedy the obvious abuses in the field of insurance sales to the elderly. With respect to the concept in my bill. H.R. 2602. GAO said: Another alternative proposed by the staff report involves a voluntary certification program whereby HEW would approve those Medigap policies which meet minimum standards in terms of benefits and economic value.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the past week. attention has been focused on the recently signed SALT II Treaty. As a consequence. the protracted negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions have been overlooked. Indeed. during the latter stages of the United StatesSoviet negotiations. the United States set a very ominous precedent for these negotiations by initiating bilateral discussions with the Soviets on MBFR. despite the fact that these negotiations are multilateral. Such secret bilateral negotiations can only stimulate distrust and disunity within the NATO alliance at a time when unity of purpose is crucial to Western security. Mr. William Safire. in a recent essay in the New York Times (June 14. 1979) entitled \"Below the SALT\" has called attenion to some of the most crucial issues affecting MBFR. Mr. Safire suggests four steps which U.S. policy should take: Modernize the theater nuclear arsenal in Europe. terminate alliancewrecking bilateral negotiations with the Soviets on MBFR. require meaningful Soviet troop withdrawals. that is. a tank army rather than a simple manpower or equipment withdrawal. and to test Soviet sincerity by proposals which would require their acceptance of mutual onsite inspections. Regrettably. the United States agreed to terms in SALT II which will prevent groundlaunched cruise missiles. whether nuclear or nonnuclear from being deployed in Europe at least through 1981a precedent which may prevent modernization of the U.S. theater nuclear posture for many years. The Soviets. on the other hand are vigorously modernizing their theater nuclear posture with three new shortrange ballistic missiles to replace the SS12 Scaleboard. FROG7 series missiles. and the SCUD. These have been developed in addition to the MIRVed SS20 now being proliferated in numbers which suggest that the Soviets will have more warheads in their SS20 force than they now have in their SS4/5 medium/intermediate range ballistic missiles. Moreover. the unfortunate failure of the United States to insist that the Soviet Backfire be included in SALT means that the Soviets will be able to deploy 350400 Backfire bombers useable against either the United States or the Eurasian land mass by 1985. The disasterous arms control posture we have adopted has become a threat to American security. not only at the strategic level. but at the theater level as well.

Okla. Mr. Harold Chitwood and his family have given unselfishly of their time and private lives above and beyond the duties and responsibilities normally demanded of a teacher. I take these few moments to publicly acknowledge the tremendous impact he has had on my life and the shaping and molding of the lives of many other young people. Too long have we gone without expressing our appreciation and thanks to people who have had a positive influence on our lives. Mr. Chitwood has taken many of us who were very awkward and shy in public and assisted in providing the activities in his classroom and beyond to allow us to compete and seek to achieve more for not only ourselves but for those with whom we share our daily lives. The young people who have worn the blue and gold jackets of the FFA were taught to wear it honorably and with pride as we represented our school. It was this respect that we gained from wearing the FFA jacket that many of us translated into respect for the individual lives of others. Mr. Chitwood has never been a flamboyant or boisterous man and. because of his quiet manner and humble spirit. he taught us the true meaning of the beginning sentence of the FFA creed which states: I believe in the futurewith a faith born not of words but of deeds. Surely. the deeds of this man speak louder than any words I could convey to you today.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to lend my support today to the Equal Access to Justice Act. This is a most important piece of legislation which addresses a subject that has long been a special interest of mine. Under present law. a private party must bear all costs of litigation involving the Governmenteven if the Governments position is arbitrary. frivolous. or groundless. This is grossly unfair. Many individuals and small businesses simply cannot afford the cost of fighting improper or abusive Government action. As a result. they may be coerced into submission not because they were wrongbut because they could not afford to prove they were right. This bill is much like the Regulatory Fairness Act which I introduced in July of last year. It would place the expense of unwarranted litigation Where it belongs--on the offending Government agency. Unless the agency can prove its position was reasonable. it would have to pay the attorneys fees and other litigation costs of the prevailing small business. association. or individual. While there are some differences be.tween my bill of last year and S. 265. I believe the current proposal represents a fair and workable compromise. It redresses the wrong of present law which places the financial burden of correcting or resisting Government abuse on the victimthe small businessmanrather than on the offending Government agency. The passage of this bill would go a long way toward ending governmental excesses without interfering with legitimate regulatory activities. I urge my colleagues to adopt this measure without delay. Mr. DE:CONCINI. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his concern and interest in this legislation. and the work he has put forward on it.",

I also commend the subcommittee chairman. the distinguished Senator from Arizona . As a new member of the Judiciary Committee. it has been a privilege and of great interest to learn about the problems of that committee and how they are addressed. and how the problems relate to the American people. Our Nation is governed by laws that establish rules. rights. obligations. and responsibilities. and to interpret those laws the citizens of our country turn to the courts. Unfortunately. the cost for pursuing a question based upon those laws is frequently prohibitive for the average American. Ironically. it appears that American justice has become too costly for the average American budget. The cost of attorneys fees. the cost of putting together a case and seeing It through an administrative proceeding or the courts. the cost of paying expert witnesses and developing facts. can all come to much more than the cost of simply giving in. Consequently. the rights of many Americans are not being protected. Due to formidable court costs. our system is losing the ability to act as a balancing factor between individuals and the Government. The Equal Access to Courts Act would serve to alleviate this irony by creating a presumption in favor of an award which the Government could negate by showing that its position was substantially justified.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to express my strong support for S. 265. the Equal Access to Justice Act. This legislation will give the individual the wherewithall to protect himself against the unreasonable exercise of governmental authority. The bill authorizes the payment of fees and other expenses to the prevailing parties in administrative adjudications and civil actions brought by and against the United States in certain circumstances. Mr. President. the American citizen is increasingly regulated by administrative law. rather than legislation. Many of those regulations have become a tangled bureaucratic mess which is almost impossible to alleviate. Very few private citizens can afford to get involved in a court case over Government regulations. The cost has been simply too prohibitive and. because of this. Americans have been forced to comply with administrative rules which should be challenged. Because these cases are not challenged. the Government can simply outwait the citizen. This legislation attempts to better balance the power between citizen and Government. It provides for the award of legal fees to litigants except where the governmental actions were substantially justified. This does not prevent the Government from promulgating further regulations which are. in fact. in the best interests of society. but. it does provide the necessary balance to determine that those regulations are In the best interests of society. This change in our law will allow a court to treat the U.S. Government the same way that it would treat the award of fees against private parties. The Court will be able. in its discretion. to award legal fees to the prevailing party in an action against the Government. Just as it is now able to award such fees in cases involving private parties. This legislation will have a twofold benefit. In the short run. it provides individuals with a remedy which they do not now have. thereby releasing them to make decisions as to the advisability of litigation based on the merits of the case rather than the costs and. in the long run. it becomes a way to curb outlandish regulations issued by Government authority. This bill represents an experiment. We are not making irreversible decisions. S. 265 sets up a 3year test program. At the end of 3 years. all information can be reviewed. I personally believe we will find such a program of tremendous benefit and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of the agriculture cooperatives in California and elsewhere throughout the United States. my amendment would allow agriculture cooperatives to qualify for reimbursements under this act without regard to net worth. Mr. President. this amendment is to S. 265. the Equal Access to Justice Act. I support this legislation. which provides that when a small business or individual citizen prevails in litigation with the Federal Government. that the individual would be reimbursed for attorney fees and costs. if the Government could not justify its position. My amendment addresses a section of this bill that limits the applicability for reimbursement of fees to individuals whose net worth exceeds $1 million. or to corporations and other organizations whose net worth exceeds $5 million. My amendment would allow agriculture cooperatives whose net worth may exceed $5 million to qualify for reimbursements under this act without regard to net worth. The reason is as follows: While this definition of corporations or organizations appears to work effectively for most groups. It fails to take into consideration the basic characteristic of agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives generally operate at cost with respect to their dealings with members/patrons. These members are growers who are not simply investors or stockholders but are participants in the business. All benefits and risks assumed by the cooperative are shared equitably by each of the growermembers. The net worth of the cooperative as an entity is not significant for the purpose of the definition. This amendment would remove the net worth test for agricultural cooperatives which meet the definition of the Agricultural Marketing Act. In substance. compliance with the tests would insure that only legitimate selfhelp agricultural associations formed by the farmers would be entitled to this treatment under the bill. I hope that my colleaaes will support this amendment. As the Senator from California I represent many agricultural cooperatives in my State. They deal with avocadoes. almonds. walnuts. citrus fruit. tomatoes. and other crops. Such an exemption from the definition of corporate net worth has merit and X urge my colleagues to support this language.",

Senator HAYAKAWAS amendment simply provides that an agricultural cooperative. as defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act. shall be regarded as a \"party\" under the proyisions of S. 265 regardless of the amount of its net worth. Currently. this legislation is applicable only to individuals having a net worth less than or equal to $1.000.000 and to partnerships. corporations. associations. or organizations having a net worth less than or equal to $5.000.Mr. President. agricultural cooperatives are often involved in administrative proceedings or in litigation with any one of several agencies. such as the Federal Drug Administration. the Environmental Protection Agency. the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. or the Federal Trade Commission. These proceedings are usually brought against the members collectively in the name of the particular cooperative to which they belong. and. as a group. they would undoubtedly exceed the $5.000.000 net worth limitation for associations or organizations. The cost of such proceedings is borne. however. not by the cooperative as a separate entity but by the individual members. Furthermore. the great majority of these farmers would qualify under the bills current $1.000.000 net worth limitation for individuals. I feel it would be unfair to deny the benefits of S. 265 to these growermembers who would qualify individually simply because they are engaging in administrative proceedings or in litigation in the name of the cDoperative itself.

The reason for making an exception In the case of these coops Is that they generally operate on a nonprofit basis. They simply do not accumulate a lot of capital which can be used for defending themselves in lawsuits. .Ike a corporztion can do. As a general rule. at least 95 percent of revenues received by agricultural coops go back to the farmers or growers. who are members. These individual growers are in a different situation from the stockholders of a forprofit business. Farmers are not passive investors. Fully 100 percent of all legal costs of the coop comes directly out of the pocket of growers. The coop must assess its individual members to pay the bill of any legal actions necessary to defend their rights against Government abuse. Mr. President. cooperatives have done business for over 75 years under the encouragement of Federal laws. These agricultural cooperatives have been leaders in the development of efficient farm export programs. They provide efficiencies of scale to small farmers which enable groups of farmers to effectively compete in world markets. No single farmer. or small group of farmers could possibly compete as well by themselves. How could they provide the marketing capabilities. the consistency of supply. that is demanded in order to sell in the larger markets at home or abroad? Coops have helped to make American agriculture the success that it is and to enable family farmers to join together in this success.

The rapid growth in Government regulations and Federal laws in recent years makes enactment of this legislation imperative. Taxpayers should not have to bear the costs of vindicating their rights against unreasonable Government action. I am particularly gratified that this bill basically incorporates a key provision of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights Act which I introduced on April 10. 1979. My bill would provide for the award of reasonable attorney fees if a taxpayer wins his case against the IRS. This is an important consideration. because today. a taxpayer who believes he is in the right may just give up the fight rather than incur the legal costs of litigating. Under the legislation we are considering today. fees will be awarded unless the Government can show that its action was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust. It is important to note that this bill does not exempt cases arising under the internal revenue laws of the United States from its provisions. We all recognize that enactment of this legislation will bring about a significant change in the general American rule that each party to a dispute must bear his own costs. Nevertheless. this proposal has been given full and serious consideration and Senate approval is both important and timely.

On these campuses. education is truly a process of communication between and among students and faculty members. Dr. Sammartino is an educator who shuns the \"ivory tower\" concept of learning. He encourages the involvement of students in cultural experiences outside of the confines of the institution. and he invites residents of surrounding communities to share in the programs of the university. Dr. Sammartino is one of those very rare individuals whose busy schedule can always be expanded. somehow. to accommodate yet another community service project. For this dedication to improving the quality of our lives. he has our gratitude and affection. I am proud to express my appreciation to Dr. Sammartino and congratulate him on this appropriate recognition.0",

Facing almost certain death. these courageous people fought for their freedom and dignity and in so doing gave inspiration to free men everywhere. This event. and such horrors as the execution of some 6 million Jews in World War II are not easy to look back upon. but it is important that we do so. It serves as a reminder. a reminder of the evil man can produce. It gives a dreadful specific to the counsel to be vigilant. The observance of the anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising should include the remembrance of all those who died in the holocaust throughout Europe. Nothing will ever erase this deplorable chapter in our history. but remembering those who died may prevent repetition of such horrors. Let us hope none of us will ever forget. We should also never forget those who were responsible for these heinous crimes against mankind. That is why I was pleased to cosponsor House Resolution 106. a resolution urging the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany to abolish or amend the statute of limitations governing the prosecution of Nazi war criminals.

I am sure that many of my colleagues have received similar recommendations. It has been pointed out that a handful of nations are distorting world economy by exercising \"blackmail\" tactics concerning crude oil prices while we sit idly by and ignore the possibility of using what might be considered our own trump cardgrain. We are permitting our invaluable grain to be sold for less than the cost to our farmers. while continuing to hand out enormously higher amounts of cash for oil and other necessities. As a result. the dollar. our balance of payments. and our taxpayers are all negatively impacted. In the interest of seeing domestic grain prices raised to realistic levels for foreign customers. and to allow the United States to flex its muscles in terms of fighting this OPEC blackmail. I have joined my colleague Mr. WEAVER in sponsoring legislation to provide for a national grain board. Such a panel will be empowered to approve sales and to arrange for barter in terms of oil and other goods. It will not represent a costly effort to the taxpayerin fact. it will actually provide relief to our citizens. This effort.

Our tremendous strength as a nation is due in a very large part to men and women who have succeeded in establishing sound businesses through long hours and many personal sacrifices. Cesar and Fay Beltran typify the kind of people who are willing to work those long. hard hours. and make those necessary personal sacrifices. During the past 12 years. Cesar has enlarged his business from one neighborhood grocery store that grossed $73.000 to the point where he now owns three stores that will gross in excess of $2 million. This kind of personal commitment and firsthand experience is exactly what makes the free enterprise system we all enjoy so successful. It is very fitting that the Small Business Administration has chosen Cesar to represent California when the National Small Business Person of the Year is announced in Washington. D.C.. on May 13.

I merely state that I agree with him that we do not have to have a large bureaucracy to study and report as required by his amendment. because as the Senate will see on page 30 of the bill under powers and authority of the Board section (d) says: On request of the Board. the head of any executive department or agency may detail. with or without reimbursement. any of its personnel to assist the Board in carrying out its functions under this section. I believe what the Senator has in mind is that the Board take from the agencies of this Government their analysis of laws under their jurisdiction and that it compile them and report to us on the effectiveness of this bill with reference to expediting. indicating what other laws may be impediments or inhibitors to energy selfsufficiency or projects. I do not believe we need a new bureaucracy. I think the section I have read plus the fact that this Board will be asking other executive agencies from time to time for information clearly indicates we have enough expertise within the agencies to provide most of that which is needed. In addition. I commend the Senator for asking that the reports to the Board be further amplified and expanded upon as provided in his amendment. because we are all assuming that this Board and its functions and its powers are going to work.

Numerous economic indicators are flashing ominous signs of continuing inflation. slowing output. lackluster retail sales. and. most recently. rising levels of joblessness. As the current recession becomes more pervasive. unemployment in our individual States will become more visible and accurate guidance for relief will become crucial. The unemployment rate is our signal that something is going awry with the Nations work force. Unemployment rates are integral to our decision process whether for the formulation of macroeconomic policy or for regional aid to our individual constituencies. There have been allegations in the past that the unemployment rate no longer measures accurately the unemployed. In some cases. criticism included undercounting. for example. the discouraged worker. on other occasions. the problem stemmed from overcounting. for example the student who wants only parttime work. The extent of our reliance on this indicator makes its accuracy doubly necessary. In order to determine the accuracy of these statistics. Congress created the National Commission on Employment and Unemployment Statistics to review and evaluate the Nations labor force statistics. For 18 months the Commission has commissioned background papers from experts. held public hearings around the country and consulted with a wide variety of public and private sources. I am pleased to say that the Joint Economic Committee aided the Commission by publishing the three volumes of the public hearings. In addition.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the greatest strengths of our American society lies in its approach to change. We are flexible enough to respond to changed circumstance and to alter our laws to reflect the realities of the world we live in. Over the last 20 years we have experienced a major reshaping of our labor force. More and more women are working outside the home to help supplement the family income. I understand that onehalf of all married women are working today. by 1990 this figure will rise to threequarters. Yet. one of our most powerful means of promoting social policyour system of taxationhas ignored this trend. This year. I reintroduced a bill. S. 336. that would remove our outdated method of taxing married couples. At present. married people aggregate the total family incomes and file their returns jointly. Although this system is beneficial to traditional onewageearner families. it places a severe penalty on couples in which both spouses work. This penalty occurs when the two incomes are combined and filed jointly. placing the second income in a higher tax bracket. My marriage tax bill would resolve this inequity by allowing all married couples the additional option of filing their returns as single individuals. If it is adopted. each spouse would be taxed according to his or her income. independently of the other spouses earnings. More than 20 of our colleagues have cosponsored this bill. and Congresswoman FENWICK has. at last count. attracted 175 cosponsors in the House. I think it is clear that the reform effort is gathering momentum. Mr. President. last week President Carters Interdepartmental Task Force on Women published a study of the marriage tax penalty. Thoroughly analyzing four possible solutions to this problem. the task force has come out strongly in favor of the approach embodied in my bill as \"the simplest way to permanently eliminate the marriage penalty.\" Mr. President. so that all of my colleagues may read this report and see the need for reform. I ask that the report be printed in full in the RECORD. The report follows:",

The purpose of this convention would be to explore the possibilities for transforming the present relationship among these nations into a more effective unity of their peoples. An Atlantic union based on democratic. Federal principles would strengthen the common defense. assure adequate energy resources. and enhance the general economic prosperity of the people of the nations joining this effort. At the same time. it would preserve their welfare. liberty. and sovereignty. It is. I believe. more important than ever. to pursue the ideal and objective of Atlantic union. We are entering a period of great challenge and enormous danger for all free peoples. Scarce energy supplies. vast economic dislocation. the growing Soviet military threat and aggression totalitarianism place our democratic way of life in jeopardy. Tragically. the West has been unable to concentrate its efforts in order to confront these challenges together. Instead. the West appears to be falling increasingly into disarray. 1980 has been a year of serious dissension within the Atlantic community. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the crisis in the Persian Gulf has stimulated divisiveness and recriminations among the United States and its allies rather than a stronger resolve to unite in opposition to common threats. There are worrisome trends in United StatesEuropean relations toward trade protectionism and reckless competition for scarce energy resources. The United States and Europe also seem to be headed toward divergent paths in EastWest arms control efforts and Middle East peace initiatives. It is critical that the people of the Atlantic community of democratic nations recognize that all will lose should their governments pursue policies antagonistic to one another rather than joining forces to confront mutual problems.

In the speech delivered on June 19. Chairman GIAIMO made several provocative points about the future relationship between the scientific community and the Federal Government. He stated that the relationship would become a rougher one. particularly because of the prospect of future tight Federal budgets. Despite this problem. it was Chairman GIAIMOS belief that it was vital to Americas national security and economic interests that its scientific and technological enterprise be in a position to play an important role in the decade ahead. Because of this. he pointed out that it would require the best efforts of the scientific community over the years ahead to insure the future health of Americas scientific endeavors. While Chairman GIAIMo and I hold differing views on the relative merits of a number of individual Federal programs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide for the exclusion from gross income of certain retirement benefits received by individuals who have attained age 55. The effect of this legislation is to exempt from taxation the first $17.000 in benefits received by beneficiaries from public and private pension plans. The wisdon of exempting retirement income from taxation has been discussed and debated since 1935. A 1937 Supreme Court decision and a 1941 ruling of the Bureau of Internal Revenue rendered the benefits from social security tax exempt. In 1957. Congress sought to assure greater equity between the tax treatment of social security benefits and other kinds of retirement income by allowing a tax credit for lowincome elderly. However. this tax credit is very limited in application. extremely complicated. and has not been updated to keep pace with inflation. While these are important steps. there is a pressing need to provide equitable tax treatment to public and private pensions to the millions of Americans relying on this type of income. The cost of fuel. housing. and food has skyrocketed in the last decade. As much as onefourth of the elderlys income is spent on health care alone. However. only some public pensions permit costofliving adjustments for annuities. while most private pensions contain no costofliving adjustments at all. Yet income from these pensions are subject to taxation. For those Americans who depend in part or entirely on income from pension annuities and who have seen the value of their pension annuities ravaged by the high rate of inflation. I believe it is imperative that we enact legislation to exempt qualified pension plans from taxation. The following is a text of the bill: H.R.A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide for the exclusion from gross income of certain retirement benefits received by individuals who have attained age 55. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United of America in Congress assembled. That (a) subsection (a) of section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to annuities) is amended to read as follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have recently become aware of a remarkable program operated here in the Nations Capital that can take a handicapped child who is unable to stand or walk. and impart to that child the ability to ride a horse. Not only does the handicapped child learn to control a huge animal many times larger than himself. but he also develops selfconfidence. selfesteem. and often increased physical and mental abilities. Associated with the teaching of skills is an academic program through which the student learns about horses. grooming. tack. and horsemanship. with an emphasis on basic skillsreading. writing. and math. This program. operated by the National Center for Therapeutic Riding under the direction of Robert Douglass. trained 500 handicapped children last year. The program is currently in jeopardy because the facility housing it has been deemed unsafe. The authority for funds for a program of this kind is found in sections 311 and 316 of the Rehabilitation Amendments of 1978. These authorities are for the purpose of providing recreational programs for handicapped persons. I cannot imagine a more worthwhile opportunity for the use of funds appropriated under this authority. The program has received recognition from all parts of the United States as well as internationally. Because of its success. there are plans to expand it to 1.000 handicapped students. and to extend training opportunities to instructors from around the country and abroad so they could return to their communities and begin similar programs. But these plans will not be realized without Federal assistance. The Department of Education. and specifically. the Rehabilitative Services Administration. must make sure that this program continues through support under the authorities cited above. It is appropriate that such a national and potentially an international center for therapeutic riding programs and the training of instructors for such programs be situated in Washington. D.C. It has been a wise investment of deep significance to the students who have participated in it and can be for students to come. The National Center for Therapeutic Riding is a fitting endeavor to support in 1981. the International Year of the Disabled.*",

The attitude of the dealer. the Zone office (GM) and Im sure the Division itself is \"tough sledding old cob\". If auto imports are limited Im sure that the quality of U.S. autos will decrease even further. I expect to buy quality. If U.S. auto makers and auto workers cannot provide it in a free market then they should go the way of Studebaker. Packard. etc. If we limit imports it will only serve to make imports more of a sellers market and cause their prices to rise in relation to U.S. cars. All Detroit will do is raise their own prices.

Simply stated. the FTC has been doing its job too well. Sadly when that happens in Washington. it draws the fire of lobbyists and the next thing we know. it is translated into punitive action by the Congress. At the moment. we are on the verge of gutting the FTC by a bevy of proposals that would effectively tie the hands of the agency in its efforts to protect the American consumer from some of the questionable practices that exist in the marketplace. And. Mr. President. these lobbyists are Powerful. let us make no mistake about that. Frankly. the only way to counter their efforts is through an outpouring of response from consumers across the Nation. Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn has properly recognized this need in a recent column entitled \"Help to Save Embattled FTC\" which appeared in the November 30. 1979. edition of the Cleveland Press. as well as other newspapers around the Nation.

Congress usually hears mainly 0 from industry lobbyists and a few. standarc s consumer groups. The average voter doesnt know what hes losing until its all over. Summing up the problem.

As chairman of the Senate Banking.

A similar resolution in the House already has 80 cosponsors. evidencing the broad support for this legislation. Square dancing. Mr. President. is a form of dance as old as America itself. From its first recorded use in 1651just 31 years after the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rockto the present. the square dance has been an expression of our national character. The dance is a simple salute to life in early America. and a continuing tribute to the American way of life. Square dancing had a unique meaning to the early American farmers. Square dances were held on the occasion of husking beesbefore the invention of the combinewhenever corn was ready to be harvested. The dance highlighted community gatherings. gatherings which often cut across social and economic ties. It is significant that square dancing still serves this function in many communities. Mr. President. square dancing also promotes good fellowship and provides healthful exercise and is enjoying a rebirth of interest. Through its international congresses. it promotes international understanding and brotherhood. And throughout its long history. square dancing has provided a rich source of inspiration for countless artistic professionals. The national and international status of the square dance would be heightened by the adoption of my resolution. Due to its rich and long love affair with the American people. the square dance deserves the designation of \"National Folk Dance of the United States of America.\" I urge the adoption of the resolution by the Senate. and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

I want to thank my colleagues. Senators HATFIELD and STAFFORD for joining me as cosponsors. The amendment I propose will increase the repair allowance for small hydroelectric facilities to 5 percent. This increase will put the repair allowance for small hydro property on par with the current allowance for other types -of utility property. such as electric utility steam production plants. Since the majority of existing small dams suitable for producing electricity were built in the 19th and early 20th century require considerable maintenance and repair. it seems appropriate that these facilities should be given the sameif not higherrepair allowance of other utility properties. Mr. President. the time is long overdue to bring small hydroelectric facilities back into service.especially in New England where we are at the expensive end of the energy pipeline. We must now stop relying on costly imported oil to take care of our future energy needs. In the rural areas of New Hampshire and New Englandareas that have probably suffered the most. at the hands of rising energy coststhere is a good mine of power freely flowing through our rivers and streams every day. We have an absolute responsibility to harness that power and bring it to the persons who need it the most.

I want to thank my colleagues. Senators STAFFORD and HATFIELD for joining me as cosponsors. The amendment I propose would increase the total tax credit available for small hvdroelectric property from 20 percent to 25 percent. The increased tax credit will directly reduce the capital cost of repairing and reconstructing hydroelectric facilities. many of which were abandoned in New England earlier in this century. The tax credit. as the New Hampshire Energy Law Institute has indicated. will stimulate an increase in construction of small hydro facilities by 33 percent. In talking about smallscale hydro electric power. the most important thing to bear in mind is that this is a technology of today. We are not talking about a power source for the next century. Hundreds of dams in New Hampshire. New England and across the Nation have the capability of reducing the absolute dependence we now have on imported oil to supply our energy needs. We have the technology of reducing this dependence almost immediately. not 10 or 20 years in the future. Because of my belief in smallscale hydropower. I have long supported Federal initiatives to encourage development of this power source. As my colleagues are aware. two provisions which I authored for developing smallscale hydroelectric became law last year as part of the National Energy Act. One authorizes $30 million for feasibility studies on small damsites. and the other authorizes $300 million for a construction loan fund to build the hydro facilities. Mr. President. I again come before the Senate to plead the case for small hydroelectric development. If my amendment is adopted. smallscale hydroelectric facilities will be more quickly developed. and the Nations reliance on imported oil will decrease. I strongly urge passage of this amendment.e",

Also. the Senator indicated earlier that something like 90 percent of the HewlettPackard costs were provided. The fact is that they examined 90 percent and they found that almost all of that. about $147.000. was involved in other compliance and not involved in compliance with the Renegotiation Board.

Admiral Rickover stands like a pillar. stands out like a beacon. in his efforts to protect the taxpayers dollar against rapacious defense contractors. In these days. we hear much talk about reduced Government spending and increased Government efficiency. Passage of this amendment is a way for us to show that we mean what we say. These days we hear a lot of talk about constitutional amendments to balance the budget. about proposition 13. and about reducing Federal expenditures. I would ask some of my colleagues. how can you truthfully tell the taxpayers of this country that you are fighting the battle against wasteful Federal spending and then turn around and vote to abolish the Renegotiation Board. the only watchdog we have against excessive profits in defense expenditures? How can you tell the taxpayers they are getting a fair shake and then leave in the hands of defense contractors possibly hundreds of millions of dollars of Vietnam windfall profits? Why do many Members find it easy to talk about reduced funding for Federal programs that benefit the old. the young. the poor. and the sick. and so difficult to talk about proposals that would affect our Nations most powerful corporations? I believe it is time to show the American people that the U.S. Senate does not succumb to the blandishments of powerful lobbyists. I believe it is time to show the American people that the U.S. Senate will not ask them to make sacrifices. yet help rich corporations become richer through unconscionable profits on defense contracts. This amendment is the test. This amendment only extends the Renegotiation Board for 90 days. But. at least. it allows us to show the American people that we are not going to let this needed Federal agency die. It allows us to show all who are watching that we in the U.S. Senate do care about wasteful Federal spending even if it means stepping on the toes of some of our Nations largest corporations.",

Another issue that was raised was after the Tennessee Library and Archives Department returned that November 17 form and said. \"You have not itemized your contributors.\" Was a conscious decision made to disregard the directions of that election official. the head of the Tennessee Library and Archives Department. Those two issues were not addressed in the letter of the attorney general.

It is not to be confused with another Metro bill. currently in the Governmental Affairs Committee. that would authorize substantial Federal funding for construction. operation. and the retirement of revenue bonds of the Metrorail system. This bill. H.R. 3914. amends the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 (NCTA). to life the ceiling on the amount authorized by Federal law for the Districts share of the cost of the rapid transit system of the National Capital region. Under the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Compact. the District is obligated. along with the other State and local jurisdictions involved. to contribute its share of the costs of the construction of Metro. Under the NCTA. the District of Columbia was authorized to make an aggregate capital contribution of up to $269.700.000. This amount has recently been exhausted. primarily due to inflation and unexpected delays. before completion of the system. It is thus necessary to lift the ceiling of the Districts contribution. so that it can remain a full partner. with Virginia and Maryland. in the creation of this rapid transit system. and also be able to put up the money constituting local matching funds for entitlement to Federal interstate highway transfer funds. The Senate Budget Committee has determined that this bill does not. on its own. create any new direct costs to the Federal Government. The contribution will be made through the District Councils own budgetary process and will be subject to the congressional appropriations process created by the Home Rule Act. The House passed this legislation by a vote of 357 to 48. and I would like to reemphasize its noncontroversial nature. I urge its speedy passage by the Senate today.*-",

He has also dealt with a number of important domestic economic issues during his long and illustrious career. From the various statements which he has made to the Committee on Banking. Housing. and Urban Affairs and elsewhere. it is clear that Mr. Volcker recognizes the need to assure economic stability at home as an indispensable part of strengthening the U.S. dollar abroad. Mr. Volcker will become Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under very trying conditions. The challenges facing him and the other members of the Board are enormous. The rate of inflation is accelerating at the very time the economy appears to be in the early stages of a recession. Interest rates are extraordinarily high and the dollar is still on uncertain waters abroad. The Federal Reserve will play a crucial role in seeking a solution to the economic problems facing our Nation over the months ahead. Monetary policy needs to be placed on a sound footing if economic stability is to be restored. The rate of growth in the money stock needs to be maintained on a noninflationary course if the problem of inflation is to be solved. Rapid monetary growth. particularly under existing economic conditions. is completely inconsistent with stable prices. Moreover. presently high interest rates cannot be reduced without a reduction in the rate of inflation. and the dollar will remain under pressure in foreign exchange markets until price stability is achieved domestically. Mr. Volcker has served for the past 4 years as the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He appears to recognize the need for an independent Federal Reserve. Certainly he has had the opportunity to see first hand how important it is that the Federal Reserve remain independent from political pressures. I trust that Mr. Volcker will maintainthe independence of the Federal Reserve to work for stable economic conditions here at home and a stable dollar abroad.0",

Evidence of General Khatamis ownership interest in Air Taxi was in Textrons own files and other evidence was easily available to Textron auditors. Even Textrons special committee report of the board of directors which was appointed in the wake of the Banking Committees inquiry issued its report last month concluded that \"it is highly probable that Gen. Mohammed Khatemi. the deceased former commander of the Iranian Air Force. had a secret financial interest in Air Taxi. or in commissions earned by Air Taxi. during the time Air Taxi acted as (Textron) Bells dealer in Iran and the settlement (of $2.9 million) was agreed upon.\" Evidence to support this conclusion as I say was known or available to Textron officials. Instead. Miller chose to brush off the suggestion by the committee that Khatemi owned Air Taxi. Miller approved the payment of $2.9 million. It is completely unrealistic to believe that Miller should not have known about General Khatemis interest in Air Taxi. In testifying before the Banking Committee. Miller repeatedly denied that Textron engaged in bribery. Miller repeatedly stated that Textron operated with the highest standards of ethics and conduct. Miller stated that \"Textron endeavors to maintain the highest standards of conduct. This has been a subject discussed at every major management meeting during my 22 years with the company.

As this section now stands. it is too rigid and inflexible. I would strike some of the detailed requirements set forth which have been criticized as akin to regulations. rather than language appropriate to include in a statute. This bill establishes a new office within the Department of HEW. While legislation putting restrictions on what a Government agency can do. often receives wide support. it is unusual to give such specific directions as to how an agency should carry out its responsibilities. Judgments will have to be made based on experience. Congressional oversight is the proper method of assuring ourselves that the office in question is in fact carrying out the responsibilities given to it by this legislation. Mr. Chairman. the goal of resettlement policy should be to get the refugee out of a temporarily unemployed situation. meet their health needs in an environment where they can overcome language barriers and develop their skills to become selfsupporting. contributing members of society. If this goal is accepted. language training and skill developments are fundamental to successful resettlement. I. therefore. believe that the cooperation of the Department of Education and the Department of Labor are important. The second part of my amendment. therefore. contains an affirmative requirement that the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Labor make yearly report3 as to the efforts of their respective departments to increase refugees access to programs within their jurisdiction. Involvement of these departments was strongly urged in an excellent analysis of refugee resettlement in the United States prepared last summer by the New Transcentury Foundation. This additional language fortifies the interdepartment cooperation intended by other language in this title. I want to make it clear that by offering this amendment. I do not object to the functions described in the language that is being stricken. The amendment retains the Office of Refugee Resettlement reporting directly to the Secretary of HEW. I am sure that as this office is established. our committee will be aware of the steps it takes to perform its duties and make our ideas known in that regard. I feel this amendment simplifies title HI without reducing the authority granted to implement a viable refugee resettlement policy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

As it passed the House. it would expand the program to include types 6 and 7 wetlandsprimarily shrub and wooded swampsand coastal wetlands. it would require an adjustment in payment rates every 5 years instead of every 10 years as provided by present law. and it would increase the amount authorized to be expended under the act in any one year from $10 million to $30 million beginning with fiscal year 1980. Mr. Speaker. the Senate passed H.R. 2043. with an amendment. on Tuesday of this week. As it passed the Senate. other than making technical changes it would make the provisions of the bill effective with fiscal year 1981 instead of 1980. and it would limit the amount of funds that could be expended in any one State in any calendar year to 15 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated in any fiscal year.

The point is that. at a time when we have a 13.2 inflation rate. the time has come. I believe. to start taking a hard look at some of the frills in the Federal budget. These routes to be terminated have to be classified as frills.

The rules have changed. We have an energy problem. it is said. We have gasoline lines and because of the gasoline lines. we are going to have more people riding Amtrak and Amtrak is going to start getting itself out of the hole. Well. the response to that is. think. in several forms: First. last March. when the President of Amtrak testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce. he stated at that time that if Amtrak were running at 110 percent of capacitythat is. standing room only on every single trainit still could not cover its expenses. It still could not break even on the present system. The second thing that should be said is that the projections that have been made as to increased ridership are projections which are made. really. on the basis of speculation. on the basis of advanced bookings and decisions as to who will be using those tickets several months down the road.

What we are really talking about is whether or not we are going to cut out some 18 percent of the trains which we have demonstrated here this afternoon have high ridership on them. where we have shown actual ridership for the last week available. showing them almost full. and we have shown through the projected reservation of these trains that even looking 6 weeks in advance they are 50 percent booked. We can compare this to anything we want to. If you want to compare it to what is booked on airlines. and you can show that 13 weeks from nowI misspoke myself a little bit ago. I said 6 weeks are 50 percent bookedit is 13 weeks from now they are bookedand if we can look at airline routes and show they are 50 percent booked. then we would say that is a pretty good airline route. If we could look 6 weeks in advance and say it is 75 to 80 percent booked we would say that is a good airline route. Yet these very trains that are being eliminated in this 18 percent cutand that is all it amounts to--are these types of trains. These are not trains going empty. These are not trains that currently are being subsidized. These are trains making money for Amtrak. and I think it is appropriate to keep them in place for another year. and have the General Accounting Office survey the criteria that go into this and find out whether or not these trains we are talking about are not. truly not. dogs. but very good moneymakers for Amtrak. as they appear to be at this moment.

Now. on the Hiawatha. for a passenger to go from Chicago to Seattle it loses $138.87. Anywhere along the Hiawatha route a person can and does buy tickets to ride on the bus. It costs $73. about onehalf of what the loss is on the Hiawatha. about onehalf of what we pay to subsidize a person to take the Hiawatha. That is what it costs for a person to buy a bus ticket all the way through. and people are riding on buses at their own expense. and paying taxes to do so. and the buses are paying taxes. How can we justify continuing to run up this cost? We started outI say we. the Congress started outwith this program losing $40 million a year for operating costs. Now it has worked up to $600 million a year. projected to go up to $1 billion a year. How long can we justify those kinds of losses? How can we justify doing nothing to protect the taxpayers against these rising increases. where losses on this thing have increased 15fold and are scheduled to go up to 25fold. how can we justify those kinds of increases without any kind of a cutback?

ED and I came to the Senate together in 1958. so I have had more time than many Senators to work with him and observe his performance. It is a performance that did this institution proud. Mr. President. and that Is why I am certain every American will be proud of his performance as Secretary of State. Although the overwhelming reaction to this appointment has been favorable. there have been some who question his lack of experience in foreign affairs. Let me say to those critics that ED MusKuE will master his new job and will make up with diligence and intelligence whatever he lacks in experience. The fields of environmental protection and congressional budget control were new when ED Musig entered them. but he proved more than a match for them. Indeed. his work on behalf of environmental protection assures him a place in this Nations history. And if the gruelling job of bringing budget restraint to the U.S. Senate does not win him public accolades. it does give him a position of everlasting respect in this body. What the United States needs now in foreign policy ED MUSKiE has in abundance. That is a clear sense of this Nations goals and aspirations and a dogged determination to have those needs met. As I said when the nomination was announced. ED is an able advocate and a tough adversary. This country could have no stronger ally in its corner than ED MUSKI when it comes to dealing with the various hostile forces at large in the world today. This is a good appointment and the American people will come to appreciate that fact over the weeks and months to come.",

I certainly hope that will be the view that is taken here. I might say. with the problems we face on the commercial sidewe are going to lose $10 billion in the trade account with Japan this year with trucks and cars. 2 million Japanese cars are coming into the United Stateswe cannot have all of these things continue because we are spending $520 per capita while they are spending $87 per capita. and the money they are not spending on free world defense becomes part of their industrial base which. in turn. is creating these economic differentials that are hurting our balance of payments and which cause rising unemployment in the United States.

The belief was expressed that mobile home loans were covered under this provision. I wish to take issue with this interpretation since it was my undersanding that they were not included. Many mobile home loans are made essentially as consumer loans with very high interest rates and with short terms of 5 to 12 years. State usury laws on mobile home loans are separate and distinct from usury laws on residential mortgages. There is a very serious question whether the Congress should abrogate laws dealing with what are often essentially consumer loans with rates as high as 18 percent.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment would provide authority to States. without time limitation. to enact new laws placing limitations on discount points and other charges in connection with a residential mortgage loan. Section 305 of the bill would override State laws limiting the rate or amount of interest. discount points. or other charges assessed in connection with a residential mortgage loan. However. a State could make this override inapplicable by adopting a provision of law. within 2 years after the date of enactment of this act. limiting the rate or amount of interest. discount points. or other charges on such loans. I support this mortgage usuary override in the bill because I believe the facts clearly demonstrate that State laws which limit the rate of interest that can be charged on mortgage loans. although well intended. have often had the unfortunate effect of shutting off or disrupting the flow of credit. The case for overriding State laws limiting discount points or other charges which are included in the annual percentage rate is less strong. since there has been no demonstration of disruptive effects of such limitations. and since there are potential consumer abuses in the manner in which discount points or such other charges may be imposed. On the other hand. a number of States have enacted laws limiting discount points in the context of a usuary restriction on interest. so that overriding State limitations on interest without at the same time overriding limitations on discount points could have confusing and unintended effects. Thus it makes sense to wipe the slate clean. However. States should have flexibility to enact new laws placing limitations on discount points or such other charges. without any time limitation. My amendment would provide this flexibility.",

As you know. section 419 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 mandates the Civil Aeronautics Board to make essential air service determinations for small communities. This bill provides $7 million to help small communities maintain a satisfactory level of air service as determined by the CAB. The CAB has established essential air service guidelines for qualified small communities across the country at 160 seats in total daily arrivals and departures to and from designated hubs. Some California communities. especially in the San Joaquin Valley. need TE 30661 far more service than 160 seats dailya need which the carriers have not met. Kern County. the No. 1 oil producing and No. 2 agricultural county in my State. has gone through and is still experiencing a very difficult transition from major air carrier service to small commuter air carrier service. At one point under deregulation. Bakersfield. the county seat for Kern County. had no air service to San Francisco at all. We are speaking of a community with over a third of a million people. Prior to deregulation. the people of Kern County were accustomed to abundant and reliable service. They have every right to expect at least reliable and adequate service now. The 160 seat determination applied to Bakersfield demonstrates that the Board has not recognized the critical problems and needs in that area of California. Bakersfield is only one example. The Board is currently assessing the essential air service needs of Stockton. Modesto. and Chico. The Board must do a much better job in facilitating the smoothest transition possible from major carrier service to adequate replacement service. and in evaluating California communities in terms of their individual needs. taking into account economic and geographic features. As long as the Board remains so insensitive and unresponsive to the problems in California. I regret that I must have serious doubts about its ability to handle airline deregulation.",

If the illegal alien in question is like 30 percent of all other illegal aliens he will come back to the United States and the circle is complete. This is an abuse of the American tax dollar.

However. a recent study for the National Bureau of Economic Research clearly demonstrates that unions and unionization can have a positive impact on productivity. In a microeconomic study. Dr. Kim B. Clark of the Harvard Business School conducted an exhaustive examination of the U.S. cement industry and concluded that all of the data in that industry pointed to a positive correlation between unions and unionization on the one hand and higher productivity on the other hand.

He negotiated to supply 1 million tons of superphosphoric acid annually to the U.S.S.R. from plants in Florida in order to supply four new ammonia plants to be built in the U.S.S.R. Armand Hammer and Occidental Petroleum would. in return. receive ammonia and urea to be sold in the United States.

The Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Finance is presently holding hearings on the product liability problem. We began these hearings by examining the nature and causes of the product liability problem. The testimony received to date confirms the existence of a serious problem. Many American businesses have found it increasingly difficult to buy product liability insurance. Some firms have been unable to obtain product liability insurance at any cost. some of these firms indicate that they have never had a product liability claim. We intend to proceed to receive testimony on the proposed legislative remedies at the end of this month. I believe that our hearing record should include a thorough consideration of the proposed Risk Retention Act.

I read from an article by Tom Edsall in this mornings Baltimore Sun which begins: Supposedly balanced budgets on the floor of the House and Senate are both in deficit. according to revised estimates by the Congerssional Budget Office. The cost of federal proLorams in 1981 will be about $3.5 billion more than was anticipated when the House and Senate Budget Committees agreed on revenue and spending targets about a month ago. according to the CBO. \"No matter what we do. we dont seem to be able to keep up with the increased spending.\" James R. Capra. chief of the CBOs projection unit. said. The consequence for the version of the budget currently under debate in the HouseAnd that is the committees budgetis that instead of a $2 billion surplus. the measure is about $1.5 billion in the red. Now. what that means. if this is an accurate description of the situation. is that not only is the committee budget $11/2 billion in deficit and is not a balanced budget. but the Obey substitute now before us. which is premised on many of the same major assumptions. though it does readjust many of the categories. including revenue and spending areas. is also $13/2 billion in deficit. So if there has been some concern on the part of you as individual Members of the House that you wanted to vote for a balanced budget. you cannot possibly vote for this substitute now before us and achieve that goal because. according to the Congressional Budget Office. it is already $1 1/2 billion in deficit. Based on the experience that we have had in the last year or two of budget forecasts by CBO and others. it is very likely that th.s substitute is in deficit many. many billions of dollars.",

I think that is a shame because that amendment overwhelmingly passed this House last year and we know what the sense of this House is.

Mr. Chairman. I firmly believe that if we were to repeal the foreign oil tax credit that the stockholders in the oil companies would then find that it is going to be more profitable to research. to find. to drill and produce oil in this country and it would be much more profitable than buying the oil overseas. I do not think it is fair for the oil companies to receive this tax credit when every other national business in this country and overseas. if they have a doingbusiness expense such as buying material to produce goods. they are able to write that off as a business expense but they still pay the U.S. obligation on the profits of that organization. Mr. Chairman. under this system. if a major national oil company has a profit of let us say $100 million and they have purchased $100 million worth of oil from the Arab countries. then they can take the $100 million that they have paid. which is just a normal business expense. and apply it to their U.S. tax obligation and pay no taxes at all. which has happened in the past. This should be repealed. We should not be forced to vote on that issue when it is tied in with the other Obey provision which does increase spending. Mr. Chairman. I am still in the dilemma.

Also last week. the Senate acted to put in place the Presidents emergency gasoline rationing plan and to release funds for energy assistance to the Nations poor and elderly during the recordbreaking heat wave. Concurrent with Senate efforts to deal with national energy needs has been the considerable time and effort devoted this session to keeping Federal spending down and within the budget ceilings. For the first time since enactment of the 1974 Budget Control Act. the reconciliation process was invoked to restrain expenditures. A number of major pieces of legislation considered by previous Congresses have become law this year. such as the comprehensive changes to the banking system. and deregulation of the trucking industry. Important modifications and reauthorizations of numerous existing programs were enacted. A more detailed account of the legislative achievements of the Senate this session Democratic policy committee staff. I ask unanimous consent that it be inserted in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

When the Senate returns from the August 6 recess. there are only 37 working days. including Saturdays. before the announced October 4 adjournment. That adjournment will be sine die if all the essential work for the Congress has been completed. However. if it is necessary to return after the November election. I have already announced that the Speaker and I have decided that the Congress will return on Wednesday. November 12. This was at a meeting at which the House leadership was present. the Senate leadership was invited to attend and. for reasons which were meritorious. some of them could not attend. In any event. that is the date on which the Congress would return. Obviously. there are a number of essential measures remaining for consideration in the limited time available. Expiring authorizations and appropriation measures will take priority. Incidentally. the appropriations measures that have been passed by the House and received in the Senate as of the close of business yesterday were these: Energywater. military construction. legislative. State. Justice. HUD. Agriculture. and Interior. Seven in number. So the Senate has not acted on any of the major appropriation bills. Now. the list I will submit is not intended to represent the only legislation that will be called up. Any measure on the calendar will be eligible for consideration as time and the schedule permit. This would include such measures as the Criminal Code revision. aspects of regulatory reform. export trading. Antiterrorism and Immigration Act amendments. The Senate has made excellent progress this year in the area of expiring authorizationsapproximately 50 of these essential measures have already passed the Senate. I am confident that with the continued excellent cooperation and assistance by all Members of the Senate. this progress will continue when we return on August 18. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point. therefore. a list of legislation to be completed by adjournment. with the understanding. as I have indicated before. that it is not all inclusive and is not intended to represent the only legislation that may be called up.",

We are giving. if this bill is enacted into law. primary subsistence rights to Alaskan Natives and rural residents.

This amendment. in my judgment. strengthens the UdallAnderson bill by adding the same definition of subsistence that appears in the DingellBreaux bill. It says. and it says it explicitly. that Federal subsistence uses will be limited to the customary and traditional uses by Alaska residents. This amendment adds the word \"rural\" to Alaskan residents. so that we assure that we are not dealing with the citizens of Ketchikan or Juneau or Fairbanks with respect to subsistence hunting or fishing. The second amendment makes it clear that the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife for personal family consumption. for barter. or sharing for personal or family consumption and for customary trade. and here we have Inserted the word \"noncommercial\" so that the language reads customary \"noncommercial\" trade. There are Natives who sell salmon or furs in their own areas for the cash requirements of village life. This is not commercial trade in the sense that they are not selling these salmon or furs to restaurants in cities and thereby making the $20.000 a year some of the Indians along the Klamath are making today under allegedly subsistence fishing rights.",

All three of these are very critical environmental issues. The gentleman from California on all of these has taken the language that is contained in the BreauxDingellHuckaby bill and offered it to the UdallAnderson bill.

The UdallAnderson has so many problems in their version of these areas. because they take some of the prime existing minesites and put them in the middle of a wilderness. Now they are trying to do it piecemeal. You are going to work some little exceptions so you might be able somehow to get into the wilderness and get to the mine. The way we are trying to handle the problems is if there is a valid mine. we just do not put it in the wilderness. thereby we eliminate the problems created by the UdallAnderson approach. I still say they have not corrected the problem because the wilderness law is very basic. If the area is wilderness. there will be no commercial activity. there will be no permanent roads constructed. I think that is the law of the land. I think case history has proven that. and by trying to work these little narrow exceptions. this does not solve the problem.",

There are so many arguments which have come to the fore in the general debate on this bill as to why our bill was bad from an environmental standpoint. Now in all of these critical areas like subsistance. like access. and like mining in wilderness areas. and like the Copper River Delta Refuge. that were so bad a couple of days ago. we now see the UdallAnderson forces are starting to embrace these concepts which we had originated in the BreauxDingellHuckaby version.

Those must be explored as well. and I urge the point the gentleman makes. that cutting taxes is not enough by itself. We have to worry about the end product. the balance between income and outgo.

In November of 1977. the Narcotics Select Committee held hearings at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York on international narcotics control- hearing that I. along with Messrs. WOLFF and BIAGGI participated. I was impressed by the testimony of Rear Adm. Norman C. Venzke. Chief of the Office of Operations and Director of the Enforcement of Laws and Treaties Program of the U.S. Coast Guard. who stated: The general revision of drug laws which produced the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970 omitted the provision making the possession of quantities of drugs by US. vessels on the high seas a Federal crime. Consequently. Coast Guard drug law enforcement action against U.S. vessels at sea beyond the 12mile customs zone now requires the proof of conspiracy to import beforce law enforcement action can be properly undertaken. Mr. Speaker. our legislative proposal is designed to help plug that 12mile zone loophole by prohibiting circuitous avoidance of U.S. jurisdiction and by subjecting the convicted violator to an imprisonment of not more than 15 years. a fine of not more than $25.000. or both. A subsequent conviction would subject the violator to imprisonment of not more than 30 years. a fine of not more than $50.000. or bothpenalties that are stipulated by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of I understand that the Subcommittee. on Coast Guard and Navigation will be holding hearings on this measure later this month. I commend the committee for acting swiftly on this legislation and hope that other colleagues will join with us and the more than 50 cosponsors in helping to plug this loophole- a loophole through which significant amounts of drugs are smuggled onto this Nations shores. If our Nation is going to effectively interdict narcotics trafficking then the statutes under which our law enforcement agencies operate must be perfected to permit our dedicated law enforcement agents to properly perform their dangerous tasks. This legislative proposal is a step in that directionit would improve our legislative arsenal in the war on narcotics trafficking by providing the Coast Guard with the necessary authority to interdict drug traffickers on the high seas and to penalize the convicted traffickers with stiff penalties.

He served his country through three wars and nearly 35 years in the military and became the first Black American to attain the rank of fourstar General. I have recently received a letter from a constituent. Mr. Claude C. George. who was a close personal friend of General James. I would like to take this opportunity to insert Mr. Georges correspondRepresentative WYCHE FOWLER. Longworth House Office Building. Washington. D.C. MY DEAR REPRESENTATIVE FOWLER: I realize that there is not enough time nor space to express adequately. the profound effect that Chappie had on America and those whose lives he touched. However. one great sage from our past wrote that. \"Man should be afraid to die until he has made some contribution to humanity.\" \"Chappie\" James. Jr. was such a man. Our friendship began over 40 years ago at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. I have known General James as a close personal friend. former college roommate. fellow athlete. student leader and humanitarian. Although General \"Chappie\" James received many horiors and firsts as a military leader. his greatest achievements revolved around his strong commitment to being a topnotch fighter pilot and his love for America. In spite of the fact that when he joined the Air Force. Black soldiers were segregated and denied the same rights and privileges as their white counterparts. \"Chapple\" never lost faith in his country and remained loyal during periods when most men would have faltered. General James was a true American. A mans man. A soldiers soldier. A true believer in the hopes. dreams and promises of America. General James expressed his commitment and unswerving love for America when he admonished those around him who busied themselves in denunciation of his country when he stated-\"We are trying to get away from the business of being so busy practicing our rights to dissent that we forget our responsibility to contribute.\" As a lasting tribute to such a great General. the establishment of a Memorial Center at Tuskegee Institute in his honor would be a refulgent symbol for others to emulate. Therefore. I felt that it was incumbent upon me to share with you and your fellow Congressmen. my impressions of a man whose accomplishments should be printed indelibly in the annals of American and international history.

The first entitled \"Masons Choice\" focuses on perhaps one of the main actors in the entire Northern Ireland issueSecretary of State Roy Mason. The editorial suggests that Mr. Mason has reached the point of being totally unable to positively contribute to the peace orocess in the North. The Irish Times joins with others who are speculating on Mr. Masons imminent departure. The second editorial entitled \"Initiative\" explores an issue of supreme importance to myself and the ad hoc committee. Where will the Initiative that will bring peace to Northern Ireland come from. The Irish Timessuggests that a Dublin initiative is in the works. There is some credence to this claim as both Prime Minister Lynch and Foreign Minister Michael OKennedy have made major statements on the Northern Ireland situation in recent weeks. The Times feels strongly that an initiative is not forthcoming from Great Britain. The editorial states: It may be that Britain can never solve this problem and that only international Intervention. by the United Nations. or America would bring us peace at last. Britain may have to be pushed into this. The ad hoc committee has proposed an initiative for peace in Ireland. On February 1 the executive committee of the ad hoc committee voted unanimously to sponsor a Congressional Irish Peace Forum beginning the week of May 14. We will invite all sides to participate in the forum most particularly representatives of both the British and Irish Governments. We hope they come willingly. The fact is America in general and the ad hoc committee in particular with its over 100 Members of Congress. is viewed as an honest broker by all sides in Ireland. We wish to exploit this assessment to advance the movement toward peace and justice in Ireland. I hope for the active support of my colleagues in this endeavor. The ad hoc committee sees America as playing a vital role in the peace process. Yet we stress that our role would be to contribute to peace not impose peace. The decision on the future of Ireland can only rest with the people of Ireland. The two Irish Times editorials follow immediately:",

Warren Brookes recently analyzed the problem. and found that oil imports have little to do with the weaknesses of our international trade and the dollar. I submit his article. which appeared February 6. 1979. in the Boston Herald American. for consideration by my colleagues. I believe it is essential background before considering the administrations invitations to raise taxes. to authorize the further curtailment and rationing of energy supplies. to endorse the idea that inflation is caused by workers working and business doing business. and to adopt an \"antiinflation\" program which attacks workers instead of inflation. The U.S. Government has caused the countrys domestic and international economic problems. First. with burdensome tax and regulatory policies which discourage production for export and domestic trade. Second. by inflating and devaluing the dollar in the belief that it will cure the balanceofpayments deficit. when in fact it worsens the problem and reimports the inflation we have been exporting for years. Third. by curbing and rationing energy. which makes energy scarce and expensive. when it need be neither. These are exactly the wrong policies. We must instead reduce tax rates and regulations and otherwise increase economic incentives for production. We must adopt a monetary policy which guarantees a constant price for the dollar.

The legislation before us grants congressional approval to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). thereby revitalizing this needed planning panel. As one who is privileged to represent the southern portion of beautiful Lake Tahoe on the California side. I am delighted that my colleagues have seen fit to bring this measure to the floor in an expeditious and responsible manner. Both Houses of Congress must ratify this legislation. which sets forth the terms of the compact agreed to by the legislatures of California and Nevada to encourage wise use of Lake Tahoes resources. In approving this bill. we will be demonstrating our recognition of the importance of insuring a strong State and local voice in decisions affecting the precious Tahoe Basin. I consider the terms of the agreement to be equitable and workable. and all those who have labored diligently to arrive at the language of this compact are to be commended. In 1969. when the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was initially ratified by Congress. it was ponted out that Lake Tahoe and the majestic Sierra Mountains which form the lakes basin were among our most prized national scenic treasures. Working in concert. the States of California and Nevada made every effort to protect that valued environmental entity for future generations. During the 1960s. Americans pledged to halt the destruction of environmental gifts such as Lake Tahoe. and to insure that advancing urbanization and industrialization did not leave us stripped of our natural heritage. In the intervening years. the need for protection of the environment has become more urgent. as has the realization that State and local control must be encouraged. The bill before us serves as tangible proof of our renewed commitment to the dual goals of environmental protection and enhanced local decision. It serves as an instrument of ratification. enabling California and Nevada to continue striving for prudent use and conservation of the waters of Lake Tahoe. and of the resources in the basin. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will vote favorably on this measure so that no delays will be incurred in implementing the terms of the bistate compact. and I urge rapid approval of this needed bill.

Presently. the Secretary lacks authority to dispose of these small parcels. Available methods to resolve the problems presented by these tracts. such as litigation or private legislation. are cumbersome. expensive. and time consuming. The authority to sell or exchange these tracts given the Secretary under the bill is subject to several safeguards.

The Secretary is directed to insert in the quitclaim deeds conveying the parcels such terms as are necessary to insure protection of the public interest. including protection of scenic. wildlife. and wilderness values. Finally. persons to whom parcels are conveyed are required to bear all reasonable costs of administration. survey and appraisal incident to the conveyance. H.R. 6257 was referred to. and reported favorably by. both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.

I know that this year. as in past years. Memberswill want to carefully consider these recommendations as we strive to improve the quality of life for senior citizens. During January. NRTAAARP concluded another successful legislative policy conference. Nearly onehalf of all Members of Corgress206 Representatives and 46 Senatorsattended the ceremonies. Leading opinionmakers in Government and the private sector spoke frankly on a wide range of issues with legislative council members. These conversations helped the council fashion sound and broadly based policies on the economy. retirement income. tax equity. health care. and other important issues for older Americans. As chairman of the House Committee on Aging. I am especially pleased tl~at the legislative council adopted many policies that our Aging Committee is now advancing. For example. the councils eloquent call for elimination of mandatory retirement provides further compelling evidence for prompt and favorable action on H.R. 4. our legislation to abolish agebased compulsory retirement for workers in the private sector. In addition. the council urged that the social security earnings limitation be eliminated. I am in full agreement. and have introduced H.R. 2570 to implement this objective. I shall continue to work to remove employment barriers for older Americans. Functional capacitynot chronological ageshould determine whether a person is hired. fired. promoted. or demoted. The -council also developed a sixpoint program to.convert social security into a national pension program. Mr. Speaker. the entire NRTAAARP Federal legislative package deserves the close consideration of all Members of Congress.

I knew and worked with JOHN SLACK for many years. West Virginia has lost a dedicated Congressman. and the Congress and our country have been denied the services of a good and conscientious Representative. JOHN SLACK was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1958. Previous to that election. he had served in the Armed Fo:ces in World War II. and had been a member of the Kanawha County Court and the assessor of Kanawha County. In the House. Congressman SLACK was chairman of the State. Justice. Commerce. and Judiciary Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. A man of outstanding character and exemplary moderation. he was recognized widely for his wise counsel and mature judgment on issues vital to our country and the State of West Virginia alike. Throughout his years in Congress. JOHN SLACK proved himself everresponsive to the needs and best interests of the Third District. Moreover. as a congressional colleague. he was always cooperative and helpful. Though he was a deeply committed and concerned citizen and patriot. he knew the value of reason and perspective in the arena of public decision. Mr. President. I join today with thousands of my fellow West Virginians in the Third District and throughout our State in mourning the passing of Congressman SLACK. and I extend to his family and many friends my personal condolences on our mutual loss. In a genuine sense. all West Virginians share in the untimely death of JOHN SLACK. and we shall long be indebted to him for the contributions he made to our lives and our wellbeing.",

Under Senator JAvITs leadership. the conference last week adopted a set of economic principles that seize the initiative in combating inflation. Our statement says that. when dealing with inflation. the factors we have developed and unanimously approved. present a balanced economic program to the country. What is more. our program gets to the very root causes of inflation. These principles were enunciated nearly a year ago by the Senate Republicans. They should have been implemented then. There was not any receptivity for them. Today I hope the country and the administration are far more receptive to these important antiinflation steps. Budget cutting is important. It is the very first of our principles. We intend to move toward a balanced budget just as we intend to limit the level of Federal expenditures to 21 percent of GNP. But we get to the heart and fundamental cause of inflation when we deal with productivity. capital formation. and incentives for investment. We must address the cooperative things that industry and labor must do together. We should. for example. spur the creation of councils of labor and management to increase productivity. to work together to encourage capital formation and investment. to try to find ways to reduce scrap and rework and to reduce absenteeism. In short. we need to work toward reducing all those factors that contribute to cost but do not contribute to the value of a product.

In an article titled \"People. Not Hardware the Highest Defense Priority.\" he succinctly points out that while -the Consumer Price Index has risen 75 percent since 1972. military pay has gone up only 51 percent. Thus. a military member has faced a 14percent real decline in purchasing power. With an evermore complex military system. both in its technological advances and its standard operational and maintenance procedures. there is a premium placed on the skills of the military member. Education and experience are essential to the efficient operation of our defense forces. With inordinately low pay scales. however. many of these individuals are being forced. out of economic necessity. to seek other employment. This drain of skilled manpower may do more to lower our force level capabilities than the more highly visible lack of hardware. It is time. therefore. for the Congress to approve a pay package for military personnel that will allow the retention of skilled personnel and provide for decent. fair compensation to our military families. The costs of such a program can be borne by efficiencies within the systemby a freeze on civilian hiring. for example. which would save over $1.2 billion in 1 fiscal year. There are many other examples of frills and luxuries that could be eliminated in order to place the proper emphasis on our military manpower requirements. Mr. President.

In the Senators State of Delaware. the tarx windfall to the Federal Government for 1979 is estimated to be $34.500.000. and for 1980 $57.400.000. This comes to $115 per taxpayer in his State this year. and $192 per taxpayer in his State next year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was cosponsor of the Tax Equalization Act of 1979 introduced by Senator DOLE which is identical to the present amendment. I am very pleased now to be a cosponsor of the DoleArmstrong amendment which is now pending. and I commend my distinguished colleagues from Kansas and Colorado for their perception of what is troubling Americans today more than almost anything else. Inflation is hurting Americans. but inflation in taxes is probably the harshest penalty that they are paying. Some months ago a young woman stopped me in an elevator in the First National Bank building in Chicago. She said. \"Senator PERCY. it is just absolutely unjust. this tax system that we have. I received a wage increase. I earn $13.000 a year. I received a wage increase of $1.040 that was supposed to fully compensate me for the increased inflation. As a result. however. I move into another tax bracket and I do not have sufficient income to compensate for inflation at all.\" It is the bracket creep that people agonize over. They get increases for inflation and it simply does not show up in the real income they are able to keep and spend. This amendment will eliminate the bracket creep for individuals and reduce the most inflationary item in the average familys budget. Federal taxaCXXV- 2195Part 26 tion. The DoleArmstrong amendment. by indexing individual tax rates and personal exemption tax rates. will correspond to real income as they are meant to. Further. the progressive tax structure will be stabilized and will be certain. The real effective rate of tax. as a percentage of real income. rises steadily. The Federal Government gets the resulting windfall in tax revenues without having to make a single change in tax policy. For a 10percent rate of inflation. the Treasury reaps a 16.5percent increase in revenues. Inflation therefore creates a hidden tax. Taxpayers who receive modest costofliving pay increases. like this woman in Chicago. who just received a presumed inflationary wage increase. are pushed into higher tax brackets where our progressive tax rate takes a bigger bite of income without the worker having retained increased purchasing power. I am pleased. therefore. to cosponsor. this amendment. I again commend my distinguished colleagues for offering it and trust that we shall be joined by a majority of our colleagues on the vote.",

I share the belief of the sponsors of this amendment that the time for indexing our tax system is comingbut I do not believe the Senate Is prepared to judge the full implications of the proposal before us. I agree with the sponsors of this amendment that it is unfair for people to be pushed into higher tax brackets simply because inflation increases their nominal income. Real income does not necessarily increase and the resulting increase in Federal taxes has the insidious effect of reducing a familys standard of living. The time for careful evaluation of tax indexing and its impact on the economy is now. The results of various studies bn tax indexing which are now underway should be considered by the Senate as soon as they are completed. I have discussed this with the chairman of the Finance Committee and he has assured me that he will look favorably toward holding of hearings on the proposal to index our tax system when the requisite studies are completed. I oppose this amendment only because hearings have not been conducted on this substantive proposal. With the assurances of the chairman. I am confident that a tax indexing proposal will be before his committee in the very near future. After such hearings. Senators will have the benefit of exhaustive hearings and expert testimony on this subject thus have a sound basis for determining the impact and wisdom of various indexing plans.*",

The estimated cost of construction of the Kennedy carrier is $1.8 billion. The cost of procuring. storing. and delivering the fuel oil. at current costs. at todays prices. would be $570 million for that 15year period. That means the total price of procuring and propelling that nonnuclear Kennedyclass carrier would be $2.385 billion. Let us compare that to the cost of the nuclear Nimitz carrier. The total cost of that carrier. is $2.398 billion. To date this Congress. the House and the Senate. have appropriated and expended funds in the amount of $268.4 million. Those are dollars that are spent and gone and will be lost unless we dedicate those to the building of a nuclear carrier. So if we consider those appropriated funds we find that from this point on it would cost us $2.129 billion to build a nuclear carrier. That shows us very clearly that the nuclear carrier is less costly than the Kennedy carrier. Indeed we can procure a nuclear carrier for $556 million less than we could procure a Kennedy carrier. So the nuclear carrier. I say to my colleagues. is a quarter of a billion dollars less expensive. based on the current cost of buying fuel oil for the nonnuclear Kennedyclass carrier.

All of the American Qbserver groups were uniform in their conclusion that these elections were. in fact. free and fair. One Washingtonbased foundation. the Institute of American Relations. has produced what is perhaps the most comprehensive observer report of all those in attendance at this historic election. That fourmember group included. from the House side. Dr. Belden Bell who also happens to serve as deputy director of the Republican Study Committee of which I am a member. Mr. Speaker. this excellent report is worthy of close review by all of my colleagues. This report would clearly indicate that the conditions of CaseJavits have been met and that the President should act immediately to remove sanctions or. in the absence of such affirmative action by the President. the Congress should move accordingly to permit the same economic freedom to the new ZimbabweRhodesia as we now accord to many nations whose elections bear far less credibility.",

July 6. Arthur Malan \"Tinker\" St. Clair retired as the county clerk of McDowell County. \"Tinker\" and his lovely wife of 39 years. Elnora. will now live with one of their two daughters in Virginia. The 1935 graduate of Gary High School began his career in 1937 as a county schoolbus driver to help his father make ends meet during the depression. In 1948. he was appointed deputy sheriff. After serving for 10 years. under three sheriffs. \"Tinker\" served as an investigator for the prosecuting attorney and 9 years later was elected justice of peace for Browns Creek District. In 1965. he was appointed and then elected county clerk of McDowell. He subsequently overwhelmed opponents in the elections of 1968 and 1974. Mr. Speaker. I cannot say enough about \"Tinker\" St. Clair. As the Representative in Congress from the Fourth District of West Virginia. he is a close friend and adviser. I pray that all of us can carry out our duty to the public in the same manner he did. The State of West Virginia will miss him. McDowell County will miss him. I will miss him. We all wish \"Tinker\" and Elnora a very happy life. with their daughters Patty and Linda. and I am sure their grandchildren Kimberly. Eddie. and Mack will add to that pleasure. I am also very happy that \"Tinkers\" chief office deputy. Mrs. Hilda Taylor. has been appointed to fill out his term. Mrs. Taylor has also been a tireless public servant and will certainly carry on where \"Tinker\" St. Clair left off.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the House begins consideration of the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. I want to alert Members to two bills I introduced yesterday to establish protections for American consumers and dairy farmers. One of the bills would require foreign dairy producers to meet health and sanitation standards as stringent as those imposed on U.S. farmers and manufacturers. The other would require all products containing imported dairy ingredients to be clearly labeled as such. If we are establishing new trade relationships. they should be as open and fair as possible. At the very least. we should assure consumers that imported products are wholesome and protect domestic producers against an unfair competitive advantage now enjoyed by foreign producers. The Uniform Consumer Dairy Sanitation Act. a bill similar to one I cosponsored with the late Representative William Steiger in the last Congress. would set up an inspection program for foreign dairy products marketed in this country much like the existing meat inspection system carried out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Each exporting nation would have to take steps to assure that its milk processing plants and farms meet the same general quality grading and health inspection standards required of U.S. producers. USDA would monitor the systems to insure compliance with U.S. standards. It is especially important to beef up. our inspection efforts in this area. since only about 10 to 15 percent of foreign imports are actually examined now through random sample inspections by the Food and Drug Administration. This We of Russiavi roulette approach to public health fails to provide consumers with adequate protection against contaminated dairy products shipped to the United States. In recent yearS. more than 5 percent of those dairy imports that have been checked ended up rejected be-\" cause they were unwholesome and unfit for human consumption. If random samples have yielded such results. it is reasonable to assume that some unsafe imported dairy products are getting into",

I too would like to pause and share with you one spectacular example of the unique spirit that I feel is a common bond among us all. It illustrates a special spirit of red. white. and blue. and I feel fortunate to have been able to witness its development. Earlier this year. I visited with Mr. Harlon Lamkin. director of 164 Owasso. Oklahoma High School Band students who call themselves \"The Pride of Owasso.\" and for good reason. They had just been invited by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to participate in the Second Annual International Festival of Music. to be held in Dublin. Ireland. But before they could accept the invitation. they had to raise an estimated $150.000 for the expenses of the trip. Many people said it could not be done. it was simply too much money. That is where the true spirit of America came through. When all avenues of public or private assistance were explored and depleted. the teenagers. fellow students. and the whole community rallied together as never before. They mowed lawns. washed cars. and baked enough cakes to raise the necessary funds. The Owasso Band recently returned from Dublin. Ireland. where they won first place in the international competition against more than 70 other outstanding bands from around the world. They have brought honor not only to their community and Oklahoma. but to the United States as well. They have shown what goal setting. determination. and hard work can accomplish. These characteristics have been the hallmark of our great Nation. and these young people have shown us that instead of subsiding as some might think. these qualities of American life are actually flourishing with a renewed sense of excitement and challenge. I extend to Mr. Lamkin and the band members my heartiest congratulations. not for striving to receive the first place award. but for striving to achieve a level of performance that merits a first place award. That. I believe. is the true reason behind Americas success. The pride of Owasso. like the pride of America. has captured that special red. white. and blue spirit.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the debates regarding the establishment of a separate department of education. we have been assured over and over by the proponents that there will be a net savings of money to the American taxpayer. There are those of us who are a little skeptical about such claims. despite limitations on the number of new personnel which can be added to the department and other devices designed to allay our fears. I recently had occasion to look. in some depth. at the 1980 budget request for the other DOE. the Department of Energy. which is currently our newest department. A cursory reading of that request indicates that the total request actually dropped some $2.4 billion from fiscal 1979. \"Good job. DOE.\" we might say. We mightbut we should not. The major reason for the drop in the DOE request is: That portion of the budget for providing strategic petroleum reserves went from $3 billion in fiscal year 1979 to only $8 million in fiscal year Despite massive fuel shortages. and constantly rising demands from the Congress and the public that more resources be put into energy research. the Department of Energy actually requested $115 million less for energy technology. basic sciences. and conservation than in fiscal year 1979. The DOE budget request was not all cuts. however. There were two significant places (other than defense activities) in which the DOE requested more money than last year: First. regulation and information. and second. policy and management. Mr. Speaker. it is as those of us who have been opposing a department of education have been saying it is: A new departmentany new departmentwill want to grow and grow. While the Department of Energy was cutting its budget request by $115 million for research and development. it was adding $97 million for regulations and administrators. This is our newest department. but they learned the old tricks very quickly. Decrease the overall request. if you must. but continue to increase administrative and regulatory functions. There is no doubt that we will be seeing this same phenomenon in a few years if we vote to establish a department of education. This is but one more reason to vote against the bill. e",

This bill represents the final work product developed with the assistance and support of the forestry and financial communities to provide an effective financial incentive to help private. nonindustrial landowners manage their land for timber production. I felt it necessary to revise the original legislation based on further study and recommendations. I believe this bill which embodies these imorovements will create a viable and worthwhile program to encourage the practice of forestry. I plan to offer the measure in committee as a substitute to H.R. 3049. which I introduced earlier this year. Creation of the opportunity to draw together land ownership. working capital. and management required for longterm improvement in quality timber production on private forest lands is not only a worthy objective but one which will be needed to meet future timber demands. Recent surveys indicate timber production on private. nonindustrial lands. which accounts for 59 percent of all commercial forest land. must rise from 7.5 billion cubic feet in 1975 to 16 billion cubic feet in 2020. The data for the South shows that perhaps only about 12 percent of the nonindustrial acreage harvested each year is being reforested because of a conscious decision by the land0 -rmar. This works out to a loss of 1 million acres every year. Much of this land is in possession of people lacking the other two necessary ingredients of working capital and management skills.

While private homes and apartments are exempted. just about every other type of building where people work. dine. play. study. or shop will be affected.

President Carter proposed his 1980 budget in January of 1979. This original proposal called for outlays of $532 billion and a deficit of $29 billion. Last November the Congress passed the supposedly binding second budget resolution. which allowed spending to increase to $548 billion and the deficit to expand to $30 billion. And the story continues. Apparently the definition of binding has changed with this administration. It appears that the Congress will be presented with a third budget resolution(hopefully before we begin consideration of the first budget resolution for 1981that will call for outlays to climb to $564 billion and for the deficit to balloon to $40 billion. That is a total budget increase of $32 billion in spending and $11 billion in the deficit over the Presidents original budget figures. So much for fiscal austerity.

Used properly. words can inspire. redirect energies. cajole. support. and comfort. When we look at Lincolns great words they fit perfectly into the actions he took. The man who spoke the words of the Gettysburg Address did not simply mouth those wordshe believed them and he practiced them. His memorable words about the evil of slavery were backed up by his action to end slavery. The man who uttered those memorable words about saving the Union gave the last full measure of devotion to translating those words into deeds. Lincolns words and his actions were in harmony. not in discord. But when a Presidents words tell us one thing and his acts tell us another. the result is confusion at best and national tragedy at worst. It is my hope that today. Lincolns Birthday. reminds President Carter of the necessary connection between words and deeds.",

Mr. Speaker. it is clear that the dogmas of the Democrat Party. which has controlled Congress for the past 25 years. are out of date. The Democrats have brought our Nation a quarter century of economic mismanagement. In that period Federal spending has increased 700 percent. taxes have climbed 690 percent. and inflation has risen 300 percent. But. things do not have to be as bad as they are today.

We find a proposed budget for fiscal year 1981 that will raise the proportion of Federal revenue to GNP to 21.7 percent. the highest. most confiscatory peacetime burden in the history of the Republic. And we find that the Presidents budget projects a deficit of $15.8 billion for fiscal year 1981. a figure that many economic forecasters consider unrealistically low. Mr. Speaker. the American people have the right to know that this highspending. highdeficit. hightax Government the result of this Democrat administrations policies enacted with the support of this democratically controlled Congress.

For instance. just a week ago. in the Washington Post the Democratic majority leader boasted that during the last 4 years the Democrats in Congress have cut income taxes twice. Yet during that timethe amount collected from income taxes has more than doubledfrom $131 to $268 billion. Working American families know taxes are not going downthey are going up. Every time the people in charge of Congress talk about cutting taxes. American families should reach for their wallets. At the same time the Democrat leadership is creating another burst of inflation. Some people in charge of Congress actually claim that they are limiting spending. Yet they decided to spend $1.060.800. think of that. $1.060.800 just in this very minute that I speak. And they will spend that much every minute this year. Imagine how we could help working American families if the majority in Congress stopped spending money for just 1 hour60 minutes. If Republicans were in charge of Congress. we could cut inflation and create jobs for people. We would cut spending that helps bureaucrats. and hurts working families. We would pass a tax cut which would mean lower taxesnot higher taxes. For a change in policies. we need a change in leadership.",

Billing himself as a Washington outsider. he promised to rid the bureaucracy of waste and inefficiency. He said he would duplicate his reorganization effort in Georgia. He said we would cut the number of Federal agencies from 1.900 to 200. What he said. and what he has actually done are two different things. The Federal civilian work force has actually increased by 40.000 since he took office. He has not decreased the number of Federal agencies significantly. In fact. he has created two of the biggest bureaucratic nightmares ever imposed on an overregulated publicthe Department of Energy. and the Department of Education. He has hidden much of the growth in bureaucracy by \"contracting out\" the work. It has been estimated that as much as $10 billion is wasted each year by agencies farming out work they should do themselves. Unfortunately. President Carters reorganization plan needs reorganizing.

I am a cosponsor of the bill and one of 218 Members who signed the discharge petition which aided greatly in the expeditious consideration which this legislation is receiving from the House. H.R. 3567 simply proposes to prevent the decimation of a bona fide industry from the effects of an illadvised ruling by the Federal Trade Commissioners. The Commissioners in 1978 ruled that the territorial arrangements used by the soft drink industry for the past 75 years constituted unreasonable restraints of trade. This ruling was preceded by 7 long years of court battles and the final action taken by the Commissioners overruled the decisions of every lower court which had reviewed the arrangements. In my home State of New York. the soft drink industry is responsible for the employment of some 5.800 workers in a total of 116 plants. It is a major industry in a State which needs strong industry for its economic wellbeing. The present territorial arrangements practiced by the soft drink industry work to the advantage of the small businessman and also the consumer. Indications I have received from industry representatives show that if the FTC ruling were to stand the smaller bottler would be forced out of business or would be forced to become distribution arms for large bottlers. This would result in greater concentration and less competition in the industry and this could lead to both higher prices and in some areas reduced supplies. Using the present territorial arrangements. the overwhelming majority of soft drink bottlers are independently owned and 70 percent employ fewer than 50 people. From the consumer end. the price of cola in 1939 was 0.77 cents of 1 cent per ounce. today it costs 0.79 cents of 1 cent per ounce. Further variety of soft drink products is quite extensive with new products entering the market on a regular basis. When there is nothing wrong with a system why feel compelled to fix it. That is the question we must ask ourselves today. This Congress has gone on record on several occasions this year against arbitrary actions taken by the FTC under the guise of consumer protection. Their assault on the soft drink industry is wrong and this legislation must be passed before any further harm is done.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to speak in support of H.R. 3657. the Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act which. more importantly. is in support of independent small business. The passage of this act will clarify the standards by which the necessary licensing procedure can be properly judged in an effort to provide protection for the thousands of independent bottlers in the country. Without the protection of territorial licenses these independent businesses could well become swallowed up by huge corporate interests. The loss would have ramifications far beyond the bottling business alone. If only large regional bottling plants under the control of a handful of big corporate interests were to provide soft drinks to retailers. we would soon find that the small grocery stores. especially the traditional mom and pop stores in so many of our small towns and rural areas. would find supplies sporadic and limited. The big corporate bottlers would find it more profitable to service only the massive grocery chains in our heavily populated areas at the expense of the rest of us. In an era when we see the steady deterioration of small independent businesses under pressure from high volume. heavy cash flow corporations and a time when the small corner groceries are closing day by day under pressure from giant chains. we must preserve and protect those independent businesses that remain as an integral part of our American character. Critics of this bill claim that its passage will stifle competition and that the consumer needs more choice in the product. The truth is just the opposite. The facts easily dispute such weak argument. You only have to visit any grocery store to see the rainbow variety of soft drinks on display in every city. town. and crossroads in the country. As for competition. the overwhelming majority of the 2.150 bottlers in this country are independently owned businesses operated by the men and women who are residents of the communities that they serve. In the interest of independent business that is the backbone of our free enterprise system. we have the obligation to provide adequate protection for their licensing rights against the encroachments of big impersonal corporate interests.*",

However. the amendment does not limit the Administrators authority under the act to take action under emergency suspension provisions whenever he deems it necessary to protect human health and safety.

There is a proviso in this section which allows the Administrator to proceed with an emergency suspension action without completion of this peer review. however. the amendment specifically requires that this peer review be initiated promptly after such an order is issued.

June 17. 1980. an attempt was made to suspend the rules and pass this legislation: This attempt was defeated on a rollcall vote of 199 to 215 because of the opposition expressed primarily by our colleague Congressman LEVITAS. His opposition stemmed primarily because of the lack of the opportunity for Congress to review and. if necessary. veto regulation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under FIFRA. Such an amendment had been included in last years legislation. H.R. 3546. which is still in conference. This type of amendment is one of the issues that the conferees have not been able to reach agreement on in that legislation. Today. another attempt is being made to suspend the rules and pass this legislation. Vice Chairman DE LA GARZA is to be commended for his inclusion of an amendment providing for a twoHouse veto of pesticide regulations issued by EPA pursuant to FIFRA. Last week. I stated that I supported the concept of the oneHouse veto and I certainly want to indicate to my colleagues that I support the twoHouse veto and want to see this legislation move along through the legislative process. FIFRA is important to our farmers and with the appropriation bills now being considered. it is necessary that we get this authorizing legislaion approved and signed into law at the earliest opportunity. I urge adoption of this legislation. While I support the twoHouse veto provision contained in the DE LA GARZA substitute. I do not want my concurrence construed as an endorsement of the particular language as the best proposal for handling the legislative veto issue. However. it is acceptable and is certainly a step in the right direction. I will conclude by saying that the Wampler amendment in this bill. addressing the issue of \"peer review\" is in my opinion one of the most important provisions we could add at this time to the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide. and Rodenticide Act. I commend my colleague for authoring such a provision.",

The appropriations bills are moving through at this time. FIFRA has not had an authorization now. I believe. for 2 fiscal years. which means that while there has been no authorization the Appropriations Committee has continued to fund the program. That creates a serious problem because it does not permit the legislative committees and the Congress as a whole to put supervisory jurisdiction in the charter under which this program should operate into place. So. therefore. I would hope that this legislation is speedily passed by both Houses and signed int o law so that there can be authorization and so that the program will be administered by the Environmental Protection Agency under the directions of a congressional mandate. not according to the way they want to administer the program. I know th at many people share my concern that in the absence of an authorization .his year. there would be an effort madi to oppose the funding in this program. Consequently. I think it is very important that we move forward. Mr. Speaker. the final point I would like to make. again to agree with my colleague. is this: That while I support this legislation and the two House congressional veto provision which it contains. I do not want that to be understood in any way as diminishing the efforts which I and many other Members will make to establish other forms of congressional veto in other pieces of legislation where another form of veto would be more appropriate. necessary. and more effective.

Mr. DE LA GARZA. Having previously discussed the merits of the bill when it was considered on Tuesday. June 17. I shall confine my remarks today to the vice chairmans floor amendment. This amendment provides for a twoHouse veto of pesticide regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide. and Rodenticide Act. as amended. rather than the oneHouse veto that was sent to conference in the first session of this Congress. And which. by the way. still languishes there because the other body refused to go along with that measure.. As my colleagues will recall. the previous action the House took in the first session of this Congress with respect to the legislative veto provided: That a rule or regulation promulgated by the Administrator shall be transmitted to the House and Senate and . . . shall not become effective If within 90 calendar days of continuous session both Houses of Congress adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the rule or regulation or within 60 calendar days of continuous session one House adopts and transmits to the other House such a concurrent resolution and such resolution is not disapproved by the other House within 30 calendar days of continuous sessionfollowing its adoption and transmittal. .It is my understanding that our colleague Mr. LEVITAS. of Georgia. in opposing the passage of the bill last Tuesday. June 17. wanted the bill amended to encompass language similar to the socalled oneHouse veto. explained previously. I also understand that after considering the safeguards for prior consultation with the committees of the Congress required in the statutes of EPA. prior to the promulgation of rules and regulations pertaining to FIFRA. Mr. LEVITAs has modified his stance and will support the bill under suspension as amended by Mr. DE LA GARZA. I share Mr. LEVITAS concern for the need for legislative restraint over EPAs actions.

We instituted the draft for the first time. We had also experience with the draft in World War I. We had experience with the draft in World War II. Let me remind the Senator that in 1917 we registered over 10 million men in 1 day. In 1940 we registered 16 million in 1 day.

LEO RYANS concern in the case of such a catastrophe is comparable to the concerns which he expressed for constituents who became victims of a distorted program and actions of some misguided leaders of the Peoples Temple.

The good die young. the old saying goes. and it was certainly true in this case. He died simply because he was a good man whose desire to help others led him to that nest of unbelievable horrors in Guyana. But the measure of any man is his desire to help others. and LEO scored high under any means of measurement you can name. Even before he entered Congress in 1973 LEOs style of helping people through firsthand investigation was well established. In 1970 he spent 8 days at Folsom Prison in California to learn about conditions facing inmates. Even further back during 1966. he taught in a neighborhood high school following the Watts riots and visited Newfoundland to investigate the hunting of harp seal pups. For this latter effort he received a well earned \"Man of the Year\" award from the International Wildlife Foundation. Suffering and injustice. these were his only enemies. Aside from these more dramatic efforts. and long before the tragedy of November. LEO RYANS congressional efforts were also geared to helping resolve problems that plague everyday life for people.

He wrote letters. sent investigators out. held hearings with the Federal Aviation Administration and in the end. came to the District himself to see and hear for himself the disruption of family life that jet noise causes. He held that hearing on a Saturday morning and my constituents poured out their frustrations to LEo and his subcommittee members.

LEo approached his job with an enthusiasm and innovation that few could match. He tackled tough issuessuch as the collapse of the Teton Dam in eastern Ohio and corruption in the Immigration and Naturalization Servicewith an intellectual curiosity. an investigative eye and a tenacious zest for reform. LEO will be sorely missed. But we must remember that the greatest tribute we can give to him. to his memory. to his family and friends. are not tears or eulogies. heartfelt though they be. but a vow to rededicate ourselves to the goals he had. What were his goals? LEO had many. to be sure. But foremost among them was a very simple aim: to serve the people. Let us. his fellow Members of Congress. strive toward that goal in memory of LEO RYAN. who died as he lived. serving his country.0",

But in the short time I have been a part of this body. I have learned much about the many contributions he made to the House and to the people of the llth District of California he served so well. During his tenure Mr. RYAN developed a reputation for being a conscientious. hardworking Congressman who always did his homework. Whether it was on the floor. in committee. or in his district. LEO RYAN was always persistent in seeking solutions to the problems he faced. These are qualities every one of us should always aspire to.",

His career was the embodiment of the ideal of being a public servant. Ironically. it was his courage that led to his death. During his legislative career both here and in California. LEO RYAN frequently showed great courage as he sought to satisfy his intense curiosity and interest in problems he personally investigated. He once was confined to a California prison so he could experience the troubles it was having firsthand. something very few would attempt. In Guyana he again placed his duty above his personal safety in investigating the bizarre Peoples Temple which had victimized many of his constituents. The courage cost him his life. At a time when most people do not commit themselves to anything. the death of a truly committed person like LEO RYAN is especially tragic. The people of the llth District of California were fortunate in having a dedicated public servant like LEO RYAN represent them. Whoever they now elect to succeed him has a hard act to follow.*",

LEO RYAN was murdered by people who had rejected the institutions with which our colleague had associated himself and on behalf of which he was acting in his final hours. His murderers preferred instead the dissolution of all impersonal institutions of government in favor of an overruling. unmediated. socalled personal relationship with their governing leader. Thus freed from institutional restraint. with no codified check upon his personal powers of manipulation. this hoisted demigod absorbed their individual personalities into himself. and so rendered himself helpless to prevent his own self destruction. with all it portended. That should give pause to those who arrogantly dismiss government institutions as destroyers of individuality. To take even the most extreme example. a Solzhenitsyn could survive for years in the institutional horror of the Gulag. but he would not have survived for very long in institutionless Jonestown. If we could enter into communion with LEO long enough to hear his final testament. I think he would tell us: Restore the faith of all the American people in their institutions of government. work ceaselessly to make those institutions so strong and decent and secure and respected that anyone challenging them will be speaking to an empty room. To the extent we accomplish that. LEO RYANs tragic mission will have been redeemed.*",

School District. Those of us that supported the Mottl constitutional amendment to prohibit forced busing predicted massive busing would result in a needless use of- energy during a critical energy shortage. On September 27. 1979. I had occasion to visit with the very able superintendent of Columbus Public Schools. Dr. Joseph Davis. and he advised me that an accurate tabulation of miles traveled per week by the buses in the Columbus school system equaled six times around the world. Think of it. How much gasoline would it take to drive a bus around the world six times? Multiply this by the number of weeks school is in session. plus the number of school districts being involved in this type of social experimentation. and the energy consumption is beyond belief. The President seeks energy conservation through standby rationing authority. 55milesperhour speed limit. carpooling. and reduced thermostat settings. none of which would conserve enough energy to begin to match the energy wasted by providing fuel for busing for the purposes of forced integration. Six times around the worldcan you believe it?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under pressure from the OPEC nations. this administration has stopped buying oil for the planned 750millionbarrel strategic petroleum reserve. The reserve is expected to be this countrys main insurance policy against another oil embargo. This recent decision reflects an astonishing acknowledgment of national indecision and vulnerability. The Energy Department. which administers the oil stockpile. has not purchased oil for it since November of last year. With only 94 million barrels stored in three salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. the program is now more than a year and a half behind its original schedule. In addition to falling behind schedule. DOE has paid more than $27 million to three oil firms for services it has never received. The contracts entered into requires the Department make minimum payments even if the services are not entirely used. The Saudis have apparently threatened to reduce its oil production from 9.5 million barrels a day if the United States continues to build its petroleum reserves. A year ago this country was filling the reserve at a rate of more than 200.000 barrels a day. much of it Arab oil. By August of this year. it was down to 50.000 barrels a day. all of it Mexican. This month it has been zero. How is this great Nation to extricate itself from this dangerously weak position? Mr. Speaker. some of the options include the development of a synthetic fuels industry and a national conservation policy which offers direct grants to the residential sector and lowinterest loans and other incentives to the industrial and commercial sector. We must prove to the world. and OPEC in particular. that Americans can. in fact. overcome their need to consume more oil.

If we are going to spend military dollars. then let us do it in a fashion that will help the overall economy. If indeed we move into areas of high unemployment and we are able to get small businesses to secure procurement contracts in those areas of high unemployment. for each person that they will employ at about $16.000 a year we will be reducing the drain on the cost of keeping people unemployed. which amounts to about $17 to $19 billion a year for every 1 percent of unemployment. [] 1050 I think it is a specious argument to say that if we indeed repeal Maybank that it will be more costly to the Government. It will not. It will save the Federal Government money to the extent and degree that we move into these high labor unemployment areas. put people to work. and therefore. and thereby begin to reduce the cost of unemployment to the Federal Government. That cost. as I indicated. is about $17 billion each year for 1 percent of unemployment. I think the gentlemans amendment makes sense.

I disagree strongly with some of my colleagues on the question of repealing the socalled Maybank amendment. It ought to be repealed. I have not heard more inconsistencies in the well of this House in a long time. I want to tell my colleagues something. If you want to save money. if you want to create more jobs. and if you want to bring more of the free enterprise system into the Department of Defense. there is one way to do it. and that is to repeal the prohibition. What I would like to do is try to put into perspective what we are talking about here. In rounded numbers. this budget contains about $50 billion in procurement dollars. Looking at the Pentagons past record. about 70 percent of that is negotiated. There is not even a competitive bid on it. I do not quarrel with that. I am for that. because what we are talking about in that 70 percent. the vast bulk of what is in here is the major weapons systems that involve the security of this Nation. No one. certainly not this Member in the well. certainly not the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee. nobody wants to interfere with the national security of this Nation. What we are talking about is tracking a program that is in existence now for small businesses that increases competition for the goods of the Defense Department that are not essential to the national security. that roughly 30 percent that is put out on competitive bid and in an effort to get more competition and better prices per product in the Defense Departments budget. Let me just illustrate a couple of them to my colleagues. We have a program that nobody quarrels with: The small business setaside program.

It is all permissible. all bids must be reasonable and none will interfere with the procurement of strategic weapons or other items necessary for military preparedness. Some concern has been expressed that this is a regional issue. It is not a regional issue. it is national in scope. 1954 labor surplus areas would be afected by this program. These areas are in something like 300 different congressional districts. If my colleagues are thinking of voting against this. take a look at the small industry in your congressional district to see if they qualify for procurement under this program.

EDA. the title V regional commissions. the Farmers Home Administration loan and grant programs and the Small Business Administration programs.

This is not political preference. This is political favoritism. This is just simple national good sense to target the procurement of this country that we need for defense into the areas where we have the highest social need and economic and employment need in this country. Northeastern Minnesota is not now a distressed area. but it was 15 years ago. I want to tell the Members that a steel plant in my district could not get a barbed wire contract out of the Defense Department during those years to keep a few people off unemployment. off the welfare rolls. and keep them working and producing for this country.

Mr. Chairman. in the last year we have full figures. about 19 percent of the procurement went to small business and minority ccntractors. Mr. Chairman.

In our concern for providing the conventional military means to thwart the expansionist tendencies of the Soviet Union. we have overlooked a Soviet weapon Moscow holds over our heads which could devastate the West withouta shot ever being fired. Since the mid1970s the Soviet bloc has piled up a debt to the West estmated at almost $60 billion. Western bank claims on the Soviet Union and six Eastern European countries .have grown from $14.9 billion in 1974 to $59.6 billion in 1979. These figures represent hard currency debt to the West. Loans have been extended to the Soviet bloc countries on faith. I for one seriously question the faith we can put in the Soviet Union. These loans have increased inflation in the West. The Soviets have gotten priceless technology. grain. and machinery -in return for a totally unenforceable assurance that someday they will pay us back. Can the Soviet bloc ever generate enough hard currency to repay their debts? Do the Soviets have any intention of repaying us? Let us not forget that just last November Iran refused to repay the $10 billion it owed American banks. Luckily. American banks were able to recover most of their money. I shutter at the impact on this Nations financial community if the Soviet bloc were to default on amounts six times greater than the debt Iran refused to pay. The amount of money owed Western banks almost equals the total assets of Exxon and General Motors combined. I ask my colleagues: Has not the West been put in a most untenable position? Goods and money have been moving in one direction. Western banks are being used increasingly to finance Communist modernization attempts. We have created loans to pay ourselves for what we send to the Soviets. What is to stop the Soviets in a possible future time of severe confrontation from simply defaulting outright on these loans and bringing about the collapse of our banking system.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank my distinguished friend from Wyoming for his contribution and for his kind remarks about me. In conclusion. Mr. President. may I note that Republicans in the development of the platform process did something that I think has not been done by political parties before. We held some 10 regional hearings which provided a broad base of testimony and recommendations from all sectors of the country. all elements of our society and our economy. We listened very carefully to what people had to say. and many of the recommendations that they made to us were incorporated in our platform. Our deliberations in Detroit ran smoothly and finished nearly a day ahead of schedule. which demonstrates the unity not only of thought but unity of purpose of those who were gathered there to formulate and finally recommend to the convention a platform. Even on controversial issues there was every effort made to arrive at agreement and to preserve harmony and again to try to identify areas of consensus. This platform is a departure from the usual format. It is a thematic approach because it was our belief that public policy issues should be related to people in their capacity as individuals. in their capacity as family members. as residents of their neighborhoods. as functionaries of the workplace. as citizens of a great nation. and citizens concerned with the peace and security and the ultimate freedom of all people of this world. That is the thematic approach that was followed by our platform. In terms of specific issues. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a bulletized version of the specific positions and recommendations of that platform.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in June of this year. the tiny. northeast Indian state of Tripura was rocked by violence. More than 400 Bengals--ethnic immigrants from Bangladeshwere slaughtered by native Indian tribesmen. who resent the presence of foreigners in their remote border state. Fighting broke out for several weeks. as indigenous hill people attacked the ethnic immigrants. who have become a majority in Tripura since 1971 when war and starvation drove them across the border from their homes in Bangladesh. In addition to an estimated 400 dead. 50.000 were left homeless after dozens of refugee villages were destroyed. Tripuras chief minister said the mass killings had assumed \"genocide\" proportions. Although the slaughter in Tripura would probably not fall under the terms of the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. it might come very close. However. this type of violence is exactly what the treaty intends to curbthe harassment and extermination of racial. religious. and ethnic minorities. For 31 years. the Senate has sat idly by while a hundred Tripurastyle slaughters occurred. The genocide convention may not stop such incidence of regional violence. but it will raise the worlds consciousness and bring international pressure to bear against those who let such slaughters occur. It will provide an impetus for all civilized nations to protest. punish. and hopefully prevent mass killings. It is time we confront the realities of death and destruction that faces mankind in every corner of the globe. Let us join the forces against genocide. Let us at last join a fight that has enlisted 83 other nations as allies. Let us finally ratiffy the genocide convention.",

I know that many Members of the House of Representatives share my sentiment in commending the Republic of Panama for the friendship shown to the United States in admitting the former Shah of Iran to residence in their country. This act of humanitarianism on the part of Panama has undoubtedly taken a good deal of political courage and comes at a time when many other nations. though sympathizing with the plight of our hostages in Iran and the special problems created by the presence of the Shah of Iran in the United States. have nonetheless been unwilling to consider the Shah for asylum or have even retreated from earlier offers of asylum. This action by our small neighbor to the south. at the crossroads of the Americas. should. we all sincerely hope and pray. reduce substantially the dangers to our American hostages being held in Tehran by the international bandit. the Ayatollah Khomeini. I know that many Americans would like to join me in offering a modest word of gratitude to the Government and people of the Republic of Panama for providing this degree of assistance to our country at a time when we need it most. I am pleased that the smooth and peaceful implementation of the Panama Canal treaties has helped to establish the kind of harmonious relationship between our countries which has made possible this gesture of friendship on the part of the Republic of Panama. Sometimes you do not know who your friends really are until you have the occasion to call upon them for help. The Republic of Panama has responded when we needed that help most. and this act of cooperation. which might well help defuse one of the major international crises of this decade. is a good example of the true spirit of panAmerican friendship and bodes well for future cooperation between our two nations.",

Unfortunately. its demise is only temporary and we will see it again during the second session. Antirecessionary fiscal assistance was uniqueit was a Federal spending program that was actually allowed to expire. But rather than leaving it dead and buried. H.R. 5980 would breathe new life into this program. H.R. 5980 is an example of legislation at its worst. because its costs are so drastically understated. I have heard many Members remark that it is a bad program. but that they will vote for it because it will cost onlyand I use the word advisedly-$1.15 billion. But where will that money come from? It will have to be borrowed. and then we will continually have to borrow more and more to pay the interest on that original borrowing of $1.15 billion. Based on current longterm interest rates for Treasury debt issues. that mere $1.2 billion antirecessionary outlay in 1980 ends up costing the American taxpayers $16.940 million over the next 30 years to cover the compounded interest on the borrowing. In other words. we hand out the money in 1980 and get the political benefits next fall. but the taxpayers go on paying and paying for that extravagance long after the political gains have been reaped and forgotten. So when the House leadership decides to sneak H.R. 5980 back onto the calendar. remember. its price tag is not $1.15 billion. but rather the $16.94 billion the taxpayers will be footing for the next 30 or more years. This program cannot justify the expenditure of $1 billion. let alone $16.94 billion. but that is exactly what we will be sticking the taxpayers with if H.R. 5980 becomes law.",

LINDy BOGGS. which recognizes the actions of Thailand regarding the Kampuchean tragedy. The resolution puts this House on record as officially recognizing the great service and valiant efforts of the Thai Government and Thai people in their work to aid the Karnpuchean refugees. Thailand should be very proud of its humanitarian and generous actions in response to the tragedy. In the past 4 years. approximately 4 million Kampucheans have died as a result of the strife and famine in that nation. The horror which I viewed in Thailand and Kampuchea several weeks ago along with several of my colleagues is almost beyond comprehension. The sight of starving and dying people there have left me permanently affected. with visions of gaunt children indelibly marked in my mind. Currently. over 300.000 Kampuchean refugees are living in Thailand. The number of new refugees continues to multiply daily. Thailand is not a wealthy country. the Kampuchean refugees represent a new drain on the Thai economy and a large sacrifice for the Thai people. Therefore. Thailands response to the tragedy is even more remarkable and noteworthy. Thailand has opened its border to the refugees and has provided them with firstnation asylum. It has permitted the establishment of refugee camps on Thai territory where the refugees can live. Finally. the Thai Government has worked closely with International relief agencies and private groups to insure that the refugees are provided with food and other assistance. Our Government must recognize the actions of the Thai Government with a deep sense of admiration. Moreover. our Government must reaffirm our own commitment to help save the Kampuchean people. Thailand neither can. nor should be expected to shoulder the burden on its own. It is essential that we send food and other aid. In addition. we must accept into our country a reasonable number of refugees for permanent resettlement. All governments of the world should follow the example set by the people of Thailand in helping to put an end to the Kampuchean nightmare.*",

I am not sure that the workers in UAW fully realize how capable their negotiators have been in the settlements. But GM union and all other labor must see to it that business retains more capital funds. The Japanese automobile manufacturers are staying modern. I saw a recent statement that six of Toyotas eight plants were built between 1965 and 1975. I saw that Toyota with mechanized plants had direct manhours per vehicle of 1.6 compared to 3.8 for the United States. For American labor to stay competitive in the automobile market. Labor must allow business to retain more capital for reinvestment in new plants and machinery.",

Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of further explaining the instruction to the conferees which I am now offering. This instruction to the conferees relates to a nongermane amendment added by the Senate to the windfall profit tax bill. repealing the socalled costbasis carryover provisions of the 1976 Tax Reform Act. This particular provision went into effect as of January 1. 1977. Subsequently. in the Tax Reform Act of 1978. because Treasury regulations had not been possible. because it had proved to be unworkable and because there was a growing opposition to the measure. we retroactively postponed the effective date of the costbasis carryover provisions of the 1976 act until It is my instruction to the conferees. which I hope my colleagues will support. to accept the Senate bill to the extent that it repeals outright this provision of the 1976 act. There will be in all probability some effort made in connection with the previous question on the motion to instruct. to suggest that this provision should be simply amended rather than repealed outright. It is an unworkable provision. It works to the detriment of those people who are neither wealthy nor poor. who are the owners at death of substantial appreciated assets and in general the holders of nonliquid estates. where the appreciated assets might have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax. People who have substantial wealth normally are sufficiently liquid so they can pay their estate taxes without liquidating appreciated assets. People with modest holdings. family farms. small businesses and so forth. because much of the value of their estates may be concentrated in one nonliquid asset. may have to sell a portion of that appreciated asset in order to pay the estate tax and in so doing. under the costbasis carryover rule. they would have the untoward effect of a pyramiding of taxes at the time of death. having to pay a capital gains in addition to the estate tax. therefore. winding up with substantially greater estate taxation than the law previously imposed.",

We are all aware of the magnitude of the problem we face in solving our energy difficulties. If this amendment passes. Mr. Speaker. it will seriously jeopardize our ability to get the investment we need. at this time. into a new alcohol fuel program and that is a program that can move us forward toward solving this critical energy problem we have and I hope above all else that the Members of the Congress will realize the importance of this issue.",

Some of you are aware that our Ambassador to Colombia. Diego Asencio. has been shot along with possibly seven others at the Dominican Republic Embassy in Bogota. Colombia. It is now reported on the wire services that as many as 45 hostages are held. with at least 8 of them shot. These 45 men and women are almost all diplomats. including the Papal Nuncio Angel Ayerbi. These terrorized diplomats represent at least a dozen nations. it is reported. American businessmen who were attending this reception at the Embassy of the Dominican Republic are also held hostage. Heavy automatic weapons fire is continuing. Mr. Speaker. our President said that the tragedy of the 53 hostages in Tehran would not be moved off the front pages of our newspapers if he could help it. Unfortunately this has happened. No matter what the President of the United States desires. the Colombia hostages will dominate the news tonight and for days to come. We now have 95 or more hostages held around the world and I suggest Congress ought to directly enter into an intensive debate to figure out some solutions to prevent this madness in the future.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. Speaker. I know that no single group in this Nation supports the development and deployment of gasohol more than the Members of this body. However. I do not understand why we should be stampeded into supporting the gasoline tax exemption approach taken by the other body. Not only does the tax exemption approach raise difficult issues of fiscal planning in the highway program. but it constitutes a support mechanism which unduly shifts the financial burden of gasohol development onto those highway users unable to use gasohol. Mr. Speaker. gasohol. which is made of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent grain alcohol. is a regional fuel. The report of the alcohol fuels policy review published by the Department of Energy so states: Through 1985. the contribution of alcohol fuels is expected to be modest nationallyperhaps displacing as many as 40.000 barrels per day of oil once presidential initiatives are put into practice. Production will be limited by the capacity to convert agricultural and waste material into alcohol. The impact is likely to be much greater regionally. however. In agricultural states. alcohol fuels may become significant sources of local supply. The rapid deployment of gasohol in even a few States will benefit the entire Nation by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. However. the development of gasohol in just a few States when coupled with the gasoline tax exemption will drastically reduce the contribution made by those States to the highway trust fund. Without a corresponding reduction in their Federal aid highway funding through a change in the apportionment formulas. this gasoline tax exemption will create a huge windfall for these few States at the expense of those highway users throughout the vast remainder of the country who cannot readily benefit from gasohol.",

I want to affirm my support for gasohol and the development of a program to encourage gasohol production. We must not underestimate the importance of this alternative fuel in our efforts to conserve petroleum. However. I do not believe that the only avenue available to us to promote gasohol production is the current conference proposal to extend the present exemption of gasohol from the 4 cents per gallon Federal fuels tax. There are several problems with this approach. the most serious of which is the devastating impact on the major revenue source for our Nations highway program. the highway trust fund. This motion instructs the House conferees not to accept any conference provision which directly reduces revenues dedicated to the highway trust fund. Other approaches are available to encourage expanded gasohol production. such as a direct subsidy program. which do not reduce the funds available to preserve and upgrade our Nations system of highways. As we look toward the future and develop programs to conserve energy. we must remember the tremendous importance of our transportation systems in any conservation effort. Fuels programs. such as gasohol. should work with other efforts in the area of transportation. not against them. I urge my colleagues in Congress to support this motion.",

We should be asking to increase the gasoline tax fund simply to have in the trust fund what is already in it today. Beyond that. Mr. Speaker. we turned to the Alcohol Fuels Commission and asked them what the implications of this are. and they told us that there will be up to 15 billion gallons per year of domestic gasohol available by 1984. That means. with the credits the Senate has proposed. $600 million a year out of the trust fund. But that is only domestically. We are also told that it is anticipated that both IBrazil and the Philippines will have sufficient quantities of alcohol available for export by 1984. so that is another $600 million a year out of the trust fund. And that is a $600 million a year American subsidy of foreign production. If the Members can go home to their constituents and tell them that they voted for a Senate position which is going to give up to $600 million a year in credits to foreign companies and foreign countries to help them increase their alcohol production. they certainly have more courage than I. In conclusion. I would say. Mr. Speaker. that the proper course for us to take is to vote against tabling this motion and to vote in support of the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey so that indeed we will preserve the highway trust fund and at the same time support gasohol funding through the windfall profit tax and not at the expense of Americas highway trust fund.",

N.J. He was raised in the Drexel Hill area of Philadelphia before moving to Mansfield. Ohio. where he went to high school. graduating in 1949. Bishop Lang went on to Fremont College in Los Angeles where he graduated in 1956 with a degree in medicine. He went on for graduate work in medicine and anthropology at UCLA and then on to St. Albens Seminary in Los Angeles in 1962. He was ordained in 1965 at St. Augustines Old Catholic Church in Los Angeles by Archbishop Marchenna. That is Archbishop Richard A. Marchenna. Lang served as rector of Trinity House in Los Angeles from 1965 to 1975 and as head of the Old Catholic Mission in Nicaragua from 1975 to 1980. He is currently involved in finding a site for their new seminary for the Old Catholic Church. Now. Bishop Derek Lang serves as a bishop of the Old Catholic Church which first broke from the Roman Catholic Church in 1703 in Holland. The church was joined by a group of German Roman Catholics in the year 1870 after differing on the matter of papal infallibility. The archbishop with whom I checked is Archbishop Richard A. Marchenna at 836 East 40th Street in Brooklyn. N.Y. I realize the gentleman probably did not do the research himself. He had staff do the research.

Sixtytwo percent of all automobile trips in the United States are 5 miles or less. If only 1 percent of these trips was made by bicycles. we could save 131 million gallons of gasoline per year. There are over 105 million American cyclists. Over 9 million bicycles were sold in the United States in 1978. and between 1972 and 1978. bicycles actually outsold cars in this country. \"Pedal power\" clearly is on the upswing in our Nation. and more bikeways are being built in our communities.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise along with my colleagues. in support of House Joint Resolution 463. a resolution which designates the week of October 5th as \"National Diabetes Week.\" Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by either an insufficient supply of insulin in the body or by defects in the action of insulin. Produced by the pancreas this insulin is a key hormone in the control of many of the complex physical and chemical processes involved in the maintenance of life. in particular those processes which involve blood sugar or glucose. Before the discovery of insulin in 1921 by Dr. Frederick Banting. the prognosis for the diabetic was a tragic one. In fact life expectancy without outside sources of insulin to preclude excessive glucose accumulation in the bloodstream ranged between 2 months and 2 years. And although the discovery of insulin has extended life expectancies dramatically. we must remember that this is merely a treatment. not a cure. In the United States diabetes is still the fifth leading killer. It is the leading cause of new blindness and is a major direct and indirect cause of heart attacks and strokes. As many as 10 million Americans have been or will be affected by this debilitating disease and its prevalence is rising at the rapid rate of 6 percent per year. The only effective way to deal with diabetes is to continue the arduous task of research in order that a cure can be found. I am happy to point out that advances made in the last 10 years in this field have outpaced accomplishments of the previous 50. Yet more attention still needs to be focused on both increasing awareness of the disease and continuing the quest for a cure. Through my position on the LaborHEW subcommittee and as ranking minority member of the full Appropriations Committee. I pledge to not only expose the problem of diabetes. but to secure appropriate funding levels for the six national institutes which carry on biomedical research. We must continue to work through every appropriate channel in order that we can offer the victims of this dreaded disease not only treatments. but cures.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. about 3 years ago one afternoon my youngest son. a teenager. came to me and complained about having a tremendous problem with thirst. I kind of passed it off not thinking too much about it but suggested. after this continued a day or two. that he see our local doctor. He did so and a quick examination disclosed that he was a victim of diabetes. He went immediately to the hospital where his sugar count was found to be quite high. He then began a long and slow process of being reregulated and brought back into balance. From that day to this he still takes a daily injection of insulin and has learned to live with the disease we call diabetes. While I think that is a typical case. the thing about diabetes today is that it has become more and more a young peoples disease. If one studies it. one finds that the age level and incidence is going down and down. and the cases are being found not only in teenagers. but in preschool children and children just beginning school who fall in this group as well. They have to spend a lifetime learning how to live with it. We hope that the breakthroughs the gentleman from New Jersey referred to will be made and will open the possibility for normal life for these people once again. The thing that concerns me most is that there are literally thousands of people in this country today who have diabetes and are unaware of it. I think that is where the focus on National Diabetes Week begins. to get people aware of the problem. It is the unknown diabetic who can be struck by coma. who can begin to have irreversible vision problems. heart problems. and all of the things that go with diabetes that can be checked and stopped if they know about it. I think this is one important step we can take to bring up the level of public awareness and that can save a lot of lives and a lot of misery and many peoples health if we unanimously approve this resolution today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 10 million Americans suffer from diabetes. a disease which ranks behind only cancer and cardiovascular disease as our Nations third killer disease. Our national economy and the livelihoods of millions of workers are either partially or entirely victimized by diabetes. with $5.3 billion annually lost through wages and costs for health care and disability payments. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing by 6 percent per year. a rate which means that a child born today in the United States faces a 1in5 chance of contracting diabetes if he or she lives to age 70. The disease affects people of all incomes. races and ages. yet it goes untreated and unacknowledged by far too many. leading to much unnecessary suffering and death. The designation of the week of October 5 through 11. 1980 as \"National Diabetes Week\" would serve to focus attention on the symptoms and treatments for the disease. If treated properly. the diabetic can lead a normal. productive life thanks to insulin and a controlled diet. But. diabetes reduces life expectancy approximately 30 percent from the time of onset. and every month and year it continues without treatment is time that cannot be recaptured through medication. The causes and means of prevention of diabetes are unknown. While it is important to alert possible diabetics to symptoms and treatments. another crucial goal of this resolution is to focus attention on the need for increased research into the causes and cures of the disease. The inability of major research centers to raise funding for longterm projects on this disease is a problem which an increased awareness of the seriousness of diabetes might help remedy. I urge passage of \"National Diabetes Week\". 0",

It is difficult to mention the work of the USO without thinking of the unselfish and gracious contributions to our servicemen by Bob Hope. Bob Hope was not born in this country. yet he has become a flattering reflection of the Yankee character. By simply being himself. he continues to be an American representative to the world that we can all take special pride in. Bob Hope has probably been as honored as any American of his time.

This legislation is a much needed step in that direction and I commend it to my colleagues. Mr. President. I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate another matter incorporated in this measure which is also of importance to veterans with serviceconnected disabilities. During the markup of the Professional Special Pay Act of 1979 I introduced an amendment that corrects the great harm done to the CHAMPUS program unless corrected by December 31. 1979. The Secretary of Defense has indicated that he will no longer allow veterans with serviceconnected disabilities to take advantage of the CHAMPUS program. Instead. these people will have to go to a Veterans Administration or military medical facility to receive treatment. If implemented. these veterans would have to. in some cases. travel long distances for such care. causing a hardship. Additionally. the valuable doctorpatient relationship for these people would be broken if they would now be forced to obtain medical care from a different source. The House bill. H.R. 5025. was passed by the full House of Representatives on October 15. 1979. This bill would amend title 10 of the United States Code to provide that any veteran with a serviceconnected disability may not be denied medical treatment under CHAMPUS.0",

He continued in the 1940s. developing Federal housing programs. Although he had left Government employment by the 1950s. he did not abandon public causes. He was international president of Bnai Brith from 1953 through 1959. and he was appointed by President Eisenhower to be a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly.

Upon returning to private life. he engaged in international banking and finance and eventually became a partner in Salomon Bros.

As the majority leader has already noted. the constitutionality of Public Law 9567. which exempts Members of Congress from paying State and local income taxes in any State except that from which they have been elected. is now under court challenge in Maryland. I will not object to the adoption of this resolution. Nor will I speak at length on the subject to which the resolution pertains. On a number of occasions in the past. I have expressed my opposition to this law whose constitutionality is now under challenge in both the Federal and State courts in Maryland. I opposed the proposal when it was first introduced in Congress in 1975. I opposed it again in 1977 when it was reintroduced and I opposed it when it was finally enacted into law. I continue to oppose it today. I oppose it for the simple reason that the law gives outofState Members of the Congress living in Maryland a free ride. it discriminates in favor of such Members who enjoy the whole panoply of excellent public services available in Maryland. but who unlike all other residents. do not pay income taxes to support these services. Members of Congress. as citizens. should accept the responsibilities of citizenship. including the payment of State and local income taxes. As I have stated previously. I will not impede the adoption of the resolution now before us. Nor do I oppose the pending court action. The time has come for the citizens of Maryland and those Members of Congress who are affected by the challenged law to have the matter resolved at last. The pending case will do just that. I also welcome this test case because I know that. in the end. the position I support. together with my colleagues from Maryland and representatives of the Maryland State government will be vindicated.

The argument surrounds whether an additional $22 billion to $24 billion in tax could best be used by developing alternate sources of energy or could best be used by the oil industry in increasing production in tier 2. Mr. President. I suggest that we reach a point of diminishing marginal returns that borders on the misallocation of resources if we think that that $24 billion is best spent trying to increase the production capacity of tier 2 oil. because clearly there is a much stronger production response in other forms of energy. Even within the context of the debate on the windfall profit tax. I think that one of the points the Finance Committee focused onas I know a number of other independent studies focused on. such as the Congressional Budget Officewas this: Where can you give incentives. where incentives will produce additional oil? We feltand the Congressional Budget Office and any number of people who testified before our committee feltthat the biggest response would come in new discoveries and tertiary oil. Yet. the opposition to this amendment is made in the name of increased production. I do not think that the opponents of the amendment or any others have demonstrated how or why production will decline if we increase to 75 percent or by how much that decline will take place.",

    "speech": "I wonder whether the Senator is familiar with the impact of his amendment on the construction of the Alaskan gas pipeline. Those are resources already discovered. not transported. They have been discovered. ready for transportation since at least 1975. They were discovered in 196810 percent of the Nations gas reserves. The Government. this administration. asked the industry that has developed the Alaskan North Slope to participate in the equity and debt financing of the construction of the Alaskan natural gas pipeline. The industry just committed itself to $4 billion. This amendment goes from 60 percent to 75 percent. We are checking this now with the Congressional Budget Office. It is my understanding that the impact of going from 60 percent to 75 percent is in the range of $10 billion to $15 billion. Strangely enough. that is the cost of the gas pipeline at the current estimatesabout $15 billion. Why should the Senators amendment take from the revenues from Prudhbe Baywe are talking about existing production of tier 2 oilthat cash flow. after normal corporate taxes? These are aftertax dollars which normally would be invested in facilities necessary for the transportation. production. and development of oil or gas. That is the first portion of Prudhoe Bay. incidentally. I am not even dealing with the question of how much it will cost to fully develop Prudhoe Bay. Why should the Senator take the money away from the companies which have agreed to put their aftertax dollars into a gas pipeline and put the money into the Treasury. and why should we debate next year whether we will put it into the natural gas pipeline? Why does the Senator want to take that money and put it into the Treasury with all the handling cost coming through Washington? Why should they not be permitted to leave that money flowing through the industrial base of the country in developing the transportation facilities for our gas? The Senator must be aware of the impact of this on Prudhoe Bay.",

    "speech": "I think the Senator is correct to point out that his State of Alaska does have a number of oil wells that do fall into the two tier category and that these oil wells will indeed be taxed. Of the total revenues of about $22 billion to $24 billion that will be raised by this. about $5 billion of that will be Alaska oil. I am not at all certain that there are not a great number of projects in this country that merit consideration for financing by private sector companies. That might indeed result in greater energy production. It is in context of that thought that we want to increase the tax on tier 2 oil so as to obtain the revenues that can be used to stimulate the growth of energy production in this country as a whole in sources of energy much more than simply oil and gas. If we take the narrow approach on the particular amendment. we have to deal with what is the production decrease as a result of increasing the tax from 60 to 75 percent. I really wish to see someone come up with that figure. It is quite reasonable. I suppose. to argue that if you had more money to spend. be you an oil company or a citizen. you would spend it on a number of activities.",

This bill totals $160.4 billion. an increase of about $6 billion over the administration request and an increase of about $3.4 billion over that approved by the House. This legislation recognizes the serious state in which our defense establishment has reached during the 4 years of the Carter administration. While it obviously does not contain all of the programs I believe as essential for funding in the current fiscal year it goes further in that direction than either the budget request or the Housepassed bill. In this connection I will offer at least one amendment. that being an amendment to restore to the bill $255 million for reactivation of the battleship New Jersey. By including this reactivation the Senate can place into the Navy force structure in about 1 year a powerful fighting vessel at about oneseventh the cost and in about onefifth the time that a new ship of equivalent value would require. I will speak at greater length on this subject when my amendment is considered. Mr. President. ths legislation includes a number of increased pay proposals. various bonuses and incentives for both regulars and reserves. an increase of $3.5 million for tuition assistance and an educational ass.stance test program. I plan to reintroduce next year my GI education bill which is badly needed by the services and which should not only encourage military enlistments but should enhance retention of well qualified enlisted and officer personnel in both active and reserve forces. Mr. President. one of the more important aspects of this bill is the appropriation of $51.3 billion for operation and maintenance.

We have other priorities that are much higher now with the new. modern weapons of war. We would be better off to spend this $255 million on new ships of the future. The Navy has problems recruiting and retaining personnel. In fact. the Navy is experiencing personnel shortfalls. although the situation has improved recently. Spare parts and support for many of the systems on the ship are not available and new sources and production lines would have to be established at an additional cost. One of our problems today with the B52 is when parts wear out. and they have to have new parts. it is tremendously costly to get an industry to establish a new producton line. They cost probably 10 times as much as they should. This is a good battleship. but we have other priorities that are much more important. in my estimation.

I will vote for the amendment by my colleague from South Carolina to add $255 million to the fiscal 1981 Defense Appropriations Act to reactivate the battleship New Jersey. His proposal .represents a prudent approach to strengthening our naval capability more quickly and at a more reasonable price than could otherwise be achieved. * There are several reasons why I take this position: First. reactivation of the New Jersey is estimated to cost far less than it would cost this Nation to construct a new ship of this size and capability. Second. this reactivation and deployment of the New Jersey to the fleet. where it is needed. is expected to require far less time than would be necessary if we built a new vessel. Third. there is strange testimony from senior Navy admirals that the manpower needed to operate this ship would be available when required. despite the Navys present crisis in retaining more highlyskilled senior enlisted personnel than would be necessary for the New Jersey. In addition to the expression of interest from former Navy personnel about reenlisting for the opportunity to serve aboard such a highlyregarded vessel. there is evidence that the Navy is beginning to improve the recruitment picture for the lessexperienced sailors needed to man the New Jersey. I also might point out that the large increases in military pay and benefits contained in this appropriations bill. and in the fiscal 1981 Defense Authorization Act already signed into law. can be expected to further improve the Navys manpower situation. A fourth reason to support the reactivation of the New Jersey is that the Navy already is studying several proposals to make excellent use of this ship to increase its capabilities to meet successfully its wartime and peacetime responsibilities. The proposals range from adding vertical cruise missile launchers to greatly enhance the New Jerseys firepower. to using the ship as a flagship for a surface warfare strike task force. to assigning it to a carrier task force or Marine amphibious force to support those types of operations. Mr. President. I believe these reasons are persuasive. and urge adoption of this amendment to strengthen our Navy through reactivation of the battleship New Jersey.*",

Coming here brings back many wonderful memories of my service here on the Hill. most of which. of course. was in the other body. I do have cherished recollections of a 9month period where I was Presiding Officer. Those days were not easy. and they were days when the friendship of the people on both sides was of utmost importance to me. and for that friendship and support I am most grateful. I think it is a matter of record that in my 28plus years in Washington. 25plus were in the Congress of the United States. Those were wonderful. wonderful times for myself and not just because it was longer than elsewhere but because of many other reasons. Gerry Fords heart is still on Capitol Hill. and for those many years I blame only my constituents. of course. because they either did not know better or were kind enough to send me back. and those will be memories that will be indelibly written on my heart as well as my mind. On behalf of my wife. Betty. and myself we thank you. You may not remember but just by happenstance the other day Betty was sorting through some things. and when she had her mastectomy. her cancer operation. there was an actual resolution approved by the U.S. Senate and signed by all Members of the Senate wishing her well. I thank you again for that consideration. I thank you for your friendship and I congratulate you on the great achievements and the wonderful service of this part of our Federal Government.

It is an outrage. all right. and I certainly hope that this body will not even dignify the matter by giving it serious consideration. We ought to pass without delay legislation such as House Concurrent Resolution 292. which I have introduced to put an end to any further talk of reducing by direct Government tax the meager income security of senior citizens which this Government already reduces indiscriminately through the hidden tax of inflation.

Apr. 27. 1980] The Carter administration has come up over the last few years with some mindboggling examples of lusting after the public purse to fuel one or another of the budgetbusting. inflationary programs so dear to the liberal heartand so devastatingly and directly responsible for the inflationary fires in which the nation writhes. The Carterites wanted to tax your fringe benefits as income. kill your deduction for charitable contributions. cut your Social Security benefits. raise the minimum age for eligibility as high as 70even. at one time. drive a stake through the struggling heart of your Social Security burial benefit. Well. by dad. they didnt get away with it. Roars of public outrage drove them scuttling back across the drawbridges protecting their bureaucratic fortresses. But today. pensioners. a new warning.

I am today introducing legislation which will provide for the payment of pastdue supplemental security income beliefits to the representative payee of a deceased beneficiary. This legislation would prevent future inequities such as occurred to a constituent of mine. Ms. Jeanine Smith. in 1974. Ms. Smith applied for SSI benefits on behalf of her grandmother. Rosette Guidet. who had recently been placed in a boardandcare facility for the aged. While her application was being processed. Ms. Smith paid a monthly advance payment of $250. Two months later. and without ever having received any SSI checks. Ms. Guidet passed away. The Social Security Administration then denied payment of the SSI checks to the granddaughter. Ms. Smith. for reimbursement. This is because section 1631(b) of the Social Security Act provides that money due a recipient who dies can only be paid to the deceased individuals eligible spouse. Mr. Speaker. this provision of law is inequitable and unreasonable. Since the courts have recently ruled that posthumous reimbursements to representative payees are not allowed by law. there is a real possibility that qualified potential SSI beneficiaries will be refused muchneeded care or services until the administrative paperwork on their claims has been processed. This can take weeks or months. even when there is no doubt about eligibility. Similarly. recipients whose checks are late may find creditors reluctant to provide for their care if the creditors know that posthumous reimbursements to representative payees are not allowed by law. This cannot be allowed to happen. It is unfair to our Nations SSI beneficiaries. it is unfair to creditors. and it is not in keeping with the purposes of the SSI program. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker.

The cost of energy. particularly foreign oil. is the majok factor behind the runaway inflation and unemployment. In 1980 the United States will spend in excess of $80 billion on oil imports. nearly half of all the oil we consume comes from abroad. For consumers the price of gasoline and heating oil has doubled in most cases during the past year. Creating a national energy program that is responsive to consumers and that is under public control is the key to solving the economic problems we face. Unfortunately. very little has been done so far to deal with the major obstacles: the need to lessen the dependence on foreign oil and to curb the inordinate control that the big oil companies exercise over the entire energy field. the need to control and roll back the prices consumers pay for energy. and the need to create new energy sources. Today I am introducing the Federal Oil and Gas Development Act of 1980 . the purpose of which is: To protect the rights of the American people to the oil and gas resources that exist on Federal public lands. To accelerate the development and production of the enormous oil and gas resources that exist on Federal lands.

Finn. who will be retiring this June. A graduate of the Yale University. Mr. Finn began his long career in the Shelton school system in 1937 as an instructor in science. Soon thereafter. Mr. Finn embarked on a football and track coaching career that would bring him and the entire city tremendous pride in the years to come. Under his tenure the golden years of Shelton Gael football began. culminating in an impressive record of 114 victories. 46 defeats. and 15 ties. Many of those fine victories and several narrow defeats came at the hands of higher classification teams. To achieve such greatness consistently in an area of the State where football excellence and heated rivalries are the order of the day Is a truly remarkable achievement. His last team won the title in 1961. which left no one unconvinced of his high standards and dedication to the development of his players as adults. That year he became principal of Shelton High School and later became assistant superintendent of schools. In 1975. Mr. Finn was named superintendent of schools in Shelton. a position which he has held with distinction ever since. Under his administration. the Shelton school system has flourished into one of the States finest. As testimony of this. I speak each day with many families that have recently or are planning a move to Shelton due to its fine community living and superior school system. Edward C.

He has listened to each persons special concern. and dealt with each of us with complete fairness. I deeply appreciate his help in matters of personal importance to me. Wherever he could. BOB has gone down the line to offer that special kind of help. I know he will be missed on the Appropriations Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation. where he most ably served. He will certainly be missed by all of his friends and colleagues that served with him over the years. I wish him. his wife Marilane. and family every success in the future.",

Perhaps some of the Members might be familiar with that figure. I see him beating the brains out of any athletic competition. more often than not. I see that same figure carrying the fight through his career for what is right as God gives him the light to see what is right. The words are Shakespeares. from Henry V: To imitate the action of the tiger. stiffen the sinews. And if that is an apt description of BOB at his best in working for the success of a cause in which he believes unwaiveringly. it also describes in a sense. in the feline sense. his political career. BoB has had several of his nine political lives already. but he has several left. Speaking of Illinois. if I remember correctly. there was a Representative. a former Member of this body. who served in this body. never served in the other body. never served as a Governor. but the first thing you know. he was President of the United States. One of these days. if the people of this country are in the market for a fellow who thinks as he pleases and says what he thinks. finds that refreshing. I would not be a bit surprised if we might all be addressing him as Mr. President Duncan one day.",

It is just unfortunate. however. that a man of the caliber of BOB DUNCAN has to leave before hearing these things on the House floor. I am sure that many Members have expressed great regrets to him personally. but I think it is still a different matter to publicly say the things that perhaps are on the minds of many of us concerning BOB DUNCAN. He was someone who I became very close to because of his work on the transportation appropriation subcommittee. I know that I speak for many Members of the House Authorization Committee. when they authorized the projects to go to him. they know that they would be treated absolutely fairly and with utmost honesty. He has been a person who I think every Member had great confidence in. I think we would all like to see everyone else emulate him. I know on behalf of New York. he took our special problems into consideration. I know that he also scrutinized every appropriation that he ever signed off on himself personally. as well as having all the great detail right at hand and personally took control of that subcommittee like no other Member I believe ever did. So it is going to be a great loss. not only to the Congress. and as my predenessor said. to the district from which he came. but I hope and I certainly pray that he has a great future ahead of him.

He is as different. as distinct. as honorable and sometimes as onery as anyone in this House. In all seriousness. however. underneath BoBs bravado. we find a sharp individual and a serious vein. Because BOB DUNCAN is one of the ablest Members here. When he steps up to debate. his presentation is strong. rapid fire. and certain. His affability disappears. yet his sense of decorum and politeness is still there. His arguments are persuasive. BOB DUNCAN probably has to restrain himself from getting involved in all discussions on the floor. He follows everything like a hawk. And he is qualified to speak on just about everything. In fact. BOB is one of the most brilliant Members of Congress. Perhaps my affection for him is rooted in the fact that we are fellow members of the 88th Club. the group of freshmen elected in 1962 and 1963. His wife. Marijane and my wife and I have enjoyed a warm special friendship through the years. BOB DUNCAN is an affable \"Scotchman\" and I hear. he might be a snuffdipper. If anyone ever took Carl Vinsons place. it would be BOB. I am told Mr. Vinsons old spitoon still has a place on the House floor and that place is presided over by one BOB DUNCAN. Our friend from Oregon is truly a unique individual. a talented man who protects the national interest and a patriotic fellow who love his country. We shall always hol dhim in respect and affection.

Anyone who does not believe that should have been to the conference of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday. BOB DUNCAN was in charge all the way. He was in charge just the same as he has been during our hearings on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. BOB DUNCAN is able to get from witnesses information that is absolutely necessary and essential. When BOB holds hearings he is in complete control. and this year those hearings filled. as I recall. 8 volumes and some 6.500 pages of testimony. My colleagues will find BOB questioning and probing witnesses on most every page. When we find someone like BOB who is so dedicated to what he is doing as to be able to pull out of the witnesses the proper information at the proper time. we find we will be making good legislation. When we stop to think about the Transportation Subcommittee that BOB chairs. we find that he has left his mark on the safety people enjoy as they travel by air. highway. rail. and water. He has seen to it that we are a little safer today than we were yesterday. We also have more conveniences. more miles of highway. and better transportation systems because BOB worked so long and hard. This chairmanship is not a parttime job.

Thirtyeight years have passed since this sorry episode in our history. It is incumbent on the Government of this country to review carefully the circumstances which gave rise to the internment of some 110.000 Americans of Japanese ancestry. and 1.000 Aleut civilian U.S. citizens who were relocated at about the same time.

Mr. President. I feel sure that all of us are tremendously concerned about the plight of our Nations economy. We seek solutions to these economic problems but we know the problem is complex and requires carefully planned and executed actions on several fronts. An excellent anlaysis and discussion titled \"The Causes of Recession\" was printed in the May 15. 1980 issue of the Wall Street Journal. In that article the author states that: If we see that the recession was basically caused by inflation. Government spending excesses and tax increases. we have some hope of designing a mix of policies that both moderates the recession and builds a sound base for the next recovery. If instead we blame the one man (Mr. Volcker) who started down the right road. we will end up fighting the recession with yet another burst of money creation. and doom ourselves to another and more virulent repetition of the inflationrecession cycle we are just now experiencing.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as a cosponsor of S. 2635. the Small Business Energy Conservation Act of 1980. I strongly urge the passage of this legislation which would provide sorely needed assistance to qualified small businesses to undertake energy conservation projects. Specifically. S. 2635 would provide small businesses that have proven track records with longterm. low interest financing through the bond market for acquisition of innovative. energysufficient equipment. Under this legislation. SBA is authorized to guarantee payment of principal and interest by small firms for energy equipment and facilities that are financed by taxexempt municipal or State bonds. It should be noted that SBA is allowed to issue similar guarantees to qualified businesses for acquisition of pollution control facilities. This program is one of SBAs most successful programs: In the 31/2 years of its existence. the pollution control program has had only one default. and because of the security of that transaction. it is not anticipated that this default will result in any net loss to SBA. In addition. the revolving fund for payment of guarantees under the pollution control program has grown substantially from $15 million to $21 million through guarantee fee payments paid by the small business concerns who have qualified for this program. Mr. President. this success can easily be realized in the field of energy conservation through S. 2635. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in a recent study estimates that small businesses account for 25 percent of the total energy used by manufacturing and 6 percent of total U.S. consumption. OTAs review of the assistance offered under S. 2635 indicates that by 1990 the equivalent of 300.000 barrels of oil per day could be conserved and by the year 2000 a savings of 450.000 barrels of oil per day could be achieved. This legislation represents but one of a number of steps that this Nation must take to combat the present energy crisis. This Nations reliance on insecure foreignsource oil threatens our economy and national security. In the shortterm. the only effective weapon that we have against OPEC is energy conservation and measures which enhance this effort. If given the necessary financial tools. businesses will continue to play an everincreasing role in curtaiiing our consumption of scarce energy resources. I urge the adoption of this legislation as a small but important step in this direction.*",

I also understand that the Bon Secour Refuge which the Senate is considering may have a number of worthwhile benefits for wildlife. I am concerned. however. with the budget implications of this new program. This authorizing legislation will add $25 million to an already strained Federal budget. Mr. President. there are a number of projects like this one which are deserving of our consideration. The problem as I view it. however. is that even though this specific project may be worthwhile. as more such projects are considered and approved the ability of Congress to mandate a fiscally responsible budget becomes almost impossible to achieve. The Nation is now watching Congress closely to see if it will meet its responsibility of creating a sound fiscal policy. One of the surest methods of achieving this goal is to create new spending programs only in the direst of circumstances. Thus. while I will not object to the proposed legislation. I would urge my colleagues to remember. as the session proceeds. the economic crisis before the Nation and our need to make hard decisions on higher levels of Federal spending.* The bill was considered. ordered to a third reading. read the third time. and passed.",

Adoption of this legislation would. I believe. lend greater consistency and content to American actions taken to date imposing trade sanctions on the Soviet Union. Those sanctions can only be diluted or circumvented if they are not actively supported by our allies.

As you may know. last Monday in a 5to4 decision. the Supreme Court re.versed the lower courts decisions and ruled against the State of Utah in a case which involves the ability of the various public land States to freely exercise rights and privileges granted them under the bilateral compacts which admitted them to the Union. As a result of that opinion. Mr. President. the efforts of the Secretary of the Interior. Cecil Andrus. to clear away all pending in lieu land selections in the Western States have been thrown into chaos. Resolving this longstanding controversy in a fair and equitable manner is absolutely necessary to the current efforts to develop and bring to the marketplace the vital energy resources which underlie these lands. The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Powell. the Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Blackmun. and Mr. Justice Rehnquist eloquently details the historical and legal background of the case. By virtue of the reasoning therein expressed. Mr. President. I am introducing at this time. the Indemnity Lands Act of 1980 and respectfiully request its prompt consideration by my colleagues in the Senate. The opinion reads as follows: [Supreme Court of the UnitedStates. No. 7815221",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the most recent action by an agency of the Federal Government in the name of \"equal employment opportunity\" was the requirement. promulgated on August 22. 1980. by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. that Federal court employees and judicial officers must thereafter be identified according to a listing of \"race/national origin\" groups that includes the separate subcategories \"Hebrew\" and \"Arabic.\" This is the first time in our history. so far as I know. that the Federal Governmert has asked that \"Hebrew\" employees be so identified. It is. in my view. an ominous act. On September 26 a second notice was distributed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. courts that. in effect. withdrew the requirement because \"it appears that the prospect for any use of the information is too remote to warrant insistence on its collection.\" But that such a designation of Federal employees could even have been contemplated. however. much less set forth as a requirement. is nonetheless alarming. Clear proof. as if any were needed. that continued vigilance by those of us who care about such matters is imperative. I ask that the August 22 memorandum be printed in the RECORD.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the more recent atrocities which has been occurring in Indochina concerns the genocide being carried out against the Hmong tribal refugees in Laos. A recent article in Readers Digest illustrates the extent of the torture being inflicted upon these individuals. The horror stories apparently are countless. Tribal refugees are frequently attacked through the use of poisonous gasses dropped by helicopters and planes. The most serious factor about these poisons. which the refugees call \"rain.\" \"gas.\" or \"smoke.\" is that they cannot escape from the effects of the chemicals for they contaminate the water. plants. animals. and fields. The \"rain\" falls in various colors. Yellow and red tend to be the most serious. killing those who contact it directly. The green and bluegreen rains tend to be less lethal yet victims usually suffer from vomiting. bloody diarrhea. fever. bleeding through the nose. and dizziness. According to the article the present Hmong survivors living in Laos \"now face a terrible future. for they are the targets of a deliberate. calculated policy of extermination.\" During the Vietnam war the Hmong were the backbone of the American resistance against the Communist forces in Laos. Seeking revenge for the actions of the Hmong forces. the Communist forces in Laos and Vietnam have been deliberately gassing the Hmong people since the American withdrawal in 1975. Untold thousands have died from gassing. starvation. disease. and many others have been shot attempting to escape to Thailand. Mr. President. it is critical that all Senators be fully informed on this issue. and I ask that a copy of the article. written by Ms. Jane HamiltonMerritt. and entitled \"Gas Warfare in Laos: Communisms Drive to Annihilate a People.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to use this opportunity to call to the attention of the Senate what I believe to be a serious breach of the administrative law judge system. While this is only one specific case. it may well illustrate a problem Government wide. The Federal Trade Commission has for several years been pursuing an antitrust case against the Nations three largest cereal manufacturers. The administrative law judge handling the case was Harry H. Hinkes. who decided to retire before the case was brought to a conclusion. Realizing that the matter would have to be retried and reresearched under a new ALJ. FTC Chairman Pertchuck approved a contract totaling $72.000 to retain Mr. Hinkes involvement in the case. I suggest that this gravely impunes Mr. Hinkes independence from the FTC and his objectivity in judging the case. Even though Chairman Pertchuck removed himself from the Commissions consideration of the contract itself. it is known that he phoned Mr. Hinkes to urge his acceptance of the offer. I sincerely hope that the new Congress will take a long hard look at theperformance of the ALJ system. reviewing the testimony taken at the oversight hearings last September by the Consumer Subcommittee. and recommend substantive changes where they are appropriate. It is not too much to expect from this quasijudicial system that it is fair and free from biased influence. If this country continues to rely on regulation instead of law to achieve our various objectives. then our citizens must be assured of complete and objective consideration of their cases. Thank you.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on November 23. an article appeared in the Chicago ExpressNews by Maury Maverick that called to mind the extraordinary patriotism of a truly extraordinary manthe late Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. We remember Paul Douglas today for his contribution to this Nations social legislation for his brilliant academic career at the University of Chicago. and for his three outstanding terms in the U.S. Senate. But. in this article. Mr. Maverick. who is himself the son of a great Texas Congressperson. portrays another Paul Douglas. That was the renowned economist. who. at the outset of World War II. used his substantial political influence to secure a special favor for himself. Mr. Maverick wrote: It was 1942 and a company of enlisted Marines was about to graduate from Paris Island. S.C.. the East Coast boot camp for leathernecks. A drill instructor spoke his piece by congratulating the boots for their accomplishments. Up and down the line he looked at young men in their teens. Then his eyes came to a man with snow white hair. It was PFC Paul Douglas. 50 years of age. Prof. Douglas could have remained a civilian or become a colonel at the snap of his fingers. But Paul had a thing in his gut about the plain people of his country. he identified with them. Pulling strings is what got him to the Marine enlisted mens boot camp. where he neither gave nor received any quarter. Paul Douglas went on to fight in some of the most savage battles of the Pacific war. in places with names like Okinawa and Pelelieu. He won a Bronze Star for \"heroic achievement.\" And he carried for the rest of his life the scars of the wounds he sustained on Okinawa. Senator Paul Douglas was one of the finest men to ever have graced this Chamber. He left for us an example of compassion. integrity. and unsurpassed couragemoral. physical. and intellectual. He has not been and will not be forgotten. So. Mr. President. I warmly endorse Maury Mavericks call at the conclusion of his column for \"a round of cheers for the Marines on their 205th anniversary.\" And I add to that a special cheer for the memory of Paul Douglaseconomist.

I sincerely regret the fact that Members of the House did not have the opportunity to record their vote. and their position. on the 5.5percent comparability increase for Federal employees that has now been set in the preliminary budget for fiscal year 1980. Frankly. we are dealing with a contradiction of terms when we speak of comparability and 5.5percent raises in the same breath. This is because a 5.5percent increase only guarantees a continued state of inequity between the salaries of Federal employees and those holding similar positions in the private sector. In October 1978. Federal employees received increases of 5.5 percent despite a much higher inflation rate. So their real earning power actually decreased. dropping them behind their friends who do not work for the Government. Instead of compensating for that decrease this year. this budget would actually perpetuate it. The President has asked all U.S. workers and companies to follow guidelines holding wage and price increases to 7 percent. Many are following these guidelines. some are not. I do not understand why Federal workers. our Nations civil servants. are required to take less of an increase than most everyone else who contributes to the American economy. Mr. Speaker. I would have voted for the Barnes amendment to the first concurrent resolution on the budget were I given the opoprtunity to do so. I hope that we will yet have the chance to stand by the countrys employees. and see that they get raises this October generally comparable to those of their private sector counterparts.

Anthony Lewis analyzes one aspect of SALT IIverificationand concludes that the SALT II Treaty would improve. not undermine. our ability to monitor the Soviet Union. Mr. Lewis makes three points: That the treaty prohibits interference with \"national technical means\" of insuring its compliance. it prohibits concealing anything \"in a way that would prevent effective monitoring of compliance with the treaty.\" and finally. it authorizes a procedure for consultation on any questions of compliancewhich would be impossible in the absence of a treaty. While many people still feel that these provisions are insufficient. the alternative without the treaty is not only an accelerated buildup of nuclear arms on both sides. but a diminished ability for each to determine accurately the others total arsenal. Rejection of SALT II does not enhance our ability to monitor Soviet strategic or conventional weapons. In order to bring attention to the critical problems of worldwide nuclear arms buildups.

The article. entitled: \"Soviet Union. The Mysterious Switch Into Metals Buying.\" highlights how the Russians and their satellites are shopping in world markets for lead. copper. zinc. aluminum. molybdenum. and cobalt. all of which they produce. At the same time. they have ceased or severely cut back their exports of such metals as nickel. platinum. and titanium. the latter two of which we rely on U.S.S.R. imports for 26 and 37 percent respectively. of our needs. Speculation about the reasons for Russias purchasing strategy range from internal production problems. increased industrial needs. or possibly the SinoVietnamese border conflict. I wonder if it is not a case of speculating on rising metal prices. buying international metal futures of a sort. The article points out how the entrance of the U.S.S.R. into world markets. already tight for metals such as molybdenum. lead. and cobalt. is having farreaching effects on Western governments and industry. It is the lack of having an analytical capacity in the United States to assess the whole of numerous factors that affect U.S. minerals availability that concerns me relative to the indecisions that seem to be the only product so far of the administrations Nonfuel Mineral Policy Review. With respect to the tight conditions in the world molybdenum market. Im reminded of the oftenheard argument. both from inside and outside Government. that Government should stop development of new U.S. molybdenum deposits on the grounds that we already produce enough to satisfy our needs. This shortsighted view does not consider how we benefit by new molybdenum discoveries and that exports of this important alloying metal to our Western friends in 1978 brought in $350 to $400 million to help buy OPECs oil.",

We are faced with an OPEC cartel that can use its power to blackmail us and use it to hamper our defense efforts. What the gentlemans amendment would do would be to say. \"Turn the clock back to 1950. when oil and energy supplies were in plentitude.\" which is not the case today. If we are to have a defense production energy base. we have to recognize that today petroleum is a scarce material that can be used to hamper our national defense effort.

I was not in on the development of this bill. but since it does relate to the Defense Production Act. which is a responsibility of our Armed Services Committee. let me just say that the gentleman is absolutely correct that petroleum is not only a strategic material for the defense of our country. but it has been so recognized for many years. As a matter of fact. up until the oil embargo of 1974. the Committee on Armed Services had total control over the Naval Petroleum Reserve precisely so that adequate supplies of petroleum would be available for the needs of the U.S. NavY or any of the other of our Armed Forces in periods of emergency. In the hysteria of 1974. the Congress saw fit to take that oversight control away from the Committee on Armed Services and to give it to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. and to the Interior Department. The only thing in this petroleum area that we have left over which the Committee on Armed Services still has oversight is not the extensive and valuable Petroleum Reserve No. 4 up in Alaska. that could contain perhaps 30 billion gallons of reserve. but only little Elk Hills. out in California. Nevertheless. our committee has been trying to guarantee and protect those resources for the Navy. In part because. Members of the House know. the Commander in Chief. for some reason or another. would prefer to have our Navy go back to oilpropelled ships rather than use nuclearpropelled ships. So if we are going to be in a position to protect our interests in the Indian Ocean or anywhere else. we are going to have to have petroleum. and there is not enough oil in Elk Hills to keep the Navy going for more than about 3 months. So this bill is certainly in keeping with the changing needs of our Defense Department. I would strongly oppose the amendment of the gentleman from Michigan. who is trying to suggest that one of the most critical fuels. one of the most critical materials that we get out of the ground. has no relation to national defense.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the amendment. as the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is aware. has. really. two provisions. One is the money provision. The other is that. on page 9. it is provided that funds available from this appropriation may be used to reimburse Navy reservists traveling under permissive orders to active duty for training. That part of the amendment. as I said. is about $1.9 million as far as we can estimate at this time. Nobody knows how many exactly are going to show up for training or how far they have to travel. The problem. as I see it. is that Admiral Palmer. the Chief of Naval Reserves. has to say on his honor as an officer and as a gentleman. \"If you go out and take your training. you are going to get reimbursed for your travel and you are going to get your training pay.\" I believe what the chairman of the Committee on Armed Servicc s is suggesting is that we keep that money. which will guarantee the travel moneybecause that will then be in both the House bill and the Senate bill and that will remove that language from conferenceand that. then. we will take the drill pay money. the $4.8 million. to conference. And. since that money is in conference or is in the House bill. has been provided by the other body. that Admiral Palmer may not be able to say. \"On my honor as an officer and as a gentleman. you are going to get this money. but I believe the Senator from Maryland is going to help you get it and the Senator from Mississippi is going to help you get it.\" Is that about the case.

It was not too many days ago we had great wailing here on the floor and almost the gnashing of teeth. concerning the problems of the military and how we would resolve those problems by calling for registration of the 19- and 20yearolds. Let me say this. I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland would do far more to meet the military needs of our Reserves than all the registrations of 18-. 19-. and 20yearolds will accomplish. I. for one. want to say now that I am going to fight very diligently in the conference to try to restore this full amount in order to maintain the good faith of the Government of this country with our national reservists. because when we do things that demean that reason and faith in their Government. we are not only hurting the naval reservists. we are undermining the whole Military Establishment of this country. I cannot understand the miserly attitude that is expressed here on the floor concerning something to which we are already committed in trying to maintain a strong Naval Reserve and. at the same time. say we will do something significant in meeting the needs of our military personnel problems by calling for registration. This. to me. does not even make logic or sense. I appreciate the leadership given by the Senator from Maryland. But it is again an example of how little leadership we have gotten from the Armed Services Committee. if I may make that observation. concerning personnel problems in the military. We have had to raise on the floor through amendment time after time the proposals to meet those needs of our military pay problems. It seems to me this is another example where we have to go almost around the Armed Services Committee that should be giving the leadership to correcting these problems. Mr. President.

This amendment is very short and my statement will be likewise. It simply deletes an additional $3 million that was added at the last minute for salaries and expenses of the Office of Water Research and Technology. I would point out that the House bill contains zero amount for this expenditure. The Presidents request contains a zero amount for this expenditure. Yet the committee has added an additional $3 million that was not even requested. I will be very curious to know whether a specific plan exists for this spending. or whether somebody at the last minute thought that it woulC be nice to step up water research in the Mount St. Helens area. Of course. it would be nice to step up such research. But we have to make choices in the budget process and a lot of nice things get lost by the wayside.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this is the second time we have debated this issue. The first time was on June 19 when I brought to the floor of the House a deferral resolution. The administration wanted to defer the expenditure of $1.8 million for drilling on the national petroleum reserve in Alaska. The gentleman from Vermont voted in favor of postponing the deferral and my good friend. the gentleman from Washington. who is a distinguished and valuable member of our subcommittee. not only voted against the deferral. but participated in the discussions in our committae. He voted in favor of postponing the deferral in our committee. voted in favor of postponing the deferral when the bill came to the floor and is now taking an opposite position. The fact is that it is a question of time. Sure. private enterprise will ultimately move into the program. but under the law there has to be a report filed by the first of the year in which the Department of the Interior can propose legislation to the Congress. The testimony before our committee was to the effect that if the administrations request were agreed to and the Husky Oil Co. were required to close down its drilling. pack up its rigs. take up its equipment. and leave the premises. we would have to pay the Husky Oil Co. at least $60 million in termination costs and that it would be at least 5 or 6 years before a private contractor having bid on a Government program would be able to start drilling. Husky Oil Co. is in that position at the present time. The question is one of time. How important is it to this country that we continue a drilling program that may result in our finding oil on the petroleum reserve? Is it not of utmost importance that this program be continued? I say it is and I say this is an illtimed amendment.",

The record should reflect at this point that that contract was entered into in a competitive bid in which the major oil companies were excluded from bidding. What we looked at was the interest of the Nation and the way for Husky Oil to collect $64 million is to do what this administration wants to do. close them down and have them leave town and leave us as a nation continuing to hold the energy bag.

The park will commemorate the formal beginning of the struggle of women for their equal rights. Almost 132 years ago. in a small town in New York State. the womens rights movement began. It was on July 19. 1848. that a small group of women convened the Equal Rights for Women Convention. After much deliberation. they adopted a series of resolutions in which they demanded the equal right for women to vote. to enter schools. colleges. and the professions. to hold public office. to control their own property. to earn a living and to control their own earnings. to guardianship of their children. to make a will. to enter into contracts. to sit on juries. and to conduct business. The Womens Rights National Historic Park will include five sites in Seneca Falls and Waterloo. N.Y.. associated with the 19th century womens rights movement. These sites Include the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. site of the 1848 convention. and the residences of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Amelia Bloomer. Jane Hunt. and Mary Ann McClintock. women who dedicated their lives to the fight for equality. Mr. President. the legislation we are introducing is the result of the active participation of the local citizens who wanted to insure the preservation of the sites associated with the struggle of women for their equal rights. and the innovative study of the National Park Service to investigate sites whose significance is related to themes which are not adequately represented in the National Park System. I want to commend all of the persons associated with this proposal and hope that the Congress will act upon this measure expeditiously so that their efforts may come to fruition.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as most of us in the Senate are well aware. the U.S. Government--out of the best of intentionshas implemented several policies which have adversely affected the competitiveness ofAmerican exporters of goods and services. At times. we have sought to extend our values into an unreceptive world in the belief that the international world order is still dominated by the U.S. economy. Unilateral restraints have contributed to a decline in the competitiveness of American firms relative to foreign concerns. which do not operate under similar limits. Nowhere is our plight more graphically illustrated than in the Mideast. where the U.S. share of construction contracts has dropped sharply. In a 13month period ending June. 1979. the United States ranked 12th after other industrialized countries. ThirdWorld nations. and Eastbloc countries. The winner of the largest number of construction contracts was South Korea. Awards to U.S. contractors amounted to about 1.6 percent of the total compared to 10.3 percent in the preceding 34 months. Although complete figures for all construction contracts let during this period are not available. the evidence of declining American competitiveness in this crucial area of the world is compelling. The reasons for this sorry situation are manifold. In some cases. the Federal Government has imposed restrictive policies. while in other instances. the private sector has not been sufficiently aggressive. We in the Congress cannot convince business to be more competitive. but we can and should prevent the imposition of selfdefeating shackles on business.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the embargo of grain shipments to the Soviet Union raises the question of its potential effect on Soviet agriculture and economy. U.S. feed grains especially have been cited as key to Soviet planning for building livestock herds and increasing meat production. Some dislocation in the rising consumer demand for more and better quality protein sources has been predicted as a result of the embargo. The fulfillment of these projections awaits to be seen. Although the Soviet agricultural economy may be well understood by academicians and Sovietologists. because the Soviet Union is a closed society. its agriculture and rural life are remarkably little known or understood by Americans in general. For this reason. I was particularly impressed with a report which was recently sent to me from the National 4H Council on the experiences of five young Americans who participated in the young agricultural specialists exchange program in the U.S.S.R. in the summer of 1979. It should be noted that this program. which is coordinated by the National 4H Council in behalf of the Cooperative Extension Service. has been canceled for 1980 because of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. One of the participants in the exchange was an articulate and knowledgeable young man. Russell L. Jesser from Kimberly. Idaho.

Va.. after being struck by an automobile 2 days ago. Since Mr. Lewis came to Washington. D.C.. to join the staff of the NSBA in 1965. he has given the very highest caliber of leadership to that organization specifically. and to the national small business movement generally. Under his guidance. the National Small Business Association grew steadily in numbers. stature. and influence. and is now one of the most prestigious small husiness associations in the world. In 1976. Mr. Lewis conceived the idea of unifying small \ufffd business efforts through a Small Business Legislative Council. to be made up of trade associations whose membership is mostly small businesses. The force of his personality made that concept a living reality. and the council now counts 75 associations as members. representing about 4 million independent firms. Its many accomplishments are a tribute to the trust and confidence placed in Mr. Lewis by his fellow association executives. who elected him executive director of the council. Capitol Hill knew John Lewis as the most senior and one of the most outstanding leaders of the small business movement. He was to us a man of outstanding integrity and dedication. His positions were based on high principle and constructive compromise. He was unfailingly knowledgeable and goodhumored. These qualities earned him the respect of this body. as they did with all who were privileged to be associated with him. The legislative victories of the past few yearsin the tax. regulatory. paperwork reduction. and procurement areas--are monuments to Mr. Lewis successful work. It is doubly unfortunate that he has been lost to the small business community just as the White House Conference on Small Business has helped usher in. a new era of greater visibility and sympathy toward the entrepreneur whose cause John Lewis fought for so long. so valiantly. and so well.

Many of us agree upon the objectives to be accomplished and the types of changes that need to be instituted in sentencing reform. however. we differ in what we envision as the precise mechanisms for these reforms. It is important that the Congress debate the issue fully. resolve the remaining differences. and adopt a meaningful proposal for sentencing reform. For that reason. I am pleased to join with Senator BIDEN. Senator HART. and Senator JAVITS in introducing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1979. It is my hope that this legislation will stimulate a final phase of Senate discussion of sentencing reform. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1979 contains many similar provisions to those found in S. 1722. the criminal code reform legislation introduced earlier this year by Senators KENNEDY. THUR-",

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of our greatest urban treasures is the long neglected network of inland waterways which flow through our oldest cities. For years. our urban rivers have suffered from accumulated pollution. trash. and debris. Flood control. navigational hazards. water quality. river bank erosion. and deteriorated docks and piers are just some of the major problems common to urban rivers. Many neglected historic sites and potential recreational areas abut inland waterways and are in need of assistance before their value is permanently degraded. Existing Federal programs have been found to be inadequate to deal with the problems of interstate inland waterways. An example of the need for a new approach is the Ten Mile River. which flows through some of the oldest industrial cities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The river has been the subject of over 20 years of study by State and Federal agencies. and the Congress has been memorialized by both the Massachusetts and Rhode Island State assemblies to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem. As a result of discussions with local legislators and my colleague in the House. Representative FERNAND J. ST GERMAIN. a legislative remedy has been developed which has the potential of serving as a model for the rehabilitation of other inland waterway systems. I am today introducing legislation identical to what Congressman ST GERMAIN has already introduced in the House. I look forward to working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the committees to find a solution to a longstanding problem. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Subcommittee on International Finance of the Committee on Banking. Housing. and Urban Affairs will hold a series of hearings on trade and technology. The purpose of the hearings is to assess the implications for U.S. trade competitiveness of technological change and international technology transfers. as well as the effects of trade on U.S. technology. The hearings will examine U.S. trade and technological competitiveness in many contexts. including EastWest trade. trade with newly industrialized countries. and selected economic sectors: agriculture. steel. electronics. and others. Earlier this year the subcommittee released its report on U.S. export policy. based on 11 days of hearings on the subject in 1978. The report noted the increased international competition facing the United States in high technology fields where U.S. producers have long been dominant. American agricultural and industrial exports are both technology intensive. Our continued export competitiveness is clearly tied to our comparative advantage in technological innovation and the production of high technology goods. But as the subcommittee report notesWe are losing our competitive position in high technology trade. and uncoordinated Federal Government policies make it difficult to remedy the situation. The subcommittee intends to study thoroughly the interrelationships between trade and technology. Among the issues to be examined are: First. the effect of U.S. exports on economic competitiveness. including effects on domestic capital formation and technology development. Second. the effect on U.S. trade competitiveness of U.S. restrictions on technology transfer. Third. the effect of U.S. transfer of technology on economic development abroad. Fourth. the effect of foreign technology subsidies and trade barriers on U.S. competitiveness. The first hearing in the series will be held on Monday. November 19 in Pittsburgh. Pa. The time and location of the hearing will be announced in the RECORD at a later date. Within the general scope of assessing U.S. trade and technology. the Pittsburgh hearing will focus on the steel industry. The Office of Technology Assessment has released a study which suggests portions of the steel industry may have strong export potential. if current U.S. technological leads are promptly and fully exploited. Other studies suggest that the steel industry as a whole could dramatically increase its trade competitiveness by adopting new technologies. including some developed abroad. Testimony will also be received on Senate Concurrent Resolution 38. introduced by Senators",

The program provides a unique experience for high school students throughout the Nation to learn firsthand the pragmatic skills necessary to survive in an increasingly complex and competitive business environment. In Minnesota alone there are 110 junior achievement organizations. many of which are extremely profitable. An impressive example is the East Bloomington Trade Association. which paid the original 21 stockholders $40 for every $1 investeda remarkable 3.999 percent return on investment. But junior achievement is an experience in real world economics. and the lessons learned from an unsuccessful enterprise are every bit as important as those drawn from a profitable one. The important thing is participation. and young men and women across the Nation are participating in record numbers. The other great benefit of junior achievement is the opportunity it provides for retired businessmen to share their expertise with a new generation of Americas industrial leaders. These men and women represent one of the Nations greatest untapped resources. and the program provides a bridge through which their life experience can be transformed into a foundation for the Nations future industrial growth. We all benefit from the activities of junior achievement. and those of us in the Senate have a unique opportunity to honor the people whose efforts have made this program such a remarkable success. I have been privileged to join with my distinguished colleague from Connecticut. Senator RIB:COFF. in sponsoring a resolution to designate the third week of January as \"National Junior Achievement Week.\" That resolution.

Even though the Soviets may have reduced their force numbers by almost a third by 19Z5. by replacing the older systems with the more advanced ones. the number of warheads on those systems will have been in-\" creased by about 50 percent. from about 2.150 to about 3.250 warheads. Without the NATO force modernization program. the Soviets will have a warhead advantage that will have increased from about 4 to 1 to about 6 to 1. with a major advancement in the accuracy of the delivery of those warheads. The deploymert of about 572 Pershing II and Tomahawk ground launched cruise missiles under the NATO modernization plan would even up the numerical balance between the Warsaw Pact and NATO delivery vehicle force levels and would reduce the Soviet warhead advantage to about 3 to 1. However. the accuracy advantage would rest with the NATO forces. with the Army/ Martin Marietta Pershing II having an accuracy 1011 times the Soviet SS20 and even 23 times more accurate than the General Dynamics Tomahawk GLCM. The disadvantage is that the Pershing II is in the over 1000 km range. forcing its deployment in closer to the Warsaw Pact front. while the SS20 has a 4400 km range that allows it to be deployed in central Russia and the GLCM has an over 2000 km range allowing it to be deployed much farther back. such as in Britain. All of this is based on intelligence estimates that the Soviets will continue to reduce the number of longrange theater delivery systems through 1985 by as much as onethird. If the Soviets should elect to increase the number of SS20 and Backfire systems beyond the level estimated. or decide to keep more of the older SS4. -5. Blinder and Badger systems in service longer to offset the NATO theater modernization program. the improvement of the balance could move much slower.S",

    "speech": "Mr. President. at the time the Senate considered the legislation granting mostfavored nation status to Communist China back in January. I warned of the potential for adverse impact upon the United States. The ultimate question. of course. Is whether the United States has ever really benefitted from trade with any Communist nation. In the instance of the Soviet Union. for example. we engaged in technology exports which netted American manufacturers a few millions of dollars. But. as a result. it will cost the American taxpayers billions of dollars to catch up with the Soviets in strategic weaponry. The analogy extends to our \"tobacco trading\" with Communist China. What the Communist regime in Peking wants. of course. is U.S. technologyand if we transfer it to them. I am convinced that it will ultimately be a severe blow to U.S. tobacco growers. In further reflection upon the impact that trade concessions to theRed Chinese will certainly have upon our tobacco farmers. I prepared an article for the April edition of the FlueCure Tobacco Farmer magazine. It explains in detail the adverse impact that I predict will come from massive technology transfers in tobacco production and handling to the Red Chinese. and it speculates upon what that will mean to U.S. growers. It is significant. also. that the official report of the Tobacco Trade Mission to Communist China has become available since the Senate considered the MFN status legislation. The report substantiates my conclusions that the Red Chinese can compete with U.S. tobacco farmers. though the author seems to believe otherwise. The fundamental question not assessed in the report is: How can our tobacco growers hope to compete with $40ayear labor? My fear is that those who advocate such trade with Red China are rushing to travel a oneway streeta street that may very well help lead U.S. tobacco growers into oblivion. Mr. President. I do not doubt anybodys sinceritybut I do not want to see our tobacco farmers destroyed because somebody was sincerely wrong. I ask that my article. \"Trade with Communist China: Bad News for U.S. Tobacco Farmers?.\" and the report prepared by Dr. W. K. Collins of North Carolina State University entitled. \"Tobacco Trade Mission to Peoples Republic of China.\" be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. so that interested persons may make their own judgments.",

I. myself. was amazed at the pressure put on Members by the executive branch to vote against it. My office received a phone call last week from the Justice Department just before the vote making it very clear that the administration wanted the HoltGramm substitute defeated. Additionally. we were urged to support the Obey substitute. We received this call from Justice despite that fact that the amendments in question to the budget has nothing whatsoever to do with the direct Justice Department budget itself. Mr. Speaker. there is a prohibition--supported by criminal sanctionsagainst executive branch lobbying without express congressional approval. Unfortunately. this seems to be honored more in its breach than in its observance. In this most recent and blatant example. if this did not violate the letter of the law against lobbying by the executive branch. it certainly violated the spirit of it. Mr. Speaker. the defense of this country is too important to be made the subject of artificial political litmus tests. Our country deservesand needs--better treatment.",

Today. the Senate has the opportunity to reaffirm that commitment by providing the budget authority to accomplish the will of the Senate as expressed last November. It is true that the fill rate we have assumed would result in about 72 million barrels in 1981. about 30 million barrels additional in 1980 if it were begun in July. which is about 100 million barrels more than we now have. It is not a billion barrels. but it is a beginning. and it is a clear statement on the part of Congress and the U.S. Senate that we recognize that our national security is threatened. Six months from now. 9 months from now. 1 year from now. I want to see every Senator who votes against this amendment. when the interruption will occur. and I want to see him justify that vote on the basis of a balanced budget or because he was making the wrong assumptions. The budget is nothing but assumptions: about the inflation rate. about the employment rate. about the enactment of laws that deal with interest and dividends. Mr. President. this is an issue that is very clear. We can assume all the good will in the world on the part of our Saudi alliesthat. indeed. they do not want to reduce production. I can make the argument. on the other side. that they will reduce production a million barrels a day. whatever the Senate does. in the third Quarter of this year. because of the world inventories of oil. Assuming all the good will in the world. there is no way to predict an event that occurs in an unstable region of the world. that zaps this economy and withdraws from this economy 3 million. 4 million. or 9 million barrels of oil a day.

Senator DOLE. with whom I have shared a long interest in the viability of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. President. the Budget Committee has taken a very precarious path to reducing the deficit that we will face in fiscal year 1981. By knocking out nearly $2.6 billion from function 270. the committee has decided to take money appropriated to buy oil for the strategic petroleum reserve and to use it for a number of questionable purposes. First of all. they want to use it to mask the true impact of higher defense spending: and. they want to use it to fund other programs that I think should be funded directly by general revenues. Mr. President. that SPR money has been appropriated by the Congress for a very important reasonto be able to purchase oil on a moments notice for the SPR. We now have an obvious international political and national security problem in actually making those purchases. But the situation could change at any time and if it did. large quantities of crude oil could be made available for a limited time to fill the SPR. To get this oil. we must be prepared to act quickly. By knocking out this $2.6 billion. the Budget Committee is effectively requiring the Congress to come back and reappropriate funds for the SPR and that totally destroys the ability of the President to respond quickly. Mr. President. if the programs for which this money is to be used is important enough to justify funding them from the SPR account. then it seems to me that the Budget Committee should have the courage to fund those programs by direct revenues. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.*",

But the additional revenues in the sum of $2.1 billion which are included in the Bradley amendment are simply not credible. There is general agreement that the revenues which may be generated if the oil import fee remains in effect are not counted in the revenue figures in the budget resolution. and if the entire $11 billion are not counted then it is not appropriate to count $2.1 billion of that $11 billion as proposed here. Alternatively. it is proposed that the necessary revenues are to be collected from a new 2cent security tax on oil which will be designated solely for the SPR. I might support such a tax as an appropriate and temporary \"insurance premium\" for the national security. However. no such legislation is before the Congress. such an assumption is not an appropriate basis for revising the size of the Federal budget at this time. For the moment. I must therefore oppose the Bradley substitute. However. I shall support Senator JACKSONs proposal. as I believe the security issue involved here is so vital that it warrants even unbalancing the budget for the purpose. Should this Jackson amendment fail. I shall offer a substitute for the resolution which restores the budget authority for the SPR which the Senate Budget Committee cut out. while not changing the outlay level in the pending resolution.0",

I would like to express my sorrow that JOHN MURPHY will leave the House after 18 years of dedicated service. not only to the residents of Staten Island. but to the Congress and the Nation. The gentleman from New York has been one of the hardest working and most effective Members of this House for many years and we will all miss his energy. his courage. and his friendship. JOHN has served for 4 years as chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and has been an effective and imaginative champion of many important causes on that cornmittee. The gentleman deserves the thanks of this House for the work he has done to preserve and revitalize the American merchant marine and fishing industries. As the author of the landmark Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. he leaves behind a memorial to his service through a balanced and farreaching program to develop our offshore oil resources with significant environmental and economic protection for our coastal communities. In the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974. the House made an important improvement in the tools available to the leadership to manage legislation cutting across the jurisdiction of many committees. The rule permitting the Speaker to establish ad hoc committees to process complex legislation was first used to establish the ad hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf. which the gentleman from New York so ably chaired. It was a difficult task which the gentleman handled with sensitivity. fairness. and good judgment. Indeed his management of the ad hoc committee serves as a good model for how this new process can best be used. The distinguished service of this highly regarded West Point graduate in the Korean conflict is well known. Equally known is that the gentlemans great courage has never deserted him in his public and private life. I am proud to count JOHN MURPHY as a friend. We will all miss him in Congress and I wish him well.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is an unusual business venture underway virtually in my own backyard that merits some attention and praise. An unprecedented alliance between a maritime labor union and an American shipyard has created a new shipping company. the First American Bulk Carrier Corp.. that will encourage more and more businesses to ship American. Jesse M. Calhoon. president of the National Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA). wanted to do something that would help the U.S.flag shipping industry. At the same time. he had the financial security of his union to think about. With the help of the Levingston Shipbuilding Co. in Orange. Tex.. Mr. Calhoon was able to come up with something to accomplish both ends. MEBA has invested $7 million from the unions pension fund into a combination bulk/container shipping venture that will serve Australia. the United States. and Europe. Levingston Shipbuilding. the only shipyard in my district. put $4 million into First American. In addition to its 32 percent interest in the new line. Levingston also is building two multipurpose. energysaving bulk/container ships that will carry containers and dry bulk cargoes around the world three times a year. each generating more than $7 million annually in ocean freight revenues. Levingstons naval architects in Orange designed the ships to be readily adapted to military uses and. in fact. they will be among the few ships built since the mid1950s that can carry and unload military tanks and aircraft. I am very excited by the fact that a maritime union and a shipyard have become partners to encourage the further development of the U.S.-flag shipping industry. MEBAs Mr. Calhoon is quick to point out that First American Bulk Carrier Corp.. will not be competing with existing U.S.-flag companies. Perhaps other industries should explore the applicability of this innovative and yet very sensible approach toward investing labor capital.e",

I wish to take 1 minute to correct a misstatement of facts which appeared in an article in the print media recently and then was repeated on the House floor yesterday during debate of the transit bill. The misstatement concerned the present program under which cities are Identified as to their eligibility for transit aid funds. A prominent newspaper incorrectly explained the present transit aid program and that news article was in turn used as evidence during yesterdays debate. The news article. giving an example of transit aid. stated that Odessa. Tex.. received $600.000 a year in transit subsidies even though the city has no transit system. That statement was incorrect. Odessa does not receive any mass transit aid. does not have a mass transit system. and has never applied for Federal mass transit aid. The Federal Government has never sent mass transit money to Odessa. What should have been stated was that. under the present plan. Odessa qualifies as an eligible city which can apply for mass transit aid. The city. however. would first have to apply for such funds. meet additional qualifications. and then come up with its share in matching funds. Only after these conditions were met would the city then receive Federal mass transit funds. I hope this clarifies the record on the subject. It was a very misleading statement. and I sincerely hope no vote was influenced by the misleading and false evidence.*",

John W. McCormack. I was deeply saddened to learn on November 22 that former Speaker McCormack had passed away. John McCormack was a good friend of mine. He was here when I arrived in Congress and he will always be remembered for his outstanding service as a great majority leader and later as a fine Speaker of the House of Representatives. While his tremendous abilities in the public arena should be noted. the thing that stands out the most in my memory of John McCormack was his devotion to his wife. At a time when society puts so much stress and pressure on the family and we see the family unit fragmented on many occasions. John McCormack served as an outstanding example to the other Members here and indeed everyone in public life throughout our Nation. He showed that an individual could climb the pinnacles of power. handle the heaviest onslaught of time demands and public responsibilities. and yet still maintain an ideal marriage based on devotion and mutual trust and find time in every day. no matter how busy. for family life. His reverence for the sanctity of his marriage and his dedication to his wife is a powerful. modern love story. John McCormack was a selfmade man. He started off delivering newspapers at $3 a week and gradually worked his way up to becoming an attorney. There are living monuments to John McCormack in every corner of this great land in the many programs which he shepherded through this body. I hope that the high standards. both in his public life and his personal life. which John McCormack established will live on as an example here in these Halls in the years to come.

This nomination was unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee and I would respectfully request the Senate to add its stamp of approval to this nominee. The life of U. W. Clemon is truly remarkable. Every person in this body could learn from this man. Born into a poor Alabama sharecropping family. U. W. Clemon was not given many of the things that we all take for granted. He came up the hard way. learning by experience. Sustained by the love of his family. U. W. Clemon committed his life in service to making America a better place to live. As a teenager. he saw that the law was the tool that he would need to change many of the wrongs he saw in society. He therefore kept his nose. in the books. pursuing a quality education. After graduating from Miles College. an excellent institution in Birmingham. Mr. Clemon attended law school at Columbia University. After an outstanding career at Columbia. U. W. Clemon was offered an excellent job at a prominent New York law firm. He declined this offer. explaining that the people of Alabama needed him. Returning to Alabama. Mr. Clemon opened his law office. Since that time. he has distinguished himself with an outstanding practice. Lawyer after lawyer will tell you that they have faced no worthier adversary than U. W. Clemon. In addition to his legal career. U. W. Clemon has been. a political leader both in Birmingham and in the State of Alabama. He is presently serving his second term in the Alabama State Senate and is chairman of the judiciary committee. Before I was elected to the U.S. Senate. it was my pleasure to serve in the Alabama senate with U. W. Clemon. Based on that service with U. W.. I would like to make a few personal comments about him. His service in the senate has been distinguished. He has represented his district ably. Every dealing I had with U. W. was fair. His integrity is above reproach. his talent unsurpassed and his compassion serves as a shining example to others.",

I have attempted to make a complete and thorough examination of the very detailed hearing record in this case. While I am not totally satisfied with all aspects of the allegations against Mr. Clemon. I do not feel my reservations are sufficient enough to warrant voting against his confirmation. Let me be more specific. I cannot condone Mr. Clemons failure to file his taxes on time. It is every citizens duty to support our Government through the existing tax structure and that requires the timely filing and payment of the incurred liability. There is. however. no indication whatsoever of fraud or a failure to disclose his true and accurate. financial situation to the Internal Revenue Service. To his credit. Mr. Clemon is now current in both filing and payment of taxes. With regard to this problem. Mr. Clemon made one particular statement during the hearing that most impressed me. and I quote from the hearing record: It is increasing significant to me that my tax situation is one that I simply have to make a record of in terms of prompt filing and prompt payment. Mr. President. I believe U. W. Clemon will do just that. He has proven himself to be a man of courage and dedication. He was a sharecroppers son and 1 of 17 children. Yet. he made the decision at 14 years of age to become an attorney. Mr. Clemon had the aspirations of alleviating much of the poverty and suffering he saw around him and to his credit. I think he has accomplished a great deal of what he set out to do. Mr. President. I intend to vote for him.*",

As an original supporter of the Amtrak system. you should indeed recognize the need for passengertrain service not only along the BostonWashington corridor. but throughout rural regions of our country that lack adequate transportation alternatives. The Department of Transportations announced cutbacks. drastically reduce passengertrain service to the State of West Virginia. and in particular the southern portion of the state which I represent in Congress. The curtailment of this service severs an important link to Cincinnati and Chicago. in the west. and to Roanoke. Washington and New York. in the east. With Appalachian highways being what they are and with no airpassenger service in many cities and towns. West Virginia residents will be left to their own means of transportation over long distances.

Under current law. the handicapped person is given a deduction for the purchase of a specially designed vehicle. modification of a vehicle (that is adaptive equipment such as hand controls and special chair lifts) and maintenance costs. Thus. if a handicapped person is not severely disabled and is able to transport himself. he is given a deduction covering his transportation expenses. Yet. a severely handicapped person who is ready and able to work but needs the service of a driver to transport him to and from work is not able. under current law. to deduct this expense from his income. Enactment of this bill will meet two important objectives. First. this legislation will remedy the existing unfairness in the tax laws by providing the severely handicapped an appropriate deduction. In addition. the bill will facilitate employment of the handicapped individual and encourage that individual to lead an independent. \"deinstitutionalized\" life. Congress recently passed the HumphreyHawkins bill which specifically directed the Federal Government to make efforts to reduce the substantial unemployment rate among handicapped citizens in this country. This bill will help achieve that result and at a minimal cost. In fact. it has been estimated that this bill will generate revenues as a result of increased employment. Therefore. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation which will reduce the burden on the employable handicapped. The following Members are cosponsors: Mitchell of Maryland. Hyde. Conte. Moakley.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to amend the Inf 2339 ternal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide a deduction on Federal income tax on the proportionate share of rent and interest that a renter pays on his principal dwelling place. There are two important reasons why I believe we need such a bill. First we should eliminate the present gross inequity in Federal tax treatment between the homeowner and dwelling unit renter. For years the homeowner has been allowed to deduct expenditures for property tax and interest on his property. The renter on the other hand has not been afforded this privilege. This inequity exists despite the fact that the renter pays his or her share of the property tax and interest on the rent charged by the owner. The result of this situation is that the owner deducts his costs and thus pays a lower income tax than a renter with the same income who cannot deduct these payments. My bill would eliminate this inequity and put the 35 percent of Americans who rent on a fair and equal basis with the other 65 percent who own their homes. To give an example relating to the property tax deduction. an average apartment renter in a city in my district. Yonkers. N.Y.. pays a proportionate share of property taxes on his apartment of $470. My bill would allow the renter to deduct this amount from his income. There would be additional savings realized on deductions for interest payments made by the renter. The effects of this bill would be felt by an even larger percentage of renters earning less than $15.000 per year. as between 40 and 50 percent of this income group rents. My second reason for introducing this bill is to provide a form of relief in this period of rampant inflation. Everywhere the wage earner turns he or she is confronted with rising costs of heatihg fuel and other utilities. property taxes. food. and housing. This bill would provide an immediate reduction in the cost of housing as it would allow deductions on the proportionate share of property tax and interest actually paid by the renter. The homeowner is provided this relief now. my bill will provide this deduction for the renter. I urge support for my bill and for the equal tax treatment it will provide between renters and homeowners.*",

State. and Federal taxes. most of them are not aware of the dramatic increase in their international taxesmandatory taxes collected by the U.N. tax mantaxes which are used as an income redistribution device to force the shift of wealth from the United States and other developed nations to the less developed nations who hold a heavy majority in the U.N. \"legislature.\" These taxes are also known as \"mandatory U.N. assessments for technical assistance programs\"-assessments which member nations are forced to pay in addition to their voluntary contributions for technical assistance. Let me explain why the funding for technical assistance is being switched from the traditional voluntary basis to a mandatoryno choicebasis. The United Nations operating budget is financed by mandatory assessments of member nations. A growing proportion of these funds. however. are being used not for peacekeeping. or operating costs. et cetera. but for technical assistance programsprograms through which resources are transferred from developed nations to less developed nations. The original purpose of the U.N.. of course. was to keep world peace. Soon. however. a new emphasis was placed on promoting development in the Third World. Such development occurred through voluntary assessments for technical assistance programs. now managed primarily by the U.N. development program. a special U.N. agency outside of the regular U.N. budget. The United States has generously contributed. including approximately $140 million this year. Not satisfied. the Third World nations decided to increase their take by shifting as much funding as possible for technical assistance into the mandatory assessments of the regular U.N. budget. A 1978 State Department report states: The delays and cancellations of project delivery caused by the UNDP financial liquidity crisis of 197576 stimulated pressure from developing countries for more funding through assessed budgets. Specialized agencies saw this issue raised forcefully in their governing bodies. where developing countries increasingly contended that technical assistance no longer should be treated as an ancillary function. To avoid the vagaries and uncertainties of voluntary funding. they preferred to see technical assistance supported more through assessed rather than voluntary contributions. (Emphasis supplied.) The Third World. incidentally. has its own caucus. the Group of 77. Its meetings are paid for through assessed contributions (25 percentU.S.). Oh. yes. the United States is not allowed to attend.",

The purpose of the gentlemans amendment is to preserve the Helms amendment as passed by the Congress in the fiscal year 1979 State Department appropriations bill. This amendment reflected the will of Congress last year that no funds for international organizations should be made available for the furnishing of technical assistance by the United Nations or its agencies until the U.N. puts technical assistance fully on a voluntary basis. The U.N. should reform its budget procedures so that all technical assistance programs are voluntarily fundedand taken out of the U.N. general operating budgetswhich are funded through mandatory assessments. There is a need for the Congress to send a message to the United Nations to bring about a reform in its budget process. The funding of technical assistance programs through mandatory assessments precludes the right of nations to determine the programs they wish to support.

    "speech": "I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. a matter of special concern to the Congress and to the AFLCIO. and other free world union leaders is an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act. sponsored in 1977 by Senator McGOVERN. which calls upon the Secretary of State to automatically recommend approval of an application for a nonimmigrant visa to a member of a Communist organization seeking to enter the United States. At the time this amendment was adopted. it was hoped our gesture would encourage the Soviet Union to comply with the obligations they assumed as signatories to the Helsinki accord. Unfortunately. this has not happened. The Soviet Union has not reciprocated the McGovern language. In fact. it has blatantly violated the human rights provisions of the Helsinki agreement. It launched the trials of Ginzberg. Scharansky. and Orlov designed to crush the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group. These trials illustrate the institutionalized repression of basic human rights by the Soviet Union. Under the language now in the law. purported labor leaders of the Communist Warsaw Pact countrieswho bear no relationship to the free unions of this countryare admitted to the United States as labor leaders. a case of false pretenses. Also. the McGovern language has. in effect. created a legal loophole which has facilitated visits to the United States by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. At a time when the PLO is carrying out terrorist acts in opposition to the IsraelEgypt peace agreement. this is no time to be admitting without proper review by the Secretary of State members of such an organization. It is my understanding that the amendment before us will correct these problems by: Putting an end to the procedures under which agents of totalitarian states can 8346 co come to the United States in the guise of trade unionists. Closing a loophole under which PLO e agents can come into the United States. In my opinion this language represents a step toward restoring the principles of reciprocity with the Soviet Union.

There are three things which I would quickly like to point out. In addition to the authorization and the financial matters in the bill. there is also a provision that amends the Atomic Energy Act by granting the Commission authority to protect certain unclassified but sensitive safeguards information from unauthorized disclosures. Many will remember that people can just go out and read a book on how to do certain things to powerplants and then go and do them. They are written up. to begin with. so as to learn how to protect them. But others can use them for their own purposes. Second. I would like to call the attention of the committee to two amendments that I will offer. This authorization was passed many months ago. and a lot of things have happened in the meantime. Three Mile Island. and those sorts of things. So I will have two amendments. One is an additional $50 million in authorization which I will explain at the time of the amendment. but it is for additional moneys for plant safety design. radiation monitoring. emergency planning. operator training. and other purposes. Finally. I will offer another amendment. Many will remember that the Kemeny Commission has criticized the lack of coordination and direction in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. and there is a reason for that. because section 201 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 says that all Commissioners have equal authority. So there is really no head of the organization. And what I will try to do by offering an amendment is to give the option to the rest of the Commissioners to delegate that authority to one of the Commissioners.

As a member of both the Interior and Foreign Affairs Committees I would refer my colleagues to the letter from Chairman ZABLOCKI which appears in the Interior Committees report on this bill. and to section 101 in H.R. 2608 which was embraced by all concerned parties to insure that the NRC will have adequate staff and technical resources to implement the United StatesIAEA International Safeguards Treaty when it is ratified by the Senate. This treaty is of particular importance to U.S. efforts to persuade other countries that international safeguards against the development of nuclear weapons must be expanded and upgraded. Its ratification by the Senate will. among other things. enable greater U.S. cooperation with the international watchdog agency on proliferation to enhance safeguards techniques. I would also note that all three committees endorsed the NRCs request for four additional persons over the fiscal year 1979 levels in the Office of International Programs. Even with this increase. the NRC staff will continue to devote only 1 percent of its total resources to nuclear export licensing and other important international regulatory matters. Even under these conditions. I feel that the NRC has contributed substantially to the fulfillment of U.S. nonproliferation objectives and has made good headway toward streamlining the export licensing process consistent with its mandate under the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. I would like to compliment Mr. UDALL and Mr. DINGELL and the members of both subcommittees for their considered attention to these important international responsibilities of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 2608. a bill providing necessary authorizations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in fiscal year As ranking member on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. I am well aware of the serious concerns which have been raised regarding the future of nuclear power following the accident at Three Mile Island. During the past 4 months. I have actively participated in the extensive committee investigation into the causes of that accident. as well as the broader questions of nuclear policy. As those hearings progressed. one fact became quite cleardecisions on the future role of nuclear power must be balanced and rational. based on facts not emotion. One fact which I urge my colleagues to keep in mind as we debate this bill and amendments is that nuclear power is an energy source which cannot be replaced in the immediate future. When you get down to the statistics and consider our alternatives. the Nations energy requirements indicate that nuclear power cannot be discarded as an option. Clearly the Nation faces some hard choices regarding its energy future. Without a deliberate and long range policy based on facts. we could be facing an increased dependence on foreign oil and gasskyrocketing electrical bills for the consumerserious repercussion to the national economy. including dramatically increased unemployment and spiralling inflation. With the present situation in Iran and the continuing power of the OPEC countries over the price and supply of oil. America clearly does not have the option to presently shut down its nuclear industry. But what about the future? Unfortunately. our Nations energy picture becomes worse. not better. Recent reports by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Department of Commerce have made projections on the levels of national energy consumption and supply through the year 2000. It is important to note that both reports factor into their data significant emphasis on energy savings resulting from conservation efforts and significant increases in solar. wind. and geothermal production. Both assume these sources will generate approximately 32 times the current level of energy. Both reports also assume that there will be a virtual phaseout of oil and gas as sources of electrical energy by the year 2000 as dictated by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to applaud the gentleman. I think this amendment basically is up to no good. I think it is not in good taste. either. at this particular time. We have the situation where the people there are overworked as it is. They are trying to solve some substantive problems. Now we are going to divert them over to making up a lot of lists. I think this is unnecessary. a slap in the face to what the NRC is trying to do. I think there are some things behind this amendment which I will not mention. but I think they are all mischievous. I would hope that the House would not go for this type of approach.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think the gentleman has made a good point. I think it is questionable the need for this particular amendment. It is questionable why it is necessary to spend these kinds of resources. these kinds of dollars and these kinds of manhours to put together these kinds of requests when. in fact. the NRC is already doing these now because of the postconcern over Three Mile Island and the evaluation and conclusions that they arrived at during their evaluation of Three Mile Island. I do not think that this kind of requirement makes a contribution to nuclear safety when. in fact. these kinds of provisions are already being made. Now. the gentleman from New York points to the Indian Point nuclear facilities as being questionably safe. but I want to point out to the gentleman that they recognize what we found by Three Mile Island that the training of operators was wholly inadequate and as a result Consolidated Edison is already using some of the most sophisticated simulators today to train operating personnel. not only for Con Ed unit No. 2. but also for the Power Authority of New Yorks unit No. 3. so Mr. Chairman. it seems to me that we have all learned lessons from the recent potential disaster at Three Mile Island and that the NRC is very well aware of those and is moving very quickly to comply with the findings of the various commissions.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I just noticed something in the amendment. that all this information. the NRC is required to submit it within 120 days. According to the estimates I have. it would take one Individual 50 years to do it. so if we are going to do it in 120 days. we are going to have to put some 300 or 400 people to work on this when they ought to be working on something else.",
