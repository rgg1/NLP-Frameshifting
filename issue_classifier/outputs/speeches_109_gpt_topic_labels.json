    "speech": "For 75 years. the Magen David Adom has served as Israels emergency relief service.. Founded in 1930 by seven Israeli doctors and a oneroom emergency medical service. the MDA has grown to play a major role working alongside the Israeli Army Medical Corps in times of war and peace. Twelve hundred employees and more than 10.000 volunteers have helped countless disaster. accident. and terrorism victims within Israels borders. And on battlefields and disaster areas around the world. the relief service has distinguished itself with consummate caring. professionalism and bravery. Even the United States has been a beneficiary of the MDAs humanitarian efforts. Most recently. in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina MDA Israel launched an emergency mission named \"United Brotherhood\" to collect donations. funds. clothing and other equipment for the New Orleans survivors who were left homeless. Despite their indisputably noble work. for nearly 60 years the organization has been excluded from the international Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The reason? The Israeli agency has been excluded for 60 years because of its decision to retain its own protective symbol rather than adopt the Red Cross or the Red Crescent. Finally. this month. the impasse was broken. An overwhelming majority of the stateparties to the Geneva Conventions approved a new protective symbola \"Red Crystal\"-to allow the relief agency to operate as a member of the global humanitarian movement. Within Israels territory. the agency will still use the Red Star of David. Around the world. it will use the Red Crystal Protective Symbol. with the option of also displaying its traditional logo if the host country permits. Aside from a few remaining formalities. the Israeli emergency service will. finally. at long last. take its place as a full member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. I would have liked to have seen straightforward international recognition of the traditional symbol. But the new Red Crystal is a worthy and fair compromise. I commend the International Committee of the Red Cross and the American Red Cross for their efforts to bring this vital and life saving organization into the fold. And I applaud the Magen David Adom for their compassionate and honorable work inspired by faith and carried out everyday with extraordinary courage.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier this week. the Committee on Armed Services favorably reported the nomination of Mr. Dorrance Smith to the full Senate. Mr. Smith is an experienced and highly accomplished television executive. who has been nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. I have a copy of Mr. Smiths biography. and I would note that he is a fourtime Emmy award winning television producer who spent 9 months in Iraq from 2003 to 2004 where he served as Senior Media Advisor to Ambassador Paul Bremer. I have met with Mr. Smith on several occasions. I believe him to be highly qualified. and I fully support his nomination. At a full Armed Services Committee hearing on October 25. 2005. and later. at an executive session of the Armed Services Committee on December 13. at which Mr. Smith was present. he fully and respectfully answered all questions posed to him. Many questions focused on an op ed article he wrote as a private citizen that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 25. 2005. In this article. based on his \"in the trenches\" experience as Ambassador Bremers senior media advisor in Baghdad. Mr. Smith questioned the practice relied on by major media outlets in the United States of airing video of insurgent attacks supplied by the Arab satellite news channel Al Jazeera. I am satisfied with Mr. Smiths responses. I would note that no major media outlet. except Al Jazeera. expressed any concern about Mr. Smiths op ed. The post of Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs has been vacant since June 2003. Mr. Smith is an outstanding nominee. I urge favorable. rapid action by the full Senate on his nomination. I ask unanimous consent that the abovereferenced biography be printed in the RECORD.",

I worked with them to amend it to extend for 4 years the \"sunset\" of a provision first enacted in the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 that grants the Judicial Conference of the United States the authority to redact information from a judges mandatory financial disclosure in circumstances in which it is determined that the release of the information could endanger the filer or the filers family. The bill. as amended. also extends the protections of this provision to the family members of filers. Like the more comprehensive court security measure Senator SPECTER and I have introduced. S. 1968. the Court Security Improvement Act of 2005. CSIA. from which it is drawn. S. 1558 provides judges and their families with needed security by extending the judges redaction authority without interruption and expanding it to their families. It also strikes the right balance with the need for continuing congressional oversight to prevent the misuse of this redaction authority. which has been a matter of some concern to me. I appreciate that the Judicial Conference is seeking to improve its practices and the Senate passed S. 1558 because none of us wants to see judges or their families endangered. Now. because of the failure of the House to pass S. 1558 and enact the reauthorization of redaction authority for another 4year period. these protections will lapse at the end of the year.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today regarding the December 7 Korean Fair Trade Commission. KFTC. decision against Microsoft. A major employer in Washington. Microsoft is being unfairly penalized by Korea. but this decision goes well beyond Microsoft as the Korean Fair Trade Commissions decision is ultimately a decision against free and fair trade. When the European Commission issued its competition decision against Microsoft in March 2004. I was one of many Members who expressed serious concerns about the decision and its impact on one of Americas most innovative companies and its workers. Like many of my colleagues. however. I was also alarmed at the broader policy implications of the decisionthat Europe would adopt a decision whose negative impact on trade was so clear. and which diverged so markedly from the Department of Justices remedy addressing the same conduct. I believe that the December 7 decision of the Korean Fair Trade Commission against Microsoft is yet another warning sign that our trading partners are limiting competition in order to benefit their domestic interests. in this case. the Korean Fair Trade Commission not only followed the EUs marketdistorting. anticonsumer approach. but appears to have gone substantially further than the EU remedies In several respects. The KFTCs decision makes me wonder whether the Microsoft case is not a unique case but instead indicates the beginning of a trend among some of our key trading partners to use competition law as a means to pursue protectionist agendas or advance domestic industrial policy goals. If so. this should be of tremendous concern to every member of this body. Last week I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Portman about this issue. and I would like to ask unanimous consent to place that letter into the record. The letter urges Ambassador Portman to work with others in the administrationincluding at the White House and the Departments of Justice. State. and Commerceto develop and implement mechanisms for addressing these issues in a more coherent and effective fashion. At the same time. I urged Ambassador Portman to work with others in the administration to take whatever steps are still available to advance the U.S. perspective in the Microsoft case. so that the anticonsumer. antiinnovation decisions do not establish a precedent that harms U.S. competitiveness for years to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women. More than 211.240 new cases of breast cancer in women will be diagnosed in the United States in 2005. In my own State of Connecticut. more than 2.600 women are expected to be diagnosed and 530 are expected to die from breast cancer this year. Overall. it is believed that 1 in every 10 women will develop breast cancer at least once in their lifetime. The best defense against breast cancer. is early detection. The sooner one can detect breast cancer. the better the chances that the disease can be successfully treated. It is because of this that the American Cancer Society suggests that all women age 40 and over have a mammogram annually. As important. women must learn to do regular self breast exams. Women generally will understand their bodies better than doctors. In Connecticut. early detection from mammograms and self breast exam has helped our State achieve a 5year survival rate. for those women diagnosed with breast cancer. of 97 percent. That is one of the highest such survival rates in the country. As successful as my State has been. we have not been successful enough. We must strive to increase awareness and education of breast cancer so that all women are aware of the risk it poses and the indisputable benefits of early detection. We must increase research into the relationship between environmental exposures. genetic predisposition. and breast cancer risk and also seek new drugs and tools that will allow health care professionals to better treat breast cancer patients with the goal of cure. It is in this spirit on January 21. 2006. Eastern Mountain Sports Connecticut stores will sponsor the Winter Wonderland Walk for the Cure to benefit both breast cancer research and the Connecticut chapter of the Susan C. Women Breast Cancer Foundation. at Tarrywile Park in Danbury. CT. Therefore. it is my pleasure to join Connecticuts Governor. M. Jodi Rell. herself a breast cancer survivor. in celebrating. in recognition of the need to increase awareness about breast cancer and the need for early detection.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to speak on the disturbing reports of political chaos in Ethiopia. With allegations of vote tampering and emerging pictures of largescale human rights abuses taking place in Ethiopia. that the administration must impress upon Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other global neighbors. that severe consequences follow actions which undermine democratic ideals. Ethiopia held its first ever democratic elections on May 15. 2005. Revelations since then of violence and mass detention of Ethiopian citizens by the Meles government are not only alarming and disconcerting to me and the American people who have supported the country in its effort to advance the cause of democracy. It is regretful to have to witness a regress in democratization. Roughly 90 percent of Ethiopias populace turned out for the democratic election. Rather than a sentiment of accomplishment or progress. the mood of the country remains nihilistically somber. According to international human rights observers. increased repression of the Ethiopian people is connected to the seeming loss of power from the ruling Meles government to the opposing party. the Coalition for Unity & Democracy. CUDhas shown by early vote counts during the election. With the Meles government accused of voting irregularities. it is not surprising that the people of Ethiopia protested the unofficial election results. Recent reports of human rights abuses in Ethiopia range from arrest and intimidation by government authorities and illegal arrests of innocent people. including ranking members of the CUD party and media representatives. to the loss of life. For example. some 14.000 people were detained when riots ensued following the election. Among other journalists. Getachew Simie. former editor of the Amhariclanguage weekly. and Leykun Dngeda. former publisher of the Dagim WonchifWeekly. have been given jail sentences for covering the antigovernment protests. Even Prime Minister Meles reported that 48 people were killed last month in relation to the unrest caused by the alleged fraud in the May polls. Prime Minister Meles must fulfill his good faith commitment to human rights. With any successful transition to democracy. civil society requires the firm accountability of its government authorities. Until the Meles government brings an end to the intimidation of its people. political unrest will remain high and Americas support for the democratization of Ethiopia will be muted by concern for the countrys political instability.",

The Justice Department provided statistics. and last year we saw a decrease in the numbers of labs. There is one way of looking at that. that these Byrne grants have done their job by helping local law enforcement. The reality is that while it is our local law enforcement that is finding these labs and breaking them up. and there is one that just moved away from my house. and a month or so before that they found one in the trunk of a car at super department store in a very affluent neighborhood in west Omaha. so these can be anywhere. But what my local police officers are telling me is while the labs are a major part of the supply or a significant part of the supply. it is actually more now from the gang drug network coming in from the superlabs in Mexico that the gentleman spoke about. So as we are fighting the good fight and shutting down the labs. the drug dealers have found a new way to create supply in a different country across the border.

AfricanAmericans on staff with the Senate. At Finance. there were just three staff members with the committee and no standing subcommittees. Today. there are 70 staff members and 5 standing subcommittees. During his more than 30 years with the committee. he created the committees archival system and became our resident historian. He also contributed to the history of the Senate as a whole. In 1994. he generously participated in an extensive oral history for the Senate Historical Office. In it. he describes some of his most memorable moments during his long tenure. Mr. Nichols rubbed elbows with some of the most important leaders of the daybut he was excluded from eating in the Capitols restaurant and cafeterias because of his race.

Senator Long in particular called Mr. Nichols a \"senior member\" of the committee and \"one of Gods best people.\" When Mr. Nichols finally retired in 1971. the committee had to hire two people to carry on his extensive work.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I want to pay tribute to the life of Jesse Nichols. Sr.. who passed away on February 22. 2005. Jesse R. Nichols. Sr.. faithfully served the U.S. Senate for over 30 years. He was the first African American Clerk employed by the U.S. Senate. Jesse Nichols was born on June 14. 1909. in Clarksdale. MS. He began his service when the late Pat Harrison of Mississippi was the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committeethe committee I am now privileged to chair. Jesse was appointed as a messenger for the Finance Committee in 1936. and was elevated about 6 months later to assistant clerk of the Committee. At that time. the staff of the Finance Committee numbered only three. In 1967. on the occasion of his thirtieth anniversary on the Senate staff. several members of the Finance Committee. led by Delaware Republican John J. Williams. rose in the Senate chamber to pay tribute to Jesse Nichols who had \"earned the respect of those former giants of the Senate. each of whom was proud to call him a friend.\" Senator Williams added that: It is refreshing to meet a man who throughout the years has served the Senate and his country with but one thought in mind. and that is. to do his job to the best of his ability. always remembering that as a Government employee he is a servant of the people. Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen added his endorsement. noting that: Thirty years of faithful and devoted service certainly deserves to be taken account of in the proceedings of this body. An oral history interview conducted by the Senate Historical Office from March 26 to April 12. 1994. is available on the Senate Web site. The history documents Jesses employment by the Committee on Finance from the 75th Congress through the 91st Congress. He worked under the guidance of Democratic and Republican Chairmen. including Walter F. George of Georgia. I Senator Eugene Millikin of Colorado. Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia and Russell B. Long of Louisiana. Jesse Nichols service was faithful. exemplary and noteworthy. He served not only the Finance Committee with class and grace. but also the Senate as a whole during that critical period in American history. I join my colleagues in recognizing Mr. Nichols life and am grateful to his service to our country.",

At the hearing this year. I think we explored in considerable detail the issue of his DC bar membership. It is always a difficult matter when a lawyer is a member of one bar and seeks to become a member of another. I know I went through a similar issue when I took the New Jersey bar. 23 years after I attended law school. It is an experience. but I went through it. However. I think this by no means disqualifies Mr. Griffith. and I think the issue has been adequately explained on the record. Tom Griffith is well known in the Senate. perhaps better known than virtually any other judicial nominee who comes here. because he had been legal counsel to the Senate. I think many people who know Mr. Griffith on a personal. intimate basis know of his high ethical standards. his scholarship. and his legal ability. He is soft spoken. He is mature. He is knowledgeable. I think he will make a fine circuit judge. Mr. Griffith comes with an especially strong recommendation from the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Senator HATCH. who has known Mr. Griffith personally for many years. and speaks very highly of him. Regrettably. I cannot be here tomorrow to speak again. as is the practice for the chairman to speak immediately before leadership. because I will be traveling in Pennsylvania with President Bush.

You had to go all the way back to Abraham Lincolns time to find anything similar to it. when we met in this body with the Chief Justice of the United States. William Rehnquist. sitting in the chair. and held an impeachment trial of the President of the United States. I doubt very much that will ever happen again. It was a very different kind of trial than the one that occurred with Andrew Johnson the first time this happened. That was purely political with Andrew Johnson. and everybody recognized that. I remember a Member of this body saying that we had actually had three impeachment situations in our history: The first. Andrew Johnson. the second that never got to the Senate. which was Richard Nixon. and the third. President Clinton. The Senator said Andrew Johnson. clearly not guilty. clearly a political vendetta Richard Nixon. clearly guilty. clearly should have been removedhe stopped that by resigning.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. the Air Force and the Navy together requested $55.9 million for base exchange projects at Keesler Air Force base. and the Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport in Mississippi. The request for Keesler was $40 million. The request for two projects at Gulfport. $15.9 million. The committee has not included funding for these facilities. Base exchanges. including construction. are typically resourced through non appropriated funds. The exchanges use their sales revenue to fund their operations as well as their capital costs. Congress provided $3.8 million to construct a temporary exchange at Keesler in December in the December supplemental. But now we are being asked to build a permanent facility at over 10 times that cost. The committee is concerned about setting a precedent for using military construction funds for exchanges. We have been told that the Army and Air Force Exchange Service has a $251 million capital budget for Fiscal Year 2006. and the Navy Exchange has a capital budget of $68 million. We believe that they should first look to their capital budgets to pioritize and fund these projects. The committee is also concerned about the exchanges policy of self insuring these facilities. This means that when a disaster happens. like Hurricane Katrina. a fire and so forth. the taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill. That is why we had directed the Department of Defense to take a hard look at the possibility of privately insuring these facilities. We dont tell AAFES or NEX what to do with their non appropriated funds. But we are concerned about them passing on these risks and costs to taxpayers. The committee will continue to take a look at this issue as we go into conference with the Senate. But at this point. I must oppose the gentlemans amendment.

I have served on the authorizing committee for about 16 years now. In the span of that 16 years. I dont ever recall a request from our colleagues on appropriation to pass language to either force or encourage the commissaries to be selfinsured. And I think I am pretty keen on this issue and I am pretty confident in saying we have never received a request from your committee to do that. So now that the President is willing to make this commissary whole. that obviously the need is there. that it was indeed an act of God. that it is authorized. I find it strange that at this time Keesler Air Force base and AAFES would be punished for not fulfilling a request that they never got. On the other hand. I think we could fulfill requirements of the Presidents request. fulfill what is best for AAFES. fulfill what is best for the airmen. for the retirees and the active duty personnel. The people who flew the missions into the hurricane shop at this commissary. People who fly missions in Iraq shop at this commissary. It is a part of their compensation that was promised. It is a part of the compensation that has been denied.

Madam Speaker and Members. lowincome Americans have been struggling to pay for heating bills during the winter: and. thankfully. this winter has not been as cold as expected and heating bills have not increased as greatly as feared. However. natural gas prices that drive electric prices have quadrupled over the past several years. The States public utilities commissions. PUCs. are passing those costs on to our constituents. Lowincome Americans also struggle to pay cooling bills. When the 90 and 100 degrees heat rolls around this year. the situation is going to become very critical very quickly.

Northern States do very well. and relatively little funding goes to the South. Above this $2 billion trigger. however. the formula becomes much fairer. for Congress has never crossed this trigger by any large amount. that is until tonight. The Senate compromise legislation provides an extra $500 million to the LIHEAP formula over and above the $2 billion Congress has already provided. This is incredibly important for regional equity. This legislation has provided $500 million in contingency funding which can be used for emergencies such as blizzards. heat waves. hurricanes. and this funding is required to be allocated in 2006. Today marks the first day we have a real chance to cross that $2 billion trigger and provide a measure of equity for the warm States. Importantly. today also marks the best chance to increase LIHEAP for 2006 for cold States as well by providing 2006 contingency funding. If we pass this legislation today. the LIHEAP allocations for 2006 will become much more equitable between regions. It is important we pass this legislation today. It will directly go to the Presidents desk and provide immediate extra assistance for the Northern and the Southern States this year.

I am from New Hampshire. one of the cold weather States. and even though the weather has been somewhat warmer than might be expected in most winters. we have seen at times a spike in the price of home heating oil by nearly 65 percent in some instances. It has abated somewhat. but nevertheless prices of home heating oil this winter are significantly higher. We all know how successful the LIHEAP. the Low Income Heating Assistance Program. has been. It is effectively monitored by State and local interests. but it is funded at the Federal level. My State has seen about a 12 percent increase in applications this winter because of that spike in prices. My State has allocated all of the dollars it has received so far to trying to process the applications that it has and it is committed. and without this funding. the State of New Hampshire and other cold weather States are going to have to dip into their own State funds to help fund a Federal program in 2006. My State. before the emergency funding was released by the President. was nearly $3 million short. that is about 15 percent under last year and at a time when there is record demand and record high prices. That is why this bill is so important. Madam Speaker. why we need to bring it up. have this vote tonight. get it to the Presidents desk.

In reality. we will have to find $1.4 billion when you work out the numbers to match the level provided for 2006. That is in the 2007 bill. So I reiterate. that means $1.4 billion will have to come out of education or medical research. because I just do not see any enhanced allocation to do that. Now. in adopting the supplemental. we recognize the potential emergency. and we provided language in there. This is an amendment that I offered in the supplemental in the full committee that allows the shift of $750 million as needed to address any shortfall in 2006. but we do not mandate that It be done. Under the Snowe approach. this would force the expenditure. and if the funds were not used. they would lapse. And I think that it is just not good management to require. as this bill does. the movement of this money from 2007 to 2006. and therefore. run the risk that it might lapse. When we tried to address the problem in the supplemental by saying that the money could be used up to $750 million if needed. and I think that is a much better solution. It is a more responsible solution to manage of potential problem without impinging heavily on the 2007 money and forcing the committee to make that up to the amount of $1.4 billion out of other very important programs.

In most cases. a program like LIHEAP is funded from general revenue. and what Mr. REGULA said is absolutely true. absolutely true. In this case. the budget reconciliation package for the fiscal year 2007 or the budget reconciliation package that we just passed. the Energy and Commerce Committee. on a bipartisan basis. worked to offset by saving in other areas of our jurisdiction so that we could plusup LIHEAP by $1 billion. So the LIHEAP money that is before us today in the bill that is coming over from the other body has been paid for. Now. it is true as the gentleman from Ohio said that that money was supposed to be spent in fiscal year 2007. but it is also true that we need additional funds for 2006. And we are going to need additional funds. in all likelihood. in the warm weather States this summer. because of the expected heat. We have already had a record heat wave in Texas 2 weeks ago. It was 95 degrees. I will pledge to Mr. REGULA and Mr. LEWIs and Mr. OBEY and all the folks. the appropriators. that if we get the will of our leadership.

This bill is not understood by Senators who are making representations on the floor which are not correct. I dont suggest they are doing it deliberately. but they dont know the bill. The argument has been made that the recipient of a national security letter has to tell the FBI the identity of his lawyer. That is simply not true. The conference report reads: In no circumstance shall a person be required to inform the Director of the FBI or such designee that the person intends to consult an attorney to obtain legal advice or legal assistance. The representation is made here again and again that in section 215. there does not have to be a connection to a terrorism investigation or someone suspected of being a terrorist. The conference report does add a provision to the three criteria for foreign power. but the court has to make a determination on a factual showing that there is a terrorism investigation that does involve foreigners and that records are sought from another person. albeit not identified with one of the three criteria. in order to carry on the investigation. Again and again. the essence of the protection of civil rights traditionally has been that you interpose an impartial magistrate between the policeman and the citizen. and that protection is given under section 215. The argument has been made repeatedly that under the national security letter. there is no review. That is simply not the case. The recipient goes to a lawyer who can challenge the national security letter in court and have it quashed. eliminated. dispensed with. on a showing that it is unreasonable. If you get to the national security issue. then it is different with respect to a badfaith showing. There is judicial review beforehand on the very broad term of being unreasonable. which is a hallmark of American law in auto accident cases and antitrust cases every time you turn around. The reasonable standard is traditional under our law. I yield to the Senator from Arizona. who has requested 2 minutes. and he can take whatever time he chooses.",

The Senator was on the Intelligence Committee the day he came to the Senate. He was elected in 1994. 1 chaired the Intelligence Committee of the 104th Congress. He has been on it. He has been on Judiciary. He has been a leader on this measure. As the Senator said. he had trouble signing the conference report. By the way. I thank him for signing the conference report. Without his signature. we could not have filed it. As to the other provisions beside the wall. if the PATRIOT Act lapses. and there is none. what will the effect be on the fight against terrorism?",

That could have been done with or without the PATRIOT Act. All of us rallied behind the administration. even though the attack occurred during this administration and the attack occurred even though this administrations Department of Justice had information which might have stopped the attack.

Even if the relevant change made by the PATRIOT Act expired. there would be no legal barrier to informationsharing. and no wall would go back up. because FISA as it existed prePATRIOT Act contained no such barrier. So ruled the FISA court of review in November 2002 at the request of the government. It held that the change we made in the PATRIOT Act to take down the wall was not necessary. that FISA never required a wall. and that the Department of Justice unnecessarily imposed bureaucratic constraints on sharing information. So let us not delude ourselves into thinking that somehow the wall goes back up if PATRIOT expires. It does not. It was not legally required in the first place. How much time do I have remaining?",

It is as simple as that. Some Members of Congress have called for a retreatanddefeat strategy in Iraq. and that is the wrong strategy in Iraq. and it is the wrong strategy here at home. A vote against the PATRIOT Act amounts to retreat and defeat here at home. against terrorism. To those who still harbor concerns with this bill. I have a simple reply: We have more to fear from terrorists than this PATRIOT Act compromise. The compromise includes more civil liberty safeguards than in current law. more congressional oversight. more judicial review.

We saw this amazing step in todays news. where Americans are being spied on. not through any court order. not through any act of Congress. not with any oversight. not with any check and balance. but simply by a stroke of the pen of the President. following the advice of the same people in the Department of Justice who advised him that torture was legal. We have rejected the concept that torture is legal. We should reject the concept that we can have Americans spy on Americans with no checks and balances in a free and democratic Nation such as ours.

Goldman Sachs. whose previous contributions to the U.S. Government included John Whitehead. Deputy Secretary of State under President Reagan. and Robert Rubin. the Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton. Senator CORZINE followed in that tradition of very successful men who could do anything they wanted with their lives for the rest of their lives but had chosen to commit themselves to public service. It has been an honor and a privilege and a pleasure to serve with Senator CORZINE these last 5 years. to learn from his own wisdom and experience as it relates to so many matters affecting the betterment of our country. and then to watch him forego what would have been a safe track and a relatively easy reelection next year as a Senator because he felt he could be of better service to his fellow citizens from New Jersey by acting as their Governor. going through the rigors and ordeals of another campaign. a challenging endeavor but where he sacrificed himself and his own resources in order to give greater service to the people of New Jersey. Our loss in the Senate with his departure will be a gain for his fellow citizens from that State as he devotes full time in New Jersey to their better interests. I wish him well. We will miss him.

That is something Senator DURBIN added to the mix. I think I had heard that but had forgotten it. He was successful in the financial world in an extraordinary way. He was a marine. Of course. every marine I have known has been shaped by that. and I believe Senator Zell Miller wrote a book saying that everything he ever needed to know he learned in the Marine Corps. or something to that effect. JON CORZINE has been an active Member of the Senate. I remember the time we spent together in Montgomery. AL. on a civil rights trip. We were at the church that Martin Luther King preached in on Dexter Avenue. the Dexter Avenue Church. We had a discussion at that time about Rosa Parks. whom we have just honored and who recently passed away. At that very site. Martin Luther King led the efforts of the bus boycott that ended the concept that a person must go to the back of the bus because of the color of their skin. JON CORZINE didnt have to go to Montgomery. but he was interested in those issues and he believed strongly in equality and civil rights. Senator CORZINE has been a strong advocate for the Democratic Party and its principles. heading its campaign committee. We didnt agree on those issues. but he was always courteous and professional. I cannot remember a single harsh word that we have had. In fact. I cannot remember him having a harsh word with any other Senators. I have enjoyed the opportunity to know JON CORZINE and to gain respect for him. I wish him every success as Governor of the important State of New Jersey.

He decided to enter public service and was elected to the Senate in 2000 where he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of New Jersey. In November. Senator CORZINE was elected to be Governor of New Jersey and I am confident he will continue his outstanding public service work in this new position. I am very pleased that while he served in the Senate. Senator CORZINE had the opportunity to visit my home State of South Dakota in 2002 during my reelection campaign.

I am pleased to join the Senator from Virginia as an original cosponsor of legislation to study and promote the use of energy efficient computer servers in the United States. The growth of the Internet and online applications and the strong demand for electronic transactions are creating a growing need for data centers. Most data center equipment is composed of servers. which are computers that share resources with other computers on a network. The average annual power and cooling bill for 100 servers is about $40.000from Computer World. February 6. 2006. The U.S. server market is expected to grow from 2.8 billion servers in 2005 to 4.9 billion in 2009. Without improved efficiency. data center power costs could easily overtake hardware costs in the next few yearsA. Fanara. EPA. technical workshop on server benchmarking. March 27. 2006. Our bill would require the Administrator of EPA to study and analyze the growth and energy consumption of computer data centers. A critical goal of the study is to develop a standard way to measure server efficiency. Energy efficient servers and data center designs are currently available. This analysis would help promote the use of efficient server technology through the Energy Star Program or the Department of Energys buildings standards program and allow consumers to compare products on the basis of efficiency. This legislation has broad support from the information technology sector and energy efficiency advocates. including the Alliance to Save Energy. the American Electronics Association. the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. the Electronic Industries Alliance. the Information Technology Industry Council. the Semiconductor Association. and leading companies such as Intel.

On July 12 Hezbollah militants launched an attack into northern Israel. killing seven Israeli soldiers and kidnapping two soldiers to hold hostage in Lebanon. On June 25. despite Israels evacuation of Gaza almost a year ago. Hamas entered sovereign Israeli territory. attacked an Israeli military base. killed two Israeli soldiers and kidnapped one. who is still being held captive. Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist organizations supported by Syria and Iran. The Senate is on the record demanding that Syria and Iran abandon their sponsorship of terrorism. with legislation including the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 and the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. Syria. Iran. and the Hezbollah terrorists that these states sponsor are responsible for the current violence in the Middle East. The kidnapping of Israeli soldiers from Israeli soil and the exploitation of civilian populations as shields are provocations to which any sovereign nation would be obligated to react. Israel has every right to respond to protect her citizens. These terrorists must be stopped. Terrorists destroy lives. They destroy hope. They destroy the opportunity for peace. The independent militias in Lebanon must be dismantled and withdrawn. The Lebanese government must take steps to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 and disarm the Hezbollah forces operating within its territory. The Israeli soldiers being held captive by Hezbollah or Hamas must be released immediately and unconditionally. I urge President Bush to use all available political and diplomatic means to persuade the governments of Syria and Iran to end their support of Hezbollah and Hamas. We are united in our rejection and condemnation of the heinous acts of Hezbollah and Hamas and the governments of Syria and Iran are supporting them. We are also united.

This bill will strengthen the ExIm Banks ability to allow American companies to compete in the global market as we try to increase our exports and increase our global competitiveness and create more and better paying jobs right here in the United States. This is a bill about exporting products. not a bill about exporting jobs. Additionally. I am happy to say both the Senate and House versions of this bill include language that I coauthored pertaining to the nation of Armenia. a great ally of our country. My language. done with Congressman ED ROYCE on the other side of the aisle and Congressman BRAD SHERMAN. prohibits the ExIm Bank from funding any railway projects from Azerbaijan through Jordan and Turkey which specifically and intentionally bypasses Armenia. I am very pleased that this language was included in the final version of this legislation. This language will assist in promoting stability in the Caucasus region. help in ending longstanding conflicts and save U.S. taxpayers the responsibility of funding a project that goes against U.S. interests. For over 10 years. Armenia has fought a blockade imposed on them by the countries of Turkey and Azerbaijan. These two countries continually exclude Armenia from regional development. Exclusion of one country in regional projects only fosters instability in that region. Besides possibly creating a regional crisis. this project. if funded by the ExIm Bank. could cost U.S. taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. I do not believe that the U.S. taxpayers should be funding a project that goes against our United States interests. I am pleased this good language was added to an already good bill. Therefore.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of S. 3938. the ExportImport Bank Reauthorization Act of 2006. a strong compromise between the House and Senate versions of bills reauthorizing this countrys vital export credit agency. This is the second time as Chairman ot the Financial Services Committee that I have been involved with the ExIm Banks reauthorization and I remain a strong supporter of the Bank primarily because it continues to create and sustain American jobs. Since our last authorization in 2002. the Bank has provided guarantees on loans to buyers of U.S. exports and insurance products numbering close to 11.500 total transactionsof which $7 billion of authorizations supported over $63 billion in export value. Alongside these numbers is the very impressive fact that last year alone the Bank returned over $1.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury in the form of fees. far outstripping the $145 million appropriated. Madam Speaker. I also am proud to note that like many of the bills we have passed throughout my chairmanship of the Financial Services Committee. this was an overwhelming bipartisan effort. led by Chairman DEBORAH PRYCE and Ranking Member CAROLYN MALONEY as well as Representatives BIGGERT. VELA.ZQUEZ and MANZULLO and with the strong support of this committees next chairman. BARNEY FRANK. This bill also represents important input from the Committee on Small Business. various export and banking experts. representatives ot both small and large businesses. environmentalists and even a former president of the Bank. Madam Speaker. the bill before us makes changes necessary to keep the Bank vital through the 5 years of this reauthorization. The greatest of these changes will be the creation of a permanent Small Business Division whose function will be conducting outreach programs and tailoring Bank products to be more userfriendly for small businesses. This division will better equip the Bank to meet its mandate of making 20 percent of its total loans and guarantees available to small businesses. with particular emphasis towards helping small businesses owned by women. minorities. and the socially and economically disadvantaged. Additionally the bill contains a number of reporting requirements that will allow Congress to better monitor the Banks activities. Madam Speaker. passage of S. 3938 will enable the Bank to be even more successful during the next 5 years. I urge its passage today.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I want to begin by thanking the outgoing and incoming Chairmen of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. OXLEY and Mr. FRANK. the outgoing DIMP subcommittee Chairwoman. Ms. PRYCE. and my colleague from New York. Mrs. MALONEY for working together in such a bipartisan way to reauthorize the ExportImport Bank. I believe the legislation we have before us today significantly improves the ability of the bank to respond to the needs of small business exporters and particularly minority and womenowned small business exporters. By creating a new office for socially and disadvantaged small businesses and businesses owned by women. we are responding to a critical and glaring gap in Exlms outreach programs. The office builds directly from an amendment that I coauthored in 2001 during the last reauthorization which required ExIm to annually report on the number and type of transactions it conducts with minority and womenowned businesses. The inadequate reporting from ExIm and their token support for minority outreach has made this new office a necessity. I want to thank my colleagues for making it a priority. and specifically Ms. VELAZQUEZ for her work on this. I also want to express my gratitude to Ms. PRYCE and Mr. FRANK for agreeing to add language to the managers amendment which requires the Bank President to consider qualified minority and women applicants when filling positions within this new office. My amendment will ensure that ExIm conducts culturally competent and sensitive outreach by hiring individuals who can relate to the particular challenges faced by minority and womenowned small businesses and who can speak their language. I am also supportive of the provisions in the bill to increase small business exports. simplity ExIms application process. reaffirm our commitment to expanding exports to SubSaharan Africa and expand transparency at the Bank. I believe that improvements to ExIm could still have been made. in particular. to ensure compliance with environmental standards following the completion of a transaction. and to get a better understanding of what ExIms real impact is in creating and retaining American jobs. However. in the next Congress as we conduct oversight of ExIm and its implementation of this bill. I hope that we can continue to examine these remaining issues.",

Borlaug Act of Senate 2250 directs the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate to make appropriate arrangements to award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to Dr. Norman Borlaug in recognition of his enduring contributions in fighting hunger around the world. This legislation is identical to H.R. 4924. introduced by the gentleman from Iowa . Madam Speaker. Dr. Borlaug is a Nobel Peace Prize recipient of whom few have heard. a humanitarian responsible for mounting a global campaign against hunger that saved so many of the worlds neediest people through agricultural science. In 1944. he took on the task of researching highyield and diseaseresistant cereal grains. Through trial and error. Dr. Borlaugs efforts led to the development of varieties of wheat that completely altered production agriculture as it was then known in places like Pakistan. India and Mexico. The dwarf wheat variety allowed farmers to produce far more grain per acre than anyone could have predicted. This newfound bounty gave the worlds poorest people access to food. ensuring children who otherwise would have been victims of malnutrition could thrive. Dr. Borlaugs landmark discoveries in agriculture led to what is called the \"Green Revolution.\" However. this modest man. born and raised in Cresco. Iowa. and educated in Minnesota. once said his accomplishments were only \"a temporary success in mans war against hunger and deprivation.\" Madam Speaker. I recognize that many in Congress and throughout the country do not know about the progress we have made in production agriculture and are unaware of the countless contributions made by agricultural scientists such as Dr. Borlaug. However. his leadership has inspired so many others of our best and brightest students to pursue careers in agriculture sciences. and his work will live on in the lives of those who have been spared the misery of starvation. Madam Speaker. this is an honor long overdue. and I would urge immediate passage of this important legislation. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2250 to pay tribute to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug for his lifes work to feed the worlds poor. It is because of Dr. Borlaugs success in developing highyield and disease resistant cereal grains that billions of the wordds poorest people have been fed. In 1944. Dr. Borlaugs work began when he and his research team were tasked by the Rockefeller Foundation to increase wheat production in Mexico. Through years of crossbreading thousands of wheat varieties. they were able to develop highyield dwarf wheat that was resistant to diseases known to cause significant crop damage such as \"rust\" fungi. As a result. Mexico became selfsufficient in wheat production. Dr. Borlaugs findings came at a time when dire predictions were being made about the worlds population growth and the possibility of mass starvation in poorer parts of the world. But. he continued to build on his findings from his work in Mexico and later worked with researchers in Pakistan and India to give farmers in those countries and regions highyield dwarf wheat to increase their wheat production. The outreach was successful. and like Mexico. those countries also became selfsufficient in producing wheat. It is for this work that Dr. Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. When the board was presenting him with the honor. they made the following statement on his humanitarian contributions: \"More than any other single person of this age. [he] has helped to provide bread for a hungry world. We have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace.\" In todays world. it is easy to get caught up in our everyday lives and to overlook some of the landmark achievements that have made dramatic improvements in the lives of others. In this case. one individual improved the lives of billions of people by giving them access to lifesustaining nourishment. Mr. Speaker. Dr. Borlaugs contributions to help relieve the worlds poorest of hunger have saved billions of lives. and have inspired a new generation of researchers in agriculture to continue the fight against hunger. It is for these reasons that I ask my colleagues to support this bill to honor Dr. Borlaug with the Congressional Gold Medal..",

Dextromethorphan. or DXM as it is sometimes called. is an ingredient found in cough medicine. This ingredient relieves the coughing associated with a cold or the flu. Cough medicines containing this drug are common and can be obtained without a prescription. While this drug is safe and effective. it is also dangerous if too much is taken. Reports have shown that some segments of the population. particularly young people. will take large amounts of this medicine in an attempt to absorb large amounts of DXM in order to get high. The abuse of this drug can cause death as well as other serious adverse effects such as brain damage. seizures. loss of consciousness. and irregular heartbeat. The Food and Drug Administration has warned of the rise in the abuse of DXM. and the bill before us here today is an attempt to stem this abuse. H.R. 5280 would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prohibit the distribution of DXM that is in bulk form to any person not registered with the FDA. It is hoped that these restrictions on the distribution of DXM will lower the potential for its abuse. while at the same time protecting the public health. Mr. Speaker.

On the night of April 24. 1915. the Ottoman Empire arrested over 200 Armenian community leaders in Constantinople. thereby marking only the beginning of the horrendous Armenian Genocide to come. On the eve of World War I. an estimated two million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire. Well over a million were deported and hundreds of thousands were simply killed. Between 1915 and 1918. the Ottoman Empire conducted other atrocities against Armenians which also included abduction. torture. massacre and starvation. Armenians living in Armenia and Anatolia were forcibly moved to Syria. where they were left in the desert to die of hunger and thirst. In addition. there were systematic murders. women and children were abducted from their homes and abused. It has been estimated that one and half million Armenians died as a result of this genocide from 1915 to 1923. By 1923 the entire landmass of Asia Minor and historic West Armenia had been expunged of its Armenian population. On this important anniversary. it is a lasting lesson to people everywhere that genocide must not only be opposed by all nations. but that it must be universally recognized as a crime against humanityno matter where it occurs or against whom it is carried out.",

As Americans. we must guarantee that our foreign policy reflects our values of justice. equality and responsibility. These values should apply in all of our international interactions. including those with Turkey. a NATO ally. Turkey wishes to increase its global profile through accession to organizations such as the European Union. However. if Turkey wishes to gain the worlds respect. it must earn it. It must demonstrate its commitment to peace and democracy in the region. It must reopen its borders. end its blockade of Armenia. and encourage Azerbaijan to end its aggressive rhetoric. And most importantly. it must accept responsibility for past injustices through an unconditional recognition of the Armenian Genocide. Only then can Turkey begin to come to terms with its history. Only then can Armenians seek justice from the Turkish government for the losses of so much and so many. Last month. I was honored to lead a conference session for Rhode Island students in which we discussed the genocide and what steps our government should take to recognize that tragedy appropriately. I think practically every student present that morning was amazed that. despite overwhelming evidence and widespread support. Congress has not yet passed the genocide resolution. It is time for Congress and the White House to speak with one voice and ensure that our national ideals are reflected in our foreign policy. Consequently. I joined many of my colleagues in asking the President to recognize the Armenian Genocide in unambiguous terms. and I will again cosponsor the Genocide Resolution when it is reintroduced in the coming weeks. As an ardent supporter of Rhode Islands ArmenianAmerican community throughout my public service career. I am proud to join my colleagues to today in honoring the victims of the genocide by paying tribute to their memory. showing compassion for those who have suffered from such prejudice. and never forgetting the pain that they have endured.",

I rise in strong support of legislation to bury the destructive death tax once and for all. and I might mention that my personal experiences. even with my own family and others. has been just the opposite of the gentleman who just spoke before. Nearly everywhere I go throughout my largely rural. agricultural district in northern California. I hear from businessmen and businesswomen and many farmers and ranchers who have had to liquidate and sell a family business or farm just to pay the Federal estate tax. This is simply wrong. Four years ago. I joined with President Bush and a majority of Representatives and Senators in an effort to enact into law historic tax relief legislation. including repeal of the death tax. Unfortunately. due to outdated Senate budget rules. the 2001 tax law will sunset on December 31. 2010. This has created an incredibly unfair and arbitrary situation. Consider that the heirs of those who pass away In 2010 will face no death tax whatsoever. while those whose families are unfortunate enough to pass away in 2011 or thereafter will face tax rates of up to 55 percent on their assets. forcing many of them to have to sell. Certainly no one can reasonably argue that this is rational tax policy. Furthermore. the death tax extracts a high cost from American taxpayers. Studies have found that family businesses spend up to $125.000 on attorneys. accountants and financial experts to assist in estate planning. These dollars could otherwise be used to modernize equipment. expand their business or farms and create new jobs. Mr. Speaker. the death tax is. without question. one of the most destructive. counterproductive and unfair provisions of our Tax Code. Let us bury the death tax once and for all.

As mentioned. this bill would add $290 billion in debt. and who would benefit? The very. very wealthy. Onethird of the estate tax is paid by the wealthiest 1 of 1.000 Americans. I think that is onetenth of 1 percent. Not farmers or small business people. That is the lamest argument brought to this floor in recent memory. The Pomeroy amendment would totally take care of this. and what my majority colleagues bill does. and it is interesting. they do not come here and say so. they would increase the taxes for thousands and thousands of Americans. These citizens would have to pay capital gains tax when they do not now do so. Why do my colleagues not come here and say this is a tax increase for thousands of Americans? They do not say that. What this is also. everybody should understand. is a further raid on Social Security funds. My colleagues have come here. some of them on the majority side. talking about Social Security and how we need to address the shortfall.

We talk about being fiscally responsible. we talk about trying to balance the Federal budget and say we have a problem with Social Security as far as longterm solvency of 75 years. but let me point out that the revenue loss of this bill equals the 75year amount to provide longterm solvency for Social Security. What we do here is make choices. If we have a choice to provide for the longterm strength of Social Security or the passage of this bill. my vote is for the longterm solvency of Social Security. The second issue I would like to point out is the predictability of the current estate tax situation. It is not very predictable. and the passage of this bill will do nothing to assure people when they do their estate plans that they can rely upon the schedule Congress has passed. We have a chance with the Pomeroy substitute to bring certainty to estate taxes with a reasonable exemption of $3.5 million. $7 million per couple. and reducing permanently the tax by 10 percent. That is what people want when they do their estate planning. They want predictability. So if Members are fiscal conservatives and are concerned about the cost of this bill on our children and seniors and if Members want predictability in the estate tax. this legislation does not give it to us. This legislation should be rejected. and we should pass a bill that provides certainty with the estate tax. We will have that opportunity with the fiscally responsible substitute so we can deal with the budget problems of this country. We are borrowing way too much money for our children and grandchildren. They deserve better than that. They deserve a Congress that will be fiscally responsible. and the passage of this bill just does not do it. I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.",

Benjamin Franklin said: --In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.\" but I doubt even the inventive Mr. Franklin imagined the taxation of death itself. Americans get taxed when they earn money. They get taxed again when they spend what is left. and government pursues them beyond the grave. devastating their relatives who must sell the family farm or liquidate the family business just to pay the taxes. The impact of the death tax extends far beyond the pain it inflicts upon grieving families. The death tax distorts economic decisions on a massive scale. It punishes thrift. It reduces savings and investment. and it diverts capital away from job creation to tax avoidance. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has estimated that the death tax will compel onethird of small business owners today to sell some or all of their business. The Center For the Study of Taxation found that 70 percent of all family businesses cannot survive the second generation and 87 percent do not make the third. All of this wasted money. energy and over 100.000 jobs lost per year and for what. a tax that the Joint Economic Committee says costs just as much to collect as it generates in revenue. Mr. Speaker. the opponents of H.R. 8 cannot provide any justification for the continued existence of this useless relic. It hurts the people it is intended to help. and it reduces stock in our economy by $497 billion a year. I urge my colleagues to drive the final nail in this coffin so 6 years from now Americans will not wake up to find that. like a vampire. this unfair tax has arisen from the dead to once again suck the blood from a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice.",

It confiscates private property and is an unbearable cost to small businesses. ranchers and farmers. which is precisely why the Farm Bureau supports this bill. I could tell you many stories about families that were forced to borrow large sums of money or sell off or parcel out their farms or businesses. dividing their families. I could tell you about the Berdolls from Austin. Texas. in my district who. after paying off a 30year mortgage. spent 20 more years paying this unfair tax burden.

He went into that bank and he took out a loan for $2 million. And the head of the bank was inquiring of the guy that is the accountant that handles our books that I have to do as a Congressman. He said. Why in the world did this guy have to take a $2 million loan out? And it particularly seemed out of place with this guy with his old rusty holes in his pickup truck. He said. His father just died and they have to pay the estate tax on the farm. I had heard stories like that before. but there it was right in front of me. So what this bill is seeking to do is to try to make it possible that we do not destroy farms and small businesses that employ close to half the people that have jobs in our country. and that seems to be only reasonable. And yet I am hearing the Democrats saying over here that they are all upset because we have already taxed a dollar the first time the guy earns it. then we are going to tax him again on sales tax and other things he buys. and now it is not fair to tax a dollar the third time it comes around.

Mr. Chairman. thank you for the opportunity to offer this amendment to H.R. 5682. the United States and India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act of 2006. The purpose of this amendment is to provide Congress with the ability to assess. to the extent possible. whether U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation with India may potentially contribute to growth in Indias military fissile material production. The amendment is straightforward. It simply calls for a report each year to ensure that the United States is not unintentionally complicit in the growth of Indias nuclear weapons capabilities. First of all. let me express my appreciation to Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member LANTOS and the House International Relations Committee staff for their efforts to address a wide variety of concerns expressed by members of the International Relations Committee. Given the global significance of this potential agreement. I believe it is important to remain diligent in the conduct of our oversight responsibilities. Mr. Chairman. civil nuclear cooperation with India is a bilateral initiative with wideranging multilateral implications. The nonproliferation. energy and environmental objectives of this proposed agreement with India are laudable. and the Committee on International Relations has emphasized the need to ensure that such an agreement would not result in unintended consequences which may undermine Its purpose and directly or indirectly result in boosting Indias military nuclear capabilities. It is my expectation that the International Relations Committee will avail itself of this opportunity to hold as many hearings as necessary to examine the content of this report and the potential implications for the U.S. compliance with Article I of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as referenced in the bill. This is particularly important in light of the recent news regarding the discovery of a reactor project which would enable Pakistan to make many more nuclear weapons each year. This news highlights very real concerns about a potential arms race in South Asia. It is up to Congress to ensure that any U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement remains just that. a civil nuclear agreement which will have no impact on the production of nuclear weapons. Mr. Chairman. I understand that Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member LANTOS are in support of this amendment. and I am grateful for their support. Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from California.",

The recommittal motion that I am propounding here this evening just follows up on the statements that have been made out of the Indian government so that they can understand what we expect from them. and we will send a signal from this Congress to our negotiators as to what we expect from them in eliciting from the Indian government.

Hugo Chavez every step of the way has gone against the grain when it comes to the ideals that we believe in as Americans.

In his own words. he talks about antiAmerican. antifreedom. In his own words. out of his own mouth. Todays resolution is about drug trafficking. Over 30 percent of the cocaine that comes into the United States comes through Venezuela. That is a huge number. We can no longer allow Hugo Chavez to manipulate the minds and the hearts and the dreams of not only his own people. but the people of the United States. Mr. Chairman. whether it is siding with Iran in trying to purchase military aircraft and weapons. his desire for nuclear technology. trying to intimidate the media in his own country. Hugo Chavez is not a friend of the United States. In fact. he is doing everything he can to turn away from freedom and democracy. I strongly support the resolution in front of us. I hope that Hugo Chavez will wake up and understand that it is better to be a friend with the United States. it is better to be a friend and believer in the ideals of freedom. security and prosperity. I hope one day that he will understand that he has made major mistakes and that it is time to come back to what was once a Venezuela that believed in freedom and democracy.",

Now we are not trying to embarrass the government of Venezuela. but they have done such things as accused our DEA agents. who are fighting the drug war for the people of this country. of being spies for the United States. They have done everything they can to hamper the DEAs operation down there. And there have been $100 million of cocaine that was confiscated at the Mexican airport that came from the Caracas Venezuela airport. And so we have not had any cooperation whatsoever. I dont know much about what kind of publicity this is going to generate in Venezuela. but the fact of the matter is Mr. Chavez needs to be put on notice that the American people are not going to stand idly by and let Venezuela be a transit point for drugs into this country and killing American people.

Because I called and asked for the information. and they provided me with the following. and I have charts that I would like to present for the RECORD. There is a chart identifying where seizures took place in 2005. two charts define how much cocaine and heroin was seized at the airport and at Santiago Marino Airport since 2002. I have a chart Identifying nationality of individuals involved in drugs and have been caught since 2002. And I have several charts identifying the type of drug and the quantity confiscated in Venezuela in 2005. the number of security agencies and personnel involved in drug confiscation throughout Venezuela. persons from Venezuela arrested for drugs in Venezuela. and the number of foreigners arrested for drugs in Venezuela. So I have all of these that I would also like to submit at the end for the RECORD. Their information is available. They have been sharing this with us. This resolution further threatens the delicate relationship between our two countries. And. consequently. for me. I am really concerned. I happen to represent an international airport. JFK. John F. Kennedy International Airport. and I understand the importance of keeping drugs out. To me. that is what the bottom line is. This isnt about us against them. For me. it is about securing our country so that we can keep the drugs from coming in and doing what we have to do. The resolution basically I think. and I hope I am wrong. as Mr. DELAHUNT said. what it will do is it will assure that we wont have an agreement. And if we dont have an agreement. then what we have accomplished is that there can be more drugs getting into this country. We have got to do just the opposite. We have got to make sure that we do everything that we possibly can to secure and to prevent drugs from entering into the United States of America. I think that this is the wrong way of doing it. so therefore I will oppose this resolution and ask all Members that. if you truly want to stop drugs. we need to get an agreement with Venezuela.",

He goes on television every Sunday for 5 hours. and he calls the President of the United States a donkey and other names.

Mr. Speaker. from what we heard from the Department officials. it is not that Venezuela is not cooperating fully. it is that Venezuela is not cooperating at all. Disconcerting was the testimony we heard from the State Department that Venezuelan passports can be forged with childlike ease and that the U.S. is detaining at our borders an increasing number of third country aliens carrying false Venezuelan documents. According to a 2003 U.S. news report. thousands of Venezuelan identity documents are being distributed to foreigners from Middle Eastern nations including Syria. Pakistan. Egypt and Lebanon. It is not just antiterrorism in which we see no cooperation. as pointed out in this resolution. it is also counternarcotics. and today. Hugo Chavez. President Chavez. is in Moscow signing a multibillion dollar agreement for advanced fighter jets for attack helicopters. for 100.000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and a license to build a Kalashnikov factory in Venezuela.

The Senator. the chairman of the committee. as well as others. came together on a bipartisan basis and said. That is not enough. That is not enough. $1.4 billion will not meet the shortfall. By our best estimate. they said 24 hours ago or whenever we debated it. we need more. we need $1.5 billion. And we acceded to your knowledge of the agency and your knowledge of its need and came together on a bipartisan basisI believe the vote was 96 to nothingand said that is exactly what we will do. $1.5 billion. Then while we barely finished this work. the House came back and said no. the figure is $975 million or whatever number they came up with. dramatically less than what we had approved. It strikes me as interesting that we are going to back off of our best estimate and say lets err on the side of less money for the Veterans Administration. Why wouldnt the Senate be holding fast to its position? Why wouldnt the Senate be holding fast to its position and say we believe $1.5 billion is the right number still. as we believed 24 hours ago when we voted on it?

I have had the pleasure of working with Tony on several different occasions. particularly through his tenure at the University of Kentucky where he served as Associate Dean of the College of Medicine and later as Director of Government Relations.

He also helped establish the UK Center for Rural Health. create the UK Area Health Education System and launch the McDowell Cancer Network. which later became the Kentucky Community Cancer Program. Tonys background in healthcare education and advocacy dates back to 1965. when he first served as executive director of the Owensboro Council for Retarded Children. He then served as executive director of the Blue Grass Association for Mental Retardation. In his next two jobs. Tony served as chief executive officer of the Bluegrass Regional Health Planning Council. Inc. and the East Kentucky Health Systems Agency. Inc. Continuing his pattern of selfless service. Tony most recently worked in the Office of the Governor in Frankfort. KY. For the past two sessions. he has served as liaison between the Governor and the Kentucky General Assembly. combining his legendary affable nature with encyclopedic command of details he helped the Commonwealth move forward on a number of legislative fronts.

I believe that they are both partially right. We should not cut off vital products from the market that are needed and used in our homes. businesses. and farms. Using the best available scientific data is essential in assuring the public that these valuable products are safe and also readily available. Senator BURNSs amendment would support a thorough review of human dosing studies to make sure that they comport with certain conditions and would report back to the authorizing committees as well as the Appropriations Committee. At the same time. the EPA should establish strong scientific and ethical standards on studies that expose people. especially young children. to various pesticides. fungicides. and other toxins that are used in commerce. I am concerned that the nowhalted study on small children from Jacksonville. FL is an irresponsible example of how to conduct such reviews. Strong standards should apply both to the agencys own studies as well as to thirdparty studies. Important questions have been raised about the protocols and guidelines of certain studies. and therefore it is only prudent to step back for a year to scrutinize that process. For this reason. I voted for the Boxer amendment. I hope that the study required by the Burns amendment will be carried out in a timely and responsible way and provide the necessary information so that approach decisions can be made about the Environmental Protection Agencys rulemaking standards applying to the studies human dosing and their toxic effects.",

I have worked with Carlos for several years and have had the pleasure of seeing firsthand his work as superintendent of Clark County schools. the fifth largest school district in the Nation. I believe that one of the reasons he has acclimated so well to Clark County. and Las Vegas in particular. is because he grew up in Los Angeles. After graduating from high school in L.A.. he earned bachelors and masters degrees from Claremont College and an administrative credential in educational administration from California State University. He developed experience as a teacher and principal in California. After several years. including serving as principal at a National Blue Ribbon School.. he eventually became the superintendent of the Fresno Unified School District. When Carlos Garcia arrived in Clark County. he began to reorganize. He divided the county into regions. he began to address achievements and accountability. and he championed the cause of educating Nevadas young people to parents. teachers. business leaders and lawmakers. It has been my pleasure to participate in different events and discussions with Carlos. We sat around a table with the other 16 superintendents in Nevada to discuss the No Child Left Behind Act. As a result of his organization and participation. I was able to come back to Washington with a clear idea of what Nevadas school districts needed. His leadership of the superintendents was impressive. and the mutual respect was apparent. Together. Carlos and I welcomed 60 new teachers from the Teach for America program. As a result of this venture. I am a cosponsor of legislation that will ensure that recruiting. training. and supporting this teacher corps will be supported by the Congress. When it comes to our school children and teachers. he always has a plan and always looks toward the future. Now. Carlos has a new future to plan: his own. I am sorry that I cannot be there to shake his hand. Thank you. Carlos. for being dedicated to providing the children of Clark County with a firstrate public education. All the best to you.",

Mr. Chairman. it makes several additions to our Nations maritime security program that enhances the law that we passed a couple of years ago. I am very pleased that the bill in the managers amendment includes several provisions that I and Representative PASCRELL from New Jersey worked on that will help enhance maritime security. These provisions will amend the law to require American citizens to be in charge of security at each of our ports. require the Coast Guard to reexamine each port terminal security plan when the facility undergoes a change in ownership. and require the periodic reevaluation of security at foreign ports. This will also establish deadlines for the implementation of important maritime security programs that we included in the original bill. including the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. which the Department has been woefully behind on. It enhances identification credentials for foreign mariners calling on U.S. ports and also a longrange vessel tracking system to improve our awareness of activities. These programs will dramatically enhance our ability to protect our ports. will help the Department. and help the Coast Guard. I want to again thank all of the Members responsible. Mr. Chairman.

God forbid. a disaster in this country. We have no protection against that now. Even with this bill. we depend on riskbased analysis. on paper as Mr. MARKEY said. to defend us. What the motion to recommit does is to say that no container can be put on a ship bound for the United States until it is scanned for radiation and for density. until the result of that scan is transmitted electronically in realtime to American inspectors in the United States. and until a tamperproof seal that will tell us whether that container has been tampered with after it is scanned is put on that container. We are told this is not feasible. Mr. KING says the technology does not exist. But it is done in Hong Kong today. It is done in Hong Kong today. The two biggest terminals in Hong Kong have this. Of course. nobody bothers reading the scans because the Department of Homeland Security cannot be bothered. They are on a hard drive in Hong Kong.

It is a reliable company. It is lowrisk. and there is an atomic bomb on that container. and no one sees it because that container is not scanned. Maybe it is scanned under this bill in Boston or in Los Angeles. It is too late to look at it in Los Angeles if there is an atomic bomb on board.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me just tell you about a company in my district called Burtek. This is an American company and American workers who are doing great work to enhance our port security. Burtek is producing something called Mobile Radiation Portal Monitors. the first of which they delivered to the Customs and Border Protection Agency just last week. These devices will be placed at our ports and allow CBP to scan containers quickly and efficiently for any radioactive cargo.

Last year. customs officials screened only five percent of the 11 million cargo containers entering the United States. That rate is both unacceptable and dangerous to our national and economic interests. I represent the Port of Philadelphia. and I know firsthand the important role that ports play in the national and global economy. I have also seen how simple accidents can have devastating impacts on the port system. Just 24 days after I was elected to the House of Representatives. an oil tanker struck a submerged object and spilled 265.000 gallons of oil into the Delaware River. This spill halted commerce. temporarily shut down a nuclear power plant. and put area drinking water at risk. All of this was caused by an inanimate and rusty anchor sitting at the bottom of the river. All told. this incident cost an estimated $150 million. In contrast. the damage and destruction caused by smuggling a weapon of mass destruction into a port could cost as much as $1 trillion. Democrats have a proposal that would prevent such a devastating device from ever entering U.S. waters or a U.S. port. Under our plan. every cargo container100 percentwould be screened prior to arrival in the United States. We put this proposal on the table months ago and. today. the Republican Leadership has refused to embrace itjeopardizing security at 361 U.S. ports and putting at risk 75 percent of the international trade entering our country. But we must take a step forward. and the bill under consideration will improve many elements of security at our ports. which I have actively supported such as establishing a riskbased port security grant program and setting deadlines for a mandatory security identification card for port employees. For this reason. I urge a \"yes\" vote on the bill. And. I will keep working to ensure security at all American ports.",

Ports will also have the much needed resources they need through the Port Security Grant Program to improve facility security.

Because the Republican majority operates largely as a subsidiary of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. they refuse to take the only step that will ensure the safety of our ports: 100 percent scanning of containers. Instead. this bill mandates more reports that will tell us what hundreds of experts already have: you cant ensure safety if you dont verity the contents of every container. The studies. further reorganization of the Department of Homeland Security. and micromanaging of port operations in this legislation are a paltry substitute for real security. Apparently the Majority feared that common sense would prevail. as they wont even allow a vote on a Democratic amendment to scan 100 percent of containers within five years. following the model set by Hong Kongs successful Integrated Container Inspection System. which has operated since 2005 without significantly increasing costs or causing delays. The shipping industry itself admits that the maximum cost of 100 percent scanning would be $125 per container. It could be as low as $6.50 per container. Either way. its a small price to pay for security when compared to the $4.000 cost of shipping a container from Asia. I will vote in favor of this bill because it is an improvement over the current system and sends more federal money to ports to improve their security. However. unlike my Republican colleagues.

In fact. ports serve as the main economic engine for many of the areas in which theyre found. making an attack not only extremely dangerous for local citizens. but economically disastrous for the local economy as well. Unfortunately. the administrations concentration of terrorism prevention funding on the aviation industry has jeopardized the safety of other modes of transportation. Last year TSA spent $4.4 billion alone on Aviation security. while spending only $36 million on all Surface Transportation security programs. Even after the rail bombings in Madrid and London were still failing to provide adequate funding to protect our rail infrastructure.

I rise today in support of the Private Property Rights Protection Act. This spring. the Supreme Court put a \"For Sale by Government\" sign in front of every American home. farm and business. It does not matter how many coats of paint you put on your house or how much landscaping you do. no amount of your investment and upkeep can match the tax base provided by corporate America. If the government thinks that it can get more tax revenue from your property when put to a different use. a bigger house. a new factory. you are out of luck and out of your home. We were taught as children and read in the Constitution that eminent domain meant that government could take property only for public use. like roads and railroads. but the 15 Connecticut citizens who had their homes and businesses taken away from them in the Kelo case found out that public use now means whatever the powerful want to do with your home. as long as it might bring in more tax dollars. Whatever happened to our rights to life. liberty and property. which were the very rights so important to the people who founded this country? Mr. Chairman. the Supreme Court took that right away. The Framers had no intention of allowing Federal judges to impart their wisdom on this issue. That Is why they put the eminent domain clause directly into the Constitution by the Bill of Rights. The Constitution here in my pocket says. \"nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\" If we do not act today. the consequences of that Supreme Court decision will not be hard to foretell. The winners are those with great influence. wealth and power. What happens when the potential buyer of a property is a foreignowned entity? Or if a Nevada church is bulldozed to make room for a brothel? Americans will not stand for usurpation of their constitutional rights by the Court.

Will we condemn small business owners by allowing their stores to be removed simply because a big developer has a different idea for what the economy should look like? Or will we stand with our constituents and condemn the idea that their property can be sacrificed for the sake of a big corporate companys development plans? The Declaration of Independence holds that all people are endowed with the right to life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Supreme Courts Kelo decision would limit the right to the pursuit of happiness to large corporate developers at the expense of small businesses and private citizens.

Harry Pappas and his family battled to win back property taken from them in downtown Las Vegas. property which they rightfully owned and that was home to seven shops the family leased to other businesses for more than 40 years. This was a 40year holding of one family in Las Vegas. In 1994. the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency notified Mrs. Pappas that they were condemning her property. At a hearing only 7 (lays later. it was decided that the agency would take immediate possession of the property. and the family business promptly demolished. The Pappases dreams were torn down with the building they lost that day. and their dignity was taken from them as they were forced to watch as a forprofit parking garage was built on their family property. The Pappas family took their case all the way to the United States Supreme Court. hoping that the justices would recognize their fundamental rights under our Constitution. But they were turned away by the Supreme Court. and their case seeking justice was dismissed. So now it is up to us. the United States Congress. to protect other families against the injustice that has been done to the Pappases as a result of the evergrowing expansion of eminent domain.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman. in my district. the values of faith. family. and commitment to community are sacred. We also hold sacred the right to own property without fear of its being taken away by government. Unfortunately. local governments are seizing property in the name of economic development and transferring ownership to other private individuals. American citizens are losing their homes in the interest of building strip malls or bigbox stores. Even more disheartening is the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has endorsed this behavior in what I feel is a misinterpretation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. I voted to prohibit this kind of action when I was a State representative in Colorado. and I have also voted my disapproval of the ruling in the case of Kelo v. New London. I rise today in support of H.R. 4128. the Private Property Rights Protection Act. I am a cosponsor of this bill. and I supported passage of the STOPP Act. H.R. 3405. in the Agriculture Committee just last month. This important legislation will help prevent local governments from abusing their power of eminent domain. While local governments may be well intentioned. the fact is that people are losing their homes because of misguided economic development principles. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. and I thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER. Ranking Member CONYERS. Chairman BONILLA. and Congresswoman HERSETH for their dedication to persevering and protecting property rights. The right to own property is a fundamental right of this country. and I will do whatever I can to ensure that it is preserved.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 4128. the Private Property Rights Protection Act. The Supreme Court decision of Kelo v. City of New London is one of the most unpopular decisions ever rendered. I believe more than 90 percent of United States citizens oppose this ruling. and it may be that the other 10 percent do not fully understand it. So it has been certainly roundly denounced. The Court states that \"any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private property.\" So if one party has a project that will yield more tax revenue than is currently provided by a piece of property. that property may be taken. This gives local governments broad powers. This creates great concern in the Agriculture Committee. as has already been noticed. Farm and ranch land can be taken very easily because a golf course. a shopping mall. an amusement park can easily be classified as being more important as far as economic development than agricultural land. Nonprofits. such as churches. Salvation Army. Goodwill Industries. shelters. are very vulnerable. They generate little or no tax revenue. So almost any project can supersede them in this regard. Small businesses are very vulnerable. I had a farmer athlete who played for me who had worked very hard to develop a small business in an old building. a restaurant. and a new hotel was coming into the area. The local city council was thinking about shutting him down. destroying the building. building a new hotel. which would be economic development. And this person was essentially very vulnerable. His whole life savings. his whole investment was going to be gone. So this bill would prevent that. H.R. 4128 prevents States and local governments from receiving Federal economic development funds if they abuse their powers of eminent domain. These are important protections. I would like to thank Chairman GOODLATTE. Chairman SENSENBRENNER. and others who have worked so hard on this bill: and certainly I urge adoption of it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for yielding me this time. It is a pleasure to work with her on this. and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important issue on the House floor today. As we all know. on June 23. 2005. the Supreme Court handed down its decision in the case of Kelo v. The City of New London. In Kelo. the Court addressed the citys condemnation of private property to implement its redevelopment plan aimed at invigorating a depressed economy. By a 54 decision. the Court held that the condemnation satisfied the fifth amendment requirement that property condemnations be for a \"public use.\" notwithstanding that the property. as part of the plan. might be turned over to private developers. The Supreme Court decision was indeed a wakeup call. Mr. Chairman. for many communities. and I have heard loud and clear from my own constituents in Georgia that they are worried that their property rights are in jeopardy. Today we are going to remedy this wrongful application of the law of eminent domain and restore important property rights to private citizens. This is very important. Mr. Chairman. what we are doing today. And as a cosponsor of H.R. 4128. the Private Property Rights Protection Act. I believe that passage of this legislation will ensure that no Federal dollars will be used to unjustly take any property at the local and State levels. In addition. I will continue to support efforts to curtail the power of eminent domain in an effort to protect private property rights. H.R. 4128 is important. and I support it because it prohibits State and local governments that receive Federal economic development funds from using eminent domain to seize land for economic development purposes. except for the construction of public facilities such as hospitals or military bases. and for use by a public utility. aqueduct. or a pipeline. In conclusion. Mr. Chairman. the States and local governments that take lands for private development could not receive Federal economic development funds for those years. I am therefore very pleased that the House is voting on this important bill today.",

Mr. President. but to middleclass Americans that is their lifetime retirement savings. It may be filled with just IOUs to you. but when you borrowed $700 billion from that trust fund. it was a very opportune filing cabinet because you stuck your hand in there and took $700 billion from the Social Security trust fund to use. It was not an old filing cabinet. It was not just a bunch of IOUs. Those are the taxes that Americans put away. the resources they put away for their life savings. and that is how every President and every Congress has treated it. It is the obligation of this Congress to strengthen Social Security. not to weaken it. For middleclass Americans and for everybody who is saving for their retirement. It is high time we begin to strengthen Social Security by paying back the $700 billion you have borrowed from it. And if you want to talk about IOUs. the IOUs we have run up. which is nearly $2 trillion in debt that now Communist China and Japan own and are our bankers. that would be a good place to see where the IOUs are.",

That is $300.000 a minute from the working men and women and small businesses of America. And that money is being used to buy Treasury bonds. It is being put away under the premise that we are creating a trust fund. The full faith and credit of the United States Government backs those bonds. Now. the President is questioning the full faith and credit. and he is saying there is no trust fund. Now. if the President is right and there is no trust fund. then we should stop taking $170 billion from the working men and women under a false premise. That would be fraud. We have to do either one of two things: lower the tax on working men and women in this country and small businesses. or honor the trust fund and the debt of the United States of America.

As has already been indicated. this legislation will require the National Association of Securities Dealers to make its databases of complaints against brokerdealers publicly available on a secure Internet site and is relatively straightforward. Let me explain. however. this is indeed a serious problem. I personally know of individuals whose entire wealth has been wiped out by fraud which could have been detected had these investors taken the time to research the brokerdealer they were dealing with in an appropriate manner. As has been explained. the current law requires the NASD to maintain BrokerCheck. BrokerCheck is a system through which investors can research their brokerdealer before entrusting with them their hardearned savings. But in light of Congress increased focus on retirement security. I believe we should encourage Americans to. In fact. take advantage of BrokerCheck. and even go beyond that and to conduct their own research before making any investment decision. BrokerCheck. as has been indicated by my colleague on the other side. provides these individuals with this information through a free check that can be accessed either over the Internet or by telephone. But because it is accessed over the Internet and by telephone. and requires that an inquiry be submitted and then a response prepared and that response sent back. the delay in getting this information can be anywhere between 10 minutes and as much as 2 days. This legislation goes at that problem and allows instantaneous access to this kind of information. Through the current system and through the enhanced system this legislation will authorize. BrokerCheck will gather and make available online",

Mr. SHADEGG. for his excellent work on this important legislation. Informed investors are critical to our Nations markets. Ready access to complete information about securities firms and brokers is critical to informing investors and building investor confidence. NASD. the selfregulatory organization for brokerdealers. has been providing this information to the public since 1990 when Congress mandated that NASD make relevant portions of the information available to the public without charge through a tolltree telephone number. At the time. the telephone was the easiest and most convenient solution. However. investors today have embraced the Internet as their preferred means of obtaining information. Therefore NASD seeks to use the Intemet to disseminate this information. Investors want and need online access to disclosure o information to assist them in deciding whether to do business with a securities firm or broker. When Congress mandated that NASD release this information. it accorded NASD immunity form liability for the release of such information to the publicrecognizing that the disclosure of key information about securities firms and brokers is a critical part of NASDs regulatory and investor protection mission. I would like to clarify that under prevailing Federal case law there is no private right of action against NASD for acts or omissions taken pursuant to its regulatory responsibilities under the Federal securities laws. I want to be clear that this legislation is not intended to change existing law pertaining to private rights of action under those laws. In addition. courts have historically granted NASD absolute immunity for its regulatory actions. This legislation is not intended to limit NASDs immunity for regulatory actions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1025. the \"Mortgage Servicing Clarification Act.\" providing a narrow but necessary exemption for mortgage servicers from certain requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) with respect to federally related mortgage loans secured by a first lien. I want to commend Congressman ROYCE and Congressman KANJORSKI for introducing this legislation. as well as Ranking Member FRANK for helping to guide this important measure through the legislative process. This legislation passed by a voice vote in the 1071h Congress and passed last Congress on a vote of 4240. When a mortgage servicer acquires the right to service a loan portfolio. the servicer is generally exempt from complying with the FDCPA because the Act extends the creditors exemption to the new servicer. The problem arises because in a typical loan servicing transfer. a percentage of the loans transferred are delinquent or in default. These loans are technically covered by FDCPA provisions requiring the new mortgage servicer to include harshly worded notices to its borrowers identifying the servicer as a \"debt collector\" and warning the borrower that any information he or she discloses to the servicer will be used in the debt collection process. These notices are commonly referred to as \"Miranda notices.\" and they can have the unintended consequences of discouraging borrowers from contacting their new service provider. Under the exemption made by H.R. 1025. a mortgage servicer would not be required to provide a Miranda notice upon the first contact with its new customer. as well as in all subsequent contacts. on those loans that were in default at the time of transfer. However. mortgage services would not qualify for this exemption with respect to other loans that may go into default after the transfer occurs. Let me close by saying that this bill is drafted to be consistent with previous recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission. the agency charged with the enforcement of the FDCPA. and is supported by a variety of financial services trade groups. including the Consumer Mortgage Coalition. American Financial Services Association. and Mortgage Bankers Association. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the leading Democratic supporter of H.R. 1025. I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Servicing Clarification Act. It is a good piece of legislation that will fix a technical problem under existing law. Under the current Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. when a mortgage servicer acquires the rights to service a loan portfolio it is generally exempt from complying with the laws requirements because the act extends the creditors exemption to the new servicer. In a typical loan servicing transfer. however. a certain percentage of loans will be delinquent or in default at the time of the transfer. These loans are therefore technically covered by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. even though the new servicer has a fundamentally different relationship with the borrower than a true debt collector. H.R. 1025 would resolve this problem by establishing a very narrow exemption for servicers of first lien mortgages from the notice requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. All other substantive borrower protections provided by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act would remain in full force. Additionally. the exemption is available only to servicers that are primarily engaged servicing current loans. We worked for several years to narrow the exemption created by this bill in order to address the concerns of all interested parties. The legislation also passed the House in the 107th Congress and the 108th Congress. and when we last passed this bill it was approved by a vote of 424 to 0. I expect that we will again today pass this bill in the 109th Congress with similar bipartisan support. In closing. Mr. Speaker. the provisions of H.R. 1025 are consistent with longstanding recommendations by the Federal Trade Commission. under the Clinton and Bush Administrations. to improve the application of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to mortgage servicing activities.

Although Cinco de Mayo marks the Mexican Armys victory over the French Army in 1862 at the Battle of Puebla in Mexico. this holiday has evolved into a way to celebrate the richness of Mexican culture. Within the United States. it is also a way to join with our fellow MexicanAmerican brothers and sisters and to learn about their heritage. Cinco de Mayo brings our community together. In Houston. we are very proud of the great cultural and ethnic diversity of our city. Today. Cinco de Mayo is an annual celebration in which we take time to enjoy the great food. music. art. and people of our Mexican community. Mr. Speaker. with this in mind. I feel that it is very important that we observe this holiday and the opportunity for cultural celebration of the people of this great Nation.",

After serving our country in Vietnam. Mr. Lehtinen graduated first in his class from Stanford Law School and went on to serve as a Florida State Senator and a United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. On May 8. the world celebrated the 60th anniversary of VE Day marking the end of the war in Europe. With ceremonies commemorating the Allies victory over tyranny. the day served as a reminder of the sacrifices made to this country by what many call our greatest generation. In contrast to the fitting tribute paid to the World War II generation. Jane Fonda recently published a book \"My Life So Far.\" There. she expresses regret not for her visits to North Vietnam. her broadcasts on Radio Hanoi nor her cavalier description of our tortured POWs as \"hypocrites and liars.\" but only for being photographed in a North Vietnamese antiaircraft gun site. Let us not forget how damaging her actions were to the POWs and combat troops in the field. I firmly believe in the First Amendment rights all Americans cherish. but traveling to enemy soil to criticize our soldiers and airmen during the war is a reprehensible act not easily forgotten nor pardoned. I urge my colleagues to read Mr. Lehtinens article and never forget the sacrifices made by all veterans of this great nation. [From the National Review. April 29. 2005]",

The future of Social Security would be addressed through the strength of these markets without the uncertainties of the stability of individual private accounts. The author also addresses some of the concerns that have been raised about this idea. As you can see. there are many thoughts that can be brought to the table to address the future of Social Security and to utilize the forces of the financial markets without being wedded to private accounts. Additionally. there are many issues surrounding personal retirement savings and pension security that deserve to be looked at carefully. [From the Hartford Courant. May 10. 2005]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate the Adler Planetarium on its 75th Anniversary. As the first planetarium established in America and the Western Hemisphere. it has firm standing as a pioneer in the field of astronomy. Its focus on the heavens has inspired generations to reach for the stars. Among its many accomplishments in the past 75 years. there are several that are especially stellar. Astronomers at Adler helped convert light from the star Arcturus into the electrical signals that turned on the opening lights at the 1933 Worids Fair in Chicago. Adler began a partnership with the National Science Foundation in 1964 to create the AstroScience workshop for Chicago area high school studentsa relationship that endures to this day. And earlier this year. NASA selected Adler to be its education partner for the Interstellar Boundary Explorer mission. set to launch in 2008. It is clear that. in the opening years of the new millennium. Adlers great tradition of space and science research is stronger than ever. The Adler Planetarium houses one of the worlds finest collections of historic astronomical artifacts. dating as far back as the 12th EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 7 century. A centerpiece of this collection is the worlds oldest sundial. which was crafted in 1529. It also has a telescope once used by William Herschel. the astronomer who discovered Uranus in 1781. Adler has made investments in Chicago area schools to provide them with access to exhibits. astronomers. and scientists through videoconferencing. enhanced websites. and learning instruction techniques. These efforts to educate Chicagoans young and old are a core part of its mission. Mr. Speaker. for many years. children of all ages have been fascinated by space and the world beyond our own. Modern youngsters watch clips of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon and gaze to the heavens in wonderwondering how it was done and how they can do it themselves. As a planetarium. Adler harnesses these vague dreams of space science. space walks. and space travel into tangible reality. The inspiration it feeds our youth is arguably its most important contribution in the past 75 years. With the hopes that it continues its great works for at least another 75 years. I am proud to congratulate the Adler Planetarium on its diamond anniversary.",

Last night. in his speech to the Nation. the President shamelessly. in my opinion. invoked the terrible tragedy of September 11 to justify our continued occupation. Mr. Speaker. the fact that Iraq has become a haven for terrorists is due to this Presidents failed policy in that country. Our continued massive presence fuels the insurgency and is a magnet for foreign fighters. It takes no courage for a President or a Congressman to stand up and say \"stay the course.\" It is not our lives that are on the line. We owe our soldiers better. It is time for the President to admit that this war was a mistake. It is time for us to begin an orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. It is time for President Bush to end his war.",

I introduced the Private Property Protection Act. a companion bill to legislation in the Senate designed to correct the erroneous decision made by the Supreme Court on June 23. That decision redefined the Constitutions fifth amendment. That decision. Kelo v. City of New London. was a slap in the face of homeowners. small businesses. and. frankly. Americans. Ordinary private property owners stand to suffer from the corrupting influence this sweeping legislation will have because government officials. because government officials can aggressively use the powers of eminent domain purely for economic reasons. Our legislation establishes two important standards that must be met before government decides to exercise its power and take and transfer private property. The first standard is that eminent domain should only be used for public use. as guaranteed by the fifth amendment. The second is that this power should be reserved only for true public uses. not simply to provide private economic development so government can make more tax revenue. Let us stop the abuse of eminent domain before it happens. I urge the Members of this body to support this very necessary piece of legislation.",

Many Members voted \"no\" because of some impending deal to address the issue once and for all. Now reports of the deal have leaked out. They are not pretty. and they will not address the MTBE contamination our constituents face. This deal would provide full liability protection to the MTBE producers and establish an $8 billion trust fund to address the contamination crisis. One big problem: the cleanup of MTBE contamination will cost between $25 billion and $33 billion. It could be as high as $85 billion. dwarfing the deals cleanup fund. Another problem: at least half of this fund comes from taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. why should taxpayers pay to clean up MTBE contamination? Manufacturers caused this problem. and they should clean it up. It is a deal written by industry for the industry. No surprise that water districts. cities. and counties across the country do not support this deal. They are the people who have to deal with the contamination. I urge my colleagues to oppose the liability waiver of MTBE and any deal like this.",

The administration needs to do more. but Congress needs to do more as well. Another 7.000 manufacturing jobs were lost in May. The manufacturing sector in this country continues to suffer.

We had an opportunity today to address key manufacturing competitiveness and innovation issues. but instead the bill before us is simply a narrow reauthorization bill that eliminates funding for the Advanced Technology Program. ATP. Democrats tried to broaden this narrow manufacturing bill by bringing eight manufacturing amendments to the Rules Committee. Unfortunately. the Republicancrafted rule blocks the four of the eight Democratic amendments. I am disappointed that this bill does so little to achieve its stated goal of addressing the long term problems facing our Nations manufacturers. Congress must confront that we are in a manufacturing crisis. The U.S. manufacturing sector is facing a crisissince 2001 we have lost 2.8 million manufacturing jobs. In the first three months of this year. we have lost another 24.000 manufacturing jobs. I am very concemed about the issue of offshoring of our professional manufacturing jobs. We have to get a handle on this problem and we need sufficient and accurate data to make sound policy decisions. Once we understand the problem. we can then develop policies to address it. An effective way to do that is. in fact. to mandate a study to report back to the Congress within a ninemonth period so that we. in fact. can take a look at the number of jobs that have been lost and the ramifications as well as the other areas that the Secretary would be looking at. Given the crisis facing our manufacturing sector. I have asked Congress to work with the administration to address the issue of offshoring. by studying its effects and implications. To date. Congress still does not have the data to do an analysis of offshoring trends. If we are serious about making America more competitive and maintaining highskilled jobs in the U.S.. we first have to understand the real impact of job outsourcing. Manufacturing plays a crucial role in the growth and health of the U.S. economy. It is an industry that helped build the great country we have today and we need to work together to get a handle on this serious problem facing our manufacturing base.",

Through an executive order. the President lowered the wages workers will be paid to rebuild the hurricaneaffected region. He suspended the DavisBacon Act. a 74yearold law which requires that companies receiving Federal contracts pay the average wage to employees hired to perform those Federal contracts. With smaller incomes. workers will pay less. But corporate income. unlike worker incomes. will rise. The corporate contractors will be able to keep more of the contract for themselves through a combination of setting lower wages for workers and receiving tax exemptions under the provisions of H.R. 3768. Suspension of the DavisBacon Act will give contractors unprecedented power to set wages. That is because the hurricane destroyed the labor market in the region. Nearly everyone is out of work. nearly everyone needs a job. After losing everything. how many people will be able to hold out for higher wages? Not many. Thus. labor market forces will not determine wages. Instead. hurricane victims and workers who may be brought into the region are at the mercy of Halliburton and Fluor corporations. just to name a couple contractors who have won or will win construction contracts in hurricane reconstruction and which will dictate wage levels. The bottom line is this: hurricane tax relief means one thing if you are a hurricane victim and another if you a corporate contractor receiving Federal funds to rebuild the hurricaneaffected region. Tax relief for hurricane victims will primarily take the form of paying less taxes on smaller wages. But tax relief means something very different to the corporate contractors. They will be paying less taxes on increased income.",

Recently. I met with a representative of Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies out of Kansas City. He discussed his research and development activities on micromechanical parts. such as gears and other smaller devices. This work is very similar to that performed at the EIGERlab which is also a Federal micromanufacturing research and development facility that I recently helped establish in the district I represent. EIGERlab has attracted a collection of scientists and researchers and has already proven to be a valuable center for advanced manufacturing R&D. H.R. 250 would help decentralize and streamline this type of manufacturing research so that efforts and duplication would be minimized. helping to ensure that American manufacturers can not only stay competitive. but thrive. The Kansas City facility uses a German process similar to an EDM wire. The EIGERlab uses a milling process. both making gears the size of Lincolns nose on a Lincoln penny. H.R. 250 also provides robust authorizations for numerous manufacturing initiatives. including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. which is quite active in the area that I represent.

Pt. 15 September 21. 2005 important initiatives that will help American manufacturers be more competitive in the world economy. We live in a real world. a world economy. One of the provisions in this bill that is most important to that competition is the reauthorization of the MEP. Manufacturing Extension Partnership. MEP makes it possible for even the smallest firms to tap into expertise and knowledge that they could not afford on their own. Each center. such as Catalyst Connection in Pittsburgh. works directly with area manufacturers to provide expertise as well as services tailored to the most critical needs of these manufacturers. The organization provides a wide variety of assistance. Some examples are process improvements. worker training. business practices. and applications of information technology. Many of these items are required for firms to be competitive in todays market. Small manufacturers are the diving force behind our U.S. economy. and increasing productivity and job creation in this sector is critical. In fact. the National Institute of Standards and Technology. which manages this program. recently showed positive results nationwide. In a single year. MEP clients reported a $2.8 billion increase in sales. They have hired new workers and retained 35.000 workers experienced $681 million in cost savings. and $941 million in plant and equipment investments have been made. Last month I visited Sharon Custom Metal Forming in Farrell. Pennsylvania. and met with management and employees of this country. One of the issues they highlighted was how their utilization of MEP has improved their business and made them more competitive. They are not alone. That happens all over my district. and continuing to fund this program means we will continue to give our entrepreneurs and small business people a competitive edge that will help them to continue to succeed in todays global market.",

The funding. as provided. is not geographically specific and can be used across the entire hurricane protection system to armor the areas identified by the Corps as the most vital. This funding is sufficient to address the most essential armoring requirements as identified by the Corps of Engineers. According to the Corps. only 16 percent of the requested $170 million can be expended in 2006. Given that the Corps will only be able to expend a very limited amount of the $170 million this fiscal year. the provision of additional funding will not result In more nearterm protection for the region. Activities that occur predominately in fiscal year 2007 and beyond do not qualify for emergency funding in this supplemental. They should be addressed in the regular order of our fiscal year 2007 energy and water bill. The amendment also seeks to add an additional $35 million to accelerate the study phase of the Morganza to the Gulf project.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. there is no doubt that the Community Development Block Grant Program needs more funding. however. this amendment would take $2 billion out of the Disaster Relief Fund. which is severely underfunded as it is. of the more than $35 billion in supplemental funds that we have provided to the Disaster Relief Fund for the recovery from Katrina. Rita and Wilma. As of March 8. only $3.7 million of that remains unallocated. and long term recovery. of course. is just getting underway. The disaster fund is very volatile. Over the last month. weekly obligations have varied from $250 million to $1.1 billion. That is per week. The administration estimates the current balance of $3.7 billion in the disaster fund will only last us through the end of May as it is. If you take $2 billion out of that. there is not much left to last us in the disaster fund. Now. if you take those monies out of the disaster fund. many of the authorized activities for which the States are expecting funding cannot be funded. And I am talking about the Stafford Act Recovery Programs in the gulf coast States ability to respond to new disasters if they should occur. During the months ahead. funds are needed primarily for the public assistance and mitigation programs in the gulf coast area. Also. funding for the disaster fund. if it is less than $9.5 billion. would mean deferring or postponing. at least stopping momentarily. at least. public assistance projects like repairing roads. repairing water control facilities. public buildings and equipment. public utilities. park. recreational facilities and the like. all of that would have to stop. So. Mr. Chairman. I urge that Members vote against this amendment. Not to say that the Community Development Block Grant Program does not need funds but this aint the place to get it. So I urge a \"no\" vote. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

We get out there different under this amendment. as opposed to taking the money under the FEMA allocation which we have heard objection to. this adds money to the current asked for. requested appropriations of $1.9 billion to the $19.1 billion that is being asked for here. to add to that amount $1.9 billion. The $1.9 billion. therefore. does not come out of the FEMA funds as the gentleman has objected to. If his argument are well taken. the FEMA fund stays intact. We do not touch it whatsoever. But out of the $3.7 billion. that is unobligated of the money that has already been appropriated for this purpose by this House. we take another $1.9 billion and provide that to Texas. The hope is that the HUD will provide that to Texas. take care of Texas needs. So we dont invade the FEMA money under this amendment. We simply add to the amount that came out of committee of $19.1 billion another $1.9 billion to provide the money that Texas needs to get this job done. We have demonstrated a need for this project back home. We have taken great pains to provide a good plan. Our State has submitted it. It has been vetted by the White House folks. Here the plan is in my hand. It is a wonderful plan that is thoroughly vetted. It is technically perfect. I believe. It states the case well. We have made the case for our needs. We have not exaggerated them. We have horrible needs back home. 220something housing units destroyed back home that we need to have fixed up. And we cannot get our city back unless we have our housing infrastructure built back up. So we are urging this House. if it does not want to take the money from existing FEMA programs. take it from the $3.7 billion that is unauthorized. and appropriate. of the $3.7 billion. $1.9 billion to take care of this urgent need in our area.

I appreciate Chairman LEWIS and the hardworking members of the Appropriations Committee who are doing a difficult job trying to balance the needs of our war on terror as well as disaster recovery in the gulf coast. This amendment seeks to do a simple thing. to require that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development use the most accurate and timely data for making decisions on where the unmet needs are in the gulf coast for housing. What this says in effect is that the director shall apply the most timely and accurate data available relating to all damages from such hurricanes and the total number of relocated evacuees. In other words. rather than use the FEMA numbers. which are slow. often inaccurate and. in fact. do not track the evacuees from Katrina to other States. nor because Hurricane Rita occurred after Hurricane Katrina. many of the needs in Texas are still being applied for and have not yet registered. So. without this amendment. the HUD Secretary would be making important decisions on housing and repair and renovation without having a true. accurate picture of where the needs truly are. I know that in Texas we have more than 75.000 homes that have been destroyed or damaged in Hurricane Rita. much of which are not yet in the system. The last decision that the HUD Secretary made. 98 percent of the money went to Louisiana and Mississippi. 1 percent to Texas. Yet Hurricane Rita actually landed a higher wind speed than Hurricane Katrina. wiped out much of East Texas. did billions of dollars of damage. and yet our people are still waiting for help in housing. repair and renovation. So this is simply an amendment to require accurate and timely data and should this not be allowed today. I hope perhaps we can work with you. because I think we all want the Secretary to use the best picture of these very complicated hurricane issues. Madam Chairman. I yield back my time.",

A further concern is that this law provides justification for China to legally push for unification of Taiwan by force. which is the worstcase scenario. Consideration of this proposal is coming at a time when both China and Taiwan have taken conciliatory steps toward each other. including the initiation of holiday charter flights that begin in late January 2005. which are the first nonstop commercial air traffic across the Taiwan Straight in 55 years. and both China and Taiwan have signaled they might be willing to restart talks relating to the status of Taiwan. Understandably. the 23 million people of Taiwan are very upset over this proposed law. for they have lived under a fullfledged democracy and enjoyed the highest standards of freedom and human rights. In view of the importance of Taiwan to the United States. China and indeed. the entire international community.

New York. Fordham Universitys Department of African American Studies and the Bronx County Historical Society have launched the African American History Project in order to respond to the growing demand for information about Blacks in the Bronx from schools. churches and community organizations. The goal of the project is to create and collect the resources necessary to tell the story of African Americans in the Bronx and to get that story out to the public through lectures. media appearances. books. articles. public exhibitions. and documentary films. This important project has been operating for over two years. During that period its research teamheaded by Dr. Mark Naison. Dr. Peter Derrick. Brian Purnell. Patricia Wright. Delores Munoz. and Colleen McCaffertyhave accumulated more than 100 interviews and catalogued countless personal records and mementos for preservation and public education purposes. The Bronx is home to the eighth largest concentration of African Americans in the country. but unfortunately not much has been written about this diverse population. As a result. events such as the migration of upwardly mobile black families from Harlem to the Bronx in the 1930s and 1940s. the development of the Bronxs eclectic musical culture fusing jazz. rhythm and blues. Latin Music and Calypso. the rise of Black political leadership in the Bronx or the migration of West Indians and West Africans to the Borough have been missing from textbooks and oral histories. Now this history will be available to the world thanks to the Bronx AfricanAmerican History Project. Mr. Speaker. Aristotle once stated: \"If you would understand anything. observe its beginning and its development.\" As a result of the extraordinary efforts of Fordham University. the Bronx County Historical Society. and active citizens such as Leroy Archible. Harriet McFeeters. Nathan Dukes. James Pruitt. Robert Gumbs. and the late Arthur Crier Jr.. the world will be able to observe the beginning and development of the AfricanAmerican community in the Bronx and thus gain a deeper understanding of its rich and beautiful history. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to all who have been integral in the development of The Bronx AfricanAmerican History Project.",

The trust fund will help pay for medical costs associated with treating asbestosrelated disease or illness caused by exposure to deadly tremolite asbestos and other fibers released by Graces mining operations. I offered this amendment to this bill because it presented an opportunity to make whole the people of Libby. who have suffered. while preventing a company like W.R.

I strongly believe that too many people have suffered. and they deserve fair compensation. I will do everything in my power to help Libby make their community whole again and to make sure their longterm health care needs are met.

The Childrens Defense Fund is writing to urge you to oppose S. 256. the bankruptcy bill. that would hurt many Americans facing financial problems through job loss. divorce. child rearing. lack of medical insurance. or predatory lending practices. This bill would inflict hardship on more than 1 million economically vulnerable women and families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year. Medical emergency. job loss and family breakup are Important factors which account for nine out of ten filing for bankruptcy. The bill would also hurt women who are owed child or spousal support by men who file bankruptcy. The bill would make it far more difficult for women to collect support because credit cad companies and other commercial creditors will have greater claims to the debtors resources during and after bankruptcy. Being first among unsecured creditors in chapter 7 bankruptcy is meaningless when over 95 percent of debtors have no resources to pay unsecured creditors. In chapter 13. the bill would require larger payments to be made to many commercial creditors resulting in smaller payments to pastdue child support over longer periods of time increasing the risk that child support debts will not be paid in full. And after the bankruptcy is over. more and more debts owed to commercial creditors will survive. and mothers and children owed support are not a match for the collection departments of the commercial credit industry. S. 256 contains a number of provisions which would have a severe impact on families trying to regain their economic stability through the bankruptcy process. The letter goes on.

This bill includes a number of new restrictions and requirements for small businesses that want to reorganize under chapter 11. These requirements and restrictions for small businesses dont apply to March 8. 2005 CONGRI large companies. I was shocked when this came to my attention. but there it is in black and white: Subtitle B. Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions. And these are not provisions to help small businesses as one might expect from a bill that is going through the United States Senate. No. these provisions penalize small businesses. They make it harder to reorganize in order to survive. These new provisions are entirely unnecessary. There is no crisis in small business bankruptcies. And a new study shows. that most failed attempts at chapter 11 reorganization are concluded within 300 days. which is the hard deadline in the bill. But 40 percent of reorganizations that succeed take longer than 300 days. That means that this bill is going to make some small businesses fail that dont have to. That is an absurd result. Remember the United Air Lines Chapter 11 reorganization is over two years old and it is still going on. Why shouldnt small businesses get that kind of leeway if there is a chance they can pull through? These provisions havent received nearly the attention in this body that the portions of the bill that deal with consumer bankruptcies have received. We need to take these provisions out. Doing so wont have any effect on the core provisions of this bill. But it will prevent a real injustice from being done to small businesses. Forcing a small business to liquidate rather than reorganize is bad for creditors. bad for consumers. and bad for small businesses. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

I rise today in support of H.R. 1245. the Gynecologic Cancer Education and Awareness Act. or \"Johannas Law.\" a bipartisan. commonsense measure that will help save the lives of thousands of American women each year. Uterine cancer is the most common form of gynecologic cancer. and ovarian cancer is the deadliest. Unlike cervical cancer. there is no reliable early detection screening test for these cancers. This means that 80.000 women will be diagnosed with gynecologic cancers this year. and almost 30.000 will die because their illnesses were detected too late. Most women dont recognize the symptoms of gynecologic cancers. and many doctors initially misdiagnose them. Early detection is the key to successful treatment of gynecologic cancers. We must do better. This bill will help save the lives and improve the health of our Nations mothers. wives and daughters. Johannas Law was named for the sister of one of my constituents from Hallandale. Florida. who lost her life to ovarian cancer. I want to congratulate Sheryl Silver and her family for their hard work. dedication. and commitment to saving the lives of millions of American women. This bill will authorize millions of dollars in desperately needed funds to help raise awareness and increase knowledge about these cancers that will lead to early detection. effective treatment. and saved lives.

Two months ago marked the seventh annual Gynecologic Cancer Awareness Month. I expressed my strong belief that raising public awareness. detecting gynecological cancers early. and educating women to the risk of reproductive tract cancers are powerful methods with which to combat this disease in my September 29. 2006. statement in honor of Gynecological Cancer Awareness Month. Today. we continue the important work to raise public awareness of gynecologic cancers through passage of this bill. We also reaffirm that detecting gynecological cancer early and educating women to the risk of reproductive tract cancers are key methods with which to combat this disease by passing this legislation. It is important to recognize that H.R. 1245 enjoys the support of 257 members of this body. The bill has been named in honor of Johanna Silver Gordon. who lost her life to a battle with ovarian cancer which was not diagnosed until it had reached an advanced stage. Today we honor her life and her fight against cancer. We also renew our commitment to legislation to be known as Johannas Law once enacted that will help save the lives of others who are at risk of gynecologic cancers. A poll recently released by the Gynecological Cancer Foundation revealed that 45 percent of American women could not name a single symptom common to gynecological cancers. This fact alone suggests more must be done in terms increasing awareness. Education and outreach on gynecological cancers deserves to be a national priority and an ongoing effort of the Department of Health and Human Services. I urge that this House adopt H.R. 1245. and I urge my colleagues support for additional and continued action towards increasing research funds and treatment options for those individuals who have been diagnosed with forms of gynecologic cancer.",

This legislation authorizes a national campaign to increase awareness of gynecologic cancersincluding the creation of written information to distribute to the public. This legislation was named after a constituent of mine. Johanna. who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1997. Johanna was a healthy and active 54yearold woman who had retired from teaching from Southfield Lathrup High School when she was diagnosed. It was a shock to Johanna and her family when they received the devastating news. Sadly. the cancer was not caught in time and she passed away on August 29. Each year. more than 80.000 women are diagnosed with a gynecologic cancer. Onethirdor 28.000of these women will die from the disease. Survival rates drop 50 percent or less if the cancer is not diagnosed early. Early detection is critical to successfully treat gynecologic cancers. Many symptoms of this type of cancer often resemble nonthreatening illnesses. Furthermore. many gynecologic cancers do not have a reliable screening test for the general public to utilize. It is important that we educate the American public on early detection and prevention of gynecologic cancers. Public awareness is crucial to curbing this deadly disease. and Johannas Law will help spread knowledge that can save the lives of women that may die needlessly each year.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 864. the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act. Commonly referred to as the STOP Act. this legislation takes several important measures to address the problem of underage drinking. Underage drinking is a serious problem in our country that has serious consequences. It is estimated that nearly onethird of children and adolescents between the ages of 12 and 20 use alcohol. which is a higher percentage than those who use tobacco or illicit drugs. Alcohol is a leading contributor to death and injury among adolescents. Over 5.000 young people die every year as a result of injuries that involve drinking. Not only does underage drinking cause accidents. injuries and death. but it can have a lasting impact on a young persons physical development. Studies have shown that the human brain continues to develop into a young persons early 20s. and that exposure of the developing brain to alcohol may have longlasting effects on intellectual capabilities and increase the likelihood of alcohol addiction. The legislation before us today will take several steps to address the problem of underage drinking at the national level. It would also assist States. localities and institutions of higher learning in their efforts to prevent underage drinking. The bill would create a nationwide media campaign to educate youth and parents on the dangers of underage drinking. It would also assist States in collecting data on underage drinking laws and their enforcement around the country. so that States can collaborate and learn from each other about which strategies are most effective at combating this problem. The bill also calls for research to be conducted on the influences and pressures that entice youth to consume alcohol. I am pleased to recognize Congresswoman ROYBALALLARD. the lead sponsor of the bill. Congressman TOM OSBORNE and other Members who have worked so hard on this legislation. Mr. Speaker. at this time I ask unanimous consent that Mr. FLAKE from Arizona be able to control 5 minutes of my time.",

Underage drinking is a serious public health concern in communities throughout our Nation. According to 2004 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. there were over 142.000 emergency room visits by youth. age 12 to 20. for unintentional injuries and other healthrelated concerns caused by alcohol consumption. This bill builds interagency and communitybased coalitions focusing on underage drinking. funds the production. broadcast and evaluation of national mediabased public health campaigns about the dangers of underage drinking. and establishes grant programs for preventing and reducing alcohol abuse at institutions of higher education and surrounding communities. This bill is a great start in moving our Nation towards the goal of decreasing youth access to. and consumption of. alcohol. It has the endorsement of both the alcohol beverage industry and a number of key public health advocates. both committed to the idea that a multifaceted national effort is key to making progress in curbing underage alcohol consumption.

What I am here to do is challenge the Federal Governments role in authorizing what amounts. in this bill. to $40 million for two new grant programs. $24 million for a new research initiative. $4 million to establish a new Federal committee. and another $4 million for a public service announcement. This is a total of $72 million over 4 years. And heres the real kicker: There already exist Federal programs that do exactly what this suspension bill intends to do. My staff and I visited www.thecoolspot.gov this morning. The Cool Spot was created for young teens by the lead U.S. agency supporting research into the causes. prevention and treatment of alcohol programs. It is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. an agency that is estimated to receive over $430 million in fiscal year 2007 and to do exactly what this suspension bill intends to do. The acting director of this agency justified in House and Senate Appropriations Committee hearings a budget increase of over $2 million for fiscal year 2005 to 2006 by claiming the agency would expand its research into youth alcohol abuse. But if you think that there needs to be more money. you can visit www.alcoholfreechildren.org. another underage drinking program that receives Federal funding from the Federal Government. Or theres www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov. or www.alcoholpolicy.gov. Why are we spending $72 million on Federal research and grants to establish duplicative programs? And why are we doing this exactly 1 week after the voters told us that they were tired of wasteful spending? Mr. Speaker. we simply cannot afford to keep adding new authorizations. new Federal programs when we know that we are running deficits and we have a massive debt. Where does it end? Where do we say. you know. having seven or eight or a dozen programs that already do virtually the exact same thing are enough? l 1245 Why are we simply adding another? We cant continue to do this.

WOLF. and WAMP. as well as our colleagues in the other body. Senators DODD and DEWINE. This is an important moment. one in which this Congress says \"enough is enough.\" For too long we have looked the other way when it comes to the increasing problem of underage drinking. and the results of our inaction are clear. Today. the average age kids start drinking is 13. 7 million young people describe themselves as binge drinkers. alcohol plays a role in the three leading causes of death among young people. and studies tell us that the average young person today. not the troubled teen. but the average kid. is engaging in behavior that leads to alcoholism. Mr. Speaker. the time for action Is now. This is a disease that starts when we are young. and it does not get better as we get older. It gets worse. That is why we need this comprehensive bill. To start with. the STOP Act will increase resources for drinking prevention coalitions like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. which we already know have had a positive impact on teenagers. This bill supports them. It will also fund more research and create a committee charged with delivering a record card on the progress we are making and what we can do better. The committee will also give us a better picture of the degree to which this problem is exacerbated by advertisements targeted toward young people. Lastly. the STOP Act would help us fund a national media campaign directed to adults to make them as aware of the dangers associated with underage drinking as possible. Too often. when it comes to adults. parents think \"not my child.\" and we need to turn that around. So I urge my colleagues to support the STOP Act.

Protecting our young people from the consequences of underage drinking must be a national priority. In my home state of Arizona. 20 percent of children and teens from 12 to 20 years old regularly drink five or more drinks in one sitting. according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services. State and tribal enforcement efforts and regulations are central in our fight against underage drinking. This legislation holds the States accountable for enforcing underage drinking laws by man52. Pt. 17 November 14. 2006 dating that the Department of Health and Human Services issue an annual report card to rate the performance of each State in preventing or reducing underage drinking. Additionally. this measure requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to award grants to design and disseminate strategies to maximize the effectiveness of communitywide approaches to preventing and reducing underage drinking. The bill would provide $5 million in enhancement grants to the Drug Free Communities program to address the problem of underage drinking. Also. another new program will be funded at $5 million annually to provide competitive grants to states. nonprofits. and institutions of higher education to create statewide coalitions to prevent underage drinking and alcohol abuse by university students. In my district. I have fought hard to work against substance abuse by supporting funding to combat alcohol and drug abuse. Just this past September. the Navajo Nation received a $98.000 grant from the Department of Justice for breathalyzers. Statistics have shown that about 90 percent of violent crime on the Navajo Nation is alcoholrelated. and many of our young people are learning that substance abuse is a way of life. I am pleased that the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking (STOP) Act is being considered by the full House this afternoon and I look forward to its passage to provide additional tools to prevent underage drinking in Arizona and throughout the Nation.",

October 28. 1940. when Greece said \"NO\" to Mussolinis demand for immediate free passage of Italian army troops through Greece. and thereby changed the course of World War II. When Greece refused. Mussolini invaded. expecting no serious resistance to his much larger and betterequipped army. In fact. the outnumbered Greek forces offered such stiff resistance that Mussolini was soon thrown on the defensive and the Italians retreated into Albania. The Greeks held the Axis forces at bay for months. forcing Hitler to divert to Greece. forces that had been intended for the invasion of the Soviet Union. which in turn caused a delay in the invasion. Within months. the German armies were bogged down in the harsh winter conditions from which they were never able to recover. In the brutal campaign that Hitlers armies waged in Greece. nearly 16.000 Greeks were killed and more than 300.000 taken prisoner. but from that campaign emerged the determined and courageous Greek resistance. In World War II. Greece and the United States were partners in the struggle against fascism as today they are partners in the effort to build a free. democratic and prosperous world. In Greek communities everywhere. Oxi Day is a time to celebrate Greeces stunning defeat of Mussolinis armies and the Greek role in assuring the Allied victory in World War II.

Felixs Mens and Womens Clothing will be closing. This store has been a pillar of Viroquas downtown business district and an integral part of the community. Thanks to Felixs and other small businesses. Viroqua continues to have a vibrant downtown. Steve Felix has owned and operated Ted Felixs since the early 1970s. Steve is a good friend who is not shy in imparting his advice on me during my frequent visits to Felixs. Steve told me once that back when Senator Proxmire served the people of Wisconsin. he would often stop at Felixs and shake Steves hand. On one of these occasions. Steve scolded the Senator and told him that he needed to start dressing better in order to look like a United States Senator. Senator Proxmire bought a suit from Steve that very day. and during every occasion when he saw Steve he would ask Steve how he looked to ensure his dress was appropriate. As my wife Tawni can attest. Steve has continued this tradition by selling me suits so I am more appropriately dressed. Small businesses like Felixs are vital to the wellbeing of rural America because of the unique spirit. personal service. and character they impart on small towns. They are what make shopping on our main streets an enjoyable and personal experience. Steves leadership and dedication. along with his wife Betty and their two children Randy and Erica. has made Viroqua and Vernon County a better place to live. work. and raise a family. I commend Steve. the Felix family. and all of the other small businesses that continue to serve America and drive our economy. I wish them well and Godspeed in their future ventures.",

William and Marjorie worked tirelessly to bring schools. running water. and inoculation centers to those who previously had absolutely no access to these resources. living in isolated villages in the State of Oaxaca. . Upon their return to the United States. the Buehlers established themselves close to the heart of Arizona. in Superior. where they soon became favored residents of the area.

Marjorie Buehler also served Superior at that time as an elementary educator. Even after retirement. the list of achievements accumulated by the Buehlers continued to grow and bring optimism and hope to those they served. Recognizing critical issues rising along the border of Arizona and Mexico. the Buehlers endeavored to establish border missionaries to address the needs of workers iacing tragic conditions in maquilladora factories located in the dangerous region. To this day. they continue to do volunteer work at Tucsons Primavera Homeless Shelter. and the Tucson Historical Society. It is a fitting tribute to honor these two lives dedicated to the less fortunate of the world. while cultivating a lasting marriage and family.",

Mr. Speaker. Mr. Green does note one trend that I think we should all be trying to overcomenamely. that \"state support (of community colleges and junior colleges) continues to decline.\" Many people with whom I have discussed the problem of inequality in America have noted that the most important thing to do to help close that gap is to increase educational opportunity. I profess to be somewhat skeptical that this is going to do as much as many argue. but that is no reason not to go forward with increased educational opportunity as much as we can. And this will not happen it we allow \"state support (to) continue to decline\" for these schools. They are an essential avenue for young people from families that are not affluent to begin achieving a college education. Mr. Speaker. I hope my colleagues will read Mr. Greens words and accept the relevance of what he says to our job of increasing public support for higher education.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Guantanamo Detainees Procedures Act of 2005. As the war on terrorism continues and more suspected terrorists are likely to be arrested. Congress must ensure that justice is delivered swiftly and responsibly in order to punish terrorists. prevent future attacks. and ensure swift and just processing of those detained. Over 500 detainees are currently being held in Guantanamo Bay. most of them captured in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Some detainees have been there for more than three years without being charged. These individuals should be tried or released. Congress must provide for the swift and deliberate processing and prosecution of detainees in a manner that appropriately balances the countrys national security needs with the countrys due process interests. The Guantanamo Detainees Procedures Act of 2005 is drafted with this goal in mind. Specifically. the legislation does the following: Provides that the executive branch has the authority to detain foreign nationals as unlawful combatants. provides a timely hearing before an independent military officer to challenge their designation as an unlawful combatant. requires release/repatriation or initiation of formal charges within two years. provides a limited extension if the Secretary of State certifies that the individual remains a national security threat and is likely to undertake terrorist acts against the U.S. and that repatriation of the detainee or the commencement of formal charges will compromise the national security of the U.S. by curtailing intelligence gathering. jeopardize intelligence sources necessary to prosecute the detainee. or other extraordinary circumstances justify the delay. requires the establishment of tribunals with clear standards and procedures designed to ensure a full and fair hearing for the detainee when formal charges are initiated. requires annual reports to Congress on the status of all detainees. Mr. Speaker. in sum. the Guantanamo Detainees Procedures Act of 2005 will provide an expeditious procedure for processing and prosecuting terrorists and will also ensure that the hallmark of our democracyjustice for all---is not compromised.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to honor the accomplishments of outgoing Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William H. Donaldson. Chairman Donaldson has announced his retirement. but he leaves behind a legacy of hard work. integrity. and achievement. Mr. Donaldson was certainly well prepared to lead the SEC. He is a veteran of the Marine Corps and a graduate of Yale University. The Chairman has more than 45 years of highlevel business and government experience. He is the founder and former CEO of the investment banking firm Donaldson. Lufkin and Jenrette and is the former Chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. Chairman Donaldson has over five decades of government experience. including service as Under Secretary of State to Henry Kissinger. When Mr. Donaldson took the helm of the SEC on February 18. 2003. our faith in corporations and financial markets was severely strained. The Chairman immediately set out to remedy these ills by advocating internal reform of the Commission and external reform of securities markets. Chairman Donaldson has accomplished his primary goals of improving disclosure and transparency. protecting investors by helping to eliminate conflicts of interest and selfdealing by brokers. detecting and punishing securities fraud. and making the SEC more effective. efficient and cooperative. In addition. Chairman Donaldson has taken the agency from a reactive to proactive posture. Donaldson once said \"look over hills and around comers\" and introduced a riskbased approach to actions. Through the principle and diligence of William Donaldson. the agency completed the SarbanesOxley rulemaking process. strengthened mutual fund oversight to alleviate potential fraud and abuse in the future. and reinforced the SECs enforcement and examination programs. During his tenure the SEC hired 1.200 new employees and also promoted teleworking and a virtual workforce. Perhaps most impressively. under Mr. Donaldsons leadership the agency prosecuted more than 1.700 enforcement actions. the two highest annual totals in the SECs history. During this time the SEC authorized more than $7 billion in penalties to companies which have not played by the rules. Mr. Speaker. our Nations financial institutions are stronger and more secure because of the due diligence of William H. Donaldson. I know that my colleagues in the House of Representatives wish him well in his future endeavors. But at this moment and at this time in our countrys history he and his staff have made a great contribution.",

I am delighted to be here to celebrate this historic occasionthe first official visit of the Prime Minister of Vietnam to the United States Capitol here in Washington. DC. Thirty five years ago I served in Vietnam as a soldier. Two years ago I returned to that country searching for the remains of a fellow soldier from my district. Captain Arnold Holm. who was shot down in Thua Thien Province in 1972. Although we never found his crash site or his remains. the Vietnamese Government and people were extraordinarily generous and helpful as we searched. And while we did not find the crash site of Captain Holm. we did find something else of great value. We found Americans and Vietnamese of courage. good will and generous spirit who believed the time had come to heal the wounds of war. As Senator JOHN MCCAIN said last night. we found people who were willing to forget the pain of the past and move forward as friends to build a better future for all our people. When I returned from my visit to Vietnam I joined my friend and colleague LANE EVANS to create the U.S.-Vietnam Caucus. The purpose of this caucus is to build constructive relationships between our two countries. to search for and recover the remains of soldiers of both countries. to develop tourism and trade. to promote educational exchanges. and to build better relations between our people. Sir Winston Churchill once remarked. \"The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.\" I am an optimist.

The value of Federal arts programs lies in their ability to nurture the growth and artistic excellence of thousands of arts organizations and millions of artists throughout the Nation. making a variety of artsperformance. graphic. literature. and mediaavailable to millions of Americans. The NEA is the Nations largest annual funder of the arts. bringing great artboth new and establishedto all 50 States. including rural communities. innercity neighborhoods. schools. and military bases. Support for the arts is a critical investment in the economic growth of every community in this country. The nonprofit arts industry generates $134 billion annually in economic activity. supports 4.85 million jobs. and returns $10.5 billion to the Federal government in income taxes. Minnesotas 4th Congressional District alone is home to over 1.200 artsrelated businesses that employ nearly 9.000 people. These businesses range from theaters. arts schools. museums. architecture firms. and advertising agencies. In addition. unnumbered individual and freelance artists call my district their home. I am proud to represent these artists and their families. I appreciate how the arts deeply enrich Minnesota. The educational. cultural. and economic impact of the arts is very measurable. Not only do 95% of Minnesotans believe that the arts are an important or essential part of the education of Minnesota children. but 67% of Minnesotans have attended an arts activity themselves within the past year. In addition. the arts in Minnesota have over a $1 billion economic impact annually. Arts education has also been proven to help students increase cognitive development. inspire creativity. and enhance problemsolving skills.

It is with a commitment to the economic. social. and cultural wellbeing of my district. and of the Nation. that I rise today in support of the National Endowment for the Arts.",

He was a friend and a neighbor whose public work was devoted to maintaining and improving our unique quality of life for generations to come. He was. in the words of his colleague Congressman Morris Udall. \"a workhorse rather than a showhorse\". a \"glutton for the tough. detailed work that so many of us shun.\" These words paint an accurate picture of a true public servant and statesman. And they set a standard of excellence for those of us now serving in Congress. Congressman Meedss tough. detailed work played a major role in creating Head Start and the Youth Conservation Corps. He took a stand as one of the first to support Title IX. the law that bans gender discrimination in our schools. He set an example for me personally with his work to preserve and protect land for future generations by brokering the North Cascades Act that created the North Cascades National Park and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. He later worked for a resolution to ensure passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. a vital piece of legislation that will protect some of the most pristine land in the United States for generations to come.

As a Nation. we must advance initiatives that support empowerment and opportunity for all. During this month. I am pleased to recognize the efforts of groups in Marylands Eighth Congressional District that work to enrich the lives of HispanicAmericans. An example of one such group is CASA de Maryland. The Ford Foundation and the National Council of La Raza. NCLR named CASA de Maryland \"Affiliate of the Year\" in recognition of its hard work and dedication to providing services that improve the lives of Latinos and others in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties. As we honor the achievements of Hispanics. we know that celebrating the Hispanic community for one month a year is not enough. All Latinos deserve a real opportunity to achieve the American dream. whether they have been here for generations or have just arrived on our shores.",

I would like to congratulate the three organizations that worked hard to put this dinner together. Hispanics United of Buffalo. the Hispanic Womens League. and the Latino Business Owners Association (LBOA). Hispanics United of Buffalo has worked hard in this community. providing assistance. while instilling pride. promoting rights. and allowing people to have a chance at a better life. by offering services unheard of being offered in the Hispanic community. Such services advocated by the agency include access to proper nutriton. adequate housing. affordable health care. meaningful employment. and equal educational opportunities. Since its inception. HUB has aided the Hispanic community by being a first step into a better. more prosperous community. not just for Hispanics nor simply for the West Side but for everyone in this city and for that I commend them. The Hispanic Womens League. was formed in 1979 by a group of women to respond to issues affecting Hispanic women in Western New York. The primary commitment of the league has been to maintain a scholarship fund established to grant financial support to Hispanic/Latina women pursuing higher education. If it were not for the efforts of this organization. the next generation of leadership for the community would not be secure. by providing a chance at higher education to youth in the Hispanic community. The Hispanic Womens League has ensured the future of the Hispanic community is a bright one and for that I would like to commend you. The Latino Business Owners Association (LBOA) has become a sound and strong organization that serves existing and startup businesses in our community. It is the anchor of support in the business community with Leadership and Guidance. Aiding entrepreneurship in the Hispanic community. the LBOA is on the frontline of economical prosperity. providing credibility and an overall positive future for the community it has vowed to aid. and for this I commend you. These three organizations play vital roles in the destiny of this community. and I know that their tireless efforts will continue to have a positive impact and play a major role in this city for years to come.",

Hispanic Heritage Month runs from September 15th to October 15th each year and is an occasion for all Americans to recognize the invaluable achievements and contributions that Hispanic Americans have made to our nation. The first day of Hispanic Heritage Month also marks the anniversary of independence for six Latin American countriesMexico. Costa Rica. El Salvador. Guatemala. Honduras. and Nicaragua. Hispanic Americans are members of a rapidly expanding and increasingly influential community in this nation. and they have played a vital role in shaping our nations culture. They have contributed to every aspect of enhancing our society including serving as leaders in business. government. law. science and the arls. Additionally. they have sacrificed in the defense of this nations freedom by serving in every major American conflict. Currently more than 10 percent of our active duty force is of Latino descent. During this months celebration. it is important to take time to recognize the value of the role Hispanics have taken in the democratic process both here in the United States and abroad. Hispanics in this country have taken an active role in democracy by increasing voter participation and striving to be model citizens. truly meriting recognition. Hispanic Americans dedication to democracy is an extension of their strong commitment to community. hard work. and family unity. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I call upon my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month.",

Arkansas. Ray graduated as covaledictorian with his twin brother. Roy. from Rison High School in 1937. Ray and his brother dedicated 31 years to Martin Brothers Gas Company. Ray is perhaps best remembered in Rison for his service to the Election Commission for nearly 35 years. It was imperative to Ray that local elections were carried out with the utmost integrity and honesty. Rays impressive list of community activities include the Superintendent of Rison Baptist Church Sunday School where he was also a deacon. a 32nd degree Mason. past President of Arkansas Butane Association. and past Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Henderson State University. As you can see. Ray spent a lifetime giving back to his community. An avid Rison Wildcat football tan. Ray will be remembered by many in the Rison community for nearly six decades as the voice of the Wildcats. In 1995. Ray and his brother were honored for their dedication to the Rison School District when the school district designated a Ray and Roy Martin Week to honor a half century of service. Ray truly set a high bar of community service for us all to aspire to. Ray was a dear friend of mine and my heartfelt condolences go out to Rays wife. Mary Ethel. their daughters. Cindy and Hilda. their grandsons. Marty. Russ. and Jason. and their greatgranddaughters. Lindsey and Ella. While Jim may no longer be with us. his legacy and his spirit will always live on in all the lives he touched.",

The estimate is that the votes do not exist to pass this agreement it in the House.

Incidentally. there are some people today from the textile area of this country saying there will be some changes in CAFTA to protect the textile industry. which presumably would require some other legislation to be passed to implement these changes. Let me just say to anybody who thinks there are going to be any changes to this. there will be nothing coming through this Senate that will not be slowed down to the nth degree. and we will try in every way possible to block it.

Today I rise to pay tribute to two very distinguished Arkansans. first to the new and undefeated. undisputed middleweight champion of the world. Jermain Taylor. Jermain Taylors skill in the boxing ring is only one reason for me to recognize him on the Senate floor. Jermain is one of boxings rising young stars. He is known for his skill and his power in the ring. but he is also known for his grace and humility outside of the ring. On July 16. Jermain. a Little Rock native. thrilled the people of Arkansas when he stepped into a ring in Las Vegas. NV and took the middleweight championship of the world from Bernard Hopkins. Jermains victory that night was the culmination of a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice that began when he was just a small boy. When Jermain was 5. he had to take on the responsibility of being the man of the house after his father left the family. Even at that young age. he took responsibility for his younger sisters without hesitation. At the age of 13. he made his way into Ozell Nelsons gym and. though he lost his first sparring session. he enjoyed the challenge and believed he would improve. and he could improve with hard work. He did. and in 1996 he won the U.S. Under 19 Championships. In 2000. he won a bronze medal while representing his country in the Olympic Games held in Sydney. Australia. Shortly thereafter he began his pro career. By all accounts and by every measure. Jermain Taylor is a great fighter. but he is an even better person. He has been described as humble. determined and one who knows that family comes first. In short. he embodies the best of what being an Arkansan is all about. He is a self described country boy with country values. Being an old farmers daughter myself. I can vouch for the fact that there is nothing wrong with that. Thousands of Arkansans traveled to Las Vegas to support their local hero. Chants of J.T. and the calling of the hogs could be heard throughout the fight as Jermain outworked and outboxed his opponent.",

I rise in strong support of H.R. 3650. the Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Act of 2005. H.R. 3650 authorizes Federal courts to conduct business outside of their geographic jurisdictions during times of emergency. Congress must enact this legislation immediately so that the affected courts in the gulf region can continue to operate in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina has severely damaged. perhaps ravaged is a better word. Federal courthouses in Louisiana. Alabama. and Mississippi. We must act with a sense of urgency. To illustrate why. consider the Eastern Judicial District of Louisiana. where operations are currently suspended. There is virtually no Federal district court presence there. Judges and court staff are physically scattered throughout Louisiana and other States. But crime in the district. assault. rape. and robbery. has not taken the week off. Yet there is no court that can act and no judge to preside. Criminal defendants will walk if deadlines established in the Speedy Trial Act cannot be met. In other words. we must restore the rule of law in the Eastern District of Louisiana as well as elsewhere. The bill contemplates that affected courts could use other facilities that are convenient and practicable to participants under the circumstances. The special circumstances allowing courts to operate outside their normal jurisdictions would continue only until the vacated courthouses could be restored for normal business activities.

Last year. four hurricanes ravaged Florida over a 40day period. Many students lost their homes. their jobs. and they were forced to withdraw from school.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless with hundreds. maybe even thousands. dead. Nearly 100.000 college students have been displaced in some 30 colleges in the gulf coast region that have been severely damaged by the hurricane.

While this is a necessary and appropriate step. we also must recognize that Congress should be doing more to provide relief for these 100.000 students. I say that not as a point in contention.

So there are many ways to respond to the impact of Katrina. and I think many people are doing so In many places throughout the country. everybody using what it is that they have got to give. Again. I commend the gentleman from Florida for his insight. for his intuition. for his introduction of this bill. and would urge that we support it and also urge support for the MillerKildee legislation that I understand is being introduced later on today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the Pell Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act. Hurricane Katrina created a disaster of monumental proportions. First and foremost. our priority should remain saving of lives and delivering aid immediately to those most in need. As long as this crisis continues. we should tap every available resource of the Federal Government to make sure that we are providing relief in every corner of the disaster zone. This relief extends to young Americans who work so very hard and. with the help of Federal assistance. were able to realize their dream of attending college. This crucial legislation would allow the Secretary to grant waivers to students who were forced from school by a natural disaster such as Katrina. This would waive the requirement for them to pay back Federal Pell grant aid when they withdraw from school. It is hard enough for them to get into college without this disaster throwing up yet another barrier to achieving the dream of a college education. I commend the gentleman from Florida for introducing this legislation. and I thank the leadership for calling this legislation to the floor so quickly. And I also thank my colleagues on the Committee on Education and the Workforce for supporting this measure when we considered the Higher Education Act in July. Mr. Speaker. this is a good bill In a difficult hour. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for it. I also would like to say a word about the bill that the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Michigan are introducing today. It is every bit as important that we pass that bill in a timely fashion as it is that we pass the gentleman from Floridas bill. It is particularly important that we allow families to adjust their expected family contribution. One of the problems with the financial aid system is that the information that is used to determine eligibility is often a year behind reality. That system works when reality does not change that much from year to year. but when it changes as dramatically as it has for so many people affected by this tragedy. it would place students in a thoroughly disadvantageous position if they were unable to change their financial contribution. So I urge speedy consideration and passage of that bill as well as of the gentleman from Floridas bill.",

I rise in support of this legislation to assist college students who have been victimized by widespread devastation visited on the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina last week. We. in North Carolina. know well the destruction hurricanes can cause as our State has been hit by at least five major hurricanes over the past decade. The Federal Govemment has a solemn responsibility to help those in need. and H.R. 3169 is one very small step in that effort. Specifically. H.R. 3169 will relieve some burden for displaced college students who otherwise would be required to pay back their Pell grants. This bill would allow the U.S. Education Department to waive the repayment requirement for Pell grant recipients whose school attendance is interrupted because of the impact of a disaster. provided that the students were living. working or attending school in an area designated by the President to warrant major disaster assistance. Congress must also pass legislation introduced by Congressman GEORGE MILLER and Congressman DALE KILDEE to provide more comprehensive relief for student victims of the storm. Nearly 100.000 college students have been displaced. while some 30 colleges in the Gulf Coast region have been severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Many students and families no longer have the necessary resources to pay for collegeeven after their current Federal student aid is taken into account. We need to ensure that we help all college students and student borrowers who have been adversely impacted by this disaster. Congress has much. much more work to do to assist in the relief. recovery and reconstruction in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. H.R. 3129 is a minimal early step in that effort. and I urge its adoption.",

These accounts have not increased in the last 3 years. but this is where the administration is going to squeeze as much as they possibly can. but there will never be enough in these accounts to eradicate a deficit of $427 billion next year.

Most recently. we have heard the claim that the costs of this wonderful Medicare prescription drug benefit have skyrocketed far above the estimates relied upon when we passed the bill in 2003. Allow me to set the record straight. The cost of the Medicare prescription drug benefit that will guarantee every senior in America affordable prescription drug coverage has not changed. In November of 2003. the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the costs of the drug benefit from 2004 to 2013 would be $408 billion. Today. they estimated it at $410 billion. In December of 2003. the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. using different assumptions. estimated that the cost of the bill over the same 10year period would be $511 billion. Today. they are saying it will cost $518 billion. So. whatever estimates we use. whichever set of assumptions we wish to rely on. CBOs or CMS. the answer is the cost estimates have not changed. They varied about plus or minus 1 percent. So what is the issue? What is the big uproar over? The answer is simple. New estimates just released by the administration are for a 10year period that begin in 2006. not 2004. These estimates cite a cost of $724 billion. That is because they drop 2 years when there was no drug program and add 2 years when millions more Medicare beneficiaries are going to enjoy the benefits of our Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act. It is just that simple. The 10year estimating period changed. So. of course. the estimates went up. But it is easy for the estimators to count the new number of people who benefit from the program in the 2 additional years and drop the 2 years when there was no program. It is more difficult for them. and so they do not do it. estimate the saving that the Medicare modernization and prescription drug bill will enable Medicare to enjoy while at the same time improving the quality of care we will be able to deliver to our seniors. The Medicare Modernization Act fundamentally changed the way Medicare delivers care to our seniors. By offering welcome to Medicare physicals and disease management programs. we have",

When 1 heard we were going to a madrassa. I was a little concerned. a little skeptical. that here we were going to visit a facility that basically educated religious fanatics. that hated America. hated western values and basically everything we stood for. I was pleased to find out that it was a moderate facility. The thing I was probably most encouraged to learn from the Pakistan government about education in madrassas is that the Pakistan governments strategy is to build secular schools right next to the extreme madrassas in their country. Because when parents are given the opportunity to send their child to a school that provides education. boarding. and food when the average income is a few hundred dollars a year. certainly they will do that. But when the school only provides a religious education that provides no marketable skills in the economy. their child does not necessarily have a bright future. and their options are limited when they graduate. and they are susceptible to some of the radical teachings. But if their child is given the opportunity to go to a school next door that provides a secular education. that teaches them reading. math. and life skills to be able to be constructive. contributing members to a country and an economy. the parents are going to make the same choice every single time. They are going to make sure their child has a bright future. has every opportunity possible to them that they can gain through that education. So the Pakistan government is doing some very good things in support of combating terrorism. by going right to the root by addressing the hope and the opportunity of the youth of that part of the world so that they choose a positive path in life rather than terrorism and crime and a very destructive path in life.

I want to make an observation about the overall position we have taken. It is my belief. and we have seen it today. that we may be harshly criticized by some for being too bold or aggressive with some of our actions. Indeed. we have already been told that we were not incremental enough. I want to take headon those who take such positions. There is no question that what is being proposed today is bold and sweeping in some areas. Without getting into the classified specifics. based on our strategic review. we are cutting back dramatically in some cases. on some technical programs that have had poor performance or could be modified for better utility for the Nations intelligence efforts. We are terminating some programs that we do not believe fit in the overall architecture for the intelligence community. We have analyzed these programs extensively. asked the tough questions. and focused on the resulting Intelligence output. To paraphrase from a Hollywood movie line. these programs have been weighed. they have been measured. and they have been found wanting. We are then taking the resulting savings and applying that to historically underfunded areas in the human intelligence and human capital areas. Specifically. we are focusing needed emphasis on adding human intelligence specialists. improving the training of analysts. improving the training of case officers. and making more robust the infrastructure necessary to gain their expertise. and then better employ that expertise. We have quite simply in the past paid too much lip service to those basic needs. while continuing to fund expensive technical programs that. although important. do not make up for the lack of analysts. lack of worldwide coverage. lack of training. and lack of basic infrastructure. In sum. we are doing the heavy lifting that should have been done long ago. We are acting boldly and positively on the task our former chairman gave us. Madam Speaker.

Democrats fixed those problems and fought back changes this year to bring us back to the bad old days of intelligence turf wars. This bill reflects the new world we live in. a dangerous world that has gotten more dangerous since September 11. and we need to be involved. and more heavily involved. to protect all Americans. no matter where they are on this planet and the bill does that.

Congress passed intelligence reform and created the DNI position to give the brave women and men of the intelligence community the tools they need to collect and analyze accurate and timely intelligence. We cannot have any more catastrophic failures where we fail to connect the dots or believe too fervently in the claims of bogus sources. This legislation. the authorization bill we are considering today. is the first funding bill under our new intelligence organization. It is a strong bill that deserves our support. As we said earlier. for the first time we fully funded counterterrorism in the base budget so we can plan CT operations against our enemies. For the first time we have urged the DNI to create multitier security clearances so we can field a diverse group of intelligence officers who speak the languages and understand the cultures of our adversaries. I am proud to say these were two ideas offered by the committee Democrats that gained bipartisan support in our committee. As I have said. there are ways this bill can be improved further. And I look forward to working on this as we move to conference. But this is a bipartisan product that deserves bipartisan support. And before I close.

Before the intelligence reform bill passed last year. he was one of the few senior intelligence officers who could get 15 disparate agencies to function as a community. He did that mainly through sheer force of personality. Our Nation collects intelligence through a variety of means. from spies on the ground to satellites overhead. and everything in between. In his capacity as the assistant director for collection. Charlie got the collectors to understand that they were most effective when they worked together as a team against the hardest targets. He got them to understand that integrated collection strategies yielded the best outcomes. Under Charlies leadership. the collectors in the intelligence community have scored some truly impressive victories. and it is unfortunate that these cannot be recounted in public. I will just tell you that Charlies service to the Nation was made clear to me the day he told the committee that he had been with the CIA for nearly 50 years. That is an astounding record. and it is certainly appropriate as we close debate on what I think is one of the best authorization bills ever. that we recognize Charlies service to our Nation.",

This is an issue that has concerned me for many years and one that I have worked to correct. The Housepassed FY 2006 Defense Appropriations bill includes substantial. new HUMINT resources. which I will make every effort to protect as we go into conference with the Senate later this year. Additionally. the authorization bill includes provisions to strengthen Ambassador Negropontes hand as he undertakes the tremendous responsibility of defining the role of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and transforming the intelligence community. I am hopeful that the authorizers and the appropriators can work together to support the DNI in this critical first year. Certainly. there are areas of the bill. particulary some of the technical programs. where I am a little disappointed in the resource levels recommended by the Intelligence Committee.

I commend the leadership of the Chairman and Ranking Member. and thank them for supporting the amendment I offered at markup to align the authorization for an important technical program with the level set by the Armed Services Committee. H.R. 2475 also underscores the importance the Committee places on providing fullfunding of intelligence requirements related to the global war on terrorism. For years. Intelligence Committee Democrats have fought hard for this. If fact. some of us voted against the intelligence bill last year because it contained less than onethird of the funding needed for counterterrorism. This year. Im pleased the Committee has finally brought a bill before the House that provides full intelligence funding for our dedicated men and women on the front lines. This bill also includes House Resolution 173. a measure which encourages the DNI to establish a uniform. multitiered security clearance system. Such a system is needed to ensure all intelligence agencies fullyleverage the cultural knowledge and foreign language skills of people who may not be able to be cleared. in a timely manner. to the highest levels. It will also help increase the workforce diversity and skillsmix. both of which are critical to the future success and viability of the Intelligence Community. The report accompanying H.R. 2475 also highlights the work of the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC). Although EPIC is funded through DEA in other legislation instead of this bill because of its drugrelated intelligence mission. its work is critically important to the U.S. national security overall. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure EPICs activities are funded at an appropriate and consistent level. In addition to highlighting the strengths of this bill. I must also note my serious concerns about the general oversight of systematic failures related to the handling and interrogation of detainees. While it is critical that we collect actionable intelligence from detainees to prevent future threats. it is imperative that we do so in a way that respects U.S. law. and international conventions and treaties. Although there were some issues some of us would have resolved differently. H.R. 2475 is. on balance. a sound bill.",

I am very pleased that the majority is accepting the amendment. It is a good idea for us to make absolutely clear that the NCTC. the National Counter Terrorism Center. is a vital piece of the reform we enacted last year and that it needs to be fully operational ASAP. To explain further. one of the big mistakes we made leading up to 9/11 is everyone now knows our failure to connect the dots. Obviously. having a fusion center designed for this purpose is a very good way to make sure we do not fail to connect the dots the next time. So it took. I would say. the introduction of this amendment to cause the President to nominate a very able fellow. Vice Admiral Redd. to be the director of the NCTC. He did that 2 days after this amendment was presented in the Committee on Rules. And perhaps now that we are accepting it as part of todays debate. the NCTC will become fully operational even before that prison reform bill is enacted. In conclusion. Madam Speaker.

This BRAC round should be delayed until the recommendations of the Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure are implemented by the Secretary of Defense. a substantial number of American troops return from Iraq. the House and Senate Armed Services Committees receive the quadrennial defense review. the National Maritime Security Strategy is implemented. and the Homeland Defense and Civil Support directive is implemented. It is important that these issues be addressed before implementing the BRAC process because once a base is closed. it can never be reopened.

These job losses will have a tremendous economic impact on the City of Cleveland. which has been named \"The Most Impoverished City\" in the country.

Communities affected by the BRAC process are going to be hit with a double whammyonce when the base closes and the military leaves town. then again when the Defense Department leaves an environmental mess behind: unexploded bombs. chemical contamination. and environmental toxins. I believe we need to address the environmental and redevelopment issues pending from previous rounds before initiating another round of BRAC closings.

In fact. it doesnt appear that anyone is obligated to consider the homeland security implications of these base closings. On September 11. 2001. fighter jets from the 102nd Fighter Wing of the Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. Massachusetts. were the first military presence to arrive on the scene in New York City. Just last week. the Air Wing escorted an Al Italia flight to Bangor. Maine. after it was discovered that a passenger on board was on the nofly list. Yet. Otis is slated for closure on the BRAC list. It takes nine minutes for the fighters on Cape Cod to reach New York City. Nine minutes because they can take off and land in totally unrestricted air space. The same cant be said of Atlantic Citywhere some of the planes may be reassigned. We shouldnt have to ask commercial air traffic to back off so we can scramble our own planes to defend us.

It is a messagesender to Zarqawi and his followers. who think that perhaps the United States does not have the stomach to continue to oppose them. It is a messagesender to our troops. who might. in seeing if this amendment should pass. feel that the resolve of the American people is fading away. This is precisely the kind of a message we do not want to send to friend and foe alike. and certainly not to the 140.000 Americans serving presently in Iraq. who feel that the country is strongly behind them.

I want to say to my side. my leader on the Committee on Armed Services who I have great respect for. this is not about our troops. This is about a policy. that I believed when I voted 2 years ago to commit the troops that I was making my decision on facts. Since that time. I have been very disappointed in what I have learned about the justification for going into Iraq. Afghanistan. absolutely. We should be there. We should probably have more troops. But we cannot have more troops when they are in Iraq. Mr. Chairman. with regard to this effort by the gentlewoman from California. we have never voted one time together. not one time in the 11 years I have been here. But. Mr. Chairman. I have beside me a picture of a young man whose name is Tyler Jordan. His daddy was a gunny sergeant killed two years ago. Phillip Jordan. He has under his arm the flag that was over the coffin. To my left are just a few faces of those who have died for this country. They died doing what they thought was right for America. and God bless them. But all this amendment does is just say that it is time for the Congress to meet its responsibility. The responsibility of Congress is to make decisions whether we should send our men and women to war or not send them to war. What we are saying here tonight is we think it is time for the Congress to begin. to start the debate and discussion of what the exit strategy is of this government. whether it be 2 years down the road. 3 years down the road. or 1 year. Mr. Chairman. what I am saying tonight is we have a responsibility. We should not be into some endless. endless war in Iraq. when we have so many other countries that we need to be watching much more carefully than Iraq. So I hope that this resolution passes and we can start meeting our responsibilities of discussing the policy for America.",

In fact. no one who has ever studied at a war college. no one who is a combat commander. no military strategist. no one who really wants to achieve victory. would ever support what this amendment is asking those of us in the House to support here today. Besides. we already have a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. and that is when we have achieved victory. that is when we have helped to deliver freedom to the Iraqi people. and that is when we have secured a foothold for liberty in the Middle East. My question is this: Did we ask General Eisenhower for a plan for the withdrawal of the forces from Europe before the war was won? Of course not. And I would ask this: Did we ask General McArthur for a plan for withdrawal in the Pacific before the war was won? Of course not. Mr. Chairman. it makes no sense to telegraph our plans to the enemy. In fact. that would be an incredibly dangerous thing for us to do. But our enemies should know this: America will not cut and run. And to the Iraqi people.

It sets no date by when the President must present a plan to Congress. just as soon as it is practicable. I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose this language. Currently. we have close to 140.000 uniformed men and women in Iraq. No matter where you stand on the question of Iraq. we owe it to these courageous men and women. and to their families. to let them know when and how we will bring them home to stay. Mr. Chairman. it is easy to start a war. but it is hard to get out of one. It is easy to go along and accept the military occupation. It is a lot harder to take an honest look at where we are now and determine when and how we are going to get out. But that is what we need to do. and we need to do it now. As a Congress. we should be ashamed that we have not demanded such a report from the President. This is the least we can do. to suggest that he send one. There has been no accountability with regard to this war. and this Congress has been all too content to just go along with an openended occupation. It is time we change that complacency. It is time we do our job. Support the Woolsey amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me time. The reason I am rising to support her amendment is because I think that we have come to a time in the war in Iraq where Democrats and Republicans alike need to consider all the events that have transpired. to do it in a way that is compassionate for the decisions that were made to send us into war. sand to do it without recriminations. without challenging each others integrity. without challenging each others love for our country or support for the troops. Democrats and Republicans came together to send this country to war. We can only come together to take this country out of Iraq. You start to see the signs that make it so apparent that the time is near. The time is near when this Congress must consider the reality facing our troops. the reality of the circumstances which sent our troops into battle. And we need to do this as colleagues who may have started from different points of view on Iraq. I certainly have a different point of view. I voted against the war. But now we are starting to see people who voted for the war coming forward and expressing their concerns. We have to have that capacity for rational reflection and an ability. not to say so much that we were wrong. but to say we have new information and we therefore have a right to reappraise the situation and take a new direction. The Woolsey amendment gives us a chance to do that. and it sets us on a path. So whether it is the Woolsey amendment or something that happens in the next few weeks and months. Democrats and Republicans are going to have to come together to help the President get out of the mess that this country is in. So I think we can proceed in a spirit that is amicable. We do not have to be beating each other up on this. We do not have to have a war about war. or certainly a war about a peaceful withdrawal. So the Woolsey amendment is an important step in the direction of setting this country on a path towards extricating ourself from Iraq. For that reason. I support it. and I want to commend her for her activity on behalf of it.",

I applaud his concern about whether there are going to be adequate resources to deal with issues of enforcement. detention. and legal enforcement. These are all worthwhile undertakings. The real issue is. in the compromise legislation we are going to raise $18 billion. The Cornyn amendment adds between $5 and $6 billion. As I understand it. the Byrd amendment is $3 billion on top of that. And we have raised fees on immigrants quite significantly so that there will be a considerable additional burden. About 35 percent of those who will be adjusting their status are overstays. and so they had nothing really to do with border security. although border security is enormously important. We cant reallocate the resources. the fines or fees. on people that had come across the border. It seems to me that these fees are enormously costly. Under the Cornyn amendment. it is going to be an additional payment for every child. We reach a point where we are talking about people of extremely modest means. reaching a ceiling. I think we crossed it even with the Cornyn amendment. I reluctantly oppose the amendment. But I want to give assurance to the Senator from West Virginia that we will monitor this very closely. He is on our side the leader on the Appropriations Committee. We have talked over his general concerns on a wide range of issues relating to immigrants. We remember the border security issue of a couple years ago. and he was very involved in wanting to make sure of the integrity of the system. He was very involved in the debate on those questions. This subject matter is not a new matter for him. It is a matter of enormous importance. I hope we will be able to handle it under the existing provisions and we would not need the additional resources that are included in his amendment. We want to give him assurance that we will keep in close contact with him to let him know what the current situation is. and we will always have an opportunity in the future to revisit it.

This is a modest sum. a modest amendment. a modest fee increase that Senator GREGG and I are asking for. The pending bill would provide amnesty for the illegal aliens who would benefit from the bill. It would provide a path leading to U.S. citizenship. It would provide access to taxpayerfunded benefits such as Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid. unemployment compensation. food stamps. Illegal aliens who would benefit from the bill are getting a lot. significantly more than what they are being asked to pay into the system. I dont believe that it is too much to ask that they help to fix the border security system that they sought to undermine. This amendment is specific. It targets those areas identified by the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that are most in need of funds. I also note that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would authorize $25 billion in appropriations over the next 5 years. Six billion of that is authorized for fiscal year 2007. and Senator GREGG and I. as the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. are going to be asked to fund many of these border security authorizations. We need a source of revenue with which to do it. So the purpose of this amendment is to provide a source of funding for our border security needs and to do it as quickly as possible. This amendment would make almost $1 billion available for border and interior security needs for the fiscal year 2007. which the Appropriations Committee can provide this summer when it writes the bill. This amendment would make another $2 billion available in the fiscal year 2008. We cant afford to delay this critical funding any longer. I hope Senators will support this amendment.",

In all of this back and forth. one group has been voiceless: the infants and young children longing for a loving home who dont care about or understand borders. In 2004. I introduced the Intercountry Adoption Reform Act. known simply as ICARE. in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to rise today to join my colleague. the Senior Senator from Louisiana. who is introducing ICARE in this Congress as an amendment to the Immigration Reform Act. Adoption represents the very best of the generous American spirit. In 2004 alone. Americans opened their homes through adoption to over 23.000 orphaned children from overseas. We must ask. how many more children would be with a loving family today if the maze of government regulation was not so complex?",

Under existing law. these children are treated as immigrants. having to apply for. and be granted. immigrant visas to enter the U.S.-a process that we all know to be cumbersome. timeconsuming. and expensive. Had they been born abroad to American citizens. they could simply travel back to the U.S. with a passport and enter as citizens. This amendment eliminates this discrepancy and injects common sense into the way our law views these children. Second. this amendment streamlines the existing foreign adoption functions of the Federal Government. Rather than having to navigate through three Federal agencies the Departments of State. Health and Human Services and Homeland Securityadoptive parents would instead have to deal with only one: a consolidated office of intercountry adoptions located within the State Department. I believe this is an essential step to cut through the layers of redtape that currently bind adoptive parents trying to give the gift of a family to a child from overseas. Mr. President. our laws simply must do a better job of accommodating the unique circumstances surrounding intercountry adoption. and I believe that is exactly what this ICARE amendment will do.

I hope this construct is one that could be agreed to. perhaps. in conference with broader application. Many of the criticisms of the current system with which I agreed are addressed by this amendment. Workers come to America to fill jobs unwanted by Americans. but they are staying and they are not going home. Workers who declared an intent to leave. instead. are requesting permanent residency and a path to citizenship. This is not the way things used to be when workers came to the United States. worked a spell. and then returned to their foreign homes and families. The Hutchison amendment returns to those days. Workers have to apply for the program from outside. They come in for 10 months to work and then must return home for 2 months. They cannot bring their family for the temporary work. and they may not apply for renewal within the United States or for permanent residency. I am also delighted Senator HUTCHISON has taken the suggestion to ensure that enough visas remain midyear for cooler States. such as Missouri. where our seasonal agricultural work does not begin until the late spring or after. Many Missourians [52. Pt. 7 9365 claim to me that past programs allowed all visas to be issued in waiver States at the beginning of the season. and that left out the northern States. I heard these concerns. and Senator HUTCHISON accommodated them. for which I am grateful. I hope this amendment is agreed to as a model in conference for the seasonal work program.

Let us not only do the right thing. Let us do something that is real. People are cynical. They are tired of politics as usual in this House.

Chairman DREIER. and the House leadership for continuing the debate in favor of securing our borders. The pattern in recent years has been to address the issue of immigration and border security once a decade. In 1986 we had an immigration reform bill. In 1996 we had an immigration reform bill. But the results at best were mixed. and this year we have yet another opportunity to get it right. Ninety percent of the American people are demanding that we secure our borders and secure our borders now. The legislation offered under this rule will help our current agents detain and apprehend criminals. not just those crossing In search of work. Mr. Speaker. but truly dangerous individuals as well. Security on our borders remains a crisis. Our agents on the border need our help. Our constituents are forcefully voicing their support for immigration reform. with an emphasis on border security. And I ask my colleagues. please support this rule and the underlying bills so we can start to solve this problem and solve it now.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. how long will the Republican Majority continue to bring to this House Floor piecemeal legislation that purports to fix the immigration crisis in our country? H.R. 4830. H.R. 6094 and H.R. 6095 are not real reform. In fact. these bills are largely a repacking of previously enacted bills dressed up to look like the Republicans are serious about immigration reform. Higher monetary and sentencing penalties. more enforcement and the usurping of du process are all tactics that have been tried throughout the years and have brought us to the situation we find ourselves today. The American people are being duped into thinking these three Republican bills will prevent illegal immigrants from entering our country. I cannot in good conscience vote for these three bills not because I dont want to stop illegal immigration but because they are hollow authorizations without any funding to implement them. What we should be voting on and what I would support is the implementation of the 9/11 Commission immigration recommendations which I have voted for seven times in Committee or on the Floor. Those seven votes would have authorized and funded thousands of new immigration agents and detention beds. Instead we are voting to impose a HUGE unfunded mandate in our local law enforcement by deputizing them to be first line immigration officers. If the leadership in the House and Senate want real immigration reform. they need to fully fund all the immigration agents. detention officers as called for by the 9/11 Commission report. I do not support illegal immigration and believe that anyone who enters the US in violation of U.S. immigration laws should be penalized. But our country is in need of an immigration policy that accounts for the fears 9/11 instilled. in addition to the hope that immigrants bring to our nation. Immigration reform should include family reunification. asylum and refugee admissions. and employmentbased immigration. It must be compassionate and humanitarian and strike the delicate balance between American jobs. border safety and national security interests. H.R. 4830. H.R. 6094. and H.R. 6095 do none of this.

I come to the well of the House to politely but profoundly take issue with my friend from Mississippi. You see. party labels do not ensure unanimity any more than trying to cast the challenge we confront as a people through a partisan prism. I come to the floor of this House to reiterate the basic concern confronting us. The problem we are dealing with at the border is not a Democratic problem. It is not a Republican problem. It is an American problem. And. Madam Speaker. I politely take issue with my friend from Mississippi when he says a comprehensive approach is needed. The trouble with that notion is that despite the goodwill and best intentions of many. regardless of party affiliation. socalled comprehensive reform subordinates the first and most basic responsibility of government. protection of our citizens to an economic exception of amnesty and special considerations for noncitizens. To this provision before the House today. which I am proud to bring forward. again from bipartisan concerns. as noted earlier in another debate. the chairman of the Rules Committee mentioned that it was bipartisan. the senior Senator from his State happens to be a Democrat. working with the chairman of the Rules Committee. a Republican. my junior Senator from my State. working with me on this because it is an American problem. The chairman pointed out that there is currently a hole in the law as genuine as some of the holes in our border. We have to criminalize the financing and construction of bordercrossing tunnels that currently serve as smuggler subways and actually promote illegal access to our country. The chairman delineated the threat. Now we see contraband. we see narcotics brought through these tunnels. but the real question before this House and before the American people is this: If narcotics can be smuggled. what of a weapon of mass destruction? Just as assuredly as the House passed the fence bill last week and the other Chamber takes it up in the coming days to move forward. believe me. there will be intense and renewed interest in using subterranean facilities. We must pass this bill today as part and parcel of what the American people are calling for. and they are calling for enforcement first. Pass this legislation. Lets get this done.",

Only in the backward world of Republican campaign strategy would passing more ineffective bills be seen as a way to highlight \"progress\" on illegal immigration. I hope that the American people ask what happened to the massive immigration bill that the House passed in December. I hope they question why House Republicans are today spending time debating three bills they know the Senate will never consider. The truth is that Republicans arent interested in stopping illegal immigration. If they were. theyd crack down on employers. Or at least make an effort to resolve differences with their colleagues in the Senate. If you define progress by anything other than fearmongering rhetoric. then this Congress is no more likely to secure the border than the Capitol Police are to stop an armed intruder. Because this Republican Congress long ago abandoned the idea of purposeful goveming. they slapped together these three immigration bills without concern for constitutionality or feasibility. No bad idea from a backbench rightwinger was too extreme. If these bills became law: Immigrants could be indefinitely detained at the whim of the Department of Homeland Security. Hey. it hasnt worked at Guantanamo. but why not try it on U.S. soil? The Attorney General could order immediate deportation of anyone deemed to be a member of a designated street gang. regardless of whether members had committed crimes. In other words. hanging around the wrong crowd. at least in the eyes of Alberto Gonzales. would be a deportable offense. Federal courts hearing immigration cases would be instructed that any relief granted to immigrants would have to be the \"minimum necessary\" and \"least intrusive\" to govemment agencies. So if the government wrongly jailed you for 20 years. you might get released. but dont expect any compensation for the loss of your livelihood.

The Border Tunnel Prevention Act is one positive step toward preventing criminals from entering our country unnoticed and illegally. This law creates new penalties for anyone using a tunnel to smuggle people. drugs or weapons into the United States. This effort is another tool for law enforcement and border security to begin to address illegal immigration and to aid in their efforts to keep our communities safe. I have heard numerous times from Minnesota law enforcement agents about illegal drugs that pass through the Twin Cities on a regular basis. much of it originating south of the border and intended for the U.S. or Canada. While our law enforcement has made progress in shutting down meth production in the U.S.. 80 percent of this dangerous drug comes from \"superlabs\" in Mexico. No legislation can entirely stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country. but this bill will add increased provisions to punish those who smuggle drugs into the U.S. Madam Speaker.

But our hearings were not condemned by the media. Far from it. because at our hearings we heard from the border agents. the sheriffs. the investigators. the men and women whose task it is to enforce border security. They called for the border fence that the Democrats opposed. Now the Democrats are referring to their motion to recommit our bill. H.R. 4437. Well. their motion would have gutted this critical immigration enforcement bill. If the Democrat motion had passed. there would have been no provision to crack down on violent alien gang members. There would have been no provision to allow for the detention of dangerous aliens. There would be no provision to crack down on employees hiring those here illegally. Their motion to recommit was meaningless and ineffectual. Only the Appropriations Committee can actually allocate funds. The Democrats know this. and they know that our appropriators over this year and next have increased Border Patrol strength by 2.700 agents. This is the maximum number of new agents who can realistically be recruited and adequately trained in that time span. But in the meantime we have the question of the broader border security issue of whether you are going to erect that fence. whether you are going to allow State and local law enforcement to assist our ICE agents. whether or not you are going to crack down on criminal gangs. Those are the provisions that we are bringing up today and passing over into the Senate. Our hope is that the Senate leadership. Republican leadership. can get past the Democratic opposition this time and get past the argument that all we should do is a blanket amnesty. We tried a blanket amnesty in 1986. It didnt work. It did not work. And the concept that the answer to all of this is open borders and another blanket amnesty is simply wrong. It is a wrongheaded notion. I urge passage.",

Our contributions to the arts and humanities are the standard by which our history as a society will be measured. A strong public commitment to the arts and humanities. along with a dedication to freedom. is the hallmark of great civilizations. History has shown that religious and political freedoms go hand in hand with greater artistic and literary activity. and that the societies that flourish and have a lasting influence on humanity are those that encourage free expression in all of its forms. This is a lesson that resonates with people of every age. background. and belief. and one that we can guarantee our children learn. By sharing ideas and images from a diverse range of hack grounds and through many different media. the arts and humanities help to create a more informed citizenry. We are better prepared to meet the responsibilities of democracy. to ask ourselves the hard questions. to demand of our leaders the full answers. and to judge fairly the actual and potential endeavors of our country. 52. Pt. 7 8681 Our support for the arts and humanities also has a profound impact on our economy. In my Congressional District. there are close to 2.000 artsrelated businesses. providing more than 9.000 jobs. This creates a substantial economic impact. Nationally. the arts industry generates $134 billion in economic activity. sustaining over 4 million jobs. Even more significant is the return on the investment for the American taxpayer. While the Federal Government spends just over $250 million on the NEA and NEH annually. it collects over $10 billion in tax revenue related to the arts industry. Federal funding for the NEA and NEH is crucial to the arts community. helping leverage more state. local. and private funds. Clearly. the numbers show that investment in the arts is important not only to our national identity. but also to our national economy. Mr. Chairman. we must act decisively to commit ourselves to our national heritage and culture. by voting to increase funding for the NEA and NEH. I urge my colleagues to support creativity and reflection. to support our economy. and to support the continued growth and expression of democracy in its fullest form.",

As a scientist. I am often advocating for investments in math. science. and technology research. development. and education. These are worthwhile expenditures that contribute to innovation and economic growth. but our nation requires a parallel investment in the arts to retain the cultural and creative growth that ties our diverse society together. This modest increase in funding will build programs that use the strength of the arts and our Nations cultural life to enhance communities in every State and every county around America. The additional funds provided through this amendment would support the very successful Challenge America program. which brings the arts to rural communities and innercity neighborhoods whose limited resources dont always allow for community arts programs. In 2005. the Challenge America program provided grants to towns and cities in 99 percent of Congressional districts for jazz and blues festivals. showcases for regional musicians and artists. and publicprivate partnerships that bring the arts into local schools. Dozens of studies have demonstrated the significant positive effect of arts education on students academic performance. self esteem. and behavior. and the Challenge America grants are an excellent mechanism to bring the arts to students who can greatly benefit from that exposure. Similarly. the NEH serves to advance the nations scholarly and cultural life. The additional funding contained in this amendment would enable NEH to improve the quality of humanities education to Americas school children and college students. offer lifelong learning opportunities through a range of public programs. and support new projects that encourage Americans to discover their storied and inspiring national heritage. It is clear that increasing funding for the arts and humanities are among the best investments that we as a society can make. They help our children learn. They give the elderly sustenance. They power economic development. even in regions that are down and out. Will the projects that would be sponsored by this increase in funding help defend our country?

I wish this amendment asked for an even greater increase in arts funding. Its astounding that this year the President will spend $60 billion in Cold Warera defense programs. such as a missile defense system that doesnt defend against missiles. and yet each year we have to come to the floor to defend this minimal amount of spending. The amount we are asking for is little more than a fraction of one percent of the Federal budget. This is not controversial funding. The NEA and the NEH are two of the best investments this Nation makes. The NEA distributes grants in all 50 states. These grants fund theatres. orchestras. dance companies. and visual artists that move us. challenge the way we think. foster dialogue. and help us to understand one another. The NEH is the largest single funder of humanities programs in the country. NEH grants help museums. archives. libraries. universities. scholars and documentary filmmakers allow us to understand our rich history and cultural heritage. The costbenefit ratio of this funding is tremendous. Each year. the arts generate $134 billion in economic activity. arts organizations employ 4.85 million Americans. they generate $89.4 billion in household income. and lead to $24.4 billion in total tax revenues. Not only do the arts and humanities have a positive economic impact. but they strengthen and build communities. They help revitalize our nations cities. and provide venues for people from disparate communities to come together and share a common experience. Students who are exposed to the arts have higher test scoresin math and sciences as well as liberal artsand have better attendance at schools and increased selfdiscipline. Atrisk teens who participate in arts programs are half as likely to repeat their crimes. Mr. Speaker. every year. my friends from the other side of the aisle try to slash funding for the arts.

As you may know. just in the past week there have been a number of attacks resulting in three human fatalities. just in the State of Florida. Florida is not the only State that has to deal with this problem. Citizens across Alabama. Georgia. Louisiana. South Carolina. and Texas have all been victims of alligator attacks. often deadly. over the years. The number of alligator complaints received by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission continues to grow. Last year there were over 18.000 complaints alone. which resulted in the removal of over 7.000 alligators. Unfortunately. with three deaths in 1 week. current efforts are insufficient to prevent these attacks. I rise today to offer an amendment to add $500.000 to the monies available to the States to hire trappers and expand alligator trapping activities.

Last December all Great Lakes Collaboration members met and endorsed this process. But we must go further. We must waste no time in moving forward with tangible changes in practice and funding. The Great Lakes face a myriad of threats. from invasive species to mercury contamination to the effects of longterm pollutants which are awaiting cleanup. These same Great Lakes are also an invaluable resource for drinking water. recreation. and transportation purposes. And to protect them we must increase coordination and funding of Great Lakes programs. The Great Lakes Legacy Act provides an essential function: addressing sediment contamination in areas of concern in the Great Lakes. My district contains Waukegan Harbor. a contaminated area that. if properly cleaned. would increase the economic value of lakefront property by over $800 million.",

The Statue of Liberty was reopened to the public on August 3. 2004. but the crown was not opened at that time. and let me tell you why the crown was not opened to the public: safety and security. The statue has long been recognized by the intelligence community as one of the highest profile targets for terrorists. After the events of 9/11. the Department of the Interior made the decision to close the statue to assess its vulnerability to attack. The Interior Department asked the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and other recognized experts to conduct bomb blast and other security analyses on the statue. Based on the results. the Park Service spent nearly $20 million on numerous safety and security improvements. They did open the statue. except for the crown. The decision was made that the visitors could not be properly protected on the narrow spiral staircase in the crown. the thinnest part of the statue. and the Department of the Interior made the decision not to open that section.

Rosa Parks. who is better known as the \"mother of the civil rights movement\" changed the course of American history by refusing in 1955 to give up her seat on a bus for a white passenger. Born Rosa Louise McCauley on February 4. 1913. she married Raymond Parks in 1932. By the early 1950s. Rosa Parks and her now deceased husband were longtime activists in Montgomery. Alabamas chapter of the NAACP. It is important to know the history of Parks. who worked as a seamstress at a local department store. and on her way home from work one day. she engaged in a simple gesture of defiance that galvanized the civil rights movement. On December 1. 1955. Parks challenged the Souths Jim Crow lawsand Montgomerys segregated bus seating policyby refusing to give her seat up. The bus driver had her arrested. She was tried and convicted of violating a local ordinance. Her act sparked a citywide boycott of the bus system by African Americans that lasted more than a year. The boycott raised an unknown clergyman named Martin Luther King. Jr.. to national prominence and resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation on city buses. Over the next four decades. she made her fellow Americans aware of the history of the civil rights struggle. This pioneer in the struggle for racial equality was planted firm in her faith of it one day being a place where all Americans could one day sit on the bus and have the same right as everyone else to enjoy their ride after a long days work. Her example of what she stood for remains an inspiration to not only me but to freedomloving people everywhere. Parks was undoubtedly one of the most important citizens of the 20th century. Every American owes their gratitude of freedom to her. Mr. Speaker. I ask that you rise with me today to honor and pay respects to an African American woman who broke down boundaries and knocked down doors.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. This year. 21 miners have lost their lives in mining accidents. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families. Today. we honor the 16 men who have died in West Virginias coal mines and the lone survivor of the Sago mine accident. We also recognize members of the mine rescue teams who put their own lives on the line to try to save their fellow miners. On January 2. 2006. the Nation watched. waited. hoped and prayed that 13 men trapped in the Sago mine would return to the surface alive. Then the Nation was stunned when we learned that 12 men had died. Only one survivor. Randal MeCloy. returned to the surface alive. Two more miners were lost at the Alma mine. despite the courageous efforts of the mine rescue teams. And just last week. two more miners died in Boone County. The first 6 weeks of 2006 have seen an unprecedented loss of life in West Virginias recent mining history. Working with the State of West Virginia. the Mine Safety and Health Administration has begun investigations into these accidents. The agency also has announced an internal review to ensure that all the regulations and procedures under the Mine Safety and Health Act were followed. In response to concern about MSHAs Freedom of Information Act policy. Chairmen BOEHNER and NORWOOD and Representative CAPITO wrote to Secretary of Labor Chao to secure changes that would provide for greater disclosure of important information. Prior to this action. inspectors notes and other information related to MSHA citations would not have been disclosed until a case exhausted all appeals. This important change will allow miners and their families better and quicker access to information regarding citations and inspectors notes. Only a thorough investigation will pinpoint the cause of these tragic events. Congress must ensure the investigation proceeds as efficiently as possible. and then consider any proposed changes to our Federal mine safety laws and regulations that will help ensure that tragedies of this kind do not happen again in the future. Mr. Speaker. along with the rest of the Nation. we extend our condolences to the impacted families in West Virginia. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Res. 331. a resolution honoring the 16 extraordinary miners who lost their lives in the recent West Virginia coal mine accidents and recognizing the courage of Randal McCloy who survived. Further. I join my colleagues in extending our condolences to the families of these miners. and recognize the brave efforts of the rescue crews and volunteers during this time. I represent southwestern and southern Illinois. a region with a rich coal mining history. Coal mining has played a significant role in transforming and developing the region since the mid1800s when substantial coal mining in Illinois began. In 2006. the coal industry continues to be a vital component of our economy. and one we are working to strengthen for the future. Improving mine safety standards is an important part of this process in Illinois. West Virginia. and other coal producing States. These unfortunate coal mining fatalities in West Virginia have highlighted the pressing need to revise the national coal mine health and safety s!andards to ensure miners are equipped with state o1 the art technologies and tracking devices. and sufficient emergency supplies of oxygen. I am pleased West Virginia legislators acted quickly to enact a state law requiring coal companies to give employees electronic tracking devices and to store oxygen supplies underground. Precautionary measures are needed to protect the health and safety of our coal miners and penalties for flagrant violations of the law and regulations must be enforced. To this end. I have joined my colleagues in the House as a cosponsor of H.R. 4695. the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006. Mr. Speaker. I know my colleagues join me in honoring the West Virginia coal miners for their courage and sacrifice and expressing our deepest condolences to their families.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. at the end of last year we came to the floor. as was pointed out. to vote on the tax reconciliation bill. That bill extended tax cuts that did not expire for years. and it ignored tax relief that was expiring within days. relief from the alternative minimum tax. or the AMT. Now. just this past Monday. the President released his annual budget. and it was. with apologies to Yogi Berra. deja vu all over again. He called on Congress to make permanent $1.4 trillion in tax cuts. Some of those do not expire for years to come. And he called on Congress to make permanent relief from the AMT only through fundamental reforms of the Tax Code. Unfortunately. his budget did not call for fundamental tax reform. So that is the naked tax increase that was alluded to. If it is not fixed. this creates 17 million new taxpayers. a tax on 17 million new people. If our friends on the other side of the aisle tell us. as they do often enough. that the budget is a document outlining the priorities of the President. then we can only deduct that paying down the debt is not a priority of this administration. that managing our money so that we no longer have to mortgage our future to countries like Japan and China is not a priority of this administration. and permanent AMT relief for working and middleclass families is just not a priority of this administration. Mr. Speaker. these are priorities for everyday Americans and for those of us on the Democratic side of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct which reflects the priorities of Americans and calls upon the conferees to provide immediate and fiscally responsible relief from the alternative minimum tax. which is going to tax 17 million new people.",

The gentleman from Napa Valley. in pleading for some of the richest Americans to get some relief from an alternative system of taxation they put in place when they were a majority and could have dealt with it. literally wants to take money from the 10 and 15 percent bracket. people who are trying to invest and grow a nest egg so that they can have a piece of America like the people in Napa Valley. The people in the 10 and 15 percent bracket for the first time actually can figure out a way to invest in America. to grow a nest egg. and to see the ability to have a better tomorrow. But they want to take the money from these people and ease taxes on those people in the upper tax brackets who have now triggered the alternative minimum tax. I said I am in favor of helping relieve the alternative minimum tax. but the plan we have proposed is not trading one for the other. It is not denying the 10 and 15 percent bracket a piece of America. We passed assistance to the alternative minimum tax. It was outside of tax reconciliation. What they want to do is shove that nest eggbuilding approach out of tax reconciliation and move the alternative minimum tax in its place. That is what we are opposed to. We are not opposed to assisting the alternative minimum tax. We are opposed to denying the 10 and 15 percent bracket a chance to invest in America at the lowest possible cost.

They are not supposed to be noticed. but those of us who happen to be frequent fliers are aware of their service. and they are ready and prepared on some of the more difficult flights that we have. coming to certain regions in the United States. I would only hope that as we debate this amendment in the midst of fees and expense that I know is borne by our airlines. that we think about the service of these men and women in particular that confront dangers on our behalf on the Nations airlines. So I would beg to differ with the gentlemans amendment because I stand in support of the air marshals. and I would hope that there could be some response to the cost. some way of adding or eliminating the burden that our airlines face. but I could not imagine us suffering the loss of these air marshals which we determined were important to us after 9/11. Even though we have given enhanced equipment on airlines. more training to pilots. we are attempting to train our airlines or flight stewards. and we are doing a better job. though it is not a requirement. I believe airlines are doing a better job of informing and training their flight stewards and flight attendants. but I still believe that our flights are better and safer for marshals existence.

Any further reduction could impact information sharing with State and local agencies conducting vulnerability assessments and construction and renovation of space for the directorate.

For instance. a cut to the Office of Interoperability and Communications can greatly impact the effectiveness of resources spent on first responder grants. In every war effort. it is easier to fund soldiers than science because what soldiers do is obvious. what science does is not. However. like the development of the tank in World War I and the development of the atomic bomb in World War II. science can profoundly influence the outcome. There is reason to believe that homeland security science can have a similar success on the war on terror. We cannot cut the Office of the Secretary. It is a tempting target. but it has already been hit by everybody in the room. Their office is only $133plus million. and significant reductions will negatively affect their operations.

I spoke earlier today on the floor of the House about the frustration Americans have with respect to the influx of illegal immigrants and immigration and. of course. I also offered to my colleagues that we must solve this problem in a bipartisan manner. In respecting that frustration. I am respectful of those who have taken up their own causes. One group happens to be the Minutemen. The Minuteman group has utilized their resources in Arizona and expect to move their operations to Texas. New Mexico and California. I would argue vigorously that these kinds of efforts can make a very difficult and unsuitable atmosphere for the border. Let me cite for you one of the individuals that is responsible for the organization Minutemen speaking about the issues. for example. in Texas: If the Minutemen were to come to Texas. there are serious logistical problems for patrols in Texas. Most of the land along the Texas border is privately owned and some of it is urbanized. unlike the open land the group monitored in Arizona. And the same reports of drug violence that have scared some tourists away from the south Texas region have become a concern for the Minutemen. \"The Texas border is pretty dangerous right now.\" Chris Simcox said. who heads the Minutemen. \"That wont scare the Arizonabased citizen patrols away.\" he said. \"but it does mean they will be more careful in planning their operations. Security becomes a serious issue because we are going to be annoying a lot of people.\" This amendment is simple. What it says is that we have to protect the Federal officers and other law enforcement officers that are entrusted with the responsibility of immigration control in the United States of America. That protection cannot give them the extra added burden using resources to try to protect those who are acting in an unauthorized way. This specifically states that we would not allow such",

Wisconsin has seen a net loss of more than 71.000 manufacturing jobs over the last five years. which is very troubling for a state with the second highest number of manufacturing employees per capita in the nation. Although the economy has improved significantly since mid2003. many of our lost manufacturing jobs have not been recovered. Congress must continue to work to help our manufacturers remain competitive in the global marketplace. Johnson Controls. Inc. (JCI). a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Milwaukee. Wisconsin. employs 2.500 workers in the state and thousands more throughout the country. As the worlds largest producer of automotive interiors. JCI works to develop and produce seating systems. instrument panels. door systems. overhead systems. and automotive electronics.

The microphones covered in this legislation are a key component of JCIs electronic telecommunications systems. However. they are not produced domestically and JCI must import them subject to a 4.9 percent tariff rate. By temporarily eliminating this tariff. this bill will reduce JCIs production costs and help them remain competitive against international competition. In addition. this bill will benefit U.S. automotive manufacturers who rely on JCl for their telecommunications systems. consumers who will pay reduced prices for these products. and hardworking Americans who are employed in the manufacturing industry. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to pass this legislation and help U.S. manufacturing.",

Located in Palm Beach County. the Town of South Palm Beach is nestled in one of Floridas many barrier islands. Rich in natural beauty. South Palm Beach shares its eastern border with the Atlantic Ocean. and its westem border with the Florida Intracoastal Waterway. The towns colorful history dates back to 1948. when two Finnish brothers from New York. Amos and Anton Askila. settled in the area. Enamored with South Floridas beauty. the Askila brothers set out for Tallahassee in 1955 to obtain a charter for the town. At the time. there were only 6 full time residents. including the Askila brothers. Robert Coletti. James Sloan and Mr. and Mrs. George Woods. The Askila brothers successfully incorporated the town during their 1955 trip to Tal lahassee and. that same year. Mr. George Woods was elected as South Palm Beachs first mayor. Today. reflecting on 50 years of history since the towns incorporation. it is clear that future generations of South Floridians have much for which to be thankful. Over the years. South Palm Beachs residents have worked diligently to preserve its residential character. friendly atmosphere and overall high quality of life. I also know that South Palm Beachs nearly 3.000 residents are working hard every day to carry on this tradition. ensuring that South Palm Beach continues to serve as a model community for other towns throughout Florida.

The problem is it misses the point of what happens in the 45 days or. if the gentlewoman from California passes. in the 75 days. What happens then? I read with some alarm the \"Roll Call\" article of December 6. 2004. on this subject. and 1 will quote from that article: \"The country is going to be under martial law until we have elections anyway.\" That was actually said by the gentleman from Ohio . chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee. And I just must say. is the agenda martial law? Because that appears to be the case. and absent a constitutional amendment to allow for a temporary appointment. we will have martial law and the elimination of a Republic in this country.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman. the primary opposition to this legislation comes from people who have favored a constitutional amendment to provide for the appointment of substitute Representatives should there be a catastrophe that wipes out a significant part or all of the House of Representatives. I believe last year. the House of Representatives laid that proposition to rest. We did have a full debate on the floor of the constitutional amendment that both the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from California supported. It only got 63 votes. Twenty votes are necessary for the twothirds majority necessary to propose amendments to the Constitution on any subject. and I believe that the House of Representatives at that time clearly and emphatically spoke in favor of maintaining elections as the only way one could enter the House of Representatives. the peoples House. So now we hear that the 49 days that are proposed in this bill are too short to be able to organize a proper election in a time of crisis. I do not think that is correct. During the Second World War. Great Britain was under attack constantly by the German Air Force. and even during the war they were able to hold special elections to fill vacancies in the House of Commons within 42 days. Democracy prevailed because the people of Great Britain insisted that it do so. and those elections worked and those people who were elected entered the House of Commons with a mandate from the people. This bill will work just as well in a time of crisis as a way of repopulating the House. We are not going to have appointed Representatives. The constitutional amendment has been overwhelmingly rejected here. So the responsible thing to do is to speed up the special election process. particularly in those States like California where it takes forever to fill a vacancy so that the States can have full representation as quickly as possible. Pass the bill. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

In 1942. President Roosevelt established a presidential directive giving African Americans an opportunity to be recruited into the Marine Corps. These African Americans. from all states. were not sent to the traditional boot camps of Parris Island. South Carolina and San Diego. California. Instead. AfricanAmerican Marines were segregatedexperiencing basic training at Montford Pointa facility at Camp Lejeune. North Carolina. Approximately 20.000 AfricanAmerican Marines received basic training at Montford Point between 1942 and 1949. The initial intent was to discharge these AfricanAmerican Marines after the war. returning them to civilian life. Attitudes changed as the war progressed. Once given the chance to prove themselves. it became impossible to deny the fact that AfricanAmerican Marines were just as capable as all other Marines regardless of race. color. creed or national origin. In July of 1948 President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order #9981 negating segregation. In September 1949. Montford Marine Camp was deactivatedending seven years of segregation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong concern over Chinas proposed antisecession law that it plans to include in its March 2005 agenda of the National Peoples Congress. This antisecession law is highly provocative. and needlessly moves crossstrait relations away from dialogue and possibly towards open confrontation. I am particularly concerned about the laws assumption that China and Taiwan are now unified and how the law sets up a legal framework for retaliation if Taiwan declares independence. Under this proposed law. China could claim the legal right to push for unification of Taiwan by force. which is the worst possible scenario. The 23 million people of Taiwan are understandably very upset over this proposed law. As we all know. the people of Taiwan live in a fullfledged democracy and enjoy the highest standards of freedom and human rights. We remember a similar reaction and backlash by the citizens of Hong Kong when they learned about the enactment of the Article 23 antisedition laws. While claiming the theory of \"one country. two systems.\" it appears that Beijings implementation of its theory may result in the blocking of democratic reforms and the undermining of autonomous selfgovernance. Certainly any country has the right to enact their own domestic laws. but I do not feel that any country should use their domestic laws as justification to suppress or intimidate democracy abroad. While the President spoke very eloquently of promoting democracy and liberty abroad in his Inaugural Address. we must remember that our country still has a solemn duty to defend democracy and liberty. I hope the Chinese leaders will be wise to not adopt this antisecession law in March. I also urge the international community to join us to voice their disapproval of this provocative law.

Currently in the United States. approximately 3.000 Christian Iraqisabout 2.000 of whom are in the metropolitan Detroit areaare in jeopardy of being deported. These are persons with no criminal record who came to the United States seeking asylum during the regime of Saddam Hussein. Due to the long delays in the immigration system. however. their cases were not heard before April 30. 2003. when the United States declared victory in Iraq. When these individuals finally had their day in court. the immigration judge denied their application because the government in Iraq that persecuted these individuals was no longer in power. These Iraqi Christians had valid claims for asylum when the came here. they have been hardworking. law abiding residents over many years. and they have put down roots and raised families here. They should not be punished for the bureaucratic backlogs of the immigration judicial system. My amendment would protect persecuted religious minorities who fled Saddam Husseins oppressive government in Iraq and came to the United States with valid claims of asylum and for whom. despite the change in government regime. it is not safe to return to their homeland.

My amendment would make these individuals eligible for legal permanent residency status and would supersede all previous judicial action on their cases. I am pleased that we are able to provide relief to these individuals who deserve legal permanent residency on the merits of their cases but were unfairly denied it because of bureaucratic delays that were beyond their control.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring your attention to a very important issue relating to medical reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) created new reimbursement mechanisms for IVIG therapies. CMSs implementation of the MMA has resulted in reduced access to lifesaving therapies for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS potentially closed the door to medical treatment when they issued the CY 2007 proposed rules for the physician fee schedule and the hospital outpatient prospective payment system. which. if implemented. would effectively limit IVIG treatment by not properly reimbursing providers. IVIG is a vital medical service. It is a plasmaderived therapy tailored to the individuals diseases and treatment options to achieve optimal results. Nearly 10.000 Medicare beneficiaries are afflicted with primary immune deficiency (PID) which only responds to IVIG therapy. For many Americans there is no substitute for IVIG treatment. More to the point. this treatment allows individuals to carry on normal dailylite activities. PID requires IVIG therapy every 3 to 4 weeks for the duration of an individuals life. but without such treatment the individual not only imposes additional medical costs on an already overburdened system. they cease to be active members of our society. Such an outcome is simply not acceptable. IVIG therapy is costeffective and beneficial for the patient. As far as I am concerned. that should be enough to get CMS to rethink implementing any reimbursement change that has the potential to harm access and reduce medical outcomes. In May of this year. thirtyfive members of Congress. including myself. sent a letter to Secretary Leavitt of the Department of Health and Human Services expressing our concern over this matter and encouraged Secretary Leavitt to consider a payment adjustment. combined with product specific reimbursement. We also made clear that we would be open to any other mechanism he may have deemed suitable in order to resolve this patient access dilemma. Secretary Leavitts response was. quite simply. inadequate. He failed to address our specific concerns or pose alterative remedies that would allow patients continued access to IVIG treatment. I urge CMS to reconsider its actions in this case to ensure patient access to a necessary and legitimate medical treatment.",

The university now has more than 2.000 students. offers 34 bachelors degrees and 10 masters degrees. more than 30 buildings. and a passion for changing lives by education and teachings from the Word of God. Many things have changed in our world and in education over the past 50 years. To enable graduates to stay competitive in our everchanging economy. our higher education system must be a key source for Americas competitive advantage around the world. Lubbock Christian University is helping to make this idea a reality. Keeping Christian values at the forefront of their teachings will help to bring about great leaders for many years to come. I am proud to join the citizens of Lubbock in extending my appreciation for all the hard work of LCUs administration. faculty. staff. and past and current students.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 16 years ago. a bipartisan Congress took signiicant steps to break down the physical and societal barriers that for far too long kept disabled Americans from fully participating in all aspects of American life. Prior to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. commonly known as the ADA. disabled Americans were subjected to false stereotypes. experienced discrimination in almost all aspects of society. and were relegated to a form of second class citizenship. The ADA changed this by restoring the full meaning of equal protection under the law and all the promises that our Nation has to offer. Through the ADA and its broad protections from discrimination in employment. State and local government programs and services. places of public accommodation and services provided by private entities. transportation. and telecommunication services. disabled citizens have experienced increased opportunities. higher graduation rates. higher employment rates and lower rates of poverty. Because of this landmark civil rights law. disabled American citizens no longer live in isolation but live as independent. self sufficient members of our communities. However. beginning in 1999. through a trilogy of cases beginning with Sutton v. United Airlines. Inc.. the Supreme Court has slowly chipped away at the broad protections of the ADA and has created a new set of barriers for disabled Americans. An oversight hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution revealed that certain decisions of the Supreme Court have actually worked to exclude millions of disabled Americans from the ADAs protections. the very citizens that Congress expressly sought to include within the scope of the Act in 1990. The impact of these decisions is such that disabled Americans can be discriminated against by their employers because of their conditions. but they are not considered disabled enough by our Federal courts to invoke the protections of the ADA. This is unacceptable. The bipartisan legislation that I am introducing today will enable disabled Americans utilizing the ADA to focus on the discrimination that they have experienced rather than having to first prove that they fall within the scope of the ADAs protection. With this bill. the ADAs \"clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the basis of disability\" will be propery restored and the ADA can rightfully reclaim its place among our Nations civil rights laws.

As we consider the budget this week. let us keep a few facts in mind: First. our Nations debt is out of control. We are expected to run a $427 billion deficit in 2005. with more deficits projected well into the future. This is $600 billion if you count what is being stolen from Social Security trust funds. Second. we do not even have a firm grip on where our money is going. For example. at the Department of Defense. only 6 of 63 departments are able to produce a clean audit. That is less than 10 percent. Third. the Bush budget omits so many major expenses that the budget is virtually a sham. The administration has essentially cooked the books using Enronstyle accounting. So here we are trying to pass a budget that hides half our problems. Already we know that foreign holdings in the United States. as far as United States debt. are on the rise and that the trade deficit is totally out of control. Mr. Speaker.

As a strong and longterm supporter of the ShaysMeehan/McCainFeingold campaign reform legislation. I want to take this opportunity to explain my decision to vote against H.R. 513 today. On the surface. H.R. 513 appears to be simple. It would require \"527 groups.\" which represent individuals or groups that are not directly affiliated with political party organizations. to register and report with the Federal Election Commission in the same manner as political committees. I support that part of this bill. However. the Republican Leadership inserted a poison pill into the bill. In the dark of night. the Republicancontrolled House Rules Committee added an amendment to roll back current limits on Congressional campaign committee spending in supporting a candidate in a House general election. In 2006. Congressional committees are limited to spending a maximum of $79.200 in a Congressional race. This amount is set by law and adjusted for inflation. Under current law. Congressional campaign committees possess the authority to spend unlimited amounts on a campaign. Congressional committees must currently borrow and use the limits assigned by law to each partys national committee and each state party committee. The amended bill will lift current caps and upset the balance of spending. A second killer amendment eliminates Congressional campaign committee limits on party spending for Congressional candidates. This bill allows each party to accept transfers from other committees within the party structure when spending for a candidate. This change will enable the National Republican Congressional Committee to accept unlimited transfers from the Republican National Committee for use in spending on any Congressional campaign. It is not a coincidence that Republicans outspend Democrats 5:1. We have just seen the former Republican Majority Leader resign from Congress in disgrace.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am proud to join my colleagues in strong support of H.R. 513. the 527 Reform Act of 2006. H.R. 513 takes an important step in closing a \"softmoney\" loophole by requiring 527 groups to comply with the same federal campaign laws that political parties and political action committees must follow. In fact. the Federal Election Commission should have already done this. A federal district judge in Washington recently called for action. ruling that the Federal Election Commission had \"failed to present a reasoned explanation\" for not requiring 527 groups to register as political committees. H.R. 513 will close this FECcreated loophole that has allowed 527 groups. of both parties. to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in unlimited soft money to influence presidential and congressional elections without complying with campaign finance laws. During the last election cycle. 527 groups raised $426 million. Likewise. much of the soft money came from a relatively small number of very wealthy individuals. According to campaign finance scholar Anthony Corrado. just 25 individuals accounted for $146 million raised by Democratic and Republican 527 groups that spent money to influence the 2004 federal elections. And. we are already seeing an increase in the rate at which 527s are raising money this election cycle. If the primary role of 527 groups is to influence federal elections. which it clearly is. they must play by the same set of rules that apply to other political groups whose purpose is to spend money to influence federal elections. There should be no exception. At a time when the public is calling for transparency and accountability. no longer can we tolerate a loophole that allows this type of money from the wealthy few to unfairly influence the political process. It you voted for the ShaysMeehan/McCalnFeingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform bill in 2002and 240 of us didit would be wholly out of step to not support H.R. 513. I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 513.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in 2002. after six years of debate. Congress passed the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. better known as the McCainFeingold bill. Supporters of the bill claimed it would rectify the perception that there is too much money in politics. and that tightening reporting requirements would create full transparency in donor information. But while their intentions were noble. 4 years later politics is more awash in money than ever before. only thanks to McCainFeingold. we now know less about where its coming from. According to the bills proponents. the crown jewel of McCainFeingold was a ban on large. unregulated contributions to political parties. known as \"soft money.\" In theory. this prohibition was supposed to prevent billionaires from donating enormous and largely unreported sums of cash to influence federal elections. In reality. it spawned a new. unaccountable funnel for millionaire money527s. Although 527s can run political ads. mobilize voters. donate to Federal campaigns through an affiliated PAC. and pertorm virtually every other function of a political party. 527sunlike candidate campaigns. political parties. and political action committeesare not regulated by the Federal Elections Commission. Nor are 527s accountable to voters. 527s have carried their message into the homes of millions of Americans without having to adhere to the numerous regulations governing political parties and campaigns. The bill before us todaythe 527 Reform Actwill close this loophole in McCainFeingold. preventing 527s from having an unfair financial advantage over political parties and individual candidates. At bottom. this is simply a matter of fairness: everyone who seeks to influence a federal election should be playing by the same rules. Mr. Speaker. when we passed the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. the other side said millionaires were playing too big of a role in federal elections. If they truly believe that. I challenge them to support this legislation and restore fairness to campaign finance laws.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to the socalled 527 Reform Act of 2005 . This legislation singles out 527 organizations in an effort to undermine their fundraising and is a direct assault on tree speech. This legislation would change the Federal Election Campaign Act o 1971 (FECA) to add 527 organizations in the definition of political committee. If enacted. this bill would suppress free speech and obstruct the efforts of grassroots organizations to encourage voter participation while doing nothing to address the culture ot corruption in Congress. I support the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002. which established balanced and effective strategies to achieve fairer elections. H.R. 513 is an unbalanced measure that favors corporate trade associations over independent advocates. For example. the bill would provide an unfair advantage to corporate interests by allowing them to continue spending unlimited and undisclosed dollars for political purposes while subjecting independent organizations. like citizens joining together to promote voter registration. to contribution limits and source restrictions. H.R. 513 also removes all limits on national and state party spending for Congressional candidates in primary or general elections. This section of the bill is an unmasked attack on BCRA and clear evidence of the majority partys true intentions in advancing H.R. 513. The goal is not reform. but partisan advantage in political fundraising. If we are serious about reform. there are several Democratic proposals that have been put forward to address the real problems facing this Congress. We should be reforming the Rules of the House in order to provide Members adequate time to review legislation before a vote. We should also be addressing the practice of travel on corporate jets and disclosure of tundraising by lobbyists. Unfortunately. the Republicans will not allow a real. comprehensive debate on this critical issue. H.R. 513 is the majority partys cynical and underwhelming response and is clearly meant to distract attention from the real problems of corruption. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and vote for a real package of reformschanges that Congress needs and that Americans expect.",

America and the world were introduced to a new generation of heroes and a new era of human imagination. The moment the Space Shuttle Columbia first launched into lowEarth orbit. every other mode of space transportation was rendered obsolete. The shuttle was then. and remains today. the most dependable and most technologically advanced spacecraft in the world. In the last quarter century. the shuttle has become a global icon of American ingenuity and American courage. Since Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen took the shuttles maiden voyage. dozens of men and women. scientists. soldiers and school teachers have followed them in NASAs mission to conquer the unknown. And in that time. 14 shuttle astronauts have been lost in the pursuit of that noble mission. men and women whose names we remember and whose valor we can never forget. Where I come from. the space shuttle is more than a symbol. It is part of our community. The shuttles managers. engineers. astronauts. contractors and designers have long called the Houston region their home. They are the people who have made our Johnson Space Centel Americas laboratory of the impossible.\" and for 25 years have stretched both the technological capacity and the collective imagination of the American people. It is an honor to represent such heroes in this House and it is an honor to cast my vote in favor of this resolution congratulating NASA and Americas space community for 25 years of making history and fulfilling dreams.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I rise in support of this resolution honoring the Space Shuttle program at NASA on the anniversary of its test flight. Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen flew Space Shuttle Columbia on its first lowearth orbit flight for 3 days. Such a feat was made possible by the worldclass workers and supporters of NASA. who are also commended in this resolution. The Space Shuttle was remarkable in part because it was the first spacecraft to launch with wings. using solid rocket boosters. It was also the first reentry spacecraft to land on a conventional runway. Notice that both these firsts are visual. if not literal. reminders of the strength of the agency itself: NASA excels in both spaceflight and flight in the atmosphere. or aeronautics. It is proof of the value of having an agency that is strong in both fields. It is unfortunate. then. that the Vision for Space Exploration. which has the potential to build on the Shuttle successes. has not been adequately funded. Instead. the proposed budget pits the Vision against aeronautics in an internal battle for insufficient funding. In fact. ever since the Vision for Space Exploration was released. there has not been adequate funding for it in the Administrations budget. The result is that other critical NASA programs lose money to the Vision as NASA is forced to pick one important program over another. For example. in FY06. there was a proposed cut in aeronautics of roughly $60 million. In FY07. that number is $179 million. despite Congress clear support in both the appropriations and authorization bills last year. That is a 20 percent cut in 1 year. This resolution before us today will send a message that Congress is proud of what NASA has accomplished.. I urge my colleagues to prove their reverence by working to fund it.",

What does it mean today and at the time it was adopted? It was never. ever. ever. ever intended or imagined that during the War of 1812. if British soldiers were captured burning the Capitol of the United Statesas they didthat they would have been given habeas corpus rights. It was never thought to be. Habeas corpus was applied to citizens. really. at that time. I believe that is so plain as to be without dispute. So to say: Habeas corpus. what does it mean? What did those words mean when the people ratified it? They did not intend to provide it to those who were attacking the United States of America. We provide special protections for prisoners of war who lawfully conduct a war that might be against the United States. We give them great protections.

We passed a law in this Congress to appease the left in America. the critics of our efforts against communism. primarily. And we have put a wall between the CIA and FBI. So that was politically good. Everybody must have been happy about that. I was not in the Senate then. Then they complained that the CIA was out talking with people who had criminal records who may have been involved in violence. and this was somehow making our CIA complicitous in dealing with dangerous people. and we banned that.

This is what is happening to the troops defending America by the people who are incarcerated. determined by our military to be an enemy combatant. A Canadian detainee. who threw a grenade that killed an Army medic in a firefight and who comes from a family with longstanding alQaida ties. moved for a preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation of him or engaging in cruel. inhuman or degrading treatment. In other words. he was going to ask the judge to take over running the jail and his interrogation. A Kuwaiti detainee sought a court order that would provide dictionaries in contravention of Gitmo force protection policy and that their counsel have highspeed Internet access. Another one applied for a motion that would allow them to change the base security procedures to allow speedy mail delivery medical treatment. He sought an order transferring him to the least onerous condition at Gitmo. He asked the court to allow him to keep any books and reading materials sent to him and report to the court over his opportunities for exercise. communication. recreation and worship.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. President. I want to point out why this is so necessary and so essential. In reviewing the underlying legislation. if you look under the provisions dealing with definitions on page 70 and 71. and then read on. you will find that it is difficult to read that without having a sense of the kind of vagueness which I think surrounds prohibited interrogation techniques. It talks about substantial risks and extreme physical pain. But the statute does not have specifics to define the areas which are prohibited. The techniques in my amendment are the same ones the Department of the Army and. to my best knowledge. our colleague and friend from Arizona has identified. Voting for my amendment would provide those specifics. The President has asked for specificity. but he has refused to say whether Common Article 3 would prohibit these kinds of acts. That has left the world doubting our commitment to Common Article 3 and has endangered our people around the globethose who are working for the United States in the war on terror. The administrations obfuscation comes at a great risk. This amendment provides the clarity and sends a message to the world that 52. Pt. 15 20299 these techniques are prohibited. They are prohibited from our military bringing them to bear on any combatants. We interpret the legislation so that any country in the world that has signed on to the Geneva Conventions. any of those countries that are going to practice activities prohibited by the field manual. that I consider to be torture. are going to be held by the United States interrogation committing a war crime. This is important. It is essential. It is necessary. The general concept was improved without objection a number of years ago in the wake of the Vietnam situation. regarding the definition of war crimes. We ought to restate and recommit ourselves to protecting Americans involved in the war on terror and ensure they will not be subject to these activities. At the present time. without this amendment. it will be left open. If we accept this amendment. it would make it clear it is prohibited. That is what we should do.

Federal wildland firefighters are classified as either general schedule or wagegrade employees of the Federal Government. However. many of them are placed in the occupational series called forestry technicians. range technicians. and biological science technicians that do not reference their firefighting duties. These current classifications do not accurately represent the work performed by these wildland firefighters. H.R. 5697 would correct that by redesignating forest and range technicians as Federal wildland firefighters. This bill changes the name but not the pay of those currently called wildland firefighters or technicians. H.R. 5697 is supported by the FWFSA. and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Madam Speaker.

He is a dedicated and hardworking public servant whose leadership as Chairman of the Financial Services Committee has been exemplary. Under Chairman OXLEYs leadership. the Financial Services Committee enjoyed an unprecedented level of collegiality and comity that permitted us all to work together and get things done. Chairman OXLEY has a series of legislative successes few others can rival. When investor confidence was at a low. Chairman OXLEY restored confidence in our financial markets by authoring the landmark SarbanesOxley Act. This legislation established tough new standards to ensure corporate accountability to all American shareholders. In addition Chairman OXLEY was responsible for the passage of The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. or FACT Act. which gave consumers new identity theft protections and also improved credit report accuracy. Chairman OXLEY also spearheaded efforts to reform our nations deposit insurance system and modemize our check clearing process which brought our antiquated systems into the 21st century. These achievements will have a positive impact on our financial services system for generations to come. Aside from his leadership in the House. MIKE OXLEY has been a true mentor and friend. Fortunately. this is not a retirement for MIKE OXLEY but a beginning of a new chapter in his career. I look forward to working with him in whatever his future endeavors may be. Although I am losing a colleague and fellow Member. Linda and I look forward to many years of continued friendship with MIKE and his wife Pat.",

I really didnt know MIKE. but I had heard about his prowess on the basketball court and on the golf course. But. one of the things that I have come to appreciate over the years has been the depth of knowledge and experience he has in the business and financial services sector. It is because of this that MIKE has eamed the respect of financial leaders in the United States and worldwide. MIKE is leaving us with a legacy that includes his work on the landmark SarbanesOxley bill to bring more accountability and responsibility to the corporate world. In the weeks following the 9/11 attacks. he led the swift response to target terrorist financing by working to pass a new money laundering statute. I think its also important to mention that MIKEs leadership in shaping policy over the years has reached beyond the corporate world. He has also made a significant difference in promoting personal savings and investments at the individual level. Prior to redistricting. I used to represent two counties that are now in MIKEs district. While I was disappointed to lose Champaign and Logan Counties. it has given us an opportunity to work together on issues important to communities in those counties. We also worked together during the most recent Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round on behalf of the Ohio National Guard bases located in Mansfield and Springfield. MIKE and I have also had some fun over the years. In a previous campaign. he has been kidding me about my campaign radio ads. He says they made him gag because they were a bit too warm and fuzzy for his taste. but I tell him that they worked because he remembered them verbatim. But seriously. we are going to miss MIKE as a friend and as a leader on business and financial issues. He and his team. including his Chief of Staff Jim Conzelman. and his longtime scheduler. Debbi Deimling. will also be greatly missed. MIKE. I wish you and your wife. Pat. and Elvis all of the best as you begin this new chapter in your lives. And maybe someday.

MIKE OXLEY has spent every day of his Congressional career spreading that hope. As Chairman of the Financial Services Committee for the last 6 years. MIKE saw our economy through some of its toughest tests. It is a testament not only to the resilience of our economy. but to the leadership provided by Chairman OXLEY that our economy and our financial sector have not only endured. but prospered. Ox has been our captain and our coach. He stuck firm to his core beliefs. while never sacrificing civility.

Chairman OXLEY is also a tireless advocate of the military and especially the Joint Systems Manufacturing CenterLima. formerly known as the Lima Army Tank Plant. The Joint Systems Manufacturing CenterLima traces its history back to WWII when it prepared and processed more than 100.000 combat vehicles. The plant today is the sole producer of the M1 Abrams tank. Chairman OXLEY worked with the Department of Defense over the years to encourage the utilization of the workforce and available space at the facility. Through his eflorts. the plant has grown beyond its original mission. providing a wide variety of cuttingedge military vehicles for the Army. Navy and Marine Corps. Most recently. Rep. OXLEY was successful in working with Task Force LIMA during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure to ensure the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center remained a strong and continued asset for the Nation. the State of Ohio and the greater Lima community. Chairman OXLEY was also able to restore funding for the modemization of the M1 tank. further ensuring our men and women in uniform remain the best equipped fighting force in the world. Chairman OXLEY is a distinguished member of the Ohio Delegation and of this House. He has made his mark on this Nation not only through his ardent support of the financial service industry. but also his unwavering support of the military.

LANE is retiring at the end of this Congress. and the House of Representatives will miss his leadership and untiring support of our nations veterans. LANE has devoted most of his entire professional life to service to the United States of America. He grew up in the heart of the district he represents. entering the Marines out of high school and serving in Vietnam. When he returned. he went to college and earned his law degree at Georgetown. and was elected to Congress in 1982. Since then. he has made a tremendous impact on issues of national importance. such as agent orange compensation for affected veterans. investigating Gulf War illness. and the effort to ban land mines. While never seeking the spotlight. our veterans. military retirees and active duty service personnel know they have not had a greater advocate in Congress than LANE EVANS. LANE was awarded the Vietnam Veterans of Americas first annual Presidents Award for Outstanding Achievement in 1990 and he received the AMVETs Silver Helmet Award in 1994. known as the \"Oscar\" of veterans honors. At the same time. LANE has always defended the rights of working men and women. protecting the ability to collectively bargain while opposing unfair trade deals that have sent good paying jobs overseas. He has been a leader on environmental issues and a friend of the family farmer. Above all. LANE has been a steady presence for the issues he believes in and the constituents he represents. Over the last several years. LANE also gained prominence for his ongoing battle with Parkinsons disease. The dignity with which he has faced this disease has inspired many. and helped educate the public about the disease. Not many people know how painful the disease can be. and you would never know it from LANE. as he has faced this ordeal with the same courage and determination he went to war and served in Congress.

What this bill simply does is guarantee benefits in the law for people who were born before 1950. It does not set up any kind of personal account system. It does not do all of the things that the Senator from Montana said. The Senator from South Carolina will talk about his Stop the Raid bill. which simply takes money out of the surplus and puts it into accounts for holders to make sure that that money is spent on Social Security benefits but no administrative costs. All the things the Senator from Montana talked about do not apply to either one of our bills. I understand there may be an objection. but I would caution the Senator from Montana that the objection cannot be under those terms because the objections that the Senator from Montana cited are not in either one of the bills. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.",

It comes into the Social Security system. It is credited to a trust fund. Then it is spent either on Social Security benefits or spent on other things. We have made Americans believe we are saving that money for them. but it is all passing through. The only thing that is in the Social Security trust fund is IOUs. Our President. who has been a leader on this issue. actually went and opened the file cabinet where these IOUs are. The problem. Senator. as you know. is we cannot pay future benefits from IOUs. But we can from real money if we start saving it. There is nothing risky about saving this money in Treasury notes so it cannot be spent on other things. But you asked an important question. Right now. the Government owns the Social Security benefit and politicians control it. If we start saving Social Security in personal accountswe are not talking about taking it out of the Social Security system. It is still just as much a part of the Social Security system as what we have today. only it is real money and people own it. which means they have a legal right to it. which they do not today.

I will use different words than the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee. the Senator from Pennsylvania. My words are as follows: This legislation is a sham. sham. Social Security benefits are guaranteed today in the United States Code. the law of the land. To meet that legal commitment. we are saving enough in Social Security to pay full benefits for a long time into the future. The only threat to that guarantee is posed by Republicans who want to undermine Social Security. slash benefits. and privatize the program. I object to S. 1750. I reserve my right to object to S. 1302 as follows: Mr. President. I heard my friend. the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. talk about raiding the Social Security trust funds. This message should be delivered at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue. During the Clinton years. remember. we werent doing that. We werent using the Social Security surplus to mask the deficit. So he should direct those remarks to this administration. Do not be fooled. This is simply another bill to privatize Social Security. The American people have already rejected this tired approach. and for very good reason. Just like President Bushs privatization plan. the DeMint bill would require deep cuts in benefits and a massive increase in debt. Under the bill. those who divert funds into privatized accounts would have their benefits cut automatically through a privatization taxeven if the value of their account has collapsed. The bill would also require $1.7 billion in additional borrowing over the next 20 years. The bill would do nothing to strengthen Social Securityquite the contraryand It certainly wouldnt extend the programs solvency. In fact. diverting money from the trust fund accelerates insolvency and makes matters worse. Despite the claims of its proponents. this bill itself amounts to a massive raid on Social Security and would cut the funds available to pay guaranteed benefits. Therefore. I object.",

I am afraid that it may always be so. But no one should hold Amtraks. president accountable entirely for this fact. Congress and the administration are also accountable.

I have known many of Amtraks presidents over the years and in my judgment. David Gunn was one of the most capable. Not only did he hold an impressive and lengthy career in the rail industry prior to coming out of retirement to take the Amtrak job. I found him to be a man of integrity. When he testified before hearings I chaired in the Senate Commerce Committee. Mr. Gunn didnt mince words. When I first asked him about the socalled \"glidepath to selfsufficiency\" which his predecessor continually touted. David Gunn didnt hesitate to Inform the committee that it was a sham. Mr. Gunn and I didnt always see eyetoeye. Indeed. I disagreed strongly with his unyielding views about the continuation of Amtraks long distance trains.

No congressional duty is more profound than ensuring and protecting the voting rights of all Americans. As Members of this House. we cannot. we must not. be divided or indifferent in reaffirming Americas promise that everyone is created equal. The vote is sacred in this country. Throughout our history. Americans have given their lives for freedom and the right to elect their leaders. from Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. to Seneca Falls in New York. to Selma and Montgomery in Alabama. Americans demand the highest standards. the highest confidence. the highest protection in their right to participate in the democratic process. The fact remains that not too long ago many Americans were denied the right to vote based on their sex or their skin color and in all honesty. many still battle the remnants of this discrimination today. It has been more than 40 years since President Lyndon Johnson called upon Congress to \"extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land\" and pass the Voting Rights Act eliminating illegal barriers to the right to vote. Since that time. the face and even the language of the American voter may have changed. but our governments commitment to protect the integrity of every vote has not. So today. I ask my Republican colleagues to put aside their partisanship and petty political gamesmanship and join me in protecting the most fundamental right of the American people. who are the rightful owners of this American government. I urge the Members of this House to reaffirm our commitment to protect democracy and support the clean final passage of H.R. 9.",

I want to thank the Speaker and Majority Leader for their willingness to go forward with this debate prior to our upcoming recess. The 1965 Voting Rights Act changed America. It created the opportunity for minority citizens to fully participate in Democracy. Prior to the enactment and enforcement of the Act. black citizens in the South were disenfranchised primarily because of the Uteracy Tests and because of the design of election systems that submerged concentrations of black voters into large. majoritywhite election districts. The result was that AfricanAmerican communities could not elect candidates of their choice to office. Why? It was because black voters did not comprise sufficient numbers within the district and white voters refused to vote for candidates who were the choice of the minority community. And so. the votes of black citizens were diluted which is a clear violation of the principal of oneperson. onevote. The Voting Rights Act permits minority citizens to bring Federal lawsuits when they feel their vote is being diluted. Hundreds of these lawsuits have been successfully litigated in the Federal courts. In my prior life I was a Voting Rights attomey in North Carolina. As a result of court ordered remedies. local jurisdictions have been required to create election districts that do not dilute minority voting strength. The result has been absolutely incredible. When I was in law school 32 years ago. there were virtually no black elected officials in my congressional district. Today. I count 302. The Voting Rights Act also requires some jurisdictions to obtain Department of Justice preclearance to any change in election procedure. This. at first blush. may appear to be unfair to those jurisdictions. But the jurisdictions that are covered have a significant history of vote dilution and this requirement of preclearance simply assures that the jurisdiction does not. intentionally or unintentionally. make changes in their election procedures that will discriminate. This is called section 5. Section 5 has prevented many. many election changes that would have disenfranchised minority voters. It serves a useful purpose and should be extended.",

For years after the Civil War. many Americans were denied this fundamental right of citizenship. Horrible acts of violence and discrimination. including poll taxes. literacy tests. and grandfather clauses. were used to deny AfricanAmerican citizens the right to vote. especially in the South. During the 1960s. many brave men and women fought against bigotry and injustice to secure this most basic right for all Americans. The Voting Rights Act. VRA. the \"crown jewel\" of our civil rights statutes. was born out of their courage. struggle. and sacrifice. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law on August 6. 1965. It provided protection to minority communities. and prohibited any voting practice that would abridge the right to vote on the basis of race. Any \"test or device\" for registering or voting was forbidden. thereby abolishing poll taxes and literacy tests. Although the Voting Rights Act is a permanent Federal law. it contains some temporary provisions. including the \"preclearance\" and the bilingual provisions. The \"preclearance\" provisions were enacted as temporary legislation in 1965. Sections four and five address \"preclearance\" and are only applicable in certain parts of the country. These provisions were originally added to help bolster the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act. The VRA required State and local political jurisdictions with a documented history of discrimination to submit any proposed changes to their voting laws to the U.S. Attorney General or to Federal judges for \"preclearance\" before the changes could take effect. This process ensured that the Federal Government had the ability to prevent discriminatory voting laws before they were implemented. For example. States must receive approval before changing the closing time of polling places. Congress renewed these provisions in 1970. 1975. and 1982. The process of \"preclearance\" provision continues to protect voters today.",

And it those devices did not work. intimidation. threats. and even violence were used to keep minorities from going to the polls. Mr. Chairman. many of those nasty devices were wiped away when the Congress passed President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act.

Obstacles to voting. borne of racism. had become accepted practice in many States. Many of these obstacles were written directly into State constitutions. These deterrents. including literacy tests and poll taxes. were designed to exclude and restrict nonwhite voters. As we quickly approach the expiration of provisions of the Voting Rights Act. we must stop and take a hard look at voting rights in America. Although the taxes and tests are now a memory. remnants of the prejudice and fear that conceived of them remain. In the many hearings held by the Judiciary Committee examining the expiring provisions. the committee found numerous recent incidents in which objections were raised to changes in voting law. One of the nine States subject to the provisions of section 5. provisions that require preclearance of changes to voting law by the Department of Justice. is Georgia. Since 2002. four objections have been raised against proposed changes to laws in that State. These four objections stopped discriminatory changes in that State. The long lines and intimidation tactics used in my home State of Ohio in 2004 are proof that this reauthorization will not. in and of itself. solve our Nations need for voting reform. But it is a strong step in the right direction. The Voting Rights Act is still needed in America.

There has been great progress made since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6. 1965. But. so much more must be done. There are still many places in our country where Americans experience discrimination when they go to the polls. In order for the United States to truly be the greatest nation ever known. we must ensure that when citizens choose to go to the polls. they do not face obstacles created to disenfranchise them. Our Nations history is replete with examples of peoples right to vote being impeded. Furthermore. unconscionable violence and discriminatory obstacles such as poll taxes. literacy tests and grandfather clauses were used to deny African American citizens the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act provided extensive protection to minority communities by prohibiting any voting practice that would abridge the right to vote on the basis of race. In 1975. the Voting Rights Act was expanded to protect the voting rights of other minority voterssuch as Latinos. Native Americans. Asian Americans and Alaskan Nativesby requiring language assistance at the polls. From California to Texas to my home State of New York. minority voters have a greater voice in elections due to the Voting Rights Act. In fact. my home State of New York is directly affected by two important sections of the Voting Rights Act. Voters in the majority of districts in New York State are provided with important language materials to assist them in the voting process if English is not their native language. In addition. voters are also protected by having any new State voting rules and regulations approved by the Federal Government before they can be enacted. Extending the Voting Rights Act is essential to protecting the voting rights of New Yorkers as well as voters throughout the country. The Voting Rights Act is one of the most etfective civil rights laws ever enacted. Reauthorizing the Act is vital to ensure that the progress made. is preserved.",

The 1965 VRA successfully protected minority voters from disentranchisement and strengthened our democracy. I support that law and realize its valuable contributions to our society. Every citizen of this great Nation. regardless of race. should have the opportunity to cast their vote without fear of threats or discrimination. The VRA was a good idea and necessary in 1965. however. times have changed drastically since it was originally enacted more than 40 years ago. During the debate. a good friend of mine. Rep. ROSCOE BARTLETT of Maryland. made the comment: \"When you get sick. you go to the doctor and you get a prescription. Once you get well you stop taking the medicine.\" The provisions of the Voting Rights Act we voted on today do not recognize the accomplishments and progress made by covered States since the original VRA was enacted. Today. the majority of electoral discrimination cases come from outside the jurisdictions that are covered under Section 5. The Voting Rights Act up for debate today should have recognized the many changes and improvements in the American South. Under the bill that passed today. Texas remains one ot only eight States subject to this gross infringement on States rights. Today. Texas is one of the most diverse States in the entire Nation with thriving minority communities throughout the state. Not only do the reauthorized provisions in the VRA not take into account the progress that has been made. these provisions will be used as an unfunded mandate on southern States for the next 25 years.

I support the valuable history and importance of the Voting Rights Act that passed in 1965. but the discriminatory problems we face today were not addressed or considered in this reauthorization. I support most of the provisions and the spirit of the VRA. however. H.R. 9 does not advance our democracy and keeps in place the taints of previous generations that are no longer deserved.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 9. the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. The right to vote is the very foundation of our democracy. Yet millions of minority voters face discrimination when exercising this crucial right. As the most effective civil rights statute ever enacted. it is our duty to support the Voting Rights Act. H.R. 9 will better safeguard the rights ot minorities. Throughout our history. minority groups have struggled hard to achieve the right to vote. Key provisions of the Voting Rights Act will expire it this legislation is not passed. We need to ensure that these hardwon gains are not rolled back. The light against voter discrimination is far from over. H.R. 9 provides more accountability in the voting process so that the votes of American citizens who are not fluent in English will be propery counted. In addition. this will effectively combat discrimination against voting minority groups. As a representative of a territory where the native language of Chamorro is widely spoken. among other languages. I can personally attest to the importance of accommodating nonnative English speakers. H.R. 9 is a necessary reinforcement to the comerstone of our democracy. Minorities have a much greater voice today than decades before thanks to the Voting Rights Act. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

H.R. 1259. to authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress. collectively. to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their unique military record. which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 152. Pt. 3 The Tuskegee Airmen. formed from 1.000 pilots. bombardiers and navigators. overcame segregation and racial discrimination to become national heroes and advanced our society by desegregating our armed forces. While in combat. the Tuskegee Airmen completed 15.000 missions and never lost an Allied bomber under their escort. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first people of color in U.S. military history to see air combat. This group of brave soldiers became one of the most respected Army Air Corp Fighter Groups of World War II. In joining the fight to save Europe and the world from a cruel and heinous regime. the Tuskegee Airmen fought for freedom that they could not enjoy in their own country. In taking to the air during the launch of military aviation. these brave men were also fighting a war against bigotry and racism at home. Thus. they deserve the kind of recognition that the Gold Medal will give them. The Tuskegee Airmen are now in their 80s. so we must pass this bill immediately to honor these WWII heroes so these medals will not be a posthumous honor.",

I hope Senators will come to the Senate today and use that time for their opening statements. This week will be quite busy as we consider the budget resolution each day and night as that clock ticks.

Needless to say. there is a lot of work to be done prior to the adjournment. We will stay in session as necessary to give the managers the best opportunity to complete our business.

On Wednesday of this week. we will have a joint meeting with the House to hear an address by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia. That address will begin at 2 p.m.. therefore.

I believe the way you reduce debt is to begin by reducing the deficit. which is what the budget does. But the presentation that this budget uniquely aggravates the debt is really not viable in the context of the solutions which are being offered by the other side because none of the solutions being offered by the other side would reduce the debt. either. They are basically offeringor at least they did in committeeamendments which increase spending and increase taxes. thus taking resources which logically the other side would want to use to reduce the debt but isnt. and spending the money. In the end. that doesnt reduce the debt at all. I didnt see in the markup at all any proposals that would reduce the debt coming from the other side. We look forward to them offering a budget which accomplishes that. I would be most interested in such a budget because I do think it is important we do that. We tried to do it in our bill by reducing the deficit in half over the next 4 years. which does take money and reduce the debt because any time you reduce the deficit. you reduce the debt.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senator from New Hampshire has very ably used the oldest debate tactic known to man. which is the straw man argument. He suggested I have said that the economy is terrible. Those are not my words. I have not described the economy as terrible. I have described the economy as not performing as well as it has in other recoveries since World War II. Let me repeat: Real median household Income has declined 4 straight years. That is not a sign of economic strength. that is a sign of economic weakness. The economic growth in this recovery has substantially lagged the economic growth we saw in the other nine recoveries since World War 1i. In the other recoveries since World War II. economic growth averaged 3.2 percent. In this recovery. it is averaging 2.8 percent. On business investment. this dotted line is the average of nine previous recessions. This recovery is the black line. It is 62 percent behind what we have seen in the other nine recoveries since World Wax II. That is also true of job creation. The red dotted line is job creation and the average of nine recessions since World War II. The black line is this recovery. 6.6 million private sector jobs behind. The most dramatic result is this: This is how our friends have propped up the economy. They have done it by running up the biggest debt in the history of America. Their proposal in this budget is to keep on doing it. more debt on top of debt that is already at record levels. When this President came in. at the end of his first year the debt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year. it will be $8.6 trillion. headed for $11.8 trillion if this budget is adopted. That is the wrong course for America. It is a mistake. and we will regret it deeply if we allow this to go forward. That is why this budget ought to be defeated. Only if this budget is defeated are we going to have a chance to change course and get America on a firmer fiscal footing. I yield the floor.",

The Revenue Commissioner testified before the Senate Budget Committee that the tax gainthe difference between what is owed and what is actually being paidis $350 billion a year. The deficit is going to be $371 billion. and we are not collecting $350 billion of revenue that is owed. I dont consider that a tax increase. I think that is simply enforcing the laws that already exist. I want to again alert colleagues. We are trying to change the way the budget debate occurs. The chairman and I are trying very hard. We have heard the complaints of our colleagues about votearamas. A votearama typically occurs because time runs out before the amendment that has been offered has a chance to be voted on under the rules of the Senate.

Anderson was a lone voice in the wilderness of the Department of Transportation begging. pleading and cajoling the various modes of transportation to shore up efforts in improving security.

Every concert explores music which should be heard. but often isnt: forgotten works by major composers. supposedly difficult compositions by twentieth century modernists. and seldompreformed works from our very own day. These worldclass performers come to Vermont to play together. to make music because they love the great richness which comes from measured rhythms and ordered sound. It is fitting that this year their anniversary celebration will be capped by the world premiere of a quintet by Kenji Bunch. a longtime violist with the Craftsbury Players. Commissioned especially for this anniversary. it will be performed on July 20. 2005 in Burlington and July 21 in Hardwick. The Craftsbury Chamber Players have shared their love of music with thousands of people in Vermont. On this. their 40th anniversary. the people of Vermont salute them for their dedication to music and for bringing the best in music to our communities. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 6",

Over an eight year period. one and a half million Armenians were killed and about a halt a million more were forced into exile. Every one of us. as citizens of the world. has a responsibility to ensure that the legacy of the Armenian Genocide is acknowledged and remembered so such human tragedies will not reoccur. We debated for months. as systematic killings occurred in Darfur. about whether the actions there constituted acts of genocide. That is why I rise today to voice my disappointment at the administrations continued lack of clarity when referring to the genocide that occurred during the time of the Ottoman Empire. Falling well short of a declaration. the President referred to the tragedy in his April 24 statement as a \"great calamity.\" Indeed. what occurred was a calamity of such dimensions that the Armenian people are still dealing with its consequences today. But genocide is more than calamity. I share the opinion of the members of the Armenian Assembly of America who say the Presidents weak statement. \"was a missed opportunity . . . to speak the truth plainly. to once and for all avoid using evasive terminology .... \" Just as there is no reason to equivocate about what is happening to the people of Darfur. there is no reason to equivocate about what happened to the Armenians 90 years ago. Genocide is genocide.",

Pt. 21 celebrating the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and reaffirming Congresss support for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I believe strongly that Congress must provide the funding promised nearly 30 years ago for IDEA and that is why I support legislation that would fully fund this commitment to special education. All American children must have access to a free public education in an environment that is appropriate and supportive. While this resolution today acknowledges the promise to our slates and schools to fund IDEA at 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure. it fails to address how far we are from making that goal a reality. This Republicancontrolled Congress funds IDEA at less than 20 percent of its promise. We owe it to our students. their families. and our communities to make full funding a reality.

The Club members believed that the social life of young Black women in San Antonio would be more secure by having. in their background. the interest of older. caring. dynamic women. They also knew that. in the goal for the perpetuity of African Americans. there was an urgency to preserve \"gentility\" within the race. Subsequently.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to recognize the life and legacy of Henry Kirksey. former Mississippi State Senator. veteran proponent of civil rights and retired Tougaloo College professor. Henry Kirksey personified the face of bravery. He was the lead plaintiff in most of the redistricting cases brought in Mississippi to bring the state into compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the late 1960s and early 1970s. when Mississippi was a dangerous place to do so. This was instrumental in opening the door to the creation of fair redistricting plans throughout the State. In 1965. Kirksey filed suit against the State. challenging countywide election of State Representatives and Senators. That suit resulted in the adoption of singlemember legislative districts in 1979. We blacks elected in the State of Mississippi today owe that election more so to Henry Kirksey than anyone else. As a result of Kirkseys sacrifice. Mississippi today appears to have more African American elected and appointed officials at every level of government than any other State in the Nation. Kirkseys service as a plaintiff. expert witness and community organizer has led to the election of almost 600 AfricanAmericans to public office in Mississippi. As part of this process. Kirksey became the first African American elected to the Mississippi Senate since Reconstruction. He became known for filing the lawsuit that led to Jackson changing its form of government in 1985 to the mayorsevenmember council system. He also was a member of the group that fought for reapportionment changes in the late 1970s that led to a record number of black candidates being elected to the Legislature. Kirksey was instrumental in challenging the districts from which state court judges ran. resulting in more diversity on the bench. As a noted mapmaker. Kirksey was significant to the formation of Mississippis majorityblack 2nd Congressional District. which I have the distinct pleasure of representing today. I applaud the life and legacy of Henry Kirksey.",

Mr. THOMPSON. for allowing me to present this particular amendment. I believe this amendment is acceptable to both gentlemen. Ensuring national security and promoting economic trade is critical to our Nations future. Balancing security aspects while maintaining the efficient flow of trade at the United States land ports is critical. My amendment provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security look at the challenges for implementing border security programs while not hindering or negatively impacting the flow of trade and business at land ports. This is critical to land ports because in 2004. for example. the top 10 U.S. land ports for land trade with Canada and Mexico totaled over $635 billion. Land ports handle more than 20.000 containers coming through international ports of entry every day. The Port of Laredo in my hometown. for example. is the fourth busiest port overall in the United States. and the Nations busiest inland port with $131 billion worth of goods and merchandise processed in 2004 alone. The Transportation Bureau of Statistics report for Laredo for 2004 reveals crossings of over 1.4 million commercial trucks. 3.400 trains with 317.000 containers. 38.000 buses. 4.5 million pedestrians. and 6.7 million private vehicles that cross the Laredo area. These statistics show the urgent need to examine and address the unique security challenges faced at land ports. H.R. 4954 is a good bill. and I certainly support this bill. I hope we can add this amendment. which is acceptable to both the chairman and the ranking member. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Mr. Chairman. at the outset let me thank the gentleman from Texas for introducing this amendment and doing it in such a spirit of bipartisanship. To me. it typifies what this issue should be about: good people from both parties working together to resolve one of the most serious issues facing our country today. I agree that such a study is necessary primarily because of the sharp increase of trade that the United States has experienced through its ports in recent years. All forecasts seem to indicate this trend will continue. While this debate largely focuses on seaports. our land ports play a vital role in our economy. Therefore. a comprehensive strategy is needed to address the challenges of efficient trade and land port security. The balance between trade efficiency and adequate security is central to the future success of the United States economy. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I rise today to offer an amendment that will help us find ways to identify and stop shipping containers that contain nuclear material. Section 202 of this bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to evaluate emerging technologies for container security. My amendment simply stipulates that as part of the Secretarys evaluation of emerging technology. he should analyze portable battery powered nuclear detection devices that can be mass produced inexpensively. We have a clear need to know what is in the containers coming into our country. Many of the available technologies to screen nuclear devices. however. are difficult and are very expensive. To my knowledge. the Department of Homeland Security has focused on detection devices that are large. expensive. use a large amount of energy. and cannot easily be placed in or on a shipping container. These technologies may work. but it may not be easy for them to be used. and it may not be possible to procure enough of these types of devices to examine shipping containers headed into our ports. That is why we need to review emerging technology. including portable devices. I know this type of technology exists because Kansas State University in my district is doing some exciting research in this area. In fact. they have developed nuclear detection devices that are the size of a dime which they believe they can produce for about $20 each. These types of devices are easily placed in shipping containers. and can be used to detect nuclear material before it enters any port. For this reason. it is prudent to ask the Secretary to thoroughly review this type of technology. We all know that rogue nations and terrorist cells may try at some point in the future to send nuclear materials to our shores. In fact. Irans pursuit of nuclear materials makes the need to secure our shipping containers even more urgent. This is a simple amendment that only asks the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine portable nuclear detection devices when he evaluates emerging technology. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

When I came here to Washington and first participated in one of many hearings on interoperability and operability. I learned from one of witnesses that this has been a struggle that Congress has been mulling over and struggling with more 10 years. And I interrupted the witness and said. this has been a problem that first responders have been struggling with for over 30 years. As a new police officer in 1972. interoperability and operability was a huge problem for us and still is today. It is intolerable that first responders are still struggling with this issue. The current language in the bill provides that grants may be used to purchase or upgrade equipment and to establish or enhance mechanisms for sharing terrorism threat information. This amendment supplements that language by providing that all equipment purchased be interoperable with Federal. State. and local agencies. Additionally. this amendment ensures mechanisms for sharing terrorism threat information. that they be interoperable with all Federal. State. and local agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has already spent $2 billion in moving this country forward to become interoperable. It is time that we make this commitment.

    "speech": "Port Act creates a new Port Security Grant Program. These grants may be awarded for twelve different purposes. including purchasing equipment and creating threat information systems. My amendment makes two simple improvements to the bill. The amendment requires that communications equipment authorized for purchase under the Grant Program is interoperable with local. state. and federal governments. Second. my amendment would require that the \"mechanisms for sharing terrorism threat information\" funded under these grants are also interoperable with local. state. and federal agencies. We know that the problem of interoperability has plagued this country for too long. The lack of interoperability contributed to the death of 121 firefighters on September 11th. It contributed to the chaos after Hurricane Katrina. Our ports are vulnerable targets for attack. As we work to give our ports the tools they need to prevent and respond to attacks. we must ensure that port systems are interoperable with the federal. state. and local agencies that work everyday with these ports. Adding an interoperable standard to the equipment and threat information systems authorized under these grants is consistent with efforts by the Administration and Congress. An interoperable communications standard is already required under the Urban Area Securities Initiative. the State Homeland Security. and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grant Programs. I fear without this amendment we may have every port in the United States purchasing equipment that does not communicate with local. state. and federal officials on the ground. What good does this do the next time there is a terrorist attack or natural disaster involving a U.S. port? I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to add an interoperable standard to the equipment and threat information systems authorized under these grants.

The amendment I have introduced would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a pilot project at an overseas port similar to the Integrated Container Inspection System. ICIS. in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong. the second busiest port in the world behind Singapore. the ICIS program scans every container of cargo at the two terminals of the facility with advanced radiation and gammaray screening. In Hong Kong. container trucks pass under two giant portals. The first portal scans for radioactivity. The second portal uses gammaray imaging to check for oddsized objects that might conceal weapons. An optical scanner retrieves the ID numbers on the container while a computer integrates data into a database that could be accessed by ports worldwide. Since late 2004. this program has generated 1.4 million digital profiles of outbound containers at the port. The ICIS system can scan nearly 400 container trucks an hour and provide realtime data to help identify suspicious cargo. all the while keeping detailed records of what passes through the port. It is not my intention. I want to point out. to limit this pilot program to one company. I understand that Science Applications International Corporation designed the ICIS program currently being run in Hong Kong. but other companies have begun to develop similar technology. In the text of my amendment. the language states the program must be similar to the 1CIS program. but it does not mandate that it be the program developed by Science Applications International.

I believe in testing and validating a detection systems performance before we fund a largescale deployment. as a great deal of money can be wasted on systems that do not work as advertised. I believe the gentlemans amendment could be improved if we stipulate that the technology tested in the pilot program goes beyond that which has been used in the ICIS program in Hong Kong. We should look to validate the performance of other more advanced systems. which I should note is the goal of the language for a radiation detection pilot program for highvolume domestic ports. which is already in this bill. My hope is that the foreign pilot program in this amendment will be strengthened by incorporating nextgeneration technology and that coordination of this amendment with the domestic pilot program will be considered during conference.

I voted against the Patriot Act Reauthorization in July 2005. and the conference report in December 2005. Neither version of H.R. 3199 sufficiently balanced the needs of law enforcement to protect our country. with the protection of our civil liberties. In December. I stated my firm belief that it is possible to be safe. free. and to protect security while still respecting civil liberties. Unfortunately.

Currently. recipients may challenge the gag order immediately after receiving a Section 215 intelligence order. However. S. 2271 would make the recipient wait one year before having the opportunity to challenge the gag order. I have expressed in the past my serious concem regarding the use of National Security Letters to access Intemet records in public libraries. While this bill attempts to exempt libraries from receiving National Security Letters. it fails terribly. According to S. 2271. libraries are only exempt from National Security Letters if they do not offer Internet accessa preposterous claim in this day and age. and an unrealistic expectation. This exemption does nothing to protect public libraries. or their patrons. from having their privacy invaded by the Federal government. and I do not support this provision. Mr. Speaker.

I rise today to honor Judge Marcel Notzon II. who has admirably served Laredo for the past twentythree years as a United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of Texas. After such a long and distinguished career. Judge Notzon is retiring this month to spend time with his wife of fortyfour years. Nora Lee. and his thirteen grandchildren. It is a great honor for me to enter into the record the accomplishments of Judge Notzon in recognition of his legal career which has spanned over thirtynine years. and extraordinary service to the federal judiciary. He served his country as a part of the United States Navy from 1956 to 1960. and was honorably discharged from his service. Following his discharge. he attended Laredo Junior College. and went on to complete law school at St. Marys University. where he graduated first in his class. Judge Notzon is wellknown in Laredo for his compassion for people. including the defendants that come in front of him in the court. He has made great contributions to the community as well through his involvement with the Boys and Girls Club of Laredo. Little League. and other charities since 1974. Early in his legal career. he joined the Laredo Legal Aid Society. an organization that offers legal representation to those who otherwise could not afford it. It is his exemplary compassion. and his deep commitment to his faith that makes him such a great public servant to the community of Laredo. Mr. Speaker. thank you for allowing me to honor Judge Marcel Notzon II. who has left a lasting impact on the South Texas legal community. and the country at large.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to the National Food Uniformity Act and in support of the right of every state to enforce their laws and protect the health of their citizens. This legislation amends the Federal Food. Drug and Cosmetic Act to create a national standard for food safety labeling. It seeks to achieve a national standard by overriding most state and local food safety warnings and by prohibiting new ones unless they are identical to national requirements. If enacted. this legislation would not only compromise consumer safety with a \"lowestcommon denominator protection\" but also seriously undermine state authority. Over two hundred state laws regarding food safety labeling would be superseded by the National Food Uniformity Act. The specter of such a widereaching federal measure has prompted thirtynine state attorney generals to organize in opposition to legislation they say would \"strip state govemments of their ability to protect their residents through state laws and regulations relating to the safety of food and food packaging.\" The attorney general in my state of Minnesota warns that the bill would eliminate alcohol labels on candy products that provide vital information to expectant mothers and nullify thirty years of work by tribal communities in Minnesota to create labeling standards for wild rice. the states official grain. The bill does include socalled flexibility provisions. which allow states to petition the Food and Drug Administration to restore current safety regulations. But the process is expected to be slow. expensive and uncertain. costing states $400.000 per petition. The added federal costs for administering the process are an estimated $100 million over five years. At a time when govemment agencies at all levels are struggling to cope with deep cuts in federal funding. these provisions create a frivolous and burdensome bureaucracy that serves only to restore state laws that already exist today. Proponents of this bill say fears over consumer safety and local authority are unwarranted and overblown. But despite introduction in the past five Congresses. this legislation has never had a full hearing where testimony from experts could be heard and critical questions explored. This lack of transparency and due diligence is unconscionable considering the bills potentially serious effects to public health. I proudly stand with consumers. family farmers. physicians. environmentalists. state attorney generals. state agriculture department officials and many other consumer advocates in opposing the National Food Uniformity Act.",

The truth is that a variety of Government services are authorized and provided by law in languages other than English. That decision has been 152. Pt. 7 May 18. 2006 made in the Voting Rights Act. There are a bunch of incidences in our law through court decisions. statutory schemes. maybe regulatory schemes. that would authorize a service to be provided by the U.S. Government in a language other than English.

The Senator asked me if I know of a case where the American Government provides a service in some language other than English that I find unjustified? The answer is overwhelmingly no. We do provide. at the Federal level. bilingual ballots and other services outside of English for a reason. and I think those reasons are good. The Senator from Oklahoma gave an example. I believe it is a Federal statute that makes sure that due process rights of people not sufficiently trained in understanding English are preserved. At some point in timein 1978 or whenever it wasCongress came along and said: There will be services provided in a language other than English in a court setting. Not only do I think that is just. but I want to preserve it. Here is the ultimate answer to the Senators question. If there is an example of an injustice in the Senators mind as an individual Senator. where the Government of our country is providing a service not in English. this will not remedy that injustice. That is what I am trying to say. Passing this amendment. voting for this amendment will not remedy that injustice. If you find one. you would have to come to the floor of the Senate and introduce a bill a regulationbecause this does not do that. What Senator INHOFE said is absolutely right. The reason I am going to vote for this is because I think it tries to unite us without taking off the table exceptions to English or services provided other than English.

English. To me. that is a good thing to say because when the demonstrations are in the streets with Mexican flags. they have the right to fly any flag. but some of us have to respond to that. I am supporting the bill. but I am not going to sit on the sidelines and watch demonstrations that destroy national unity. I am trying to bring us all together. and I want the individuals who are here and undocumented to be documented by taking civics classes and taking an English proficiency exam.

We have a chart that shows how over the last 4 fiscal years. the increases in discretionary spending and. once again. that is the money we appropriate in 13 different bills each year. We call it discretionary because each year we decide how to spend it. it is defense. it is national parks. if we look at those accounts in discretionary spending. we will find that 90 to 95 percent of the increases in discretionary spending over and above current services. just running in place. are attributable to 3 different factors. Here we go. Here is the chart. Defense. Homeland Security. and the response to 9/11. Those three factors account for 90 to 95 percent of the growth in discretionary spending. Now. the President says we are spending out of control but. in truth. the House is controlled by Republicans. the Senate is controlled by Republicans. the White House is controlled by Republicans. It is a self indictment. if anything. But here is the actual truth: discretionary spending is going up. but it is going up in accounts and for reasons the President has requested and sought money for. and we have given it to him. Having put an Army in the field in Iraq. we are going to support them 151. Pt. 6 April 27. 2005 and see them through. we hope to a successful conclusion. But this is policy that he has originated and we have supported in one way or another and now support. and this accounts for the main increase in spending.

But they do not anymore. They just do 5 years under the Bush administration because from year 6 to year 10 is such a horrifying picture. they do not want the American people to know how bad it is. And you do not have to take it from us. from Democrats. Before the 2003 tax cuts were passed. Paul ONeill. George Bushs Secretary of the Treasury. said if you pass these 2003 tax cuts. if you do that. you will not be able to do anything else that you want to do. And he was right. He was absolutely right. Because this year. as a percentage of total economic activity. tax revenues to the United States of America are at the lowest level since 1959. before Medicaid. before Medicare. We are trying to run a 21stcentury government on revenues that are. you know. really. as a percentage of the economy. 1950s revenues. And it is all because Republicans have. at least they say. they think if you cut taxes. revenues to the government increase. That is what the gentleman from Texas has stood up and said. The CBO disagrees and the real world does not work that way because every time they do a big tax cut. revenues decrease. We have got an administration that is the most fiscally irresponsible administration in the last hundred years at least. maybe forever. because they have turned the deficit. turned a surplus generated during the Clinton administration into huge deficits that go on and on.

The Department of Defense. in response to calls to reinstate the draft. has confirmed that conscription serves no military need. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is on record citing the \"notable disadvantages\" of a military draft. adding. \". . . there is not a draft.. . . There will not be a draft.\" This is only the most recent confirmation that the draft. and thus the Selective Service system. serves no military purpose. Obviously. if there is no military need for the draft. then there is no need for Selective Service registration. Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. Selective Service registration is an outdated and outmoded system. which has been made obsolete by technological advances. In fact. in 1993. the Department of Defense issued a report stating that registration could be stopped \"with no effect on military mobilization and no measurable effect on the time it would take to mobilize. and no measurable effect on military recruitment.\" Yet the American taxpayer has been forced to spend over $500 million dollars on an outdated system \"with no measurable effect on military mobilization!\" Shutting down Selective Service will give taxpayers a break without adversely affecting military efforts. Shutting down Selective Service will also end a program that violates the very principals of individual liberty our nation was founded upon. The moral case against the draft was eloquently expressed by former President Ronald Regan in the publication Human Events in 1979: \". . . it [conscription] rests on the assumption that your kids belong to the state. If we buy that assumption then it is for the statenot for parents. the community. the religious institutions or teachersto decide who shall have what values and who shall do what work. when. where and how in our society. That assumption isnt a new one. The Nazis thought it was a great idea.\" I hope all my colleagues join me in working to shut down this unAmerican relic ol a bygone era and help realize the financial savings and the gains to individual liberties that can be achieved by ending Selective Service registration.",

We are stewards of an institution governed by rules that have withstood the test of more than two centuries in time. Now is not the moment to scrap such rules simply to achieve objectives that are. in essence. transient and partisan in nature. even though they are deeply felt by their proponents. I know of no other branch of government. in this or any other nation for that matter. that would willingly surrender power to another branch. This is a moment for Senators. as Senators. to stand up for the Senate. The disagreements we have today will likely be forgotten. They will fade like so many grainy snapshots into the dim recesses of our collective national memory. But to change the rules of the Senate. to do so by evading rather than abiding by the rules of this Chamber. would do lasting damage not only to this institution but to the Republic it has served so long and so well. Future generations will not remember why those rules have been changed. but they will live each and every day with the consequences of this decision. I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and let us get back to the business of functioning as the Senate should. I thank the Chair.",

Shall we continue the twocentury tradition of voting up or down. eventually. on this Presidents or any Presidents judicial nominees? The Democrats have decided they will use the Senate rules to prevent an upanddown vote on some of President Bushs judicial nominees by using this as a consistent tactic for the last 2 years to block a vote on nominees a majority of us want to confirm. They are using the Senate rules in a way they have never before been used. They know that. Everyone knows that. There is no disputing that. They had a meeting. They decided to do it. And they are doing it. Now. they may have past grievances such as the practice used by both parties to allow a single Senator to block a nominee in a committee. I know all about that grievance. In 1991. the first President Bush nominated me to be the U.S. Education Secretary. I was enthusiastic about it. I had been the Governor of my State. I was President of the University of Tennessee. I came up and sold my house. moved my family up. put my kids into school. and then one Senator from Ohio put a hold on my nomination. So I sat there in the committee for about 3 months. not even knowing who it was. or knowing what the problem was.

The first National Police Week was celebrated in 1962 when President John F.

State and Federal police officers honors those who died in the line of duty and those who continue to serve and protect us every day at great personal risk. According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. 1.649 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in the last 10 years. In 2004 alone. 153 officers lost their lives. including 7 from Michigan. As in past years. the names of these officers have been permanently engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial along side more than 17.000 others. We can further honor the sacrifices of these brave men and women by passing important legislation to support our law enforcement officers. That is why I have joined Senator BIDnE as a cosponsor of his COPS Reauthorization Act.",

    "speech": "program was created in 1994 and is designed to assist State and local law enforcement agencies in hiring additional police officers to reduce crime through the use of community policing. Nationwide. the COPS program has awarded more than $11 billion in grants. resulting in the hiring of 118.000 additional police officers. Unfortunately. authorization for the COPS program was permitted to expire at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although the program has survived through continued annual appropriations. its funding has been significantly cut. The COPS Reauthorization Act would continue the COPS program for another 6 years at a funding level of $1.15 billion per year. nearly double the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2005. Among other things. this funding would allow State and local governments to hire an additional 50.000 police officers and improve their ability to analyze crime data and DNA evidence. At a time when we are asking more of our police departments than ever before. I believe we should be devoting more resources to the COPS program. not less. Supporting our law enforcement officers also requires that we take up and pass common sense legislation to help keep them safe while they carry out their duties. Shootings have been the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers over the last ten years",

These changes are likely to result in more species extinctions at greater loss of taxpayer dollars. The pending legislation will increase direct spending in the discretionary funding law. which we will get into in general debate. and it could rise to more than $600 million a year. $235 million more per year than we are spending today for species conservation. according to the Congressional Budget Office. Let me make one point perfectly clear here: the managers amendment is not something 1 agreed to in my discussions with the gentleman from California (Chairman POMBO). To say that I agree with 90 percent of this bill is not an accurate description. or is an unfair way to paint the matter. One of the points that we had reached agreement on was that there was to be a recoverybased standard of determining when Federal agency actions jeopardize the continued existence of a species. The managers amendment drops this crucial provision. It cripples it. While I was willing to eliminate critical habitat. it was only on the condition that we ensure that there were adequate provisions in place to encourage recovery. Without this definition. the bill will not promote recovery. We will likely see more endangered and threatened species. It is upon that ground that I oppose this managers amendment. as well as the loosened compensation standards put in order by the managers amendment. It eliminates the bills requirement that appraisals determining the market value of foregone use of property are binding on both the Secretary and the property owner. Instead. the ap51. Pt. 16 21827 praisal is binding only on the Secretary. and the property owner may then go to court to seek additional compensation. That makes the current pending legislation worse. and it will increase the cost of this entitlement program to property owners and it will increase that cost to the American taxpayer. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman. I rise to deal with the section of the managers amendment that covers the manatees. Buried in this managers amendment in dry language is a contest between Florida developers on the one hand and Florida manatees on the other. In this Republican Congress. guess who wins. the developers or the manatees? It is not even close. This is an unprecedented move to exempt a single type of activity. dockbuilding. from a key provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. After losing in court. some boaters and marine contractors have come to Congress asking for special favors so they can continue their development without addressing the impacts on the endangered manatee. It is not only bad policy. but it also undermines recovery efforts by the State of Florida and the Fish and Wildlife Service. By way of background. this section would allow those applying for dock permits to simply prove that their activities would not. quoteunquote. jeopardize. would not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered and threatened marine mammal species as mandated by the Endangered Species Act. section 7. Today. under existing law they must prove that their activities would have only a negligible impact on these species as mandated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. section 101. This simple change in wording lowers our national standard for protection of this wellloved species. Why? Because no single dock is likely to jeopardize manatees. but a whole succession of docks is likely to do exactly that. This amendment clearly targets manatees in Florida. but we really have no idea what kind of precedent or implications this would have for other critically endangered marine mammals. Now. it did not take long for the developers to get here. They lost a lawsuit on July 13. 2005. against the Fish and Wildlife Service in which the court found that the Marine Mammal Protection Act does in fact apply to dockbuilding activities that would lead to incidental take of marine mammals. and specifically manatees in Floridas inland waters. This amendment. therefore. is rushed into this particular bill. just part of the managers amendment.",

I just want to focus on one aspect of this legislation which I think would be amusing in some sense if it were not for the fact that it is an example of a kind of cynical hypocrisy in those people who call themselves fiscally conservative. The bill guts the Endangered Species Act. there is no question about that. and all the protections that are involved there. but then it creates a whole new government giveaway program for some of the Nations richest landowners and property owners. What this bill does is add insult to injury. If you think that you are a responsible fiscal conservative. if you do not want to create a big new government giveaway program. then you should be adamantly opposed to this legislation. You might want to even cast aside the environmental aspects of it. because if you look at the monetary implications of this and the budgetary implications of this bill. it is going to create an even bigger budget deficit in the context of this huge giveaway program.

Mr. Chairman. it was just a couple of weeks ago that the Supreme Court 51.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman for yielding. and I rise in support of H.R. 5782. This bill will save lives. One way it can save lives is illustrated by a story of two children from my district. Moon Township. in Pennsylvania. On March 16. 2005. while walking home from school. two teenagers. a brother and sister. walked past a construction crew that was drilling in front of their house. The crew had ruptured a natural gas distribution line. The children entered the home without knowing that natural gas was seeping in. Soon afterwards. this house exploded to look like this. Both children were inside. They escaped. Both were injured. one seriously. but thankfully both survived. The explosion occurred because accumulated natural gas fumes had ignited. When the pipeline was broken. the crew made the calls as required after they broke the gas line. but the procedures they followed did not prevent the childrens injuries. These two young children could have been among the more than 420 fatalities from pipeline accidents in the last 20 years. In this case the notification rules were followed. but the procedures just take too long. We need a faster. simpler system. one in which emergency authorities arrive at the scene quickly. and a single clear system. not the current patchwork of rules that varies State to State and town to town. That is why I worked with the family of the two young children. local law enforcement and municipal governments and others interested in pipeline safety to write H.R. 2958. Marc and Chelseas law. My bill requires pipeline breaches to be immediately reported to appropriate safety authorities in order to prevent future injuries. I am pleased that the Pipeline Safety Act includes my bills provisions to es52. Pt. 17 December 6. 2006 tablish uniform emergency notifications. With the passage of todays legislation. an excavator who causes a pipeline accident must call the local gas distribution company operator. Also. if there is detectable gas. the excavator must also call 911 immediately. Establishing consistent notification requirements is critical because there have been over 7.600 pipeline accidents. I thank Mr. BARTON. Tom Hassenboehler. Mike Layman. Susan Mosychuck for their help in this bill. but also Marc and Chelsea for their help as well.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 5782the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2006. I want to thank Chairman YOUNG and Ranking Member OBERSTAR and my other colleagues. who brought this vital and important bill to the floor today. Pipeline security has gone under the radar in recent years--but there are critical issues which must be addressed. This bill addresses many of these problems. This bill strengthens the \"onecall notification system\" which allows private citizens and the construction industry to quickly and easily notify utilities and pipeline owners of excavation. The onecall notification system is vital to protecting these key resources and critical infrastructure from thirdparty damage. Unfortunately. third parties are the number one cause of pipeline damage--disrupting the economy and putting many in harms way. These occurrences can easily be prevented and this bill helps do just that. This bill subjects anyone who does not comply with this system to stiff action and penalties. This bill establishes a State Damage Prevention Programwhich is a program which aims to prevent damage to underground infrastructure. This program will be based at the state level and this bill provides for a state grant program managed by the Department of Transportation. This bill improves the management of pipeline infrastructure by mandating the recommendations set forth by the NTSBthe National Transportation Safety Board. The bill will also improve pipeline security by assessing risk associated with human error and reducing damage from these issues by specifically providing for training and simulation exercises. On the technology side. this bill will improve on leak detection technology and monitoring alarms which will improve safety around hazardous materials and the pipelines which carry them. This bill also takes into account environmentally sensitive areas. It mandates new standards for pipelines in these areas which will aim to limit or prevent accidents in these susceptible and crucial areas. This bill also aims to assess and prevent possible gasoline shortages and price spikes by assessing how future pipeline capacity shortages might impact the price of gas at the pump. And finally and most importantly. this bill provides for proper communications between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure reliability for these important and critical assets.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of our consensus substitute to H.R. 5782. The Pipeline Inspection. Protection. Enforcement. and Safety Act of 2006. This legislation represents a broad. consensusbased process that exemplifies what can happen when different interests come together in order to produce a successful product. I thank Chairman YOUNG and Ranking Member OBERSTAR for working with Mr. DINGELL and myself on reconciling our two bills and for the open and fair process between the two Committees of jurisdiction. Reauthorizing the Pipeline Safety laws became more complicated after BPs inexcusable Prudhoe Bay oilfield shutdown in August. After rigorous enforcement and analysis. and after a thorough investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. DOT was able to approve restart of some of these lines at the Prudhoe Bay oilfield. This substitute to H.R. 5782 retains compromise language that was marked up in the Energy and Commerce Committee to address the low stress pipeline exemption. as well as several other provisions that were worked out in bipartisan fashion. For example. the bill strengthens state onecall requirements for excavation damage. provides new authority and grant money to the states to develop their own damage prevention programs modeled after the successful programs already in place. and puts some sunshine on enforcement actions. The low stress language preserves exemptions for gathering lines. flow lines. and other integrated pipeline facilities. but removes the exemption from DOT Part 195 regulation that was used by the BP Prudhoe Bay transit pipelines. The low stress language should also preserve the inherent flexibility that is already built into DOTs integrity management program. In addition. in crafting the administrative procedures implementing the safety order authority under sec. 2(t). DOT should provide a pipeline operator an opportunity to confer with DOT before exercising the operators right to a hearing. Informal consultation has the potential to produce remedies acceptable to both operator and DOT that will resolve the vast majority of concerns without the need for a formal hearing. Any action taken by mutual agreement as a result of any such consultation should be reduced to writing and made both public and enforceable. This approach will save time and legal costs and bring about safety improvements sooner. I urge our friends in the other body to take this bill up and pass it this week. as it reflects changes that were drafted in order to reach agreement with the Senate.",

I want to commend Chairmen YOUNG and BARTON and Ranking Members OBERSTAR and DINGELL. as well as committee staff for the countless hours they put in to get this bill done. It was over 7 years ago. on June 10. 1999. that a pipeline explosion claimed the lives of two 10yearold boys and an 18yearold young man in my district in Bellingham. Washington. Since that time we have made excellent progress in ensuring the safety of our Nations pipelines. The 2002 Pipeline Safety Improvement Act did a lot of good things. It increased penalty fines. improved pipeline testing timelines. and allowed for state oversight. This bill is another step forward. As a body. we can all be proud that well now be regulating lowstress liquid pipelines just as we regulate all other hazardous liquid pipes. What happened with BP lines in Alaska this summer shouldnt have happened and this bill will ensure operators are properly maintaining their lowstress lines.

I rise in strong support of this concurrent resolution to recognize the achievements of The New York Institute for Special Education. During this academic year. the institute is celebrating its 175th year of providing an outstanding education to students with special needs. I thank my colleague from New York for sponsoring this very important resolution. Founded in 1831 as The New York Institution for the Education of the Blind. the institute began classes in March of 1832 as one of the first schools in the United States to provide an educational program for children who were blind or who were visually impaired. In the mid1980s. the institute expanded its mission to include programs for students with emotional and learning disabilities and for preschoolers with developmental delays. To reflect this broader mission. the institute adopted its current name change in 1986. In the year 2000. the institute again expanded with the creation of the Cornerstone Literacy Initiative to provide staff development and school reform leadership to high poverty school districts throughout the entire United States. This Congress has made special education a priority. In 2004. for instance. with overwhelming bipartisan support. we were able to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to provide teachers and parents and schools the tools needed to ensure that students in special education receive the opportunities that they deserve. In addition. in 2002. we passed the No Child Left Behind Act which ensures that the achievement of children with disabilities is a priority. and underline that priority. in our school systems. We are proud that we can partner with States. with local school districts and schools such as The New York Institute for Special Education. to ensure that our students with special needs are receiving a highquality education that prepares them for success. The New York Institute for Special Education in particular has a long history of providing just such an education for its students and being a leader in special education nationally. I again thank my colleague for bringing this important resolution forward and for giving us the opportunity to celebrate The New York Institute for Special Education on the occasion of its 175th birthday. and I urge my colleagues to support H.

Another honest answer. he said. Congressman ROTHMAN. for every dollar we cut in taxes. we only get back to the Federal treasury about 30 or 40 cents. For every dollar we cut in taxes. we only get back 30 or 40 cents. I said. Wait a minute. what about the supply side notion and all this talk about the economic growth generating revenues? He said. Well. that is the consensus of opinion. that for every dollar of taxes cut. we only get back 30 or 40 cents. I said. Wait a minute. we are losing money every time we do a tax cut and then you tell veterans in this budget. the Bush budget. veterans have to pay more for their health care and poor people have to pay more for their prescription drugs.

Republican policies continue in this Congress to favor the wealthy over middleincome Americans and without regard to the budget deficit that is expected this year to reach $370 billion.

The argument was that they should not be extending these cuts to benefit the wealthy while our lawmakers were advancing a broad budgetcutting bill that mainly targeted programs for the poor such as Medicaid and welfare. Our ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee said. \"You talk about completely detached from reality. Thats this place.\" Well. Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday. the AP reported that the average cost of unleaded gasoline was $2.92. up 35 cents from a month ago. Moreover. U.S. drivers are now paying about 14 percent more to fill their tanks than a year ago. The energy bill passed by this Congress last year was a multibillion dollar giveaway to big oil companies. It picked the pockets of the American people and helped line the pockets of Big Oil. Those taxpayer funded special breaks for Big Oil could have much better been used for funding alternative fuels and getting us weaned off our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. Despite the failure of this policy. the Republican tax bill gives even more to the big oil companies. It is time we stopped subsidizing the big oil companies who have made not just record profits but the biggest profits in the history of the world.

I can assure you that the president of China National Offshore Oil Company and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela really dont care about the cost of a gallon of gasoline in suburban America.

They get a free ride. That is unfair. It is unfair that the companies treat their executives so well when rankandfile members are suffering. There is no way that Federal policy ought to sense that kind of activity or inequitable treatment. Our pension laws have to treat workers fairly. Under the House bill. when funding levels fall on a taxqualified pension below 80 percent. then workers cant get the benefit increases. cant get a costofliving adjustment. cant get a lump sum pension payment. But under the House bill. executives can continue to lavish themselves with benefits under the nonqualified plans with no restrictions. Executives dont feel the pinch until funding levels drop below 60 percent. At that point. executives are prohibited from transferring corporate assets to executive compensation. The Senate bill provides for more equitable treatment of executives and workers. Under that bill. workers do not lose their cost of living adjustments or their lump sum payment options at 80 percent.

One improvement we can make today addresses the concerns our constituents have about the inequitable treatment of retirement compensation for employees and executives. ci 2000 Sadly. over the last few years. hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans have had their company pensions severely cut. in some cases after 30 or 40 years of loyal service. Their companies have justified these pension cuts with the argument that cuts are necessary to remain competitive. But. at the same time. these same companies are providing lavish bonuses and compensation to their executives. Well. I believe it is important for companies to offer competitive compensation packages to recruit the best executives. I do not believe executives should be rewarded because of or in spite of the cuts that they have made to the pensions of their employees and retirees. Instead. executives should be held accountable for the mismanagement and underfunding of their pensions. When companies underfund or dump employees pensions while handing out golden parachutes to their top executives. they are not demonstrating the kind of corporate citizenship American workers and taxpayers expect. Mr. Speaker. that is why I urge you to join me in supporting the Miller motion to instruct.

She was not age 50. although she had worked at the airline 28 years. So she did not meet the cut for the people to get a more generous accommodation. She is now 49 years old.

H.R. 2830. purported to strengthen the defined benefit system. the numerous technical changes that were proposed for the funding rules that apply to defined benefit plans will change how the liabilities under the pension plan are valued and the accounting for contributions made. First of all. let me say that I fully opposed the bill that passed on December 15. 2005 by a vote of 294 to 132 because it would cause millions of Americans to receive reductions in their pension plan. Furthermore. its provisions would facilitate the freezing or complete termination of pension plans by corporate boards. Under the socalled Pension Protection Act. if an employer funds a taxqualified pension plan under 80 percent. then the covered workers cannot receive benefit increases. COLAs. or lump sum pension payments. Executives can continue to provide themselves lavish benefits under nonqualified plans without any restrictions. Only if funding drops below 60 percent. are executives prohibited from transferring corporate assets to executive compensation. This Motion by the Gentleman seeks to fix a major source of these potential dangers to our hardworking constituents. It ensures that corporate heads do not profit at the peril of their workersthey will have to adhere to the same retirement rules as do their employees. The situation surrounding Exxon Mobils outgoing CEO. R. Lee Raymond whereby he was stated to bail out of the corporation with a \"golden parachute\" of a $98 million in lump sum pension payment is a slap in the face of the notions of corporate ethics and duty to employees and shareholders. Raymonds total retirement package. including stock options and severance payis valued at $400 million. This is just one more example of out of control executive pay at American companies. As the Motion to Instruct states. Conferees should craft its report to apply the same benefit restrictions between workers and CEOs and use the earlier effective date of the House bill. December 31. 2005. Mr. Speaker. in my state of Califomia. seven oil companies control more than 95 percent of the states refining capacity.

These tribes will not know whether or not they are violating the law or not violating the law. This amendment does nothing for that. The law as is currently interpreted continues to go forward. What this amendment does is suggest that somehow that those workers on a reservation. working in a casino. who are not enrolled members of that tribe have no rights. have no rights. In California they do. under a compromise that was worked out. Last year we were working out a compromise for the first time ever. We had labor and the union and tribes sit down together. They left the room because this amendment was offered last year. and nobody has come back because this amendment continues to be dangled as somehow it is the answer to the concerns that they have. This amendment does not answer a single concern. It just kicks the can down the road. and people are still in limbo if they are seeking to work out an arrangement for those tribal lands and for labor relations on those tribal lands. That has not happened. We were engaged in those historic conversations when the gentleman offered this amendment last year. And nobody has come back to the table since then.",

He admits that in a governmenttogovernment relationship. as the San Manuel Band has done already. they actually put together an agreement with greater union rights than the NLRA.

I am the only Member of the Chamber who was exposed to a recall effort because of my support for tribal sovereignty. Even though the Constitution of the United States does not provide for such a recall. our State constitution thought it did. And so I had to endure an effort in recall because of my fierce support for tribal sovereignty. But having said that. I want to say that the gentlemans amendment goes far too far in that regard. Now I will tell you why. In my State. we had an experience in which one of the tribes contracted out to a private party to run their casino. That private party took advantage of the fact that the compact that the Governor set up with the tribe was defective. And under that defect. they made quite clear to female employees of the casino that it was their obligation. in blunt language. to either put out or get out. Now. we all know what that means. And what the gentlemans amendment means under those circumstances is that when you remove the protection of the National Labor Relations Act. you subject individuals with no power at all to that kind of treatment by shysters and bums. Now. as far as I am concerned. I heard a whole lot about family values from that side of the aisle. You think this amendment represents family values in that situation? Give me a break.

If the tribe chooses not to grant them any rights. then they have no rights. We lecture countries all over the world that you cannot do this to workers. that you have to have minimum standards. But right here in the middle of the United States. under this amendment. a tribe can grant to their workers no rights. That is just untenable. And we understand how strongly held sovereignty is. It is fundamental and basic to these tribes. We also understand how fundamental and basic the right to organize and the freedom of association is to the workers. We have been trying to work that out. This amendment is not helpful in working that out. But the gentleman is exactly right. You can end up with thousands of American workers having no rights. This is like the situation you had in the northern Mariana Islands. where you had people who could not get a minimum wage. who could not get protection of immigration laws.

But here is the problem: some of these nonprofits student loan lenders around the country have these bonds in place for the next 5. 10. some even 15. years. And if we were to end the practice of recycling new loans through there. we would put those nonprofit lenders literally out of business because those bonds were sold to the public under this 9.5 percent scheme. Now. I am as disgusted by this scheme as the gentleman from Maryland is. I can tell you. and why this practice went on for as long as it has is really very troubling to me.

As a result. an estimated 3.6 million people including 800.000 children under the age of 5--are now facing starvation. Aid workers in the field describe the situation as desperate. and report that children are dying daily and families have turned to a diet of acacia leaves and grass. I urge the administration to continue to respond and to work with other donors to ensure Nigers humanitarian needs are met. In particular. it is crucial that USAID make certain the recently announced $7 million in additional emergency funds go immediately towards alleviating the hunger in the hardest hit areas: the agropastoral regions of Maradi and Tillaberi and the pastoral regions of Tahoua and Zinder. Reportedly. there is a shortage of therapeutic feeding centers and clinics. and weakened villagers cannot manage the travel required to reach them. We also need to address longterm food security issues in the Sahel. where drought and famine regularly afflict these poorest nations. Earlier this year I traveled to three of Nigers neighborsAlgeria. Mali. and Chad. I heard firsthand accounts of how devastating the locust crisis was. and I heard a consensus regarding the need for permanent mechanisms to facilitate crisis response and to prevent emergencies in the future. As the tragedy in Niger demonstrates. even when governments. international organizations. and NGOs are able to anticipate food insecurity almost a year in advance and implement their assistance programs. we can still have a crisis. Unfortunately. it sometimes takes media coverage of already emaciated children to jolt donor countries into emergency action. We need to remain alert and responsive to 51. Pt. 14 July 28. 2005 World Food Program appeals for extra funding before the starvation begins. and we need to stay committed to longterm efforts to improve food security throughout the region.",

The frontier town grew quickly in the following years. and by 1893. the population exceeded 1.000 people. Enjoying a robust agricultural economy. Alexandria shipped more than 1.000 boxcars of grain annually. In 1914. the city purchased an electric generator. and local businessmen financed a $1.200 project to make Alexandria one of the first communities in South Dakota with electric streetlights. In 1885. the city applied to become the State capital. but came in fourth in the voting. Since the boom years of the early 1900s. economic circumstances have. of course. changed. Still. Alexandria continues to provide essential services and support to local farmers and ranchers. The rugged days of pioneer life have ended. but the residents of this extraordinary community continue to exemplify the bold and enterprising pioneer spirit. In her book. Hanson Heritage.

This bill authorizes the conveyance to the city of Yuma of six small parcels of Federal land currently held by the Bureau of Reclamation in exchange for three railroad parcels owned by the city on which the Bureau of Reclamation rail line exists. A companion bill has already been introduced in the House by Congressmen GRIJALVA and FRANKS. These land conveyances will enable the city to complete the redevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Yuma. The Riverfront Master Redevelopment Plan was approved by the City Council in November. 2001. The plan was developed through a joint planning process with the city and the developer. The citys responsibility is to amass the property along the riverfront. The developer must raise the needed capital. The redevelopment includes the development of a welcome center. a new hotel. a conference center. and mixeduse retail stores. This redevelopment is designed to connect Main Street with the Heritage Area and the river to enhance the quality of life of Yumas citizens and one of the primary economic assets of the areatourism. Most of the land in this 22 acre area is already cityowned. However. the Bureau of Reclamation does own several parcels within the redevelopment area that the city seeks to acquire. Since 2001. when the redevelopment plan was approved. the city and the Bureau have been working together to effectuate this acquisition for this public purpose. These efforts include: relocating. at the citys expense. the Bureau facilities that were within the redevelopment area and completing the necessary environmental analyses of the project area. including historic resource studies. site assessments. and asbestos and leadbased paint inspections. Essentially. the deal is complete with one exception: the authority to accomplish the conveyances. Currently. the Bureau of Reclamation does not have the authority to exchange the lands it possesses for the railroad parcels it seeks--it must be done legislatively. There is broad support in Yuma for this legislated land swap given its public purpose objectives. thorough planning. and the economic opportunity it brings. I hope my colleagues agree and will work with me to pass this legislation this year. By Mr. ENZI (for himself. Ms. MI-",

This legislation is an investment to support teachers in rural areas. and high poverty areas. It provides a $1.000 refundable tax credit for those teachers willing to serve in challenging schools. The bill also gives every teacher the chance to earn a refundable tax credit 51. Pt. 14 18989 by offering a $1.000 refundable tax credit for every teacher who earns accreditation by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. A National Board Teacher in a rural school or high poverty school would receive a $2.000 credit which hopefully would promote retention of our best teachers. According to the most recent survey by the American Federation of Teachers. the average teacher salary is $45.771. While teacher salaries rose an average of 3.3 percent. the health insurance benefits spiked an average 13 percent. according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The starting salary for a new teacher is estimated to be $30.496. Given the costs of college. the average student graduates with a debt of $19.400 and face loan payments of $210 a month. it is difficult for young. eager graduates to pursue careers in teaching and pay off their student debt and other living expenses. It is sad when a dedicated young person decides that they simply cannot \"afford\" to be a teacher. but this happens. The I TEACH Act will help by providing meaningful tax credits to teachers willing to serve in rural areas or high poverty schools. and it will provide a strong financial incentive to keep quality teachers in the classrooms by rewarding teachers who earn National Board certification. Thirty States provide some type of financial incentive to National Board teachers. and this refundable tax credit will support such efforts. For example. West Virginia offers a $2.500 bonus for National Board teachers. If I TEACH is enacted. a National Board teacher in my State would receive a 9 percent bonus which is a meaningful Incentive. Our teachers are essential professionals that inspire and educate our children. who represent the next generation. Our teachers deserve our respect and real support. I urge my colleagues to work with me to enact I TEACH and reward our teachers. By Mr. AKAKA:",

They do not have a very good track record in holding the automobile maker selling in America to increased fuel efficiency. I like dual E85 vehicles. I think those are sensible. Sadly. at this point. there are very few places to turn to to buy the fuel. My colleague. Senator OBAMA. was talking about a tax treatment that would give incentives to set up these E85 stations. It was. unfortunately. not included in this bill. I think it should have been. Right now. there are precious few to turn to. Dualfuel use is part of the BondLevin amendment.. but it is a very rare occurrence where you can actually find the E85 fuel to put in your car. Plus. we find when they are dualfuel use vehicles. which the Senators rely on a great deal for their savings. fewer than 1 percent of the people actually use the better fuel. They stick to the less fuel efficient source of energy for their car. They do not use the E85 fuel. Sadly. the BondLevin amendment will increase our 2015 oil consumption by almost as much as we currently import from Saudi Arabia.

As recently as 1997 and 1999. the Senate Banking Committee reported PUHCA repeal bills out of committee. As chairman of the Banking Committee. I have been pleased to work with the Chairman of the Energy Committee to ensure that PUHCA repeal was included as part of a comprehensive Energy bill. I congratulate the chairman for reporting a bill out of Committee that includes PUHCA repeal. Nevertheless. I have concerns that the expanded merger review authority for FERC provided for in the Electricity title undermines the important policy goals behind PUHCA repeal. It is widely understood that PUHCA has served its purpose and is outdated. Now. PUHCA acts as a barrier to interstate capital flows. and other Federal laws make the PUHCA regime redundant. The purpose of PUHCA repeal legislation is to eliminate these duplicative and unnecessary regulatory burdens. I am concerned that PUHCA repeal is undermined by legislation providing FERC with enhanced merger review authority over utility companies. I do not believe that Congress should repeal PUHCA. only to replace it with a burdensome regulatory framework administered by FERC. But I am afraid that may be exactly what we are doing in the Electricity title of this bill. I do not believe that Congress should require enhanced FERC merger authority as a prerequisite for PUHCA repeal. I would ask the chairman to consult with me during conference to ensure against this result. As the Senate Banking Committee has done recently. I think it is important that we repeal PUHCA without creating additional regulatory burdens.",

Rosemary Cottage opened in April of 1920 and could house 10 girls and a housemother.

Our countrys religious leaders recognize that danger. and for the second time this year have issued statements calling on our government to truly care for the least among us and to abide by a budget and spending plan that reflects the higher values and morals of our country. I would like to submit for the RECORD a letter from the leaders of many of the major Protestant churches in our country and another by the National Council of Jewish women calling on Congress not to abandon the poor in the aftermath of Katrina. The budget reconciliation process should not be used to further reduce funding for education. food stamps. health care. and other critical domestic priorities while spending twice that amount in tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.",

Mississippi. and Alabama. our Nation has reached a state of emergency. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been tragically uprooted from their communities. or have lost loved ones in the path of the destruction. I wholeheartedly support the effort to provide food. water. and daily necessities to these victims. as well as the longterm effort to rebuild our Gulf Coast and house the nowhomeless. As we move forward with the effort to provide for families and to rebuild. it is Congress job to ensure that federal aid and taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately and are reachENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 15 ing the truly needy. Last week. the Federal Emergency Management Agency was spending just over $500 million a day. an unprecedented rate. and over the weekend spending reached $2 billion a day. Over $60 billion in emergency appropriations has been allocated. a record for disaster relief. and Congress is expected to authorize more funds in the coming weeks. I strongly urge that future spending bills for Hurricane Katrina include controls on how the money will be spent. that this spending is offset with reductions in other programs. just as Congress did following the California earthquake and the Oklahoma City bombing. and that Federal resources are allocated for rebuilding only where State and local govemments and the private sector cannot provide the funds. Additionally. I encourage accountability and meticulous record keeping within the federal organizations funding the emergency and rebuilding efforts. I feel it is imperative that the Department of Homeland Security and other related agencies help these citizens and rebuild these towns. but in a financially responsible manner. ensuring every dollar is spent wisely and fairly in an effort to best help the victims of this tragedy. In this time of disaster. it is important that we do not saddle future generations with unmanageable debt. but rather work together to exercise fiscal responsibility.",

On September 17. 1787. 39 delegates from 12 states convened in Philadelphia to outline the powers of a new governmenta government that for the first time in world history would exercise its authority from powers loaned to it by its citizens. not the other way around. It represented a sea change from centuries of belief that every persons right to his property was somehow the states to grant or to confiscate. John Adams once said. \"The moment that the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred as the Laws of God. and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it. anarchy and tyranny commence. Property must be sacred or liberty cannot exist.\" I believe that every American that swears to defend the Constitution is obliged to defend that sacred right. Unfortunately. there exists a depressing trend. highlighted by the Supreme Courts recent 54 decision in Kelo v. New London. where those who think \"govemment knows best\" gain and property rights yield. With the death of the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. America is once again presented with a test of her character. A new Chief Justice must be appointed. He or she will bear the responsibility for defending a document that has generally succeeded in securing individual liberty for 218 years. From what I have learned about Judge Roberts. I am optimistic that he will rise to the occasion. I can only hope that the Senate will too. The Constitution is far too valuable for politics.",

Like so many Republican window dressings. this bill might seem like a nobrainer to some. Only citizens can vote. so why not have them show their ID and prove their address and citizenship to reduce fraud? If only the real world were as simple as country club Republicans imagine. What about students whose drivers licenses show their home address but who register to vote on campus? Nursing home residents who have been voting for over 50 years but whose documents are nowhere to be found? Lowincome Americans who dont drive and have never had a stateissued identification? Its no coincidence that the people who will be disenfranchised by this bill are core Democratic constituencies. Powerful interests have figured out that there are lots of ways to institute a poll tax by another name. What about reducing voter fraud. something we all support? It will come as no surprise to anyone who has run for office or worked in campaigns that there is little evidence of fraudulent voting. Its hard enough to convince most registered voters to go to the polls. What is the incentive to engage in voter fraud. a felony offense? In particular. there is little incentive for immigrantsagainst whom this legislation is targetedto vote illegally. Voter fraud by immigrants is subject to immediate deportation without appeal. Do the sponsors of this bill really believe that thousands. or even tens. of immigrants would risk deportation to cast a single vote? It anything shatters confidence in our election system. it is the thousands of votes that are not counted because of dimpled chads. electronic voting breakdowns. provisional ballot mishaps. threehour lines at polling places. and the like. The Help America Vote Act. which was supposed to address some of these problems. has never been fully funded or enforced. and yet the Republican Majority wants to further restrict voting and create a new administrative nightmare for our states and localities. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. so that all Americans might have the opportunity to cast their vote in November against this desperate cling to power.",

H.R. 4844 requires all States to demand that voters provide govemmentissued identification in order to vote in the 2008 election. and a copy when voting absentee or by mail. and proof of citizenship in order to vote in the 2010 election. Unfortunately. H.R. 4844 undoes the progress of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization enacted just 2 months ago by imposing a 21st century poll tax. This bill would disenfranchise the elderly. people with disabilities. and minorities. The costs of obtaining the documents needed to prove you are citizen are high. A birth certificate usually costs $1- $15. and according to the State Department only 27 percent of eligible Americans have passports. which cost $97. Naturalization papers. if they need to be replaced. cost $210. While supporters of H.R. 4844 promise to help some citizens who dont have money to pay for these documents. we cannot bank on the promise from the Republican majority who have refused to honor their commitment to the Help America Vote Act. Mr. Speaker. let me state clearly that I oppose voter fraud. Currently. there are very strong federal statues on the books to penalize voter fraud and I support their vigorous enforcement. The Help American Vote Act. which I supported. gave States resources to both expand access and prevent voter fraud. Yet. the Republican majority has underfunded the Help American Vote Act by $800 million. I oppose this legislation. and urge my colleagues to reject this 21st Century poll tax.",

Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. this bill includes provisions that reach beyond just our military personnel to protect all investors. I would like to thank the Chairmen of the Financial Services and Banking Committees for including language from H.R. 1077. the Realtime Investor Protection Act. which I authored and which passed as a stand alone bill last year. This language will require the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to make its database of complaints against brokers publicly available on a secure Internet site. This is extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily efficient. The result will be more informed investors with greater trust in the markets. Although the NASD already maintains this database. BrokerCheck. the organization is prohibited from making it available online. The current system requires potential investors to submit a request for broker/dealer information via telephone or email The investor must then wait for a response. In todays high tech world. this procedure is outdated and highly inefficient. BrokerCheck is an invaluable tool for investors. through which they can learn about the professional background. business practices. and conduct of NSDregistered firms and brokers. free of charge. Specifically. an investor can discover: Whether or not their broker has a criminal record. whether or not they have been subject to a regulatory action by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). and. whether or not they had customer complaints filed against them. This bill will bring investor protection up to speed with investing technologies. Interestingly. of the 4.4 million requests NASD received through BrokerCheck for information in 2004. 99 percent were through the Internet email request system. only 1 percent were by telephone. Clearly. investors prefer using the Intemet to request information.

The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to make it unlawful for any registered investment company to issue or sell any periodic payment plan certificate. In short. the bill will protect the members of our Armed Forces from unscrupulous practices regarding the sale of insurance as well as other financial and investment products. Many of us have known for some time that members of our Armed Services have been preyed upon by unscrupulous individuals in the financial services arena. Members of the Armed Services are often the victims of aggressive and misleading sales practices and schemes that result in exorbitant commissions and fees for insurance products. etc. Some sales commissions are in excess of 50 percent on the first year of contributions to the insurance product. In addition. certain life insurance products are being marketed as investment products. providing minimal death benefits in exchange for excessive upfront premiums. I believe that this bill takes a major step to close the existing loophole in the law allowing for the proliferation in the sale of these products. Mr. Speaker. it would be disgraceful if. after the sacrifices made by the men and women in our armed services. this body allowed these practices to continue.

The conventions are set up to confer status on signatories and to make sure that people who engage in unlawful activity are not covered. The people who wear civilian clothes that go in the population and engage in terrorist activity have never been covered under the convention. Under the convention. that is the definition they are giving. The administration has used the term that has been legitimized by the courts for quite a while now in international law. In the review process at Guantanamo Bay. they will take the person off the battlefield. They have to make a case whether they fit the definition of enemy combatant. Each year they can challenge the designation. What we are doing in this amendment is basically blessing that procedure. requiring two more things. One. the idea that the Senate will confirm the person who will ultimately have the release authority or the appeal authority to enemy combatant status. and two. prohibit the use of a single statement to hold somebody as an enemy combatant who was in a foreign governments hands. unless we can show the statement was not a result of torture. We have learned from our experience at Guantanamo Bay that would be a good change.",

This amendment deals with detaining somebody who is not being prosecuted yet. who may be prosecuted. but keeping them off the battlefield because we have determined they are an unlawful enemy combatant. The review process to make that determination I feel very comfortable with. And there are some small changes in the amendment. The courts have told us this is an area where Congress needs to act. The courts have many cases. not just one. challenging the Guantanamo Bay procedures and determining unlawful enemy combatant. Justice Scalia said in the dissenting opinion. if this were an area where Congress spoke. the courts would welcome their involvement.",

He said to me in the hearings that the President or the executive branch is at its strongest when they have the implied or express support of the Congress. So the purpose of this amendment. if I may say very briefly. is for Congress to legitimize what is going on at Guantanamo Bay about determining enemy combatant status. legitimizing that review process by making some changes. If we would do that. I am convinced the courts would welcome that involvement and a lot of this litigation would end overnight.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the ranking member for the time. I rise in strong support of this subcommittee bill. I am privileged to be a member of this subcommittee. and I think the chairman. the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman WOLF). and his staff have crafted an unbelievably good bill under very difficult circumstances. I particularly. on behalf of the National Childrens Alliance. want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their commitment to funding for this remarkable national network of childrens advocacy centers which have been a part of this bill for many years now. As my colleague from Texas just remarked about the crime victims trust fund funding. my local nonprofits there in north Alabama and around this country are pleased that that trust fund was not rescinded. that money was restored in there. Again. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for those plusups. This is a good bill. It should be supported by the Members. On the NASA side. on the NASA account. we are fully funding the Shuttle Return to Flight. and the Presidents space exploration program on behalf of the Marshall Space Flight Center. also there in north Alabama. This Is a good bill for NASA. and. again. it is under difficult circumstances. In my area of the country. we have a problem with the crystal meth issue. There is money available under this bill for the meth hotspots at the level of $60 million. My community sorely needs that kind of funding available for them to attempt to combat this raging and very difficult problem. The bill restores $40 million for the drug courts. In my opinion. that is related to the crystal meth Issues. at least in my area anyway. and we need those moneys restored. I might remind my colleagues that that program. the drug court program. was zeroed out in the Presidents budget. This bill fully restores funding for the NEP program. and that is important. So. all in all. as I have rambled through the various provisions in this bill. this is a good bill. and on behalf of the citizens of the Fifth Congressional District of Alabama. I urge my Members to support this bill.",

I wish to express the concern of many of my constituents regarding potential threats to the integrity of the Small Business Administrations loan program. Under current law. no funding for the Small Business Administration funds may be used to assist individuals who are in the United States illegally. Actually. to date. the best information we have is that SBA has never guaranteed a loan to an individual living illegally in the United States. However. SBA only guarantees the loans. while banks actually provide the funds to applicants. Thus. the burden of ensuring the legal status of loan applicants is actually placed on the financial institutions. While banks have internal measures designed to specifically prevent fraud. the success of SBAs policy hinges on prompt notification. rather than upfront security. Unfortunately. the post9/1l world has highlighted the consequences of fraud. My constituents and those around the United States demand that Congress act aggressively to strengthen and protect the integrity of the SBA loan system rather than passively waiting for the worst. Can the distinguished gentleman describe what steps have been taken to combat this sort of fraud and to protect America? 5 1. Pt. 9 June 14. 2005",

I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. and I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman WOLF) and the gentleman from West Virginia (Ranking Member MOLLOHAN) for all their work on this bill. I particularly commend them for rejecting the administrations proposal to create an umbrella community development program in Commerce. which would have greatly reduced the breadth and creativity of the community development programs as they currently operate. I appreciate my colleagues efforts to restore funding for other vital programs within their wholly inadequate allocation. I especially thank them for restoring partial funding for the SBAs microloan program. which the Presidents budget eliminated. Through the microloan program. 170 intermediary lenders nationwide provide loans and technical assistance to our smallest businesses. many of which could not secure loans from more restrictive SBA programs or conventional banks. Since its creation 13 years ago. the microloan program has provided over 21.000 microloans totaling $250 million. which averages to fewer than $12.000 per loan. Yet. 60.000 jobs have been created at roughly $3.500 per job. One microlender in my district. the Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund. has made 138 loans totaling $2.25 million. One hundred percent of the microloans were made to locally owned businesses. half of which were startups. and all received watchful technical assistance. which is why so few of these loans default. As we all know. small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. and I thank my colleagues for their support and urge them to work toward restoring the microloan program to last years funding level.",

I want to congratulate the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman WOLF) and the gentleman from West Virginia (Ranking Member MOLLOHAN) for putting together a very balanced bill within the available allocation. As the new chairman of the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. we are in the process of drafting a NASA authorization. Our authorization will be the first opportunity for the House of Representatives to endorse a Vision for Space Exploration. a bold initiative that is the cornerstone for investment in both human and robotic exploration. Space exploration is a technology engine for this country. We need this vision to encourage the next generation of skilled workers and to drive innovation. Telling kids that they need to study math and science rings hollow unless there is a real reason to do so. like space exploration. I certainly support State and local law enforcement assistance. however. Congress has a long track record of providing law enforcement with ample resources. Since September 11. 2001. Congress has provided more than $15 million to assist State and local law enforcement. and. in this bill. has generally funded law enforcement above the Presidents request. Funding to these State and local agencies is also provided through a number of other agencies. such as Homeland Security. the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others. NASA has a new Administrator. Mike Griffin. who is getting the Agency moving in the right direction to carry out this Vision for Space Exploration most effectively. These cuttingedge technologies will ensure our global technological leadership. our Nations security and our competitiveness worldwide. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Obey amendment and support the committee bill that we have before us today later in this debate. I thank the gentleman for his time.",

Leonard and Ida Mae Hal. Leonard learned at a young age the daily routine of life on a farm. When he was in his early twenties. Leonard began farming on his own. Soon his business grew to include a dairy and he also raised and sold cattle. Mr. Hall successfully ran his business for about 80 years. Leonard Hall once stated. \"I think everyone should give back something to the community where they lived. How else are we going to keep our memories alive?\" These were not words without substanceMr. Hall is a great advocate for his hometown and has financially supported several important projects within Kings County. In remembrance of his wife Katherine. he gave financial support to the Burris Park Museum in Hanford. The museum recognized the gracious gift by dedicating the new wing of the museum in her name. The Hanford Carnegie Museum also benefited from Mr. Halls generous donations. With his help the institution was able to install a new foundation and also introduce the original Beacon Oil office as an historical exhibit. Perhaps the most poignant of his contributions is the funding he provided to help restore the Grangeville Church. which is known as the first church of Kings County. For Mr. Hall. the renovation was not just for the purpose of historical preservation but it was a way for him to honor the memory of his parents. who were wed there at the turn of the century. Leonard Halls generosity is his way of saying thank you for all the wonderful memories. During this momentous occasion of Leonard Halls 100th birthday. I would like to wish to him and his family all the best. I would also like to extend. on behalf of the residents of Kings County. heartfelt appreciation and gratitude for Mr. Halls generosity that has helped preserve the past for the generations of the future.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on this our first day in session following World AIDS day. I rise to recognize a public awareness campaign released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse that brings critical attention to the dangerous link between drug abuse and HIV/ AIDS. This campaign seeks to inform our youth how drug abuse can impair judgment and cause risky sexual behaviors that increase the danger of contracting or transmitting HIV. The connection between drug abuse and HIV/AIDS isnt limited to the risks of injecting drugs and being infected by contaminated needles. It is much bigger than that. Drug or alcohol intoxication changes behaviorinhibitions disappear and the ability to make good decisions is impaired. Only 1 in 50 high school students report having ever injected an illegal drug. However. young Americans use alcohol and other drugs at high rates. According to NIDA. between 2000 and 2003 about 10 young people (age 1324) were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each day. Today an estimated 1 million people in the United States are living with HIV/AIDS. and. approximately 4 out of 10 U.S. AIDS deaths are related to drug abuse. My advisory committees on AIDS/HIV and Drugs and Substance Abuse confirm the toll that this dual epidemic has taken. Drug abuse and HIV/AIDS affect our children. our families. and our communities not only in the 7th District of Illinois but also across this nation. I commend NIDAs efforts in advancing research and public awareness to better understand the pivotal role drug abuse (in all its forms) can play in the spread of HIV/AIDS. We need to continue to educate our constituents about the risks of drug abuse and HIV infection. We need to provide adequate and accessible treatment for those with drug problems and HIV/AIDS. We need to support what NIDA has established that drug abuse treatment is HIV prevention. Because by limiting and protecting against the risky behaviors associated with drug abuse. we can decrease the likelihood of spreading or contracting HIV/ AIDS.",

If we are serious about ensuring fairness for all. about leaving no child behind. and about helping families achieve financial stability now and in the future. then Congress must act to address this significant wage gap. For this reason. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. This bill will take concrete steps to eliminate genderbased wage discrimination. It will provide for enhanced outreach and training programs for employers. allow employees to share salary information. and give women the opportunity to sue for punitive damages under the Equal Pay Act. It is my hope that the Administration and the Republican leadership will make a serious effort to address this discrimination this Congress. Along with wage disparity. we must continue to focus on issues of work place safety. equal treatment. and career advancement. As a woman. a mother. and a Member of Congress. I will continue to fight for equal pay. quality health care. safe work environments. and education opportunities for girls and women to ensure that they can pursue the American dream.",

November 5th. the Scots defeated New Braunfels High School 103 for the title. This program and its coach have shown an incredible amount of character since losing to San Antonio Alamo Heights in the 2002 state finals. They have not lost a single match since then. winning a state record seventy straight team matches. The team of twentyfive varsity players (thirteen boys and twelve girls) is so filled with talent that Head Coach Dan Holden had reserve players who are nationally ranked on the sidelines. a testament to the depth of this team. Coach Holden has not only prepared his players for the championship match. however. he has also helped them to seek higher education. This twopronged approach to coaching is what Coach Holden calls his \"WinWin\" strategy. He kept practices shorter than normal so that the players could have time to work with their personal coaches to improve their abilities for U.S. Tennis Association Tournaments. These tournaments provide excellent recruiting opportunities for college scouts. in turn providing the exposure necessary for the players to impress scouts in the hopes of earning a college scholarship. Proof of his success is evident. For example. Tyler Taransky. a senior at Highland Park. came back to Highland Park for his last year after a brief foray into the world of fulltime competitive tennis and home schooling. As a result. he helped to lead his team to victory one last time before enrolling at Texas A&M. where he will play tennis next fall for the Aggies. For his efforts. the United States Professional Tennis Association named Coach Holden the 2004 National High School Coach of the Year. He was also honored as the Dallas Morning News 2004 AllArea Tennis Coach of the Year. In closing. I would like to congratulate Coach Dan Holden and the Highland Park Scots Team Tennis on their outstanding achievement.

I accept full responsibility for the timing and the management of this bill and making the decision that there would be no more votes tonight. My leader has entrusted me with that power. and I have so exercised it. I regret that it appears to the minority leader. a very valued and dear colleague in this Chamber. that it is not a proper course of action. but I accept that. We have a difference of opinion. The fact that we will not have votes tonight will not deter my distinguished colleague and me as managers from continuing to work through amendments. We will both be here throughout tomorrow. We could stack a number of amendments which could be addressed on the afternoon of Monday at such time as the two leaders determine it would be appropriate. As to the matter of cloture. again I accept full responsibility. This is the 27th Armed Services bill I have been privileged to be involved in. I believe that historically cloture is needed. particularly in the last week when colleagues. understandably. on both sides of the aisle have many matters of great Interest to them and they desire to exercise their rights to amend this bill and otherwise to get a decision by the Senate as a body. So I accept the responsibility. Whether we go ahead and as the cloture ripens we go forward. that is a matter I will work on with my leader in consultation. And if there is such progress made on a list of amendments that remain. I would wish to take into consideration the possibility we might not vote on it. But I feel I have to have that in place to efficiently work and manage this bill in the interim period between now and Tuesday morning. But bottom line. I accept the responsibility. It is not that of the distinguished majority leader.",

I have great admiration for the Senator from Virginia. He provides real leadership. as does the Senator from Michigan. I do hope we will not have cloture filed on this bill. I am going to debate an amendment that will be offered in the morning. I will offer an amendment around lunchtime tomorrow. a separate amendment. I am sure many of our colleagues have amendments they wish to offer. I hope the opportunity for full debate will be available because this area is so critically important. If I might take another moment. the amendment tomorrow deals with. as I understand it. the earthpenetrating bunker buster nuclear weapon. the amendment I will offer with respect to the development of a Trumantype commission to deal with contracting abuses---waste. fraud. and abuse. massive abuses which I will describe tomorrow. These are important issues. These are not small issues. They are big issues that require and demand significant debate and consideration.

This legislation would amend the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Act of 2000. Public Law 106319. to reduce the size of the heritage area to conform to the area set forth in the Heritage Area Management Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002. The Yuma Crossing Heritage Area was designated in October 2000. It sprung from a preliminary concept plan completed in 1999 by the Heritage Area Task Force. The boundaries proposed in that plan included approximately 22 square miles. extending from the Colorado River on the north and west to the Avenue 7E alignment on the east and the 12th street alignment on the south. These boundaries represented the task forces \"best guess\" as to the cultural landscape warranting inclusion in the heritage area. This \"best guess\" was incorporated into the legislation designating the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. During the development of the final Heritage Area Management Plan. which was subject to comprehensive community involvement. it became apparent that the areas boundaries were too large and should be more concentrated along the Colorado River and in historic downtown. Rather than simply leave the boundaries as they were set in the 2000 legislation. we have heard from the community in Yuma that it is important that we conform the boundaries to those in the agreedupon Management Plan. Doing so will provide certainty to the heritage area and those private landowners who live within its current boundaries. It will allow the heritage area to meet its management goals and responsibilities without the worry that private property rights may be affected in the future. This is a noncontroversial. straightforward correction. I hope my colleagues will work with me to pass it quickly this year. By Mr. HAGEL (for himself. Mr.",

Eighty percent of the funds would be dedicated for state and local public health workers. with bonus payments available to those who agree to be placed in underserved areas. There are critical public health workforce shortages. We cannot afford to lose so many experienced workers just when our public health workforce should be expanding to meet increasing health needs.

Hollys Law is named in memory of Holly Patterson. an 18year old woman who died after taking the drug in 2003. RU486 has killed three women in the United States and many more have been hospitalized with a severe bacterial infection known as septic shock. RU486 was approved by the FDA in September of 2000. The FDA approved RU486 under a special \"restricted distribution\" approval process known as \"Subpart H.\" reserved only for drugs that treat \"severe or lifethreatening illnesses.\" like cancer and AIDS. Subpart H allows an expedited approval of certain drugs by not subjecting them to the testing and review standards required of all other new drugs. These are important tests necessary to determine the safety and longterm effects of a drug. Clearly. the fact that these tests were not done on RU486 was a damaging omission considering the death and illness associated with use of the drug.

This legislation would amend The Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources and Conservation Improvement Act of 2000. which was passed with Unanimous Consent in the 106th Congress. to authorize work needed to conserve and enhance water supplies in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. It would do so by improving the water infrastructure used by farmers. ranchers. municipalities and a growing population. Improving water conveyance infrastructure is the top priority for enhancing water conservation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Currently. unprecedented growth coupled with Mexicos past failure to comply with the 1944 Water treaty. reinforces the dire need for water conservation. The Lower Rio Grande Valley depends upon an adequate supply of water. Studies show that water losses resulting from seepage. spills and evaporation exceed 68 billion gallons of water per year. underscoring the pressing demand for improvements which will ensure efficient conservation of water. By enacting this legislation. 19 additional water districts will enhance their ability to conserve their resources. Residents in the Lower Rio Grande Valley will not be forced to rely on canal systems subject to seepage and evaporation. Improving irrigation systems and updating this 100yearold water distribution system will provide citizens in South Texas with a sufficient supply of one of natures most valuable resources. Rather than waiting for the unpredictability of Mother Nature to increase water resources through rainstorms. these communities can rely on more effective water systems. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure to help the citizens of the Lower Rio Grande Valley better conserve their water resources.

How we characterize what we do sends a message. and nowhere is that more clear than in the question of survivor benefits for survivors of military fatalities. The Senate this year is considering major increases in survivor benefits for military families. That is as it should be. and I am proud to support two specific proposals to increase that assistance. We have an historic opportunity to raise both the direct DoD assistance and the life insurance payouts to families from $12.420 to $100.000 and to provide an extra $150.000 in life insurance payouts. We also have an opportunity to allow full concurrent receipt of the DoDs Survivor Benefit Plan and the VAs Dependency & Indemnity Compensation. We also have the opportunity to improve the help that military survivors get in navigating the bureaucracies of the VA and the DoD to get the benefits they deserve. And finally we have the opportunity to protect military families from predatory life insurance companies. All of these reforms are needed. and all are within our reach this year. As I studied this issue. I was struck by the term \"Death Gratuity.\" That is the name for the assistance that taxpayers make available to military survivors. The term gratuity means gift. I believe that not one of the widows. widowers. or children left behind think of that money as a gift. These families and these heroes are the ones who have given the gift to us. They are the ones who have given the ultimate sacrifice. I know that the name of the assistance is not as important as the assistance itself. but I am sure that hearing the term \"gratuity\" is a bitter pill for survivors who have just received the worst news of their lives. I for one refuse the term \"Death Gratuity.\" and I am introducing legislation today to change it to \"Fallen Hero Compensation.\" This is a simple change. but it more properly reflects the sacrifices military survivors have made and more properly expresses the gratitude and dignity we owe these families.

Today on the streets of our cities there is a handgun. called the FiveSeveN. that was specifically designed to pierce bulletproof vests like the ones worn by police. The web site for this gun actually brags that it can pierce protective armorthat it is a potential cop killer. One of these weapons was recently confiscated by police officer in Camden. NJ. from a suspect charged with trafficking in large amounts of narcotics. If there had been a gunfight. the police would have been outgunned. Who knows how many copkiller guns are on the streets of my Stateor yours? Police across the nation are alarmed by this weapon. The police chief of Jersey City. Robert Troy. recently pleaded with Congress to ban this gun. Thats why I have introduced the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act to take \"copkiller guns\" off the streets. And. I am pleased Senators CORZINE. SCHUMER and CLINTON are cosponsors of this legislation. There might be a place for this gun on a battlefield ... but not near a playground. Not on our streets. The copkiller gun isnt good for hunting. The last time I checked. deer didnt wear bulletproof vests. It isnt for target shooting. It isnt even a practical weapon for protection against home intruders. The copkiller gun was designed for one thingpiercing the protective armor worn by police officers. This is a weapon a terrorist or criminal would love: light and easily concealed. yet so powerful that it can penetrate a bulletproof vest from a distance of more than two football fields. Armorpiercing bullets are already illegal. but the copkiller gun has slipped through a loophole in the law. Simply put. this gun skirts the law by delivering ammunition with unusual velocity. turning otherwise legal bullets into \"cop killers.\" We cant sit by. We must protect our police.

At the Organization for Security & Cooperation in Europes (OSCE) 1999 conference in Istanbul. Russia signed commitments to withdraw troops from both Georgia and Moldova. While Russia has fulfilled some aspects of those agreements. Russian troops and military bases remain in both countries. In my resolution. I urge Russia to live up to its 1999 Istanbul Commitments. The resolution also addresses concerns about the OSCEs Border Monitoring Operation (BMO) in Georgia. The BMO. which took up its mission in Georgia in 2000. is the sole source of objective reporting on border crossings along Georgias border with the Russian republics of Chechnya. Dagestan. and Ingushetia. Since last June. Russia has called for the closure of the BMO in Georgia. In December. Russia blocked renewal of the mandate for the BMO. stating that it had accomplished nothing. I am disappointed that the OSCE was unable to renew the BMOs mandate. The BMO started shutting down in January and is expected to be fully closed by May. The future of the BMO mission is uncertain. The United States. in cooperation with its European allies. should work to preserve the BMO in Georgia. But if the BMO is not revived. my resolution calls upon the United States and its European allies to seek an international presence to monitor objectively crossings along Georgias border. I am concerned that if Russia does not fulfill its commitments to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova. and if the Border Monitoring Operation in Georgia shuts down. the security situation in the region could further deteriorate. The United States must provide strong leadership on these issues. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am concerned that the Presidents Department of Veterans Affairs fiscal year 2007 budget request does not include adequate funding for VA health care. Specifically. this budget request would require certain veterans to pay a $250 enrollment fee in order to access the health care system each year. In addition. the budget proposes to more than double prescription copayments from $7 to $15. further burdening the limited resources of those who have served our country. The VA estimates that these measures will save the Department an estimated $795 million in 2007. This savings estimate is based not only on collections but on increasing the number of veterans who will optout of the service due to the higher fees. The VA estimates they will force over 1 million veterans. almost half of the Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans. to drop out of the VA health care system. Do we really want our veterans to be faced with the difficult choice of either dropping out of the VA health care system or bearing these additional costs? Those who do not drop out of the VA health care system will be forced to pay hundreds more for their health care. Veterans who receive prescription drugs from the VA and who fill a typical number of prescriptions a year could face new fees amounting to nearly $600. I realize that agencies such as the VA must look for ways to save dollars. but our Nations veterans deserve adequate and affordable health care. While I understand the need to reduce Federal spending. I urge my colleagues to reject these proposals to reduce spending for VA health care in the fiscal year 2007 budget. I believe it is absolutely critical that the VA health care system be fully funded. The Congress has rejected these proposals in the past. and I hope It will do so again this year. Our veterans should not be faced with these choices nor forced to bear this burden. We must keep our promise to care for the veterans who made so many sacrifices to ensure the freedom of so many.",

President Kennedy signed an Executive order that established the Peace Corps whose mission would be to promote peace. mutual understanding. and friendship between Americans and the people of the world. Back then. the world was viewed as engaged in a cold war with the United States and its allies pitted against the Communist bloc. President Kennedy envisioned the Peace Corps as an agency that would create opportunities for Americans to reach out to the rest of the world. and make positive contributions to community development and nationbuilding overseas. As we celebrate the Peace Corpss 45th anniversary. all Americans can be proud of what the agency has accomplished and continues to do. Through its hardworking and committed volunteers who now number nearly 8.000. the Peace Corps provides assistance today in 138 host countries in such fields as education. healthcare. environmental preservation. and business development. Last year. the Peace Corpss Crisis Corps Volunteers helped with rebuilding efforts in tsunamiravaged areas of Sri Lanka and Thailand. And. for the first time in its history. volunteers were deployed at home as approximately 270 volunteers assisted with recovery efforts along the U.S. gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I am also proud to report that the Peace Corps continues to attract Volunteers from Hawaii. At this moment. 12 volunteers from Hawaii are serving in 12 different host countries that include Bulgaria. China. Morocco. Nicaragua. Swaziland. and Tanzania. It is a pleasure to join all Americans in congratulating the Peace Corps and its volunteers past and present for their outstanding work. and for their invaluable and effective civic contributions to communities throughout the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I rise to pay tribute to Arnold Friberg. a gifted American artist. For more than eight decades as a painter. Mr. Friberg has set down a profound and varied body of work. including magazine covers and illustrations. World War II depictions. the Northwest Mounted Police. Book of Mormon illustrations. portraits. including Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth of England. and many rich and dramatic depictions of the Old West. This year marks the 30th anniversary of his revered Prayer at Valley Forge. which shows George Washington at prayer. Along with Emanuel Leutzes Washington Crossing the Delaware. Fribergs Prayer at Valley Forge is one of the great American patriotic paintings. In 1953. Arnold Friberg was summoned to Hollywood by Cecil B. DeMille for a 1month consultation on costume design for a film he was going to remake. DeMille became so impressed by the artist that soon afterward Mr. Friberg was called back to Hollywood and began a warm. personal collaboration with the storied director that lasted for 4 years. Mr. Friberg became DeMilles chief artistdesigner for the wellknown movie \"The Ten Commandments.\" which brought the artist an Academy Award nomination. Half a century later. \"The Ten Commandments\" still draws sizable audiences to television broadcasts and DVD sales. Becoming the visual designer for what DeMille and his set decorators and cameramen put on film. Mr. Friberg painted major scenes of the salient episodes in the Old Testament including The Finding of Moses. Moses and the Burning Bush. First Passover. Exodus Begins. Orgy of the Golden Calf. Moses Receiving the Law. and Crossing of the Red Sea. Visually. the film was built around these scenes. along with major costume designs created by the artist. After completion of the film. Mr. Fribergs original paintings were widely exhibited wherever the film opened. and more than 1 million copies of a catalog depicting them were sold. The golden anniversary of the release of the film is being celebrated this month at an exhibition of these marvelous paintings. along with artifacts from the film. at the Utah Cultural Celebration Center in West Valley City. UT. I am honored today to acknowledge the work of Arnold Friberg and add my name to the long list of Americans who are grateful for his outstanding contributions.9",

Before a soldout crowd of over 8.000 fans. the tenacious Scarlet Knights achieved one of college basketballs most coveted titles: Big East Conference champions. In the process. Rutgers also became only the third team in history to finish its regular season undefeated. This victory did not come easily. but the Scarlet Knights came ready to play. thirsty to win. and eager to give the Connecticut Huskies a run for their money. Despite trailing UConn by 18 points in the first half. Rutgers refused to give up. Instead. they regrouped. refueled. and used strong defense and solid teamwork to make up the point deficit. Led by head coach C. Vivian Stringer and senior standout Cappie Pondexter. the Scarlet Knights played a flawless second half that capped an outstanding season. By the time the final buzzer rang. the Rutgers women had proven that they can compete with any team in the Nation. More importantly. after winning their second straight conference title. the Scarlet Knights confirmed that hard work. perseverance. and desire remain the keys to success. With four New Jersey natives on their roster. including Big East Defensive Player of the Year Essence Carson. these young women have become a source of pride for my home State. Coach Stringer. in particular. deserves special recognition for the strong coaching and leadership skills she has demonstrated over her 10 years at Rutgers University. As one of the most recognized and most respected coaches in the game. she was inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. I think I speak for both the Scarlet Knights and the Rutgers community when I say how pleased I am to have Coach Stringer leading this remarkable team. Mr. President. on behalf of the entire State of New Jersey. I am proud to congratulate the Scarlet Knights once again for their second consecutive Big East Conference title. As the Scarlet Knights begins this years NCAA tournament. we hope they are able to maintain the momentum that carried them so well through the regular season. We wish them the best of luck.9",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church on 100 years of worship and service to the community. This milestone was recently commemorated with 2 days of events. culminating in a dance and dinner celebration that took place on March 6. 2006. This momentous occasion provides the perfect opportunity to reflect on Redfords rich history and to remember the integral role Redford has played in the community over the years. Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church was established in March 1906 by a small congregation that served what was then known as the Sand Hill in Detroit. The churchs membership grew rapidly. and as a result. in 1929. a separate addition was built to accommodate the larger congregation. Unfortunately. in 1945 the sanctuary was completely destroyed by a fire. However. this tragedy provided an important opportunity for the congregation and community to work together to rebuild the church. and by 1954. a new sanctuary. educational wing and fellowship hall was constructed. By the late 1960s. the membership had grown to more than 3.600 people. Today. Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church has a smaller congregation but has maintained its strong spirit. deep faith and unwavering commitment to serve and minister to the greater Detroit community. For the last 30 years the church has run a daycare center that helps to meet the needs of many working parents in the community. In addition. Redfords educational building is currently being leased to a charter school and is also used by a local division of Sea Cadets. Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church also continues to make its building available to many groups and organizations in the neighborhood. Considered a cornerstone of the community. Redford consistently provides meeting space for groups such as Narcotics Anonymous and Metro Detroit Deaf Senior Citizens. And. for 1 night each January. the church opens its doors to house. feed. clothe. and minister to the homeless. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Redford Avenue Presbyterian Church and wish its members. volunteers. and ministerial staff many more years of fellowship and service.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006. I am proud to say there are over 20 Senators who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. including our colleague from Massachusetts. Senator KERRY. I wish to thank Senator KERRY for his support. and for the support of all of the other original cosponsors who have joined me on this significant legislative reform proposal. The legislation itself is long overdue. It is an authority provided in one version or another to 43 Governors today. It is an authority that has been requested by at least 11 Presidents. including Franklin Roosevelt. Harry Truman. Dwight Eisenhower. Ronald Reagan. and Bill Clinton. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006. first outlined by President Bush yesterday. when enacted will provide the President and the Congress with a tool to surgically remove specific spending and targeted tax benefits from broader enacted legislation. Unlike the line item veto legislation that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in 1998. this is clearly constitutional. The legislation builds upon current Presidential rescission authorities changing the current process to require Congress to act. one way or the other. on the Presidents proposed removal of Items in enacted law. This new procedure guarantees an upordown vote on the Presidents proposed rescissions. without amendments. I was trying to think how to describe this procedure when people ask. and one might think of it as similar to the Armed Forces BRAC Commission process. I am really talking about the approach. the procedure itself. By that. I mean that the President proposes and the Congress. under expedited procedures. within 10 days. approves or disapproves of the legislation that rescinds spending. including both appropriation items or entitlement spending. The one spending program which would be exempt from this process is Social Security. The legislation is balanced in that it would also allow the President to eliminate revenuelosing provisions that provide Federal tax benefits to 100 or fewer beneficiaries or provide temporary or transitional relief to 10 or fewer beneficiaries. I am encouraged by the broad bipartisan support for this reform legislation. I hope this Congress will act on the bill to provide us another tool to control unnecessary and wasteful spending in tax expenditures. It is just good government. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join with Senators FRIST. MCCAIN. and others as a cosponsor of legislation to establish a Presidential line item veto. This is a fiscally prudent measure which could reduce wasteful spending and bring down our Nations deficit. The proposal would give the President the authority to strike wasteful spending measures from legislation. to ensure that the American taxpayer is not footing the bill for projects that are not national priorities. I applaud President Bush for putting forth this initiative. which would be significant progress in the fight to reduce nonessential spending. Throughout our countrys history. the line item veto has enjoyed a long line of bipartisan support. with Presidents such as Ulysses Grant. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan. and Bill Clinton calling for the authority. Additionally. the power has been given to Governors in 43 of the 50 States. I am pleased that the proposed legislation would require the President to send recision proposals back to Congress for final passage. Not only does this make the legislation consistent with the Constitution. it also limits the scope of any Presidents veto authority. as proposed changes will need congressional approval. I am heartened to see this call for fiscal responsibility from President Bush. I have joined as a cosponsor of this legislation because it will be impossible for us to reduce our national debt and balance the Federal budget unless we curb wasteful spending. I have been an advocate for the payasyougo budget rule. which would require Congress to pay for any new spending or tax cuts. and will continue to press for Its adoption. Since chronic deficits add to the burden of debt we are bequeathing to future generations. congressional spending must be reigned in. and I am pleased to support this proposal which is one tool that can improve spending discipline in Washington.

In February 2004. the subcommittee held a hearing entitled \"DOD Contractors Who Cheat on Their Taxes. which examined the IRS failure to collect $3 billion in unpaid taxes owed by contractors doing business with the Department of Defense. DOD. and getting paid with taxpayer dollars. In June 2005. the Subcommittee held a hearing entitled \"Civilian Contractors Who Cheat on Their Taxes\". which identified an additional $3.3 billion in unpaid taxes and demonstrated that the problem of tax delinquent Federal contractors is not confined to DOD. Because of the potential revenue that could be collected by the Federal Payment Levy Program from nonDOD contractors. the subcommittee expanded the coverage of the investigation to include contractors at other Federal agencies who receive Federal contract payments and are delinquent in paying their taxes.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Foreign Language Training Act of 2006. a bill that I believe is necessary for the success of our Department of Homeland Security personnel and other Federal agents. As you may know. our Department of Defense employees receive foreign language education and training at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center. This school has provided training for American forces involved in arms control treaty verification. the war on drugs. and Operation Desert Storm. I believe the Department of Defenses success can provide guidance for Department of Homeland Security personnel and Federal law enforcement agents who need foreign language skills. The Foreign Language Training Act of 2006 provides for such guidance by creating a facility similar to the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center for these Federal employees. My bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security and other Federal agency leaders to identify employees who need foreign language education and plan for the provision of such education. To fully utilize existing Federal assets. the Foreign Language Training Act requires this training to take place at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Artesia. New Mexico. FLETC is already planning to increase its language training capabilities and construct new language arts facilities in Artesia to accommodate the increased number of border patrol trainees being sent there. so it makes sense for other DHS employees and Federal agents to utilize this facility as well. Mr. President. the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center has prepared our soldiers for World War II. the Cold War. the Korean War. and the Vietman conflict. It continues to provide such training today. I believe that similar training is necessary for the men and women securing our homeland. and the Foreign Language Training Act of 2006 provides for such education.

But if we keep having delays such as people coming back tonight to vote on motions to instruct. on which we could argue as to how useful that actually is. or we have too many procedural roadblocks based on this bill. it is going to be impossible for us to move ahead and move the country forward when we have so much important legislation. So I think we can complete all of our business this week. but it is going to take a lot of cooperation on both sides of the aisle not to throw too many procedural roadblocks in front of us.

He continued to lead troops long after his children were grown. training boys to follow the same Scout Oath that he lived every day of his life. Mr. Sternke also contributed to the strength and development of the Boy Scout institution in innumerable other ways. As a trainer and training chairman. Mr. Stemke was responsible for helping many young Scouters become leaders. He helped design emblems. certificates and badges. some of which are still used by troops today. His awardwinning design for the Boys Life Display for the 1981 National Jamboree brought national attention to the Milwaukee Boy Scouts Council. Throughout the period of his involvement. Mr. Sternke received numerous awards from the Boy Scouts. I am especially impressed that Mr. and Mrs. Sternke were awarded the Silver Beaver Award in 1975 as a tribute to their work together in training young Scouters. Clearly. these two provided a model of leadership that could inspire youth to dedicate themselves to family. community and country.

The attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and on September 11. 2001. exposed serious communication problems for the New York City Fire Department. FDNY. Since these attacks. there have been major efforts to improve the FDNYs communication system. but much more needs to be done. As we all know New York City is repeatedly mentioned as a top terrorist target and the lack of a fullyfunctional communications system is a threat not only to FDNY and New York residents lives. but also to all those who visit there. The terrorist attacks were not just attacks on New York City. but on the Nation. With New York as a continuing top terrorist target. the protection of New York City is becoming a national responsibility. Other cities with tall buildings throughout the country face the same challenges with their communication systems and will need the same upgrades. Improvements in New York will lay the groundwork for improvements to communications systems across the country. Recognizing this need. the 9/11 Can You Hear Me Now Act instructs the Department of Homeland Security. DHS. to provide the FDNY with a communication system that must be capable of operating in all locations and under the circumstances we know firefighters face and will continue to face when responding to an emergency in New York City. This bill would require a communication system that includes three componentsradios. dispatch system and a supplemental communication device. It would require it to work in all buildings and in all parts of the city. something that the radios. unbelievably. do not now do. The supplemental communication device would allow firefighters to transmit an audible emergency distress signal when a firefighter is in need of immediate assistance. and DHS would work with the city of New York in their planned upgrades of the emergency 911 system and any interoperability initiatives with other public safety communication systems.

We have gotten good. bipartisaneven nonpartisanlegislation passed into law that has helped. and will continue to help. all Americans save for a better future. I am very happy with the Presidents choice to promote (or at least move) ROB to U.S. Trade Representative. where I know he will provide an intelligent. thoughtful voice on trade. I look forward to working with him in his new capacity to provide a level playing field for U.S. workers and freer international markets for U.S. goods. Today we introduce legislation that represents our progress on creating the next generation of Portman/Cardin pension legislation. These bills demonstrate the progress we have made and the goals we would like to pursue. I look forward to continuing this process that Congressman PORTMAN and I have started as I continue to serve here in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bills we introduce today include a refundable. permanent savers credit to give lowerincome and younger workers more money to work with in saving for their future. We include incentives for employers to provide automatic enrollment in retirement plans to make saving easier for younger workers. We include incentives for choosing lifetime annuitant retirement. to ensure that retirement savings last a lifetime. This legislation makes permanent all of the pension improvements we made in 2001. including the availability of catchup contributions. increased contribution limits. and increased portability of retirement savings. The major difference between the two bills filed today is that the legislation that I have authored does not include increases to the income caps for Roth IRAs. Once the Joint Tax Committee has scored this legislation. I intend to work with my colleagues to offer revenue offsets to mitigate any effect the enactment of this legislation could have on our budget deficit. I want to thank my friend. ROB. for being such a good. steadfast partner in helping Americans to plan for their futures. His commitment. intelligence. and willingness to put aside politics to create the best policy have been a credit to him and have made a difference in the lives of countless Americans.",

She has been teaching special education in Comal ISD for 14 years. Currently. she is a Behavior Resource teacher for all grades. kindergarten through 6th grade. at the Comal Elementary School. As a Behavior Resource teacher. Stich helps manage behavioral problems at school and provides a safe nurturing environment for the children. She also helps the administration identify and implement appropriate behavior management ideas at school. She summarizes her teaching philosophy this way: \"One belief that I now hold is that teaching (and behavioral management) requires doing things with kids. and not to them.\" Stich understands that students need to have a voice in their own education. As an educator. she realizes the importance in watching. observing. and taking cues directly from the children. It is this philosophy that has allowed Becky Stich to become such a welcoming and great resource for children and educators alike. Her attitude and dedication to children is an inspiration to the rest of the community.

I would like to recognize the organizations and individuals who work so hard to break the cycle of violence within families. I urge my colleagues to continue to make eradicating child abuse a top priority. not just during the month of April. but all year long. Throughout this month we have had many reminders of the tragic events that occur daily in the lives of children throughout the nation. Weve heard speeches with startling statistics. stories about families torn apart by unthinkable violence. and weve worn blue ribbons to remember victims. Sadly. child abuse continues throughout the year. and we all must recognize that child abuse and neglect is not just a family problemit is a societal problem that requires the attention and efforts of each of our communities. Effective child abuse programs succeed because of partnerships between social service agencies. schools. faith communities. civic organizations. law enforcements agencies. government. and the business community. The Exchange Club of Yonkers and the Westchester Child Abuse Prevention Center in my district are just two examples of groups that are making a difference both locally and nationally to eliminate the abuse of children. Both of these organizations work with families in a variety of ways to help break the cycle of abuse and educate the public about ways to help children who are victims of abuse. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to work with organizations nationally and locally to show children that they are a priority and to take a stand against the tragedy of child abuse and neglect.",

I stand with them and with ArmenianAmericans in the 6th District of Massachusetts as we rightfully recognize and renounce the unpardonable horror that occurred 90 years ago. What began in 1915 when Ottoman Empire officials forcibly led Armenians to their brutal death lasted until 1923. Those 8 long years saw the deaths of 1.5 million innocent victims. who were unsuspectingly led from their homes. their schools. their places of work and worship only to be systematically slaughtered at the hands of Turkish guards. All the while. the world stood silent. failing to act despite the fact the number of unmarked graves multiplied exponentially throughout Armenia. The tremendous magnitude of this genocide did not move prominent nations or their people to act. This is why. today. as we remember the victims of the Armenian genocide. we must also reject our collective unresponsiveness to this mass murder. Regrettably. this pattern continued throughout the 20th centuryin Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. in Rwanda in the 1990s. and elsewhere throughout the world. Another such tragic example has emerged in Sudan. It is estimated that 300.000 or more people have been massacred in Darfur. One million people have been displaced from their homes. and more than 200.000 refugees have been forced to flee to neighboring Chad. We must not continue to ignore the dire situation in Darfur. In fact. the lessons of the Armenian Genocide. among others. should teach us that we must take further action in Sudan. Today. I honor the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. offer my respects to those who were killed. and pay tribute to the commitment and perseverance of the ArmenianAmericans who have tirelessly struggled to ensure that the great sorrow of their people becomes known to all people.",

I wish to thank my colleague from Washington for yielding. and. more importantly. for his leadership on this important issue. Madam Speaker. President Bush reminded the American people last week that he is a decider. His decisions affecting our economy. gas prices in particular. decidedly favor the wealthiest of his base. Thanks to terribly misguided economic priorities. oil and gas CEOs get two tax breaks for the price of one. Subsidies worth $16.5 billion in the energy bill make it possible for oil and gas companies to lavish obscene compensation on their CEOs. who then. in turn. get to claim another break on capital gains and dividends. This belies both the need for permanent rate cuts and the industrys argument that market forces instead of price fixing are responsible for gas approaching $4 a gallon. Do not take my word for it. IRS data show that for the 90 percent of all taxpayers who made less than $100.000. dividend cuts benefited only 1 in 7. and capital gains reductions helped just 1 in 20. While congressional leaders seem prepared to allow a stealth middleclass tax increase. which will negatively impact 19 million families. they are insisting on extending the dividends and capital gains cuts which will shower benefits on only 234.000 families in the main. We can thank our President and congressional majority for these terrible choices and for the disastrous results. Therefore. Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the McDermott motion to restore sanity to our economic and energy policies. and so that they reflect the real values. needs and priorities of middleclass families and consumers.",

We want to make sure that the American people are protected from the time it comes out of the ground until you put it in your vehicle.

Pt. 5 April 20. 2005 the RECORD. But I do want to support the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of the Abercrombie Amendment. This amendment will authorize a modest program to develop ethanol from sugar cane. which would be added to fuel in Hawaii to meet the EPA Clean Air Act requirements for oxygenated fuels. The State of Hawaii also mandated a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline in the state in order to improve the states air quality. Hawaii must meet Federal standards for clean air by mandating clean burning fuel. Ethanol is currently the only acceptable ingredient to blend with gasoline to meet Clean Air Act requirements. Unfortunately for Hawaii the dominant crop is sugar instead of com. If Hawaii grew corn. they would already be receiving tax credits for ethanol production like almost every other state in the nation. According to the Congressional Research Service the tax credits for ethanol production will total more than $1.4 billion. Congress annually provides tax credits. research funding and grants to turn rice straw. biomass. agriculture waste. woody debris and corn into ethanol. Congress is spending billions to increase our nations production and consumption of ethanol from every source imaginable. Congress has decided ethanol production is worthwhile. and has provided at least $10 billion in incentives and tax credits since 1978 when an alcohol tax exemption was made law. Congress should pass this amendment in order to have a consistent ethanol policy. Mr. Chairman. I urge passage of this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment to address what is a critical shortage of labor within the oil and gas industry and the mineral industries. Since 1999 there has been a significant drop in the number of jobs in the oil field. As the price of oil and natural gas have fluctuated. workers have come and gone in this industry. We are now at a point where we are at a critical shortage of workers across the spectrum. roughnecks. well service hands. pulling unit hands and others. as well as the technical engineers. geologists. geophysicists. They are key to continuing the search for domestic production. As an example. one community in my district. Kermit. Texas. in 19981999 had some 9.000 people living there. As a result of the downturn in those years and the loss of jobs. that community now has 6.000 people living there. Even with the significant increases in the price of natural gas and crude oil that we are experiencing today. those people have not come back to Kermit. Texas. We are facing this critical shortage. My amendment would simply require the Energy Department. in consultation with the Interior Department as well as the Labor Department. to conduct a study of the impact that this shortage is having and to present possible solutions to the shortage. By way of trying to be a bit dramatic. each barrel of oil we import. each MCF of natural gas we import. adds to our trade deficit each and every day. The need to import a barrel of oil or the need to import an MCF of natural gas causes us to remain dependent on those foreign sources. I speak in favor of this amendment. Mr. Chairman.

As an oil and gas service company. we did not actually own oil and gas wells. but we owned a company that repaired the wells. My wife and I faced the problem daily of where to find employees and how to retain those employees. In the 19992000 period. the price of oil fell to $6 for New Mexico type of oil. Revenues in service companies like ours fell to 20 percent of the original values. Although my wife and I were able to keep every employee for the duration of that period of time. about 11 months. many. many of the firms laid off 68 to 70 percent of their employees and gave pay cuts in the industry. That is the sort of cyclical thing that we face in the oil and gas industry. and now that the price has come back up. literally there are no workers to be had because they do not wanted to come back to a cyclical industry. We face limitations on production based on the lack of availability of labor. So I think that this important study should be done to find out where we can get labor. where we can get solutions to simply keep our oil fields working.

EPA has no outstanding refinery permit requests. and if there were a problem. there would be a backlog. and there is none. Putting DOE in charge will create more bureaucracy. not more refineries.

The applicant would appeal to the Secretary of Energy who would just simply overturn the corps. Refineries often are not located near navigable waterways to facilitate barge traffic. If the corps said. no. you are going to do something that is going to obstruct navigation. the Secretary of Energy could overturn the corps.

What John Smith does is he gets these old cars and he goes to county fairs. He builds a ramp and jumps three or four other cars. He is kind of a daredevil. He works in a machine shop in Makoti.

He is in the Guinness Book of World Records for driving a car 500 miles in reverse. averaging 36 miles an hour.

In my judgment. it does- nothing to address the central issues facing us in fiscal policy. I believe my colleague described the accurate numbers. If we go to page 5. for example. what we find is this: Federal debt subject to limit. Line 6 says. in fiscal year 2005. that Federal debt subject to limit is going to be $7.9 trillion. and then at the end of the fifth year of the budget. it is going to be $11.1 trillion.

In the Senators budget. it is true. he has put in $50 billion for the coming year. But that is well short of what the Congressional Budget Office tells us is going to be necessary. The amendment we offered on our side In committee was to fully fund the war obligations according to what the Congressional Budget Office has told us would be required. Mr. President. I am happy to yield 20 minutes to my colleague. the Senator from Oregon. who is a valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee.",

    "speech": "You totally defeat the point. if you have to replace the revenue by taking it out of the economy somewhere else. if you have to replace it in the Federal Treasury. So it makes no sense to put more money back in up here and then be required to take it out down here. But the exact opposite is the case with respect to Government spending because it takes money out of the private economy. if you are going to finance that spending. Taking resources out of the private economy hurts economic growth because these resources could be used more efficiently by private actors than the Government. So If Congress raises marginal tax rates to finance the spending. it will hurt the economy even more by reducing beneficial incentives to work and save and invest. But with respect to spending. paygo makes every bit of sense in the world. If Congress increases Government spending in one area and then pays for it by reducing Government spending in another area. Congress has not taken resources. net resources from the private economy. alleviating at least some of the negative economic effects of excess Government spending. And by not further adding to the deficit. Congress Is acting more responsibly with taxpayer dollars that it does collect. So the bottom line is that paygo makes absolutely no sense with respect to tax cuts. the whole point of which is to leave more revenue in the private sector. It makes every bit of sense with respect to spending increases because there your whole point is to try to keep spending level. So if you increase it in one area. obviously you need to cut it by a like amount in another area. thus the socalled paygo. I hope these remarks help to make the point that we have a great and robust economy. and that we can sustain that growth by the sensible policies that are embodied in the budget that has been presented by the Budget Committee. I certainly encourage my colleagues. as this debate unfolds. to appreciate the arguments that we have made today and to support the budget that has been submitted.",

It is my understanding in this particular proposal there is a $70 billion tax cut. Am I correct. there is approximately $70 billion that will be included in this budget? So there are questions of priorities. that there will be $70 billion in tax cuts at a time when we are listening to those talking about the pressures that are on the States in terms of Medicaid. I am wondering whether the Senator would agree with me that we have seen a loss of health insurance for 5 million American workers. a growth in poverty among childrennearly three quarters of a million more children fell into poverty between 2002 and 2003. and 4 million more Americans fell into poverty in the last four years. and the States are hard pressed. Would the Senator not agree with me that all of us are strongly against the kind of asset protection frauds that take place? That isnt what we are talking about here. My understanding of this is that there are going to be some real cuts for people and real benefits for people. I was interested in what the Senator from North Dakota felt about these priorities.",

I know the budget from our friends on the other side doesnt reduce the deficit. though they say It does. If you examine the document itself. look on page 5 and see how it increases the debt each and every year by more than $600 billion. by their own calculation.

They have said that lawmakersturnedlobbyists can no longer use the House gym. Apparently. the thinking here is that fat cats will no longer be entitled to skinny lobbyists. Where the real sweating has actually taken place in these five months. where the real heavy lifting has occurred. is by Republicans who have .been in a continual workout to create the impression they were doing something while actually changing nothing about the way this House operates. It was as if the idea was to have a press conference and give a few speeches and not expect anything to happen because that press conference announcing their legislation was the highwater mark. After that. as to each provision of the bill it was the weak getting weaker at every stage of this process. How do you measure the cost of corruption to the American people that is occurring here? The cost is reflected in the experience that our seniors (and those who are helping them) are having right now with the prescription drug bill written for pharmaceutical manufacturers instead of the people that needed the help. The cost is reflected in the nobid contracts. whether in Iraq or in response to Hurricane Katrina. and the price that the jobless. the homeless. and the hopeless are paying for the corruption of this Administration. The cost of a failed energy policy is reflected in the price we pay at the pump every time we fill up. That is the cost of corruption. The bill before us today is not designed to curb the cost of corruption. just to deflect criticism from Republicans for doing nothing about it. The culture of corruption will not end in this city and in this country with one Members conviction or resignation. and it certainly will not end when the Republican leadership is here today simply resigned to business as usual.",

You know. we do this in campaign finance. and the same openness should apply to these transactions. And I thank the gentleman for including that proposal in this package.

I think that the legislative branch has a role to play in this area. It is not simply an area for the executive branch to play. But it is an area where the transparency and the light of day should shine on all earmarks. Transparency will then make sure that the good ones rise to the top and actually will be passed and the other ones which are not so good will obviously fall by the wayside.

The main thing I want to bring to your attention is that. throughout the scandals that have illustrated how large sums of money were spent secretly to conduct lobbying campaigns. the current Lobbying Disclosure Act requires the disclosure of lobbying activities that involve direct contact with Members of Congress. but there is no disclosure requirement for professional lobbying firms that are retained to spend money on campaigns aimed at stimulating the public to lobby Congress. including multimillion dollar advertising campaigns. We need stronger revolving door provisions. So I rise reluctantly against a Lobbying Accountability and Transparency Act that does not seriously reform the system. This bill really represents an effort for some to have It both ways. holding on to the financial benefits and perks they receive from lobbyists and other special interests. while claiming they have dealt with the lobbying ethics problems in Congress. This Republican proposal is problematic because it does not address the problems that have given rise to the recent lobbying scandals and the falling confidence of Americans in the integrity of Congress. The ban on privately sponsored travel. as you have heard. only exists through this years elections. The corporate subsidized campaign travel and other officially related travel is still allowed.

We have seen scandal after scandal emerging in the past year that has demonstrated that the way business has been done in Washington must be changed. The public deserves to have an open government with honest elected officials who are truly acting in the best interests of their constituents. not their own personal or financial interests. Its time for the culture of corruption to end. Yet the bill that has come to the floor today does little to reform the lobbying process. I am disappointed that the Rules Committee failed to make in order numerous Democratic amendments that would have enacted fundamental changes including a substitute amendment that contained provisions from the \"Honest Leadership and Open Government Act\" which I and many of my Democratic colleagues have cosponsored. This legislation. among other important provisions. would clean up the government contracting process. ensure that votes on the House floor are not held open for hours to twist arms. and ban gifts from lobbyists.

We have an opportunity today to make significant changes in the way we perform the peoples business and to help restore the peoples confidence in their elected representatives. With this bill. the majority. who only a few months ago was shouting for reform. has failed to seize this opportunity. In fact. it has presented a bill that contains no significant reform at all. Throughout the country. far too many people believe that Congress gives its vote to the highest bidder. This perception must be eliminated. but the minor changes in this bill will not do so. Restoration of the peoples respect of Congress requires one thingthat we change the way our political campaigns are financed. While our campaign finance rules have been strengthened over the years. they remain insufficient.

The measure is a woefully inadequate response to the most significant ethics and lobbying scandals that have swept Capitol Hill in nearly three decades. Even lobbyists say so. When asked about the significance of the House lobbying reform bill by The Buffalo News. Paul Miller. president of the American League of Lobbyists answered: \"That little thing?\" In fact. the measure is a ruse that fails to address any of the major problems with congressional ethics and lobbying that have surfaced over the past year. When it comes to lobbying reform. Congress is not up to the task. H.R. 4975 takes a cynical approach to reforming lobbying disclosure and behavior on Capitol Hill and is opposed by Public Citizen and other reform groups. The bill fails to restrict campaign fundraising activities by lobbyisis. fails to ban gifts from lobbyists. fails to curb revolving door abuses. and fails to create an independent oversight and compliance office. It bans privately sponsored travelbut only until after the next election. This legislation not only is inadequate. it makes a mockery of the lobbying reform drive. To make matters worse. a very restrictive rule has been attached to the bill that prohibits floor consideration of any strengthening amendments. which means that the bill cannot be improved upon when the House considers it on Wednesday. Representative CHRIS SHAYS. MARTY MEEHAN and others have offered a package of strong reforms that are prohibited from consideration because of this rule.",

California as the Sierra Club honors him with the Earl Thollander Award for his outstanding environmental achievements. Mikes keen interest in the environment has led him to a lifetime dedicated to environmental preservation. After earning his Bachelor of Science degree from California State University. Huiboldt and his Masters Degree from Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government. Mike returned to Napa County where he has made numerous invaluable contributions to our community. Mr. Speaker. Mike is known to be a softspoken man. but his actions resonate throughout the community. After garbage companies threatened to turn the Napa County into San Franciscos dumping grounds in the 1980s and 90s. Mike quickly took action. A passionate and dedicated man. Mike worked tirelessly to fight the garbage companies. spearheading an opposition group that raised awareness of the potentially hazardous landfills. His activism was met with overwhelming success. He was not only able to stop the creation of these landtills. but also encouraged the garbage companies to implement recycling as a method of reducing unnecessary waste. He has also served on multiple environmental boards across Northern California including the CalFed Task ForceBay Area Water Forum and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Mike also chaired the Napa County Local Agency Formation Commission working to prevent urban sprawl. Mr. Speaker. from 1992 until 2004. Mike served on the Napa County Board of Supervisors. During his tenure. Mike played an integral role in the creation and implementation of the Napa River Flood Control Project. Each year heavy winter rain has caused the Napa [ENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 6 River to flood. destroying many homes and hundreds of acres of land. Instead of constructing man made channels to redirect the flooding river. Mike helped design an environmentally sound alternative to allow the river to flow naturally without damaging homes or land. Mikes most recent accomplishment has been the creation of the new solar powered Sheriffs office which is the only law enforcement building in the country to have been awarded a National Leadership in Energy Efficiency Gold Certificate. Mr. Speaker. it is necessary that we take this time to thank Mike Rippey for his service and dedication to protecting our environment and ask that you join me in wishing him the best in all his future endeavors.",

The Parish consists of a campus of buildings that include the Dominican Priory. the Church. the School and the Parish Hall. While those buildings define the physical presence of the parish in the neighborhood and Jersey City community. the most important and lasting features of the parish are the people of Sacred Heart. Sacred Heart Parish was approved by Bishop OConnor on February 14. 1905. The Church building was designed by Ralph Adams Cram who was guided in the Dominican tradition by Father McNicholas. O.P. and Spanish Gothic was the basis for the church design. The long history of Sacred Heart School is a story of deeply rooted faith. passionate work and a belief that the spirit inspires all undertakings. It encompasses the response of a parish. the Sisters of Charity. dedicated teachers and volunteers. It is a story of children educated in knowledge and values. And. it is a story of a good seed planted and sown and brought to fruition. Mr. Speaker. I know my colleagues agree that the Parish of Sacred Heart and the surrounding community have every right to be proud of the lasting contributions that Sacred Heart has made to the residents of Jersey City.

The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching identifies outstanding mathematics and science teachers in all 50 States. the District of Columbia. Puerto Rico. the U.S. Territories and the U.S. Department of Defense Schools. This year the awards focused on K6th grade teachers. Each teacher receives $10.000 and a trip to our Nations Capital. The requirements for this award are difficult to attain and demand a great deal of effort on the part of the teacher. It is only given to those teachers who embody excellence in teaching. demonstrate devotion to the students. and are able to uphold the high standards that exemplify American education at its finest. It recognizes the important contributions teachers make to American young people and to the promise of Americas future. I am very proud of this Kentucky teachers accomplishments. Since she began teaching in 1958. she has been an inspiration to many students. In the news release concerning the Award. one of Ms. Hortons students was quoted as saying. \"Teaching is the art of making learning irresistible.\" I have no doubt which teacher that student was talking about.

The widespread use of tobacco and devastating effects of secondhand smoke create a serious environmental health risk for Americas children. Since its inception 5 years ago. the American Legacy Foundation. a nonprofit health organization dedicated to building a world where young people reject tobacco and anyone can quit. has worked to discourage adult and youth tobacco use and reduce the effects of secondhand smoke. Passive exposure through secondhand smoke. or environmental tobacco smoke. puts children at risk for a range of negative health consequences including asthma. ear infections. bronchitis. pneumonia. reduced lung function. respiratory infection. and other chronic respiratory symptoms. According to current population survey data. 13.8 million kids ages 0 to 17 are exposed to secondhand smoke and 22 percent of middle school students and 24 percent of high school students are exposed to secondhand smoke in the home. American Legacys campaigns and programs to reduce smoking are helping to reduce the number of young people breathing environmental tobacco smoke. The Environmental Protection Agency is recognizing the Foundation because of its initiatives to address the negative health effects of tobacco. Outreach efforts include public awareness campaigns and initiatives designed to educate and empower youth to take action against the environmental health threat that smoking and secondhand smoke poses to them. It is with great pleasure today that I commend the agency for its program of recognition and the American Legacy Foundation for its award. 9",

I do not think that is true. and it only serves to lower the morale of the men and women fighting in Iraq while encouraging the terrorists who hate America. The fact is those who assert that the Iraq policy is failing frankly fail to recognize the many successes that have occurred on a daily basis over there. What we are talking about is fighting terror and liberating a people. Look at just the political successes. They have had two elections. and those two elections. most of those people had never voted in a free election in their entire lives. On October 15. they adopted a Constitution. They did not know what a Constitution was. and 78 percent of the voters backed the charter of the Constitution. We are making enormous progress toward liberty and democracy for the Iraqi people. and by extension the people of the Middle East. I say thank you. troops. for what you are doing. We love you. and we are going to be with you until the job is done.",

Let me read this letter. \"I am sure you are extremely busy today with the announcement of your support for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. We have been trying unsuccessfully to reach you by phone. \"My husband is an injured Iraq soldier who so highly commends you for speaking out about this disastrous war and its aftermath on U.S. troops. Though we are now living in Washington. D.C.. on the Walter Reed campus. we are originally from your 12th District in Pennsylvania. \"Congressman Murtha actually pinned my husbands Purple Heart. We are so proud that he was the man to honor my husband for what he did in Iraq. It may serve Mr. Murtha more to remind him that my husband is the 24yearold guardsman who lost part of a leg in a suicide car bomb attack in April of this year. \"We were shocked and overjoyed that Murtha spoke out against the Bush administrations handling of the war. Unlike what many say is a blow to troop morale by questioning the war. his frank call for attention to the subject brought nods and applause from the injured soldiers at Walter Reeds Mologne House. It is the first that my husband and I feel that a politician has truly stuck up for the soldiers most personally affected by the war in Iraq.\" We send the soldiers to the war. We are the ones that make that decision. We also have to speak out when we do not think the war is going in the right direction. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

It is not one of the more expensive of our programs although it has been. at $60 million. not nothing. The President in his budget proposed I think $50 million for it. but proposed that instead of being funded out of the HUD budget it be transferred to the Labor Departments budget. That led to. I guess. it falling between the cracks of the two appropriate subcommittees. so that while I understand there is support for the program and the gentleman from New York . a former chairman of the HUD subcommittee. tells me that he strongly supports it. and I understand there was a very close vote in the Appropriations Committee on an amendment to put it back into the bill. both bills now come to the floor without that appropriation for Youth Build. And I think this is a case of something not being rejected on the merits. or not being something we cannot afford. but something that has sort of fallen through the cracks because of this proposed change in where it goes.

I support this bill because it moves us towards a more stable. reliable electricity grid. protects our consumers. and includes much needed investments in renewable sources of energy. I am especially pleased that this bill strengthens the reliability of our electricity grid and protects ratepayers from market abuses. particularly in the wake of Enron and the massive blackouts that struck parts of the Midwest and Northeast 2 years ago. I am also pleased that the bill reauthorizes the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. LIHEAP. This program protects our most vulnerable citizens by assisting them with their heating and cooling bills. I am also pleased that the conference report does not contain many of the most harmful provisions that were included in this legislation in the past. The bill does not allow for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ANWR. The bill also does not include provisions that would shield producers of gasoline additives from lawsuits. I strongly opposed these provisions in the past and am pleased they are not included in this bill. Unfortunately. the bill does contain some questionable environmental provisions. I am also disappointed that the bill does not include important provisions I supported in the Senate bill. particularly the renewable portfolio standard. steps to deal with global warming. and requirements that would have lessened our dependence on foreign oil. In the end. this is not the bill that the Democrats would have written. It doesnt address the most pressing issues facing our country today: skyhigh gas prices. global warming. and our growing dependence on foreign oil. But the bill does take important steps to strengthen the reliability of our electricity grid. protect consumers from market abuses. and move us towards greater use of renewable sources of energy. This is just the beginning of a serious debate that will continue in the halls of Congress and in communities all across the country in the days to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to thank you for your dedicated work in defending the Senatepassed Energy bill language in conference. particularly concerning the energy efficiency tax incentives. For the first time. there will be energy efficiency tax incentives for commercial buildings for each of the three energyusing systems of the buildingthe envelope. the heating. cooling and water heating system. and lighting. Each is eligible for onethird of the $1.80 per square foot tax incentive if it meets its share of the wholebuilding savings goal. This will apply to buildings that cut energy use by 50 percent. an ambitious but very important target as buildings account for 35 percent of our Nations energy usage. and commercial buildings are a large part of that percentage. My concern is that. because the eligibility period was cut back from the end of 2010 to just 2 years. this shorter window of effectiveness could undercut the program. since the time it takes to design and construct these large buildings and skyscrapers could take longer than the 2 years of eligibility. This is especially a concern as the incentives for commercial buildings is one of the fastest ways in the entire Energy bill that we can cut down the Nations energy usage in the short term.",

I wish to confinn that certain language in the Conference Report to the Energy bill. with respect to the Internal Revenue Service stopping the issuance of private letter rulings and other taxpayerspecific guidance regarding the section 29 credit. actually refers to a solid fuel produced from coal and \"coal waste sludge.\" a waste product composed of tar decanter sludge and other byproducts of the coking process. This fuel is commonly referred to as \"steel industry fuel\" because it is a superior feedstock for the production of coke that is used by the domestic steel industry. Steel industry fuel provides significant energy benefits by recapturing the energy content of the coal waste sludge and significant environmental benefits because the Environmental Protection Agency classifies coal waste sludge as a hazardous waste unless it is processed with coal into a solid fuel product. The conference report expresses the conferees understanding and belief that the Internal Revenue Service should consider issuing such rulings and guidance on an expedited basis to those taxpayers who had pending ruling requests at the time the moratorium was Implemented. I would like to confirm the understanding and belief of the conferees that this language in the conference report actually refers to steel industry fuel and the requests for private letter rulings that the producers of steel industry fuel submitted in Fall 2000.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it has come to my attention that section 1289 of the Domenici Energy Policy Act of 2005 could be interpreted as requiring FERC approval of certain foreign transactions wholly outside of the United States. I am a strong supporter of section 1289 because I believe it is vital. especially since we are repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act. that FERC be given the authority it needs to protect U.S. consumers. In my opinion. section 1289 gives FERC the appropriate authority to ensure that utility mergers and acquisitions do not adversely impact consumers. I also think it is appropriate for FERC to be able to ensure that retail customers in the United States do not subsidize foreign acquisitions. However. Section 1289 could also be interpreted as requiring FERC approval of a holding companys acquisition of a foreign utility where the holding company has no retail customers in this country. A company that has a subsidiary that simply owns generation assets in the United States for whole51. Pt. 14 19099 sale electric sales is also defined as a holding company. As a result. that holding companys acquisition of an electric utility company operating entirely overseas could be interpreted as being subject to FERCs purview as a result of section 1289 of the bill we are considering today. Subjecting foreign utility acquisitions by holding companies without any U.S. retail customers to FERC oversight could potentially have a chilling effect on investment here in the United States. At a time that we are trying to encourage investment in U.S. generation. we may be dissuading investments coming into the United States if a foreignbased holding company believes its next transaction in Great Britain is going to be subject to a FERC merger review proceeding. Moreover. the \"public interest\" test present in section 203 of the Federal Power Act does not readily fit the situation present with respect to foreign transactions. I note that section 1289 does give FERC the authority to. by rulemaking. identify types of transactions that will receive expedited Commission review. I certainly believe that the acquisition of a foreign utility company by a holding company with no retail customers in the United States should fall in that category. Other categories of foreign transactions that could possibly be interpreted as being covered by section 1289 also may fall into this category.",

Such a policy is necessary to reduce our increasing dependence on foreign energy sources. A comprehensive energy policy will help lower energy prices in the long run. Furthermore. any farreaching bill will move us toward newer technologies that will keep our economy growing strong while making us more energy independent. Although not perfect. this energy bill moves us in the right direction. It will expand our electricity transmission system and make it more reliable. The bill contains incentives for renewable energy. including the renewable energy production tax credit that I helped include. It will also spur an increase in the production and use of domestic biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Because of this bill. our coalburning plants will improve their efficiency and emit less pollution. Finally. the bill provides needed Incentives to increase natural gas infrastructure. measures that will lead to lower prices for natural gas consumers in the long run. Equally important. this bill benefits North Dakota for a number of reasons. The transmission incentives will enable my States power producers to export electricity to distant markets. In this way. transmission incentives benefit the lignite and wind energy sectors in my State. The clean coal production incentives will make it easier to build advanced clean coal powerplants. The inclusion of the wind energy production tax credit will help North Dakota realize its potential to be the biggest producer of wind energy in the country. The Renewable Fuels Standard and tax incentives for ethanol and biodiesel will aid my States farm economy. create more jobs. and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In addition. the bill will assist my State in developing exciting new technologies. such as coaltoliquid fuel plants.

I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator DOMENici and Senator BINGAMAN. respectively. They provided excellent leadership. and I know their staff stayed up many a sleepless night. They played an important role developing this bill.

Let me take a moment and speak about the hard work of the Finance Committee staff. The House and Senate bills took two very different approaches to tax policy. Conference negotiations were hard fought. We made some tough decisions. But we got it done within budget limits largely because we worked with a spirit of compromise and cooperation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote against this energy bill because it does not do enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the promotion of alternative forms of energy or by encouraging energy efficiency. I was very disappointed that the conference committee eliminated the Senates renewable portfolio standard. under which utilities would have provided 10 percent of their total sales from renewable resources by 2020. In addition. the conference also eliminated the Senate provision that called on the President to find ways to reduce oil use by 1 million barrels per day by 2025. as well as the provision promoting hybrids for use in Federal. State. and other vehicle fleets. I am also very concerned about an authorization for an inventory of energy resources in Americas Outer Continental Shelf. which is damaging in itself and may lead to future oil and gas development in some coastal areas. Overall. this bill is very imbalanced. The bill provides $5.7 billion in tax incentives over 10 years for the fossil fuel industry and $1.5 billion in subsidies and tax breaks for the nuclear industry. Compare this to tax incentives for renewable electricity. alternative vehicles and fuels. energy efficiency. and energy conservation. which were cut from $11.4 billion in the Senate bill to $5.8 billion in the final bill. With all of these bad provisions. I am pleased that a few good provisions survived. such as my amendment calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conclude action on energy crisis refunds by the end of the year or report to Congress explaining what it has done and specifying a timetable for the rest of their process. I am also pleased that this energy bill will exempt California from the proposed new ethanol mandate during the summer months. when ethanol usage in gasoline can increase air pollution. and that it included my original proposal to encourage the production of ethanol from agricultural waste. Republicans removed many provisions from the Senate bill that would have put us on a more energyefficient path. and unfortunately we were left with a bill that does not offer the sound and innovative policies we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. protect the environment. and improve our energy and fuel efficiency.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Friday in Saluda. South Carolina. 400 elementary school students gathered at a football field while a military helicopter landed in the middle. Why such a big treat for such a small school. you may wonder? Hollywood Elementary teacher Anna Frye learned of the Flags For Soldiers Project. headed by Alpha Troop Commander Captain Jason D. Hennigan. and wanted to involve her students. The project is to raise money to purchase 500 American flags. one for each soldier serving in a Cavalry Squadron of the 82nd Airborne Division. During the past several weeks. these students donated their snack money and paid a fee to participate in dressup days so they could contribute to this cause. Captain Hennlgans father. Daniel Hennigan. a retired Army officer. was so touched by the schools gesture that he arranged a special celebration on Veterans Day. As American solders continue to fight for our freedoms around the world. we can all learn a lesson from the students at Hollywood Elementary. In conclusion. God bless our troops. and we will never forget September 11.",

They want checks and balances. but more than anything. they want us to work together to address the concerns they face every day. The agenda that Democrats laid out over the last year is an agenda that all of us here in Washington should be able to support. If you want to help millions of hardworking Americans who have not received a pay raise in 9 years. you will join us in Increasing the minimum raise in January. If you want to help more teenagers get a college education. you will join us in making it more affordable by cutting interest rates in half on college loans. This is the agenda that the American people supported last week when they went to the polls. In January. we will begin to implement this agenda. and I hope that our Republican colleagues will join us in this effort.",

Among those voting were 10 million young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 who were no doubt upset by the soaring costs of college tuition and the rise in student loan interest rates put into effect by Republicans in this body. This year alone Republicans raised student loan interest rates by 7 percent and cut $12 billion out of the higher education budget to pay for the massive tax cuts for the wealthy. These 10 million young voters. along with their parents and grandparents who share the growing financial burden of higher education. elected a Democratic majority in Congress because they know our party has continually stood for making a college education an affordable goal for all American students. Mr. Speaker. these families will soon see results. Within the first 100 hours of taking office next January. Democrats will broaden college opportunities for all students.",

On the day after the election. it appeared that President Bush had finally gotten the message when he removed Secretary Rumsfeld. the man who bears a great deal of responsibility for the failed Iraq policy. However. there is now some doubt whether the President fully comprehended the magnitude of the quagmire his administration created and continues to defend. The situation in Iraq is getting worse. not better. October was the deadliest month for American troops in over 2 years. and they continue to play referee in a civil war between the Sunnis and the Shiites. It is clear after last weeks election that the American people want a change in strategy. It is time for the Iraqi people to take control of their country and to stop the sectarian violence that has made it impossible to bring stability to that nation. American troops cannot do it for them. They have got to do it for themselves. Therefore. it is time to begin redeploying our troops out of Iraq so that we can better protect our Nation. The Presidents own intelligence agencies say the war in Iraq is making us less safe. When Democrats take control of Congress next year. we will advocate for a phased redeployment so we can better protect the homeland from terrorist attacks.",

We will also repeal billions in tax breaks for big oil companies. companies that experienced record profits this summer while they were gouging the American consumer. Democrats also plan to help college students with skyrocketing college costs by cutting their student loan interest payments in half. something that could save future graduates about $5.000 over the lifetime of the loan.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation that will designate the Federal building located at 333 Mt. Elliott Street in Detroit. MI. as the \"Rosa Parks Federal Building.\" I want to thank Senator LEVIN for joining me on this bill. On December 1. 1955. Mrs. Parks left work in her hometown of Montgomery. AL and boarded a bus headed for home. When the bus became crowded. she was ordered by the bus driver to give up her seat to a white male passenger. She refused. Mrs. Parks was arrested. and 4 days later the Montgomery Bus Boycott began. The Boycott lasted for over a year until the Montgomery buses were officially desegregated in December of 1956. Rosa Parks is simply one courageous woman who did what she believed was fair and right. She is a testament to the power of one individual willing to fight for her beliefs. Her actions set the Civil Rights Movement in motion and set a precedent for protest without violence. I would like to thank Rosa Parks for her contribution to freedom and justice for all men and women in this country. Her actions changed the course of history. Rosa Parks moved to Detroit in 1957. In 1977. she and Elaine Easton Steel founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for SelfDevelopment in Detroit to offer guidance to young African Americans. She still calls Detroit home and has lived there for nearly 50 years. Nicknamed the \"Mother of Civil Rights.\" Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996the highest civilian award this Nation can bestow. Naming the building that currently houses the Federal Homeland Security office in Detroit is but one more way for our Nation to recognize and thank Mrs. Parks for her contribution to our country. It is an honor she richly deserves. and one I urge my colleagues to support. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the RECORD.",

MI. in honor of Mrs. Rosa Parks. \"mother of the civil rights movement.\" I also want to commend Representative CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK for her leadership in sponsoring this initiative last week in the House Rosa Parks is an American heroine. When this gentle warrior decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus in Montgomery. AL. her act of defiance launched the modern civil rights movement in America. By refusing to move to the back of that bus. she inspired a yearlong. citywide bus boycott by African Americans in Montgomery that led to a Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation on buses and introduced a young local leader named Martin Luther King to the Nation. It was a turning point in American history that challenged the conscience of the country and the world. Rosa Parks stand that day was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime struggle for equality and justice. Twelve years earlier. for instance. she had been arrested for violating another segregation law. which required African Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus and then reboard from the rear. In the years that followed her solitary protest. she was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement. In 1987. she cofounded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for SelfDevelopment. which continues to offer young people handson opportunities to learn about civil rights in America. Although Rosa Parks will be forever associated with one day in Montgomery. AL. she lived most of her life in my home State of Michigan. She came to Detroit under sad circumstancesharassment and threats on her lifebut she built a new life there. We in Michigan are proud to call her one of our own. and we want to recognize her enormous contributions by renaming this federal building in her honor. Appropriately. the building is a historic one. built in 1855 and used as a hospital during the Civil War. This legislation will ensure that the proud legacy of Rosa Parks is properly recognized in Michigan. and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. CORZINE):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I introduce legislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements to protect National Parks through collaborative efforts on lands inside and outside of National Park System units. This legislation is based on very successful watershed protection legislation enacted for the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land management. now commonly referred to as the Wyden amendment. The Wyden amendment. first enacted in 1998 for fiscal year 1999. has resulted in countless Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management cooperative agreements with neighboring State and local land owners to accomplish high priority restoration. protection and enhancement work on public and private lands. It has not required additional funding. but has allowed the agencies to leverage their scarce restoration dollars thereby allowing the federal dollars stretch farther. The legislation I introduce today will allow the Park Service to use a similar authority to attack natural threats to National Parks. such as invasive weeds. before they cross onto Parks land. The National Park Service tells me that if they have to wait until the weeds hit the Parks before treating them the costs for treatment rise exponentially and the probability of beating the weeds back drop exponentially. I ask unanimous consent that examples of projects the National Park Service would with this authority. as well as the groups with which they would partner be printed in the RECORD.

Croatia has come a long way in the last 14 years and has experienced a number of important developments in the process. Overcoming the legacies of communism and armed aggression. Croatia is now well on the path towards full membership in the EuroAtlantic community. All these achievements mark Croatias successful transition in political and economic reforms to a thriving democracy and market economy. as well as depicting the Croatian Governments commitment to the rule of law and human rights. Croatias strategic objectives to enter NATO and the European Union. as well as strengthen and deepen its ties with the United States. are the driving forces behind its foreign and security policy. and defense reforms. Integration into the EuroAtlantic Community will enable Croatia to assume a more active role within the community of democracies that share the same values. principles and interests. Active participation by Croatian military personnel in a number of peacekeeping operations worldwide. including the NATOled mission in Afghanistan. displays Croatias credibility as a future NATO member state. Furthermore. Croatia has a track record of cooperation with NATO allies through the PfP. Mr. Speaker. it is clearly in our national interest to encourage peace and stability in the region of Southeastern Europe. To this end. the role of the Croatian American community and their representatives in the nations capital. as an inherent component of the U.S.Croatia partnership. cannot be overlooked. They represent a vital bridge between our two countries in order to strengthen deep historical and cultural links between the United States and Croatia since 1783. Special recognition should be given to the current Croatian govemnment under the leadership of Dr. Ivo Sanader to solidity Croatias place within the community of democratic nations and to move the country forward to becoming a model of stability. peace and cooperation throughout Southeastern Europe.",

President Bush is boldly leading the way to solve these problems by providing younger Americans with retirement choices and strengthening benefits for todays retirees. Reform offers younger Americans the opportunity to invest their Social Security funds in voluntary personal accounts which will provide higher benefits and allows them to build a nest egg for retirement that the government cannot take away. As Congress continues to consider Social Security reform. I urge my colleagues to fix our system and provide better retirement choices to the American people. In conclusion. God bless our troops. And we will never forget September 11.",

This is significant. While not binding. I find this a hopeful statement 51. Pt. 3 March 1. 2005 about an emerging view towards respecting the sanctity of human life.

Mr. Speaker. it gives me great honor to rise and welcome Nevadas second statue to the National Statuary Hall Collection. located inside of the United States Capitol.

Before she reached her 14th birthday. for instance. she had learned three Indian dialects and the Spanish and English languages. She was an interpreter for the United States Army and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and served as an aide. scout. peacemaker. and interpreter for General Olive 0. Howard during the Bannock War of 1878. in Idaho. In 1883 she became the first Native American woman to publish a book. \"Life Amongst the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims.\" In 1879 she gave more than 300 speeches throughout the United States concerning the plight of her people as a spokeswoman for the Northern Paiute Tribe. She went on to found a nongovernmental school for Paiute children near Lovelock. Nevada. which operated for 3 years and became a model for future educational facilities for Native American children. The people of Nevada should be so proud to have such a noble woman in their history. and we have a couple of Members today from Nevada whom I know are going to talk about that. and also very proud to display her likeness in the Nations Capitol. Mr. Speaker. it is most fitting that Nevadas statue of Sarah Winnemucca. who represented the highest ideals of America. be welcomed into the Halls of the United States Congress.

Music allows us to celebrate and preserve our cultural heritages. and also to explore the realms of expression. imagination. and creation resulting in new knowledge. Therefore. every individual should be guaranteed the opportunity to learn music and to share in musical experiences. Studies show that leaming music can improve math and science skills. language skills. and increase spatial I.Q. Music is also designated a core academic subject in the No Child Left Behind Act (No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Title IX. Part A. Sec. 9101 (11)). A research team exploring the link between music and intelligence reports that music training. specifically piano instruction. is far superior to computer instruction in dramatically enhancing childrens abstract reasoning skills necessary for learning math and science. The experiment included four groups of preschoolers: one group received private piano/ keyboard lessons. a second group received singing lessons. a third group received private computer lessons. and a fourth group received no training. Those children who receive piano/ keyboard training performed 34 percent higher on tests measuring spatialtemporal ability than the others. These findings indicate that music uniquely enhances higher brain functions required for mathematics. chess. science and engineering. In times of stringent fiscal resources public schools are often compelled to sever certain types of programs like music and arts education. Some schools are forced to seek outside sources of funding for such programs. During times of scare resources and rigorous budget climates many programs valuable to our childrens early childhood development have been sacrificed. Mr. Speaker. I rise to reiterate my support for H. Con. Res. 45 and schoolbased music education.",

On March 1. 2005. I voted in favor of House Concurrent Resolution 45 which recognizes many key benefits of schoolbased music education. Specifically. H. Con. Res. 45 recognizes that schoolbased music programs enhance intellectual development and enrich the academic environment for all ages. Students who participate in music programs are less likely to be involved with drugs. gangs. or alcohol and have better attendance. Additionally. skills gained through sequential music instruction include discipline and the ability to analyze. solve problems. communicate. and work cooperatively which are vital for success in the 21st century workplace. This House Concurrent Resolution also recognizes music as a core academic subject and that every student in the United States should have an opportunity to reap the benefits of music education. I voted for H. Con. Res. 45 because of the overwhelming success of these programs in the 26th District. In 2004. the Denton Independent School District and the Lewisville Independent School District. both located in the 26th Congressional District of Texas. were recognized as among the \"100 Best Communities for Music Education\" in America. On a recent visit to Westlake Academy. I learned that the 5th graders attended mandatory violin lessons as it was shown to greatly improve their mathematics skills. These school districts realize the great importance of schoolbased music education. I believe these programs are vital to the overall development of our youth. I am proud of the education system in Texas. especially our involved parents and teachers at the Denton Independent School District. the Lewisville Independent School District and Westlake Academy who commit their lives and time to fostering our children.",

BOB MATSUI was one of the most respected Members of this House. During his 26 years of service in Congress. he was an advocate for our Nations seniors. our children. and for social and economic justice. From his lamilys experience in the Japanese internment camps during World War II. BOB learned the importance of protecting the liberties and civil rights that are the foundation of this great country. As an AsianAmerican he understood the obstacles that minorities face in building opportunities for themselves and their families. BOB MATSUI rose quickly to become a leader in this House because of his political savvy and his detailed knowledge of the issues. He was dedicated to this House and its institutions. He was also dedicated to the ideals of the Democratic party. We all know how tirelessly he worked as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Many will remember BOB for his leadership in our party and on the critical national issues of trade and Social Security. It is true that he understood the values of free trade and the economic prosperity it can provide to communities. He was not afraid to stand up against even his own party on issues in which he passionately believed. As the ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee. BOB was also a national expert on the subject of retirement and pension. His knowledge of the intricacies of the social security system and his wisdom will be sorely missed during this years upcoming debate on Social Security reform. I. however. will remember BOB for something else. I will remember him as a friend and champion of migrant children and their families. BOB helped us in the fight for funding for Migrant Education Programs. For years he also hosted a college assistance migrant intem in his office. Many of his former interns are now leaders in their professions and communities because of the start BOB gave them.

While his life was cut tragically short. his many achievements and contributions to our Nation will serve as a constant reminder of his hard work. integrity. and determination to advocate for those who were not able to fight for themselves. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. BOB served the people of Sacramento for 14 terms focusing on the citys public safety by bringing adequate flood protection to his hometown. He also served as a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means. covering an array of policy issues such as preserving Social Security for future generations. as well as having adequate basic healthcare rights for children. Most recently he served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee leading the Democratic Partys congressional effort for the 2004 cycle. When he was 6 months old. BOB. a thirdgeneration Japanese American. and his family were taken from their home in Sacramento and interned at the Tule Lake Camp after Japans attack on Pearl Harbor in 1942. He carried this experience with him throughout his life. In 1988. he helped steer the JapaneseAmerican Redress Act through Congress. in which the government formally apologized for the World War II internment program and offered compensation to victims. This experience helped shape his strong belief that every American is entitled to basic civil rights despite their ethnicity. BOB was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Because of his many achievements and contributions. he was and always will be a role model to the more than eleven million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country. His presence and driving force will certainly be missed. However. his legacy will live on through the people of Sacramento. the Asian Pacific Islander American community and our Nation as a whole.

During his 26 years in Congress. he has been a champion on issues that affect the lives of all Californians and Americans. from protecting Social Security to working for civil rights. Congressman MATSUIs fight against privatizing Social Security showed his deep commitment to fighting for the poor or less fortunate in our country. He led the efforts to ensure its fundamental purpose was never compromised. Congressman MATSUIs strong belief in social justice is apparent by looking at the legislation he championed. He drafted bills that became the backbone for child welfare reform. proposing to expand the social services available to atrisk children and families in the child welfare. mental health and juvenile justice systems. He also fought welfare changes. arguing that adequate job training and education programs were essential to helping parents become selfsufficient.

Secretary Bodman declared there was an energy crisis in this country. and the Republicans are scrambling to play catch- up. Since last September. Speaker HASTERT has blocked action on Congressman STUPAKS bill. which would impose tough criminal penalties on oil and gas companies that engage in price gouging. Congressional Republicans have consistently voted down efforts to give the FTC new authority to prosecute companies that price gouge. Instead. Republicans passed an energy bill which the Energy Information Administration said would raise gasoline prices. and it has. Last Tuesday. President Bush called on his administration to investigate possible price gouging. even though the FTC was completing a report on price gouging that Congress requested last year. Then. on Friday. the President said. \"I have no evidence that theres any ripoff taking place.\" Think back to the investigation. Is it any wonder. Mr. President. that Americans are skeptical that you are serious about investigating your Big Oil buddies? On Friday you said. \"Its the role of the FTC to assure me that my inclinations and instincts are right.\" Was that an order for a rubber stamp. Mr. President? No wonder the American people are a bit skeptical.

What we have here before us today is a good piece of legislation. and it does four critical things. First. it directs the Federal Trade Commission to define price gouging. to define what wholesale sales are and what retail sales are and to come up with rules that will implement those definitions. It also provides for strong civil enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and the State attorneys general for criminal enforcement. It provides strong civil penalties. Those penalties would be three times the illgotten gains for the retailer. plus an amount not to exceed $3 million per day for continuing violations. It also provides for strong criminal penalties. and these penalties are $150 million and/or imprisonment for not more than 2 years. and on the retail side. $2 million and imprisonment not more than 2 years. These are real penalties. and this will. with the proper rulemaking process. lead to a deterrent that will result. in my opinion. in energy prices reflecting true costs. It is important to emphasize that this legislation does not upset State laws. It is enforceable by State attorneys general and. as I said a minute ago. does provide vigorous civil and criminal penalties.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this bill is called the Federal Energy Price Protection Act of 2006 because the bill will protect todays excessive gasoline prices from government intervention. This bill will prevent our government from actually doing anything to reduce the price of gasoline. To reduce the price of gasoline. one must understand the underlying causes of excessive costs. Consider the fact that it costs only $20 a barrel to extract oil out of the ground today. but oil companies are making $72 a barrel. At the same time. the crude oil reserves already pumped out and in storage are at alltime highs. Therefore. crude is not constrained. and the excessive price for a barrel of oil is not based on a free market. The crude oil price is being manipulated with much speculation that recent increase in the oils futures market had played a significant role. The recent increase in profits in the refinery business correlate with the industry effort to shut down to independent refineries to constrict supply. These two factors account for 99 percent of the excessive profits. Now. the FTC has approved the oil companies monopolies. and they set the stage for the increased prices. This same FTC is going to define price gouging. as if they dont know what it already is? I suspect. under the FTC. the excessive profits are unlikely to be illegal unless the FTC can show manipulations occurred. Since manipulation is well disguised by the industry. the FTC will be easily able to brush aside excessive profits as nothing more than a market signal. Any definition drafted by the current FTC will also likely establish that the price of crude oil set by the world market and therefore any profits relative to that price are not price gouging. This bill will enable the Federal Government to cut off aggressive State actions by intervening and then settling with minimum penalties. Mr. Speaker. the American people want something done now. We need a windfall profits tax. 100 percent on windfall profits. That will give the oil companies a signal that they wont forget.",

The Federal Government has the responsibility to protect consumers from price gouging. Congress needs to pass legislation to allow the Federal Trade Commission to prosecute price gouging.

It is our duty to approve legislation that would provide relief to protect Americans from the increased financial hardship from gasoline price gouging rates that is currently taking place.

I challenge the chairman of our Energy and Commerce Committee to take up other proposals we have. Mr. MARKEYS proposal. a 52.

Why do they need tax breaks? Even the President said. as we were debating the Energy Policy Act of 2005 last year. that when oil is over $40 a barrel. there is no need for tax breaks.

Our approaches are different in some respects. but this legislation we are voting on today. a slightly different version of which was included in the October 2005 Gas Act that the House has already passed. is a good bill. It is a solid piece of legislation and deserves the support of the House. I also recognize that this is only one piece of the puzzle. We want to give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate possible price gouging. But that is not going to solve all of our energy problems. This focuses on one piece of the problem. The bill that we will consider next on the floor of the House will also look at another piece of the problem. and we are going to try to pass some further legislation that deals with tax codes. that increases domestic supply. that invests in alternative sources. things like E85. Since we passed the Energy Act in August and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee came out to New Mexico to sign that landmark piece of legislation. there are 29 new ethanol plants that have requested permits so that we can use corn to fuel our vehicles rather than having to import oil from other countries. Mr. Speaker. this bill includes strong penalties. in fact stronger than the ones that my colleague from Michigan has in his bill. I think maybe if we would have worked together. we could have come up with a good bill that both of our names were on. It gives us good clear definitions and says. we have got 23 States that have pricegouging laws. we need to get a clear Federal definition of price gouging. and the Federal Trade Commission will give that to us. It also deals with every month of the year. The bill that we introduced in September. and my colleague from Michigans bill as well. only deals with emergencies. when a disaster is declared.

I congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for awakening at long last to the need to pass strong antiprice gouging legislation to protect Americas energy consumers. It would have been far better if the House majority had come to this realization last fall. when Representative STUPAK offered a stronger version of the bill we are now debating. Instead. the Republicans voted down the STUPAK bill on three separate occasions in Committee and on the House floor. Apparently. the Majority has now seen the light. as this new bill borrows heavily from H.R. 3936. antigouging legislation sponsored by Rep. STUPAK. Better late than never. I suppose. But in the meantime. seven critical months have elapsed during which all manner of shenanigans may have occurred in the energy markets. Fortunately for consumers. a mild winter sheltered them from the full effects of high prices during the winter heating season. but last month gasoline prices shot up. As we approach the summer driving season. there is no relief in sight. In a perfect worid. I would support Representative STUPAKs bill over the legislation now under consideration. In fact. since last December House Republicans could have signed the discharge petition pending on the Stupak bill and passed it on the suspension calendar. That would have empowered the Federal Trade Commission to go after price gougers--or better yetthe enactment of antigouging authority might have deterred gasoline price gougers from taking advantage of U.S. consumers.

It will not bring down the price of gasoline. and it will not ensure any ability of the United States to refine its own gasoline. The bill is based on a false premise. There is no evidence that refineries are being denied needed permits either for construction or expansion. In written testimony before the Senate. Chevron CEO stated. and I quote. \"we are not aware of any projects that have been directly prevented as a result of any specific Federal or State regulation.\" The truth is that refiners do not want to expand existing or construct new refineries. The dirty secret is they are not going to make any money off of that. The five largest oil companies reported a record $110 billion in profits in 2005. and three of the largest petroleum companies made more than $16 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Existing law already provides for new permitting assistance. 1 year ago. in fact. this body passed the Energy Policy Act. Title 3. subsection H. of the Energy Policy Act allowed States to seek additional assistance from the Federal Government for permitting when it was needed. Yet the legislation before us today repeals this provision and replaces it with less effective language. Last year Democrats brought a plan to this floor that would have set our Nation on the right course. It would have created a Strategic Refinery Reserve. giving the U.S. Government the ability to refine its own oil for use by military and first responders. The Strategic Refinery Reserve would have made that difference. But rather than solve the problem. we are here with a plan that will not increase refinery capacity. will not bring down the price of gas and will not ensure any ability of the United States to refine its own gasoline.

This legislation would restore the right of a female service member who has been stationed overseas to use their own funds to obtain an abortion as they would be able to do if they were back home. I urge adoption of this amendment. And I speak adamantly against our present policy that while allowing women who have been raped or been impregnated by a family member or whose life is in danger because of an unhealthy pregnancy to have an abortion. they have to pay for it themselves. That is wrong. While we are not addressing this issue today at least we can move forward with the Davis amendment.",

I stand against this amendment because it authorizes the destruction of innocent human life. the most innocent. the most defenseless. the voiceless in our society. We talk about the fact that the cost will be provided by a private individual. Not true. This authorizes prolife Americans to have to underwrite the cost of building the facilities. training the physicians. training the nurses. equipping the facilities. Underwriting the cost will be borne by prolife Americans. Requiring military hospitals to perform elective abortions exposes the physicians. the nurses. the military personnel to move against their own personal convictions of life in many cases. Imagine a full colonel directing. giving military orders. to a young major who is prolife. a prolife doctor who is a major. giving him military orders to perform an abortion. His military career would be over. The Most Reverend Edwin OBrien. Archbishop for Military Services. said. \"Military hospitals have an outstanding record of saving life even in the most challenging times and conditions. Their commitment extends to the smallest of human beings. Please allow them to continue abiding by these values.\" I stand by those Americans. those prolife Americans. who do not want to underwrite and have our prolife dollars going to military hospitals. I stand by those prolife doctors and nurses who dont want to be given military orders to perform an abortion.",

This amendment is about treating the women who serve our country in the United States military fairly and with respect. Current law forbids female military personnel from obtaining abortions using their own funds from overseas military hospitals. This amendment allows U.S. servicewomen access to reproductive health care abroad. just as they would receive at home. A male member of the armed services needing medical attention receives the best. and all his medical needs are covered. But a female member needing a specific medical procedure must return to the United States. often at great expense. or go to a foreign hospital. which may be unsanitary and dangerous. This is absolutely wrong and unfair. No taxpayer money would be used to fund any abortions. The servicewomen themselves would pay for their own care. The amendment would simply lift the ban on privately funded abortion care in U.S. military hospitals. Right now. many women are overseas protecting our constitutional rights. We should protect their constitutional rights by passing this amendment.",

The core purpose of our military hospitals is to care for servicemen and women. particularly those who are wounded in the line of duty defending our country. U.S. taxpayers should not be forced by the government to have their hardearned funds used for the taking of innocent human lives. They should continue to have the free choice to say \"no\" to funding abortions. The U.S. military health care facilities overseas witness more than their fair share of violence. Military health care personnel understand that the Hippocratic Oath is a solemn commitment to heal and nurture life. Lets not abandon this legacy and force our constituents to foot the bill. Women deserve better than abortion.

Now. suddenly. to turn the hospitals that we set forth to deal with their needs overseas into abortion clinics abrogates everything that they fought and died for.

Those close to Corporal Zamora recognized an indomitable love of country and a passionate desire to serve his Nation in the military at an early age. Friends and family recall that as a young man. Corporal Zamora would often drive into the desert near Las Cruces in his pickup to practice his marksmanship. This simple custom is indicative of his discipline and certainly contributed to his great skill as a soldier. In 2002. shortly after graduating from high school. Corporal Zamora enlisted in the Army. fully knowing that his country would soon be going to war abroad. This brave decision illustrates the selflessness that endeared Corporal Zamora in the hearts of his family members. his friends. and his brothers in arms. It also demonstrates his passionate. disciplined approach to service and the selfless demeanor that is at the core of what the American Army prides its servicemembers on honor. duty. humility. and loyalty. His mother Paola. stepfather Sergio. sister Christy. are all in our thoughts. His brother Tyrel is another brave member of the U.S. Army. and I hope that we can soon guarantee him a swift and safe journey home. Corporal Zamora was assigned as an infantryman to the 101st Airborne Division.

Dave served the Government as a journeyman printer and as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee staff for nearly 23 years. In addition to his service as a printer with the Government Printing Office. he had been Chief Clerk and Assistant Chief Clerk to the committee during the 1970s.

Dave was indispensable in teaching these staff members committee printing procedures and patiently answering their many questions. Daves skills. technical ability and good humor made it possible to meet our many deadlines. During the last 6 years that Dave served the committee. we printed more than 400 documents. including executive and legislative reports. hearings. and other materials. Without Daves tireless efforts and hard work. the committee would not have been able to produce such a huge volume of material. Dave took great pride in his work and ensured that the material he produced met his and the committees high standards. Every publication Dave printed reflected favorably on the committee. the Senate. and the U.S. Government as a whole. In addition to his extensive public service. Dave will be remembered as a loyal friend and loving husband and father. He is survived by his wife Angela. who is currently the Executive Clerk of the Committee on Foreign Relations. four children.

Bill Cooper directed an impressive expansion of TCF Financial in Minnesota and elsewhere through his innovative leadership. From 1985 until his retirement in January. he helped to transform TCF Financial from a small banking enterprise into a thriving operation offering industry leading consumer services. Bill Cooper is a complete citizen. He not only led a thriving business that provided thousands of jobs and financial services to a big proportion of our Minnesota population. Bill used his voice. his philanthropy. and his influence to improve as many sectors of our State as he could get his hands on. His work on education not only shaped Minnesota public policy. his personal involvement changed the lives of hundreds of disadvantaged students forever. He has always had strong opinions and had the integrity to walk his talk. Although Mr. Cooper has retired as CEO of TCF. he has not completely given himself up to the ski slopes or the golf courses as he continues to remain active in the financial world and in his community. Minnesota has been fortunate to have a business leader like Mr. Cooper who not only has enriched the economy of Minnesota and elsewhere but has also used his good name. time. and money for the good of the community. Minnesota celebrates its lakes and farms and excellent community assets. One of the secrets of our success is community leaders like Bill Cooper who shoulder the burdens of leadership.

ND. have touched my hearts and the heart of their neighbors and friends. Throughout their years together. this special group of students has worked on more than one occasion to serve their community. As third graders. they collected box tops to purchase new games for schoolmates. When they were in the fifth grade. they initiated a fundraiser and donated the proceeds to benefit the Ronald McDonald House in Fargo. ND. As one final project. Mrs. Prankes sixth graders decided to treat themselves to a class trip to celebrate their years together before moving on to junior high school. The students began holding fundraisers for their trip. Shortly after all the funds had been raised. they learned that the father of one of their classmates had fallen critically ill. The students quickly realized that they were faced with unique circumstances. After learning of their classmates situation and the medical costs the family would bear. the children chose to donate the funds to their classmates family and forgo their class trip. By choosing to help with their hardearned money rather than keep it for themselves. these extraordinary students proved that their hearts are deep and their love for one another is real. Again. I commend Mrs. Prankes exceptional group of sixth graders. Their selfless act has reaffirmed that values and kindness have not been lost in a world that so often focuses on the negative.

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday the American people received the shocking news that the Vice Presidents former chief of staff. Scooter Libby. may have acted on direct orders from President Bush when he leaked classified intelligence information to reporters. It is an understatement to say that this is a serious allegation with national security consequences. It directly contradicts previous statements made by the President. It continues a pattern of misleading America by this Bush White House. It raises somber and troubling questions about the Bush administrations candor with Congress and the American people. Today. I come to the floor to request answers on behalf of our troops. their families. and the American people. For years President Bush has denied knowing about conversations between his top aides and Washington reporters. conversations where his aides. like Scooter Libby. sought to justify the war in Iraq and discredit the White Houses critics by leaking national security secrets. In fact. President Bush is on record clearly. in September of 2003. as saying: I dont know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information. If somebody did leak classified information. Id like to know it. and well take appropriate action. Yesterday. we found there is much more to the story. According to court records. President Bush may have personally authorized the very leaks he denied knowing anything about. In light of this disturbing news. we need to hear from President Bush which of these is true: His comments in 2003 or the statements made by the Vice Presidents chief of staff. Only the President can put this matter to rest. Harry Truman had on his desk in the Oval Office a plaque. It said: \"The buck stops here.\" In George Bushs White House. perhaps he should put one that says: The leaks start here. He. the President of the United States. must tell the American people whether President Bushs Oval Office is a place where the buck stops or the leaks start. This is a question he alone must answer. not a spokesman. not a statement. only the President of the United States. I yield the floor.",

He speaks with shock and dismayand it is a subject of great dismayabout the fact that there has been death and there are family separations and there are injuries as a result of the great sacrifice our men and women are making today in Iraq with great valor and distinction which we highly honor. just like he and others did in World War II. The question is. Is it worth it? Are we in this matter of a war over there with a choice to do anything other than success? What I didnt hear from the Senator was a solution. a plan. an idea of how he might extricate us from this effort differently. I believe the only way is to pursue it until its conclusion. when it is ultimately a peaceful and democratic Iraq.

To this point. little movement has been made to bridge the differences between the House and Senate bills. This process does not need to be a partisan one. Throughout consideration of the pension bill. Democrats have worked with Republicans to move forward on pension reform. The Senate. working in a bipartisan manner. was able to produce a strong bill that passed by a vote of 97 to 2. Democrats are eager to participate in the conference negotiations and are committed to enacting a strong pension reform bill. It is my hope that a conference agreement can be completed in a timely manner so that the uncertainty surrounding pensions can be resolved. However. House Republicans seem intent on producing a bill without including Democrats. That would be unfortunate and is likely to produce a bill that fails to meet the principles supported by the Democratic caucus. The Senate pension bill was crafted with bipartisan participation. and that approach produced a bill that received almost unanimous support in the Senate. Working together. the conferees can produce a conference agreement that would garner an equally strong vote. Attached is a set of principles that our caucus has supported throughout consideration of this important bill. I believe these principles should be the basis for any agreement reported by the conference. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.",

The city of Eureka has a long history and often parallels Californias past. Founded during the time of the gold rush. it became an important port city for northern Californias logging and commercial fishing industries because of its proximity to a rich supply of natural resources. Eureka was incorporated on April 18. 1856. and was designated by the State legislature as the county seat for Humboldt County. On a more personal note. Eureka is an important part of my familys history. My mothers family left St. Petersburg during the Russian Revolution and traveled by cart through Siberia and boarded a boat finally landing in Eureka. Today. with a population of over 25.000. Eureka is a city on the move and the cultural center of the Californias north coast region. It is the destination for many people wanting to explore miles of unspoiled coastline and visit the worldfamous coastal redwoods that are within close proximity of the city. The citys famed historic architecture has been preserved. earning it the designation as a \"Victorian Seaport.\" The historic Eureka Inn is currently undergoing renovations that will make it once again the center of many community events such as the location of the citys Christmas celebrations. I congratulate the city of Eureka on your special day and extend my regards to all of the citizens who will be celebrating this important milestone in the citys history. You should feel proud of your past. and I wish you the very best in the future.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I rise to introduce the Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act of 2006. This legislation tackles a key problem facing Americans todaythat of rising healthrelated costs. It does so by empowering citizens to act as informed consumers when purchasing their health care. Countless examples in our Nations history demonstrate that the American consumer possesses the ability to drive prices down and quality up by making informed decisions in the marketplace. Yet the cost of health care is not easily accessible to the American consumer. given the nature of our present system. The Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act would create price transparency at a consumer level. allowing Americans to choose for themselves health care services that are affordable within their region. This bill ensures that there is one location on the Internet where either consumers with health savings accounts or who are uninsured can go to view the Medicare reimbursement rates for all common medical procedures and physician visits. region by region. This information will provide a critical baseline for these individuals to assess health care costs. I believe that by removing barriers for health care consumers to \"own their health care\" and make the best personal choices. we empower Americans with the knowledge to take charge of their health spending and to negotiate health care prices. I should note that my home State of Kansas is also considering pricetransparency initiatives. This legislation is a good first step towards improving the quality of health care and lowering costs to consumers. I thank the original cosponsor. Senator TOM COBURN. for his support of this measure. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to support the Medicare Payment Rate Disclosure Act of 2006.

I have had the opportunity to go to northern Idaho. to northern Florida. to Amherst. U.S. Naval Academy and Frostburg State University.

So I would encourage you. if you havent participated and you want an uplifting experience. go out to the Congress to Campus Program and meet with these young people.

The Congress to Campus Program is a great program because it gets you out there with real kids. real people. and it is a tremendous outreach program that certainly should be encouraged. I was very fortunate to visit Rhode Island College with Jan Meyers and also Fitsburg. Massachusetts. their college with Greg Laughlin. As was pointed out. there are really two goals of the program. The first is to promote careers in government service and secondly to provide an insider view of how does government really work. You would be surprised at some of the questions that you do get from the kids in terms of various things we do. how it works. and what the inside view is. Of course as you know as former Members. we will tell most because were open. We dont have an ax to grind. Were willing to share. I think its a very educational program for the students. By the way. at Rhode Island. I was pleased that they actually expanded the program. so not only did we speak to the usual political science and other classes but also they had a forum for high school students. and then they took us off to the local media. So it is a real good opportunity to get the message out that people in government are real people who happen to have fallen into this very important position through various mechanisms. We are just ordinary people serving our fellow people and we get there in a variety of ways. That is the kind of thing I think that gets expressed to the students. As was pointed out over the last 4 years. the program has visited 120 campuses. and we have addressed over 40.000 students. 9.000 alone just in this past year. So it is a great program. If you have participated already. thank you very much. I know you appreciate it. as Bill does. If you havent. please consider it. It is well worth your time and the time of the people of our Nation.

Members of the other body have been busy adding billions of dollars in nonemergency pork to this emergency spending bill. and the price tag is simply unjustifiable. One particularly egregious earmark seeks $700 million in Federal funds to move a railroad track that has just been repaired at the cost of $250 million. Supporters of the project say the rail line needs to be moved because it is vulnerable to hurricane damage. Yet the proposed new location is just a short distance inland and was greatly damaged by Katrina last year. The real reason supporters want this newly repaired rail line moved is to make room for a casino gambling development along the gulf coast. Mr. Speaker. relocating a newly updated rail line to an equally vulnerable area simply to make room for casino gambling is not an emergency.

What is important is not what they have said in the last couple of days. but what they have done for the entire time they have been in power here in Washington. D.C. It is outrageous that the same people who are now decrying high gas prices were lavishing billions of dollars in subsidies on the same oil industry a few months ago. despite already bloated profits. In the 1990s the Republicans even passed legislation that forbade the Department of Transportation to even study higher fuel efficiency. something that would significantly reduce demand today. And they have expressed no outrage that the American taxpayer is being cheated out of fair payment for the oil and gas that is being taken from public lands by these same large companies. There are real solutions. Invest in conservation. the only way to reduce immediate dependence on expensive foreign oil now. Shift the billions of dollars in oil and gas companies to renewable and alternative energy sources. and insist that the American taxpayer be given full value for the billions of dollars of oil and gas taken from public lands.",

The overwhelming majority of the flags were Mexican flags. These people are loyal to Mexico. I have a neighbor down the street who is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Mexico. and he flat out told me if the U.S. and Mexico were at war with each other. he would fight for Mexico. \"We may be a Nation of immigrants. but the majority of Americans were born here and their parents were born here. My great. great. great. great. great Grandfather John C. Hale was killed at the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836 defeating Santa Anna and Mexico (and thus making Texas an independent country). He is one of nine Texans buried there on the battlefield. \"Now my elected officials want to simply hand Texas back to Mexico. Its a traitorous act what is about to happen in this Congress.

If House Republicans do not support our efforts to extend the deadline until the end of the year. millions of seniors will face a prescription drug tax that they must pay every month for the rest of their lives. Over 14 million seniors still have not chosen a plan. Some are frustrated. confused by dozens of plans they have to choose from. Others have heard the horror stories of seniors not having access to drugs they were promised or seniors being overcharged for some of their medication. Some of these seniors will eventually want to choose a plan. but they should not be forced into making that tough decision by May 15. It is time House Republicans stand up and support Americas seniors. Reject the Presidents prescription drug tax. And as we mark off another day on the calendar. Republicans only have 18 days to make the right decision.",

There are liberal Members of this body for the past three decades that have voted to prevent domestic exploration for oil. They have also worked to make it virtually impossible to build new refineries. and they have succeeded. We have not built a new refinery in this country since This week we have watched the Democrats stand around wringing their hands about high gas prices and blaming every Republican in sight. But this is not a partisan issue. it is an American issue. and people need to know the truth is in the voting. Last year we passed the GAS Act with not a single Democratic vote in the House. Not one. That bill would have streamlined the overly burdensome permitting and regulatory work that goes into getting a refinery. It would have made price gouging a Federal crime. The bill got no liberal support here in the House. Now it is in the Senate. Americans have only to ask the liberals why they are paying so much at the pump.",

Every month 11 million youth between the ages of 12 and 20 drink alcohol. Each day over 5.000 kids under the age of 16 take their first drink. Research has shown that these kids are significantly more likely than those who do not drink to become alcoholics. use marijuana. and try cocaine. Alcohol is also known to impact adolescent brain development and increase risktaking behavior that results in at least nine teenage deaths a day. To address this crisis. I sponsored the STOP Act. which makes permanent the national antiunderage drinking media campaign. which is directed at those who have the greatest influence over children: their parents. The bill provides grants to combat underage drinking in our communities and establishes a report card to track States efforts. I encourage my colleagues to help stop underage drinking by sponsoring the STOP Act and passing it into law.",

Margaret Spellings is the ideal person to work with States and Governors of both parties to achieve the goal of raising student achievement for all students in all schools. As the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. Ms. Spellings has been responsible for the development and implementation of White House policy on education. healthcare. labor. housing and many other elements of President Bushs domestic agenda. She has also served with distinction as the senior advisor to thenGovernor George W.

Margaret Spellings has had indepth discussions with teachers. administrators and school board members. She understands about school reform and the Federal role in education. In Texas. she was responsible for developing and implementing the States strong school accountability system. and she was also instrumental in the States strong reading and charter school efforts. As a top domestic advisor to the President. she was integral to the development of the No Child Left Behind Act. which is producing solid improvements in reading and math for Americas students and is helping students by transforming our public education system. The fact that President Bush has chosen one of his closest and most trusted advisors to become Education Secretary is a clear sign that education will continue to be a top domestic priority for this administration during the next 4 years.

She was unanimously voted out of committee. Both sides of the aisle recognize and honor her leadership and experience. In Ms. Spellings. Americas education system will have a thoughtful. flexible. and effective leader. Karl Rove once said that Margaret Spellings is the most powerful woman in Washington. whom no one knows.

He went to law school in Nebraska and made it his home. He was elected Governor. Having grown up on a dairy farm in Iowa. he understands farming first hand. We had a very positive conversation. He succeeds an excellent Secretary. Ann Veneman. who now will go on to be the head of UNICEF. Mike Johanns was an excellent choice by President Bush and was confirmed without any debate or controversy. I say that because many people think when it comes to the Senate floor it is nothing but a fistfight every single day. That is not a fact.

This Act is one of the Nations most important civil rights victories and serves as a tribute to those that marched. struggled. and even died to secure the right to vote for all Americans. Brave Americans of different races. ethnicities. and religions risked their lives to stand up for political equality. Most notably. on March 7. 1965. a day that would come to be known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" nonviolent civil rights activists. like Congressman JOHN LEWIS. were brutalized and demeaned in their pursuit of voting rights for all Americans. It took this horrific violence for the Nation to realize it had to own up to the democratic ideals it preached. Eight days later. President Lyndon B. Johnson called for a comprehensive and effective voting rights bill. This call for a voting rights bill was to ensure that this country realized the 15th Amendment of the Constitution. that \"the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race. color. or previous condition of servitude.\" Forty years later. the Act has proven effective in furthering this Constitutional ideal. as it has enhanced political participation and opportunity among racial and ethnic minorities. Today the Voting Rights Act also serves to protect the rights of language minority and disabled voters.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Sunday July 10. 2005 (3 Tamuz. 5765). marked the eleventh anniversary of the passing of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. of righteous memory. When Rabbi Schneerson first became the Rebbe. or spiritual leader. of ChabadLubavitch. the movement had barely survived the brutality of the Holocaust. Yet. over the course of his 44 years as \"The Rebbe.\" Rabbi Schneerson turned ChabadLubavitch into a worldwide movement. Under the Rebbes leadership. ChabadLubavitch began to offer educational and social services to the elderly. ill. and infirm. Over time. and under Rabbi Schneersons leadership. ChabadLubavitch became a global force for goodwill and kindness. It is not surprising therefore. that upon Rabbi Schneersons passing. both this House. as well as the Senate. voted unanimously to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. It is a testament to the Rebbes leadership that ChabadLubavitchs social. educational. and humanitarian efforts did not cease upon his passing. In fact. ChabadLubavitch presently has over four thousand emissaries operating more than three thousand institutions around the globe. ChabadLubavitch offers vital outreach and social services to communities in more than sixty countries on six continents. In the wake of the devastating Tsunami in SouthEast Asia. ChabadLubavitch responded to the crisis in a manner consistent with Rabbi Schneersons teachings and leadership. ChabadLubavitch of Thailand has extended a helping hand to all Tsunami victims and survivors. regardless of race or religion. ChabadLubavitch has provided both funding and technical assistance to local relief organizations in order to support the local relief effort. ChabadLubavitch also provides interest free loans to Tsunami survivors in order to assist in the economic recovery of individuals and communities. ChabadLubavitch also participates in an ongoing effort to provide fresh food and drinking water to the villages of Koh Muk. Laem Naew. Baan Talae Nok. Ko Rah. Bak Jok. Ko Surin. and Tung Dap. Mr. Speaker. while we continue to honor Rabbi Schneersons memory. we must also celebrate his ongoing legacy of kindness and compassion.",

Without question. we send a message with this resolution that improvements must be made in Azerbaijans democratic process. but while we discuss our hopes for improvement. it is important to remember how important Azerbaijan is to American interesls in the region. Azerbaijan is a staunch ally in the global war on terrorism. Following September 11. Azerbaijan was amongst the first countries to offer the United States unconditional support in the war against terrorism. providing its airspace and the use of its airports for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Azerbaijan was the first Muslim nation to send its troops to serve shouldertoshoulder with U.S. forces in Iraq. Azerbaijan joined all 12 international conventions on counterterrorism and reinforces regional cooperation on fighting terrorism through signing numerous agreements and participating in the activities of regional organizations such as NATO. the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. and others. Azerbaijan serves as the chair of the GUUAM Working Group (Georgia. Ukraine. Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan. and Moldova) on the fight against terrorism. organized crime and drug trafficking. GUUAM countries actively cooperate in lawenforcement. trade and transportation. and politicalmilitary spheres. Azerbaijan was a pioneer in opening the Caspian Sea to international cooperation and oil and gas exploration. Since 1994. Azerbaijan has extensively developed its energy resources to diversify western energy supplies. The BakuTbilisiCeyhan (BTC) oil pipeline opened May 25 of this year. It is widely recognized that the EastWest energy corridor plays an important security role in the region. To the United States. Azerbaijan is a critical partner in the Global War on Terrorism and the energy sector. To Azerbaijan. the United States is a pivotal leader in its efforts to promote democracy and stability within its borders and throughout the region. Azerbaijan is seeking to establish itself as a democratic nation and viable socioeconomic partner in the Caucasus. Europe and on the world stage. It is already an important partner on many fronts. and free and fair elections will allow us to further develop that partnership.",

Having an influential and important role model to learn from and to lean on for support and advice is priceless. Today I would like to honor and compliment my personal mentor. New York State Senator Owen Johnson from Babylon. Long Island. For over 10 years I had the honor and privilege to work for my good friend Owen in the New York State Senate. Always supportive of my entrepreneurial efforts. Owen encouraged intellectual curiosity and always gave me the latitude and freedom to complele my masters degree. While Owen had the chance to run for Congress himself. he chose to remain a New York Stale Senator to be closer to his family. Christel. his lovely wife. son Owen. and daughter Chirsten are truly the loves of his life. Owen Johnson. a conservative before it was fashionable. is the chairman of the prestigious Senate Finance Committee. A seasoned and polished debater and legislator. Owen and I had hundreds of spirited debates over the years. While we may not have always agreed at the end of the day. each conversation was a learning experience. I am extremely proud to call Owen Johnson a mentor. a friend. and the best State Senator New York State has ever had. Heres to you Owen for all you taught me about conservative and family values.",

Self Help Enterprises (SHE) efforts are based upon the simple principle of providing the tools necessary for individuals to help themselves succeed. SHE assists rural residents. primarily farmworkers. in a variety of housing needs. Offering technical assistance. helping people to compete for scarce resources and empowering individuals has been the main focus of this community oriented nonprofit. The beginnings of Self Help Enterprises can be traced back to 1964 when President Johnson launched the \"War on Poverty\" with the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. This legislation provided a much needed source of federal funding to help combat the devastating effects of continuous economic hardship. Self Help Enterprises originated in 1965 as the first rural selfhelp housing organization in the nation and shortly thereafter received its first of many grants from the United States Office of Economic Opportunity. Since then SHE has been instrumental in the housing development needs throughout eight counties located in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley: Fresno. Kern. Kings. Madera. Mariposa. Merced. Stanislaus and Tulare. Self Help Enterprises volunteers. benefactors and organizers have touched the lives of numerous families who are so often overlooked by the rest of the community. The 40th Anniversary of the founding of Self Help Enterprises is a time for us to not only commemorate past efforts. but also look toward the future for innovative and novel means of helping underserved rural residents.",

Mr. Sigler Amaya is a member of the Alternative Option Movement. and an activist of the prodemocracy opposition in Cuba. According to Amnesty International. he has been detained and harassed several times in the past. He was incarcerated in the totalitarian gulag in December 1999. after participating in a peaceful demonstration to celebrate the 51st anniversary on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 2002. he was again detained when he attempted to meet at a home in Havana to discuss human rights. Despite the constant threats. despite being previously incarcerated in the gulag. Mr. Sigler Amaya never gave up his dignified struggle for democracy and basic human rights. Unfortunately. as part of the dictators condemnable. March 2003. crackdown. Mr. Sigler Amaya was arrested. After a sham trial. he was sentenced to 20 years in the totalitarian gulag. Let me be very clear. Mr. Sigler Amaya is languishing in the depraved condilions of the totalitarian gulag because of his peaceful actions to promote basic human rights: The U.S. State Department describes the conditions in the gulag as. \"harsh and life threatening.\" It is a crime of the highest order that brave men and women are imprisoned in these nightmarish conditions simply for their belief in freedom. Tragically. Mr. Guido Sigler Amaya is not the only member of his family sentenced to the totalitarian gulag. His brothers. Ariel and Miguel Sigler Amaya. whom I will speak about in the coming weeks. have been sentenced to 20 years and over 2 years in the gulag. respectively. These three brothers are brilliant and admirable examples of the heroism of the Cuban people. No matter how intense the repression. no matter how severe the consequences of a dignified struggle for liberty. the totalitarian gulags are full of men and women who represent the very best of the Cuban nation. Mr. Speaker. it is completely unacceptable that. while the world stands by in silence and acquiescence. these three brothers are systematically tortured because of their belief in freedom. democracy. human rights and the rule of law. My Colleagues. we must demand the immediate and unconditional release of Guido Sigler Amaya. Ariel Sigler Amaya. Miguel Sigler Amaya and every political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.",

Representative BIGGERT for her leadership. as well as Representative MELISSA HART. for her persistence in introducing this legislation in the 108th Congress and again in the 109th Congress. I am pleased Chairman BOEHLERT and Ranking Member GORDON acted quickly in the House Science Committee to markup this bill and bring it to the floor today because it helps our steel. aluminum. copper. and other metal industries stay competitive in todays global marketplace. H.R. 1158. the Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness bill before us today authorizes the Department of Energy to develop a public and private partnership to build upon important research goals. such as energy efficiency. increasing competitiveness of the U.S. metals industries. and improving the environment. By working together. both the taxpayers and share holders can benefit from this federal cost share between the government and the metals industries. The domestic steel industry alone has come a long way since the steel crisis began in 1988. In my home state of Illinois. the crisis has resulted in four steel companies filing for bankruptcy. including Laclede Steel and the parent company for Granite City Steel. which are in my Congressional District. Approximately 5.000 steel workers lost their jobs in Illinois alone. Now. prices are stabilizing and the industry is restructuring and consolidating. All of this has happened without hampering the availability of competitively priced steel products. However. aggressive trade laws and other international pressures can damage the progress that was made. Therefore. it is important we continue down the path of successful recovery because the overall prospects for our steel industry can affect our future economic and national security. As a member of the Congressional Steel Caucus. I am deeply committed to making sure the metals industries stay competitive and for these reasons. I support to this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. as I mentioned earlier the Committee on Science held a hearing on the highperformance computer in May of last year. And at that time my colleague. the gentleman from California asked the experts who testified at that hearing whether there was any danger of computers approaching the cognitive abilities of humans. And the witnesses gave a resounding no in answer to that question. More specifically. my colleague wanted to know how close we were to a machine that has reached a level of intelligence where it would be entitled to the minimum wage. Dr. Jack Marburger. the Presidents Science Advisor responded. \"Not very. We are quite far from that in terms of number of components measured in neurons. for example. the interconnectivity of the human brain far exceeds anything that we can currently build or foresee in the foreseeable future with computer hardware.\" Dr. Rick Stevens. a renowned computer scientist from Argonne National Laboratory. responded to the same question saying. \"My personal view is that I would be much more concerned with nearterm issues associated with largescale computing or the use of largescale data systems to collect information. Right now. if you had to estimate what is the most intelligent device we can build. it is roughly between a worm and an insect in terms of what it can do.\" I think it is exceedingly inappropriate for this bill to impose a requirement on our Federal agencies to focus on the societal implications of hypothetical humanmimicking computers. Doing so would suggest that we as a body fundamentally misunderstand the nature and focus of highperformance computing research. In addition. as Dr. Stevens pointed out at our hearing last year. information technology has societal implications for privacy. for workplace collaboration and for many other areas. Our Federal agencies should focus any resources for societal studies on these real and immediate needs. Finally. NSF already has the ability to conduct research generally into social. economic. and workforce implications of information technology. We should allow the research community. via the peer review process. and the agency to determine if this sort of research becomes necessary. This should not be a mandate in this bill. Mr. Speaker.

Over the last 2 years. funding for the veterans medical care has increased by 18 percent. We are very proud of our support for veterans. And I would like to say. Mr. Speaker. that I know of no two Members of this House who feel and have more concern for the rights of veterans than the chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. the gentleman from Indiana . as well as the chairman. the gentleman from New York of the appropriations subcommittee that funds veterans affairs. So this matter brought to our attention now of a shortfall is of extreme concern to them. And as we speak. Mr. Speaker. a hearing is taking place to fully investigate the causes and the issues of this shortfall. a hearing is taking place by the appropriations subcommittee dealing with this issue. Military Quality of Life Appropriations Subcommittee. called for by the chairman. the gentleman from New York",

We have even managed to keep CDBG in HUD. Not one dime did we not fund in the request. Did we have to make some hard decisions? Yes. we did. But we funded the most important. the most beneficial. the most effective programs under our jurisdiction. There are some programs. like Hope 6. Youthbuild. and Amtrak. which are in desperate need of reform or reauthorization. We felt that rather than continuing to throw money at these programs. we would let the authorizers have their chance to provide oversight and legislative direction.

The gentleman from Florida just said that the rules of the House prohibit us from adding legislation to appropriations bills. that is the rules of the House. Well. the majority does that all the time. We routinely waive points of order on these appropriations bills. And this bill is no exception. We had a supplemental appropriations bill where you added the REAL ID legislation to that bill. 0l 1315 We had just recently a legislative branch appropriations bill where you added the continuity of Congress legislation. The gentleman talks about how great this economy is. I want to tell you. there are a lot of people suffering out there. Poverty has increased since you guys took over here. since George Bush became President. There are more people that are hungry in this country. These jobs that you are talking about being created. a lot of them are jobs that provide people with less pay than they were making before. Our problem here. and the reason why we want to amend this bill. is we think your priorities are wrong. We think it is more important to save Amtrak than to give a millionaire or billionaire a tax cut. In fact. we are even willing to give millionaires and billionaires a tax cut. What the gentleman from Massachusetts was trying to do was to reduce the amount of tax cut a millionaire would get from $140.000 a year to $131.000 a year. That money saved by doing that could have funded Amtrak. could have funded the Hope VI program for the revitalization of severely distressed public housing. It could have funded more money for community development block grants. It could have funded Youthbuild. It could have funded the Help America Vote Act. But your priorities are different.

Black History Month is a good time to remember the American heroes that were not given the full recognition that they were due.

Americans remember our heroes and hold a special place in their hearts for the Tuskegee Airmen.

Rufus Hunt. who served with the Tuskegee Airmen. has helped to keep the memory and spirit of these brave Americans alive by serving as their chief historian.

Their performance was unmatched. and I am so proud that this House today is recognizing them. I just want to say to the people who actually brought forth this resolution. I want to commend them on H. Con. Res. 26. because I think the time has come when we recognize the outstanding work of the Tuskegee Airmen. We should not just do it during the month of February because. first of all. when we think about their accomplishments. February is the shortest month of all. That within itself is sort of selfish. But the point is I think we need to do it 365 days a year. and if there is a leap year. we need to do it 366 days. because the job that they did and the things that they did on behalf of this country is something that we should continue to talk about daily.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 26. honoring the Tuskegee Airmen. When Tuskegees first school officially opened on July 4. 1881. Booker T. Washington became the first principal and was the first of many magnificent leaders of that institution. Due to the rigid racial segregation in the United States during World War II. over 966 black military aviators were trained. And one of those men. I am proud to say. was my fathers older brother. my uncle. LeRoy Cleaver. Jr.. of Wichita Falls. Texas. My uncle and others served here at home. in North Africa. Sicily. and Europe. They proved that they were not only some of the Air Forces best men but the militarys best men. On October 9. 1943. Tuskegees 99th Pursuit Squadron was paired with the allwhite 79th Fighter Group. These groups were integrated and no longer restricted to being escorts. instead. they were assigned to the highly hazardous duty of bombing key German strongholds. Tuskegee Airmen destroyed over 1.000 Germany aircraft and received some of our Nations most prestigious military honors. including 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses. 744 Air Medals. eight Purple Hearts. and 14 Bronze Stars. and they never lost a single ship. On February 2. 1948. President Harry Truman of my district in Missouri did what no previous President had dared. He announced courageously in a special message to Congress that he had \"instructed the Secretary of Defense to take steps to have the remaining instances of discrimination in the armed services eliminated as rapidly as possible.\" Even in the dark and demeaning dungeons of discrimination. the Tuskegee Airmen served with dignity.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding me time. Let me begin by thanking my good friend. the gentleman from the State of Alabama . We are both Alabama native sons. What a testament to the Tuskegee Airmen that today a white Alabamian and a black Alabamian stand here to pay tribute to their remarkable work. So much has been said about their remarkable accomplishments. and I will not repeat any of that. but something needs to be said about the origins of these men. When they were born every single one of them was born in a segregated society that was dedicated to the proposition that men and women are unequal and created unequally. When every single one of these men was born. they lived in a world that doubted their value. that doubted their worth. that doubted their potential to contribute to this country. and yet they rose above it. They worked and practiced in an Army. for that matter. that was segregated. Yet they somehow rose above it. There are young men and women who are listening to us right now. Mr. Speaker. and I hope that they will take this lesson from our standing here and saluting these airmen today: That even if you are born in a condition and climate that holds you back. even if you are born in conditions of the inner city and rural parts of the South that would seem to tell you what you cannot do. look up to the Tuskegee Airmen. because they are an example of human beings rising to their highest potential against all kinds of odds. I close. Mr. Speaker. simply by saying again. as a son of Alabama. that this is the progress that our State has made. When the history of the last century is finally written and the history of human progress is written. let it be said that these brave men came to my State of Alabama to learn about serving their country and that they learned a talent that helped keep our country free. May we draw some inspiration from that. I thank all of the outstanding Members who have spoken on this bill today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise this afternoon to speak of bravery. of courage. and of a war that was fought on two fronts. at home and abroad. Over 60 years ago America was at war with totalitarianism and fascist forces spreading across Europe and the Pacific. And here at home. our country was training and building an army to answer the call. an army with a history of excluding African Americans from aviation training. That was the case until just 3 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. when a class of five aviation candidates finished training at the Tuskegee Army Airfield on the campus of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. soon becoming the Nations first African American fighter pilots. They were George S. Roberts. Benjamin 0. Davis. Jr.. Charles H. BeBow. Jr.. Mac Ross. and Lemuel R. Custis. These were the original five Tuskegee Airmen. pilots who entered into combat at a critical part of the war and was instrumental in helping to turn the tide. Between 1941 and 1945. over 1.000 aviators trained at the Tuskegee Army Airfield. Together. fighting alongside hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens. they helped defeat the threat of fascism. proving that America is strongest when they are not divided by bigotry. prejudice. or racism. The military record of these distinguished airmen speaks for itself. 15.500 missions completed. 260 enemy aircraft destroyed. one enemy destroyer sunk. an unprecedented record of flying more than 200 bomber escort missions without the loss of a single bomber to enemy aircraft. The Tuskegee Airmen returned home with Distinguished Flying Crosses. Legions of Merit. Purple Hearts and Silver Stars. but beyond the medals and accolades. these men paved the way to an important and longoverdue victory. the full integration of the U.S. military. That is the lesson of the Tuskegee Airmen. that love of country. skill. and daring are qualities that transcend race or skin color. Today. as we face new threats from abroad. let us learn from the courage and example set by the Tuskegee Airmen. Let us recommit ourselves to putting old and inexcusable divisions behind us. Americas strength lies in our unity. and to move forward. we must work together as one nation. whether it be on foreign battlefields or in our local communities.",

My mayor of Highland Village. Texas. a city that is central to my district. my mayor. Bill Lawrence. is the son of one of the original Tuskegee Airmen. Today. I will be happy to vote for this legislation honoring a proud group of African American heroes of World War II. The House of Representatives should pass H. Con. Res. 26 to honor the Tuskegee Airmen for their bravery in fighting for our freedom in World War II and for their contribution in creating an integrated U.S. Air Force. The Tuskegee Airmen are the fighter pilots of the 99th Pursuit Squadron. which was later incorporated into the 332nd Fighter Group. who fought during World War II in the U.S. Army Air Corps and were trained at Tuskegee Army Field in Tuskegee. Alabama. No better time exists than during Black History Month to put forth such outstanding legislation. Mr. Speaker. 2 weeks ago. I was in the country of Iraq and. in fact. visited with the current 332nd Fighter Group. the original Tuskegee Airmen and there is a mural honoring their proud heritage displayed at their base. This group is so important to our current activity in Iraq. this is the group at Blaad Air Force Base that transfers injured soldiers from the field in stable intensive care environments back to Ramstein. Germany. and then back to the United States. This outstanding group of men and women serving today have transferred over 19.000 patients with only one intertransfer death. truly an outstanding record.",

Res. 26 to honor and pay tribute to the valiant efforts of the Tuskegee Airmen of World War 11. who defended the freedom of the United States and the World while breaking down the racial barriers of the U.S. military. In the midst of World War II. the U.S. Army Air Corps began a program to expand the role of African Americans in the military. In July 1941. 13 men started the first aviation cadet class at Tuskegee Army Field in Tuskegee. Alabama. After 9 months of vigorous flight training. five men successfully completed the program and graduated trom the Tuskegee Flying School. These five airmen included Captain Lemuel R. Custis of my home State of Connecticut. who went on to become one of the first members of the 99th Fighter Squadron. The United States sent the 99th Fighter Squadron to North Africa and later Europe. where the Tuskegee Airmen proved to be valuable to the Allied Forces. By the end of the war. 992 men had graduated from pilot training at Tuskegee. of which. 450 were assigned to combat oversea. In total. the Tuskegee Airmen of the 99th. 100th. 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons distinguished themselves with 1.578 missions. The 332nd earned a Presidential Unit Citation for \"outstanding courage. aggressiveness. and combat technique\" while escorting heavy bombers over Germany. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me today in honoring the outstanding record of the Tuskegee Airmen who proudly defended our Nation and paved the way for full integration of the U.S. military. Their achievements and bravery represent the best qualities of America. and we all owe them our appreciation for their valiant contribution to this country. February 9. 2005 CONGRE",

It has been cleared by both the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. and I have also received word that the Risk Management Agency is supportive of this change. Very simply. the amendment amends the section of the Federal Crop Insurance Act regarding the use of written agreements for commodities in counties where the crop has not yet been approved for crop insurance purposes. The problem is that 3 years of cropping history is needed in order to issue a written agreement for coverage. However. producers cannot get a history of planting because the banker wont lend the money if they cant get insurance coverage. Thus. it is an endless cycle. We have many counties where coverage exists for sunflowers. and we would like to use that data to expand coverage to canola. The Risk Management Agency has indicated that this would be an acceptable practice. However. the current law says that data must be used from the same commodity for which the policy is being issued. This amendment simply changes that language to allow data from agronomically similar crops to be used in providing written agreements. The amendment has been given a score of zero by the CBO. and I urge my colleagues to accept it. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "I understand that the House report on this appropriations measure includes language that directs the APHIS to adopt a particular standard with respect to microchip identification tags for pets. but that the present measure does not include this language. As the ranking member of the authorizing committee that has jurisdiction over this issue. I strongly disagree with this language being inserted in an appropriations report. and with a process that would dictate a standard for these microchips without fully considering alternatives. It is my understanding that pet animals with chips that conform to the standard included in the House report are a small fraction of all the pet animals in the U.S. that presently have a microchip identification tag implanted under their skin. These ID tags play a vital role in reuniting pet animals that have gone astray with their families. Further. I understand that adopting this standard as directed would interfere with ongoing intellectual property litigation over patented technology incorporated in the most widely adopted microchip standard in the U.S. I think it would be improper for Congress to take this action at this time. I do not advocate any action in the current legislation. other than to ensure that the language unfortunately included by the House is not included in the conference report. I would ask the subcommittee chair and the ranking member whether. since the Senate report is silent on this issue. this issue is preserved for our consideration as part of the conference. and whether they agree with me that this provision should be dropped from the conference report?",

South Floridians consistently rely on NOAA and on the National Hurricane Center for information. particularly. again. during this time of the year.

It issues warnings and watches and forecasts and analyzes the weather to make sure that it can stay in front of the technology so that it continuously does a better job in forecasting storms. Very few agencies around the country can say that their work is indispensable in actually saving lives. and the weather center is one of those.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 5450the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Act. During the more than 20 years I have been in Congress. I have made it a priority to promote the protection of our oceans and effective conservation and management of our living marine resources. From protecting coastal wetlands to cleaning up our estuaries to promoting sustainable fisheries to preventing ocean pollutionall have been priorities during my tenure in Congress. We have accomplished a great deal but. as highlighted by the more than 200 reconmendations contained in the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy report. much remains to be done. NOAA was created by an Executive Order in 1970. but has never been formally authorized. Both the U.S. and Pew Ocean Commissions argued strongly for an organic statute for NOAA. A comprehensive organic act will significantly strengthen the agency by providing a clear mandate from Congress to the nations lead civilian agency for oceans and atmosphere. An organic statute is needed to codify and strengthen NOAA and thereby enhance its mission. improve its structure. and better enable it to carry out existing and new responsibilities in a manner that is consistent with ecosystembased management. H.R. 5450 represents real progress toward strengthening NOAA and is an important first step in developing the comprehensive mandate NOAA requires. I look forward to working with Chairman EHLERS and colleagues to develop the additional provisions needed to incorporate guidance on fishery management. coastal zone management. ocean imapping and charting. and other resourcesrelated issues. Such provisions are essential if NOAA is to effectively carry out the host of oceanrelated activities essential to our nations economic and environmental interests. Nevertheless. the bill in its current form represents a welcome effort to address a major hurdle that impedes the federal govemments ability to effectively govem our oceans. coasts. and Great Lakes. Passage of H.R. 5450 will send a clear signal that the health and productivity of our nations oceans are a priority to the U.S. House o Representatives. I commend Chairman EHLERS for his leadership on this issue and I urge mny colleagues to support H.R. 5450.",

However. with no legislative \"organic act\" NOAA was restrained from taking a real leadership role in national oceanic and atmospheric policy. This legislation sets up guidelines and oversight of programs as any authorizing legislation should do for a Federal agency. NOAA now will: have a defined leadership structure and organization. defined missions and authorities. provide strategic plans to the Congress. and be able preserve current NOAA rules and regulations within its legal structure.

But one thing it cannot withstand is doubt over the outcome of elections. We have to know whoever wins. your guy. my guy. conservative. liberal. Republican or Democrat. he or she really won. Won. in fact. It is the only way our leaders have the moral authority they need to take on the great challenges of our times. As others have noted. we have had far too many elections in recent years where serious questions have emerged over irregularities and even fraud. During the last Federal election in 2004 in my home State. Wisconsin. Wisconsin found itself mired with outofdate voter lists. fake names. invalid addresses. double and triple voting. and ballots cast by convicted felons. Our States largest newspaper found almost 300 cases of felons voting illegally. at least 100 cases of double voting. and 1.200 votes from invalid addresses. And the list goes on and on and on. Every one of those illegal votes cancels out a vote legally cast. cancels out a vote from a citizen for whom that right is so precious and so fundamental to our Nations future. A photo ID will not solve all of these problem. not by a long shot. But it is definitely a step in the right direction. a step that I believe most Americans support. a step that I know most Wisconsinites support. That is why last year I introduced comprehensive election reform legislation that would have required a valid photo ID to vote in any Federal election. It is also why I am proud to support this legislation from Chairman HYDE. It is legislation whose time has come. It is a way of ensuring integrity in elections.",

I come from the State of Florida where we had the question of who 52. Pt. 14 18743 voted. This gives us protection because it asks for minimal identification. So it is a good recommendation and it is a recommendation because we dont want 50 States and some States with different levels of requirements. We have a national standard. and that is what was recommended by the commission to ensure that we have a safe and secure ballot. ensure that we not only are protecting our borders but we are protecting our ballots. In Florida you can have a requirement for identification to buy a sixpack or a pack of cigarettes. The very least we can ask is for someone who is going to cast a ballot that is so precious in our democratic process to show some identification. and I think this is a good measure.

But then the big beneficiary is. the money that is being poured into the pockets of the taxpayers. $15 million was used previously by universities to study coal bed methane gas. This last year. 2005. $327 million came into the budget from that $15 million dollar budget. and every year we are increasing the production of coal bed methane gas. The beneficiaries are not Texaco. Chevron. They are not ExxonMobil. The beneficiaries are MIT. Stanford. Penn State. and a whole plethora of other research institutions. This makes sense to lower the costs of energy to our American consumers. One party is in favor of that. The referee stands here trying to block the American people from having lower energy prices. That is a very simple fight to referee. my friend. Mr. Chairman. I oppose the amendment.",

I would just like to reference for the Republicans on this side what the President has said on this issue. \"I will tell you. with $55abarrel oil. we do not need incentives for oil and gas companies to explore.\" That is President Bush talking to the Republicans in Congress. You do not have to tell me that. I already believed that. But he is on my side of the debate now. So the point that we are making is quite clear that. yes. the money comes from the oil companies. but the money comes from oil companies because they have to pay the public for the leases on public land. So the public gets the money. But then what this bill does is then it takes the money back out of the taxpayers pockets and it hands it back over to the oil companies who have already been in the other pocket of the consumer. tipping them upside down and taking it out of $3 a gallon. So this is basically the bonus for one oil executive for a couple of years. 1 mean. that is where they can get the money from if this is such a valuable project. Mr. Chairman.

We will then charge you $3.50. $4 a gallon for it. It just makes no sense. President Bush and DICK CHENEY want this amendment to pass. Vote \"aye\" on the Markey amendment. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. despite the high cost of energy and existing laws enforcing conservation. Federal agencies still do not give energy efficiency a priorily and continually fall short of meeting their requirements. Our estimates are that the Federal Government wasted almost half a billion dollars in the last 2 years by not meeting its requirementsor roughly equivalent to 8.200 barrels of oil every daya total of 6 million barrels over the last 2 years. This happens because the laws already on the books are not taken seriously enough. The National Energy Conservation Policy ActNECPA. last years Energy BillEPACT. and a related Executive order all clearly state that agencies shall meet aggressive but reasonable energy efficiency goals and standards and to prepare reports to the Department of Energy. the Office of Management and Budget. and the Congress and on the agencies performance. Yet the Federal regulations that govern new building construction are 17 years out of date and the reports reach the Congress months or years after the data is available. The amendment I am offering today would increase the incentive for agencies receiving appropriations under the Agriculture appropriations bill to comply with the law by tying Federal buildings performance to appropriations. This amendment simply states that none of the funds made available by this act shall be used in contravention of Federal buildings performance requirements. Therefore. agencies must adhere to existing law when constructing. leasing or refurbishing any building with money appropriated under this act. These relatively simple steps in designing new buildings in conformance with current law. measuring building performance. and procurement of energy efficient products will contribute to substantial energy savings in the Federal sector--lessons that have already been learned outside the Federal Government. Increased energy conservation in the Federal sector means cleaner air. cleaner water. and in a time of soaring energy costs. keeping money in taxpayers pockets. How can we expect consumers and industry to make sacrifices and commit to energy conservation when the Federal Government fails to make it a priority for itself? Mr. Chairman. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. this amendment that I bring before the House today deals with the Missouri River and the flows on the Missouri River that are controlled by the Corps of Engineers in a series of dams that start at Gavins Point Dam in southeast South Dakota and move clear on up into Montana. It has been a struggle along this river for the last several years because there has been a drought upstream for the last 7 to 8 years. And the struggle over the water is something that many people. at least west of Mississippi. are familiar with. This is centered upon an endangered species. an endangered species called the pallid sturgeon. Fish and Wildlife and a number of environmental groups working in conjunction with the Corps of Engineers have come up with this grand experiment. It is this experiment that the idea that the natural spawning of the pallid sturgeon could be enhanced if they created a manmade flood. a \"spring rise\" as they call it. Now. there is not a basis in science for this that we identify. and we have had some hearings on it. It is the belief that if you have the water come up in the spring. that it somehow triggers a 52. Pt. 7 9481 spawning cue. but in fact. rather than emptying the dams out upstream and starving the reservoirs up there of water and flushing out the river and flooding our farmers in especially southwest Iowa and down into Missouri. we have also had those similar circumstances that have taken place repeatedly naturally because of the tributaries that produce this spring rise. So there is not a basis in science for it. and my amendment removes any funding to be used to create a spring rise until such time as there would be a sound science to establish that. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of Mr. KINGS amendment. As many of you know. earlier this month the Army Corps of Engineers decided to move forward with a spring rise on the Missouri River. I continue to remain strongly opposed to this policy because it significantly raises the chances of something adverse happening to the over 1 million Missourians that live along the rivers flood plain. Mr. Chairman. the spring rise is a huge gamble. We are gambling with the livelihoods of all the farmers. landowners. homeowners. and merchants along the river. All for what? To maybe trigger the spawning patterns of the pallid sturgeon. This is a risky science experiment to me. and I will continue to fight against this and future spring rises. Its the farmer that we need to protect. I wish to remind this body how important farmers are to us three times a day when we eat. A spring rise substantially increases the chances of down river flooding and we cannot risk that potential damage to our agricultural community. Farmers play a critical role in America and to the countless countries that rely on them to feed their populations. We must protect our farmers and their livelihoods before we consider this unfounded experiment. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment and encourage its passage.",

The regulations that determine dredging in the Great Lakes need to be updated and reflect the true economic value that they produce. The Great Lakes are the fourth sea coast of this Nation and home to the U.S. Flag fleet and the Canadian Flag fleet. In addition. dozens of international vessels regularly travel through the Great Lakes. visiting port communities along the way. These vessels team up to haul upwards of 125 million tons of cargo during a typical 10month shipping season. That is almost a half of ton for every person in the United States of America.
