My information is that if that project were consummated it would flood out 22.000 acres. including 8 major industrial sites. and remove the land from the tax rolls. The project would prevent the construction of a $40 million paper manufacturing plant. and would flood out the timber lands for the factory. It would flood out the site of a proposed $210 million steam power plant. It would cost. under the estimates submitted. about $78 million. I earnestly hope that my distinguished friend from South Carolina will join forces with us to send the bill back to the committee. where it belongs. in the light of the fiscal situation which confronts our country.",

A study group employed by the Joint Economic Committee recommended that the 25 percent support on the Federal Reserve notes which are being issued be removed. About 2 weeks ago I raised the question: If we do not have a 25 percent gold support. what have we? We have the ever changing judgments of politicians in high public office and in Congress ordering the printing of money interminably. solely for the purpose of creating artificial prosperity. The witch doctors are at hand. They are at the doors of the Federal buildings. They are at the doors of the United States Senate and of the House of Representatives. -They say they will bring us the elixir of some new fangled remedy to cure the problem that is worrying everybody who has any knowledge of it. There are classic remedies. and they are the only remedies. As the Senator from Delaware . has said. the bill does not involve $610 million. it involves $1.2 billion. Classic remedies must be adopted. Unless they are adopted trouble will come. Among other things deficit operations must be stopped. In conclusion. I observe that in the gallery are reporters from certain Ohio newspapers. If they want to do me a favor. I ask them to tell their readers in Ohio that in my judgment calamity lies ahead. that they should tell them to waken to the distress being created by extravagant and imprudent and careless spending by the Congress.

This is a pretty serious statistic when we stop to consider that the parity index is today the lowest it has been since the depression year of 1939. This surely is a far cry from what Mr. Kennedy promised the farmers during his 1960 campaign. I suggest that the time has come when the Secretary of Agriculture might well return from Russia and look at the agricultural problems of America. instead of trying to analyze and improve conditions which may prevail in the U.S.S.R. I read further from my newsletter: The price index for farm products (what the farmer receives) has dropped to 241 from its 242 standing a little over 2 years ago. However. the farmers cost index (what the farmer pays) has risen during the same period from 301 to the highest point in history. 311. In 1960 the farmers share of the consumers dollar was 39 cents. Today it is only 37 cents. Since the present administration took office. there has been a continuing drop in the number of farms. some 369.000 less today than nearly 3 years ago. and a correspondingly higher drop in the number of farmers. Falling farm prices. the reduction in farm population (but an increase in USDA employee rolls). and uncertainties in administration and in farm programs. present an unhappy situation of \"decline and confusion\" confronting American agriculturea situation which holds no promise of improvement under present conditions in which \"positive action\" is most conspicuous by its absence. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in my remarks the article to which I referred from the Sioux Falls. S. Dak..

Today many tractors cost $10.000 or more. Many repairs today are 10 times as much as they were a few years ago. If nothing is done with respect to wheat. we can expect low prices.

That deals with the 7.400.000 soil bank acres which are scheduled to come back into production next December 31. when the contracts expire. unless we enact legislation providing a procedure whereby these acres. now locked into the soil bank. can continue in that status. Think what will otherwise happen to farm prices and to our farm surpluses if we permit 7.400.000 acres. impregnated with fertility. to come fresh out of the soil bank and develop their productive capacity in the following crop year. We should act now if we are to do anything effective to continue inactive and unproductive the soil bank acres. In certain sections of our country farmers are already confronted with making a decision as to what to do with that land next year. If it cannot be preserved in the soil bank. they will have to plow it and cultivate it now. Already some of these acres are moving back into the production stream. This is the time to take action or it will soon be too late to avert trouble. The time to decide what to do about the soil bank acres is already past. We should have taken action a year ago.

At one time our State employed more colored schoolteachers than any other State. Although today our State does not employ quite as many colored schoolteachers as some other States do. the colored schoolteachers in Mississippi take a tremendous amount of pride in their work. They use the very latest and best methods. and do a very effective job. They know the needs of the colored children.

One of the questions which was argued and on which they tried to get a ruling was the question of the organization of school districts. Certain questions were left to be determined. One of those questions was the assignment of students to organized school districts. In the decision rendered by Chief Justice Warren in the Brown case he spoke of the organization of school districts. I am sure that the Senator will find that the implication was that school districts are considered as school districts based on reasonable geographic areas. they could not be gerrymandered in order to avoid desegregation of public schools. The school districts would have to be organized faithfully and properly according to population. territory. and other reasonable considerations.

My judgment is that the Brown decision means what it states. When school districts are organized properly. without gerrymandering. and with due regard for all the children and schools in those districts. there will not be segregation. I do not believe the decision meets a problem which has been recognized since that time. That problem is what is called de facto segregation. In my judgment. problems of de facto segregation were not considered in the Brown case. Such problems are for the States and local districts to decide.",

The question of slavery had been compromised for 40 years with all kinds of legislative. enactments. But Lincoln knew that this basic moral question could not be compromised if the Nation was to endure as a democracy. In a way we have reached another time -in our history similar to the crisis of the 1860s.

    "speech": "Yes. within the scope of the Brown case and decisions which follow its holding. Since that time there has been another Supreme Court decision. involving the school desegregation plans of the school boards of Knoxville. Tenn.. and Nashville. Tenn. In that case. Goss against Board of Education. the school boards had provided that a student could request a transfer from one school district to another where \"good cause\" was shown. The regulations regarding transfer were questioned because the apparent purpose of the transfer program was to enable the white children to transfer out of district schools after Negro children started to attend previously allwhite schools. Some of the crucial provisions of the Knoxville transfer plan which the court considered were as follows: and I quote from page 3 of the opinion: 6. The following will be regarded as some of the valid conditions to support requests for transfer: (a) When a white student would otherwise be required to attend a school previously serving colored students only. (b) When a colored student would otherwise be required to attend a school previously serving white students only. (c) When a student would otherwise be required to attend a school where the majority of students of that school or in his or her grade are of a different race. These provisions were considered by the court to be efforts to thwart. rather than aid. the implementation of the Brown decision. The court said. at page 6: The transfer provisions here cannot be deemed to be reasonably designed to meet legitimate local problems. and therefore do not meet the requirements of Brown. The case went to the Supreme Court in 1963. The Court held that the program of transfer was unconstitutional within the meaning of the \"equal protection\" clause of the 14th amendment. I cannot answer in detail every question the Senator has asked me. I can only say what I think is the lawthat if any system of assignment or transfer of pupils to a particular school comes within the general scope of the Brown case as later interpreted in Goss against Board of Education on the basis of standards set down in these cases it will be sustained. If it is an effort or attempt to vitiate or nullify the holdings of these cases. such programs will be stricken down. as it was in the last case. the Goss case.",

Mr. Funston bases his opposition on the grounds that the measure would be ineffective as a remedy for our balanceofpayments problem and that it would discriminate against stocks.

No notice had gone to anyone in the Senate. My office requested Mr. Valeo to request a delay of 1 day on the military pay bill so that I would have an opportunity to participate. That request was denied by the leadership. I regret to say.

    "speech": "Yes. sir. We are going to put a little new life in it. Here is the history of it. The RichardsGebaur Air Force Base. formerly named Grandview Air Force Base. is located 16 miles south of Kansas City. Mo. The 29th Air Division headquarters and combat center. a fighterinterceptor squadron and combat squadron. reserve troop carrier wing with two squadrons. are stationed at this base. All of these organizations are scheduled to remain at this base for the foreseeable future. Now let me say this: the Department advised us that in every base in this bill they propose to try to maintain and justify them for at least a 5year period. In these bases that we closed up we had to spend $24 million in some 17 other bases in order to take care of the functions which were performed by the bases that we closed. However. we brought about a $34 million annual saving by doing so. This base is public. Now let me finish my answer on RichardsGebaur Air Force Base. There are now 3.800 military personnel at that base. The Government investment is $46 million. There are two items in this program for this base. One project would provide the installation of heat in two aircraft shelters. The other is for the construction of a warehouse. I am happy to advise the distinguished gentleman from Iowa that the Air Defense Command is located in Colorado Springs and it is going to stay there and this RichardsGebaur Air Force Base is a very important part of the overall command.",

A couple of years ago the Defense Supply Agency was set up to take care of certain items of supply that were used in common by the various military services. The Defense Electronics Supply Center was set up in Dayton. Ohio. to take care of those electronics supply matters for all of the services. that is. those matters which were used in common by all the services. Recently the Secretary of Defense apparently decided to change that operation somewhat by moving about 200 jobs to a new supply center west of the Mississippi River. which would transfer about 200 warehousemens jobs from the Defense Electronics Supply Center out to the new western center. and it was also decided to set up some sort of a control center in Columbus. Ohio. which would take about 100 jobs away from the Dayton Electronics Supply Center. I would like to ask the chairman were these transfers adequately considered and fully justified before the Committee on Armed Services?",

I understood some time ago they are going to be closed down. but now it looks as if we are going to get into the building of housing units and other activities out there. The report does not show much about what is going on. but on page 8482 of the hearings you will find there are contemplated expenditures there of $4.426.000. The first item provides for the construction of two squadron headquarters buildings. The second item is for alteration of an existing structurally sound building. The fourth item provides a 200man officers quarters building. The fifth item is for a new service club to replace an existing deteriorated structure. This will furnish a broad range of selfdirected recreational and social activities to all personnel living on the base. The sixth item is for installation of 30 tons of air conditioning for the NCO open mess. The last item is for provision of the second increment of utilities in support of the newly developed Department of Defense cantonment area at this base. These are all new items. so far as I am concerned. There is very little testimony on them. The only testimony is that Colonel Smith said where it was located and said these are the things they are going to be using there. This is. as I say. something new. We are beginning this expenditure out at Bolling When we all thought we were closing it up. In addition. and this surprises me somewhat. in addition to these items of $4.426.000 we are going to build 150 new housing units at Bolling Air Force Base. The purpose of this is to house airmen. This is in addition to the $4.426.000. I understand from staff members this may cost another $2 million or more.

The Joint Committee which the Senator from Minnesota has proposed ought to be formed with the distinct understanding that it would be given jurisdiction over our intelligence departments as a congressional check. because I think there is growing across this country an increasing demand on the part of more and more people that the Congress stop abdicating its rights under the check and balance system of this form of government. and that the intelligence agencies. which now are responsible really only to the executive branch of the Government. be made responsible to the legislative branch of the Government as well. I highly commend the Senator from Minnesota for a very important speechone of the most important. I believe. to be delivered to this session of the Congress. I think the Congress must face the challenges of the speech. and I congratulate the Senator for it.",

To us who were associated with him in the cause of conservation. he was always \"Zahnie.\" Although he suffered from a heart ailment. he never suffered from lack of energy or zeal for the public cause closest to his heartthe preservation of wilderness areas--a cause that had been so much a part of his lifes work. At the time of his death. Dr. Zahniser was the executive director of the Wilderness Society and editor of the Living Wilderness. Sometimes. frankly. I found myself in disagreement with Dr. Zahnisers views. but I never found myself in disagreement with the goal he was seeking. He was steadfast in his devotion to the concept of wilderness as a fundamental part of American culture and tradition. In the words of Harvey Broome. president of the Wilderness Society: To this objective he brought great powers of persuasion and conciliation. and the wilderness bill. when it is finally enacted. will be a monument to him and to his vision. I concur in this judgment because no more spirited champion for this public service could be found than Howard Zahniser. His family and the staff of the Wilderness Society for whom he was the guiding spirit have my deepest sympathy. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial concerning Dr. Zahnisers contributions. which appeared in the Washington Post. be printed in the RECORD at this point.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is fitting that today we commemorate the national holiday of the Rumanian people. Independence Day came to Rumania on May 10. 1877. May 10 stands as a symbol of a proud history and of freedom valiantly won. Rumanian Independence Day 1964. however. is marked with mixed emotion. It is with pride that we note the fortitude and courage of the Rumanian people as reflected by their history. It is also a source of pride that here in America citizens of Rumanian extraction have contributed those noble qualities to our national life. However. it is disheartening that this holiday cannot be celebrated within the boundaries of a nation whose history is so steeped in love of freedom. The Communist dictatorship imposed by the Soviet Union on the Rumanian people has ripped this day from the calendar Just as it has torn freedom away from that once proud and happy land. Today in Rumania dissent is not tolerated. freedom does not exist. The Communist dictatorship has tried to force the people to forget this day. and their proud history. There will be no singing of the national anthem today in Bucharest. but we know that love of freedom persists in Rumania. It Is for us here to give voice to the thoughts and desires which Rumanians cannot express in their own homeland. Rumanians have known oppression before in their long history. Theirs is a nation of a great history and noble tradition. Let the Communist dictators be reminded that Rumania lived under the tyranny of the Ottoman Turks for 400 years. Since the time of Peter the Great it has been invaded 10 times by powerhungry neighbors. including Russia. However. the Rumanian people finally won their freedom. and for six decades stood proud as a free nation. They will once again take their proper place among freedomloving peoples and free nations. Freedom won after centuries of struggle and once enjoyed In happier days cannot remain suppressed. We look forward with them to the day when they will be free. Our prayer is that on another May 10 in the not too distant future. Rumania will once again stand proud among the family of free nations.",

The President of the United States has proposed a massive program for Congress which must be passed before sine die adjournment this year. Some action must be taken on the civil rights bill and soon if Congress is to vote the Presidents program up or down. Two days of debate on a bill is considered substantial debate. Five days of debate on a bill is considered a long debate. Ten to fifteen days debate on a bill is considered to be a very long debate. indeed. But on this bill. Senators have talked for 52 days. an aggregate of hundreds and hundreds of hours. There have been two votes on two relatively minor perfecting amendments. Scores of amendments are still to be acted on. but they have not been brought to a vote. Obviously. it is time the Senate got around to considering the bill on its merits and voting the amendments up or down. or every Senator will suffer from the general public recognition that the U.S. Senate cannot do what thousands of boards. commissions. and councils throughout America do every day: discuss their differences and then act. for or against. up or down. Of course. the essence of successful proceedings conducted in the Senate must be based upon the good will. the spirit of compromise. and the atmosphere of friendliness prevailing among its Members.

Oswald. and his assassinator. Ruby.

I was distressed when I read that. so I went back to see whether there was any documentation. and I find that there is. in governmental reports about that organization. Someone in a responsible position on the Commission should tell us why. on a commission that is charged with doing a fair. honest. objective job. a commission which is supposed to be a blue ribbon commission. should bring into it at least oneI understand possibly there is a secondrepresentative from an organization which is admittedly Communist.

Mr. Zebot is a professor of economics at Georgetown University. and a fugitive from the tyranny and oppression of Tito in Yugoslavia. In this letter. Mr. Zebot discusses the SovietChinese rift. and he points out that this rift between the Soviets and the Chinese should not be used as the basis for the relaxation of alertness and strength by the West. He states: By customary Western standards. open controversies of the scope and intensity of the current SovietChinese verbal exchanges. in which Khrushchev has personally taken CX- 691 part. are not easily settled. In fact. there are widespread expectations in the West that the estrangement between Moscow and Peiping may be irreparable. Mr. Zebot goes on to point out that Titos party was expelled from the Cominform. and that the separation appeared complete and irreversible and permanent. Yet we now know that except for some minor differences Tito and Communist Yugoslavia are accepted fully into the family of Communist nations. He concludes: These tensions are real. But they are not such as to justify either adventurous responses or complacency on the part of the West. Rather we should remain composed but anxious enough to try so to influence these tensions that they will contribute to the evolution of more freedom and justice and a safer peace in the world.

During the over of a quarter of a century that Nat Cole has been before the public he has changed but little physically. but he has grown to be a figure of international importance. He has sold over 50 million records. performed in literally thousands of concert halls and theaters throughout the world. He has traveled to over a score of foreign countries including Japan. Sweden. England. France. and Australia. to mention just a few. His unique voice and his own remarkable presence have made him a great ambassador of good will without portfolio. for our country. for whenever Nat Cole entered a foreign country. whatever its attitude may have been when he arrived. we know from the reception he received that he improved our image and made a legion of friends for us. At a time when monarchs throughout the world reign in a shrinking market America can well boast of this king who extends his admirable domain peacefully and happily as the years pass. He symbolizes for us and for our neighbors abroad much of the best that is America. a kind of dignity. of integrity and assurance of bearing. a kind of indestructible character that is a credit to his people and to the United States. This coming year Nat Cole will be traveling once more abroad. to Europe for an extended concert tour. He is a man. above all. who feels strongly that whenever he sets foot outside this country he represents us. It would indeed be wonderful if we could be sure that every representative of ours brought as much prestige and created as much good will for America as Nat King Cole.

Were we now to turn our backs on that historic \"Declaration of Independence\" as an outdated paper. relevant to bygone days. we would have no reason to be concerned with todays captive nations.

And. were we to file away with other dusty documents of the past the Fourth of July pronouncement. then certainly the 88th Congress and the American people might well not sound their sympathy for captive peoples. But we cannot be cynical and forgetful of--or faithless tothe brave men who preceded us and endowed us with the blessings of a free country. No. As we turn to the observance of Captive Nations Week. we dedicate ourselves anew to the noble theme that all men are created equal and are truly entitled to their inalienable rights. not by the tolerance of some beneficent government. but as Godgiven to be enjoyed by every individual.

In such a tragic circumstance it is up to Congress to exert its full legislative responsibility under the Constitution without giving any additional powers to the President so that the Nation may be preserved. It is only the strength of our system which has enabled us to prevent complete collapse under the bungling of the President for the past 3 years. Our only hope is to prevent him from taking the kind of rash action which would wreck the country until the people have a chance to remove him next year.

Captive Nations Week is not a week of celebration with festivity and gladness. but one to be commemorated solemnly with an expression of our longfelt sympathy for the more than 100 million people who are captives of totalitarian communism.

Latvia. and Lithuania. in the Baltic area. Czechoslovakia. Hungary. and Poland in central and Eastern Europe. and Bulgaria and Rumania in the Balkan Peninsula.

I am including with my remarks an editorial broadcast by radio station WFAH in Alliance Ohio. which comments upon the boast of a society band leader that his recording of \"Hail to the Chief\" is being used as signoff music by 160 radio stations. in place of the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" I think the editorial comment is well done. I feel certain that this practice is not growing as a result of any suggestions from the White House. for I believe the President would abhor a development so reminiscent of what the Russians call the cult of the personality. I feel confident he will wish to discourage the practice when it is called to his attention. Much as we honor the office of the Presidency. it is contrary to every tradition of this Republic to make either the office or the incumbent of that office a symbol of our devotion to the United States of America: President Kennedy has his favorite orchestra leader. Lester Lanin. who plays at many White House functions. Recently Lanin recorded an arrangement of \"Hail to the Chief.\" the 150yearold presidential salute. Lanin says that more than 160 radio stations are playing his version of \"Hail to the Chief\" instead of \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" our national anthem. One hundred and sixty stations represent only a small percentage of the more than 5.000 radio stations on the air. and it seems rather insignificant and unimportant. But A4629 it is significant. it is Important. It is one more piece fitted into place in the giant puzzle of whats happening to the United States of America. Suppose \"Hail to the Chief\" were substituted for the national anthem at patriotic rallies. at public gatherings of all kinds. including baseball and football games. Soon the high office of the Presidency becomes even more important than the country itself. Certainly \"Hail to the Chief\" should be played at all public appearances of the President. but let us not substitute a salute to our No. 1 public servant in place of our national anthem.

I refer to the colloquy between the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia and the distinguished Senior Senator from Oregon with respect to what they exposed as misrepresentations made against them and appearing in one of the local papers. I commiserate with them. Over 10 years ago a pair of smear writers wrote a smear book that smeared some two dozen Senators. I was one of them. They charged that I was proCommunist. a leftwinger and a \"fellow traveler\" because of my declaration of conscience. Against the vigorous warnings of good friends. I sued them for libel. I was the only one of the two dozen maligned Senators who did sue them for libel. It took me 41/2 years to get them into court after their constant stalling and attempts to evade the inevitable. And on the first day when the jury was about to be selected as the case opened. their spokesman got up in court and admitted that what they had written about me was false. They folded and made a public apology and retraction in prominent newspaper advertisements for which they paidand they paid damages. It was a complete victory for me and a significant victory against what Senators RUSSELL and MORSE have called \"yellow journalism\"-and while the smear writers folded when the \"chips were down.\" it took me 4Y2 years to nail them down. to even get them to trial. Over the weekend I read last Fridays RECORD with much interest for while Senators RUSSELL and MORSE denounced the misrepresentations made against them in a local paper. they were relatively lucky compared to the misrepresentations made against me on September 28. 1963. in a column carried by hundreds of newspapers throughout the Nation.

[ARAI spent $10.000 to train 100 copper mine workers for Anaconda. a giant company with the capability to train its own workers with its own money. I asked the Area Redevelopment to comment on those statements.

The cost to the company for the training is certainly a great deal more than that to the Government for the 2week orientation program.

This is very unfortunate indeed because this arm of the Congress is competent. well considered. and well operated. It will be remembered as an agency which was created through the active efforts of many Senators. including Senator George W. Norris. of Nebraska. The very first Comptroller General was the late Mr. McCarl. of McCook. Nebr. Review of any Government expenditure on interstate highways by such a competent body should be welcomed because when the Interstate Highway System is completed. it will be turned over to the State of Nebraska for maintenance at State expense. It therefore behooves anyone who has Nebraskas best interests at heart to insist upon the best possible building and construction job in the first instance. The General Accounting Office is fair In its operations. Before its report on Nebraska State construction was released. its proposed text was made available to the Federal Bureau of Roads for Its comment to be included in the report as published. The Appropriations Committee of the Senate was informed that the Federal bureau. in turn. communicated with the Nebraska highway department for its comment. This is typical of the fairness and the thoroughness with which an effort is made to produce a helpful and meaningful report. Under the able leadership of Comptroller General Joseph Campbell. the General Accounting Office goes about its job quietly and efficiently. Without its honest examination and appraisal of governmental operations. the Congress would have no intelligent accounting of the extensive spending programs which we authorize. In sharp contrast to the legions of public information officers who thump the publicity tubs for almost every other agency. the General Accounting Office does not even have a public information office. Yet its work is respected and regarded highly by the public. These thoughts are expressed in more detail in a recent editorial in the Omaha WorldHerald. I ask unanimous consent.

His article is an appeal for the balanced judgment in the formulation of foreign policy positions. He centers his remarks on five major foreign policy issues: First. the partial nuclear test ban. second. our adventure in space. third. our policy toward Europe. fourth. our involvement in South Vietnam. and fifth. our hope for improvement in SovietAmerican relations. In each of these problem areas. Mr. Bundy calls for a balancing of our hopes for peace with our determination to be vigilant in the face of a potentially dangerous enemy. He pleads for an appreciation of the viewpoints of our fellow citizens who may happen to be in disagreement with us on any given issue: Error comes mainly not from support of ones own position but from suspicions of the other mansMr. Bundy says. He adds: Where danger comes is not in these equally right perceptions of important phenomena but in the human tendency * * * to suppose that ones own reality is theonly reality. so that the observation of the other man is somehow misleading.. Mr. President. I think Mr. Bundy would agree that Members of the Senate often pressed hard for a particular point of view without apparent concern for a conflicting viewpoint because of a conviction that a corrective is needed to a generally accepted position. Such zeal for ones own personal insight or bias is perhaps a necessary quality of political effectiveness. But I am grateful that high in the councils of Government where final policy decisions are made. there is a man of Mr. Bundys intellect and emotional balance--one who is capable of looking clearly at all sides of vital issues.

His work in the field of drug regulation shows another facet of the Senators greatnesshis refusal to give up.

We had joined together as sponsor of considerable antitrust legislation. including the drug bill. and together we had fought through to a successful conclusion the enactment of the CellerKefauver Act and the civil investigative demand legislation both highly significant in the strengthening of our antitrust laws. Both of us shared the conviction that our economy to be free. competitive. and strong. must look to the antitrust laws. and their importance. to sustain that ideal. We both felt that economic concentration was an economic evil that had to be fought and resisted. Behind the soft voice and gentle manner of ESTES KEFAUVER. lay immeasurable strength. He was not afraid to tackle the big job. to take on the giants of industry. or the masters of crime. He did it without bluster. without threat. and without arrogance.

I am sure. who was fortunate enough to have our personal paths cross from time to time. and on each occasion his stalwart example in pursuing the public interest served as an inspiration to a degree that leaves us profoundly in his debt. As a vigorous and tireless campaigner for the Presidency. Senator KEFAUVER came to know my State of Wisconsin and its Second Congressional District well. and I was more than privileged to serve as a delegate to the national convention in his behalf. But long after he aspired to the Presidency. he came to my aid and campaigned for me with all the drive and energy that he exhibited in his own campaign. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee. my attention naturally focused on his activities in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary where I was able to observe and get a full measure of appreciation of the courage that has characterized the special investigations which he spearheaded and chaired. It takes a very special kind of courage to cross swords with giant drug interests and the powerful steel and telecommunications industries. racketeers and gambling syndicates. But Senator KEFAUVER refused to be deflected from his singular role of guardian and protector of the American public in his endless crusade against monopoly and organized crime. With much the same courage. the coonskincapped Tennessean stood out among his southern colleagues as a champion of civil rights and defender of racial equality long before the words \"sitin\" and \"freedom march\" became part of the daily American lexicon. It is too soon to try to evaluate the breadth and depth of his impact on American social. political. and economic life. but I have every confidence that his influence will continue to be felt for many years.

A Look Ahead.\" cites economists as saying that all of the ingredients for inflation are present. including a strong rise in business. growing confidence of businessmen and consumers. a push by unions for bigger pay raises. bigger budget deficits. and a big tax cut. As the article concludes: The lull in inflation of recent years now seems to be coming to an end. Under unanimous consent. I wish to insert this article from the U.S. News & World Report at this point in the RECORD:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the year that is gonethe 1st session of the 88th Congresshas been the most gruelling in my 17 years in the House and the frustrations. the disappointments. and the unrelenting pressures to which we have been subjected have resulted in all too many of our colleagues being called to their eternal rest. Perhaps. too. the fact that we are the constant targets of those who want only to make capital out of Congress resistance to bad legislation has been a prime reason for the fatalities that marked last years legislative path. Today we mourn the passing of a distinguished and dedicated colleague who was a tower of strength on our Ways and Means Committee where he lent his not inconsiderable talents to the reporting of good legislation or. which is equally important. to withholding immature measures that could only add to the socialistic menace which is bearing down upon us. HOWARD BAKER was a man who recognized a basic commitment to represent the interests of his constituents but he also accepted the larger mandate stemming from national welfare as a whole. Good men of this mans stature are not readily encountered and he will indeed be hard to replace. One of our cherished privileges was that of service with Mr. BARERS soninlaw. the Honorable William C. Wampler. who was here with us in the 83d Congress. During that period we came to appreciate the fine traditions of the Baker family. not only through the father but also through the daughter. and our [DIX A35 hearts go out to those who suffer in this bereavement. Mrs. Dague joins with me in a prayerful petition that the family of our late colleague will find consolation in the assurance that there are so many who mourn with them in this sad hour.

    "speech": "I congratulate the Senator from Alaska on his excellent speech. He is always eloquent and always wise in his statements--except. perhaps. on the rare occasions when he and I disagree. I share his belief that the appeasement of Nasser would pay off in essentially the same way as did the appeasement of Hitler. Instead of preventing aggression. it would serve. as it is already serving. as a stimulus to further aggression. My own view is that the official silence of our State Department and our representatives in the United Nations on the subject of Nassers aggression and threats of aggression is something that defies understanding. I find it incomprehensible that our State Department should remain silent. Knowing that the Senator from Alaska intended to speak on this subject this afternoon. because he was kind enough to notify me that he would do so. I looked up some notes and other papers on the subject. and I was reminded again of how dreadful this situation is. Is the Senator from Alaska aware that when Nasser addressed his military units that had just returned from Yemen. the Egyptian dictatorI use that descriptive term advisedly. because I believe that is what he isspoke in these words: You. the armed forces. who protect the homeland against any imperialist or Israel aggression. represent justice here. The armed forces are preparing to restore the rights of the Palestinian people because the Palestine battle in 1948 is a shameful thing for the whole Arab Nation. Nobody can forget this shame. The rights of the Palestinian people must be restored. Therefore. we must prepare to face Israel. Zionism. and imperialism which backs Israel. Such statements are nothing new. Nasser has frequently committed himself to the objective of the military \"liberation\" of Israel. But his words are worth remembering at this time. because they demonstrate the intention of the man. When he talks of \"liberation.\" he means the subjection of Israel. he means the destruction of Israel.",

    "speech": "That is correct. I found in my files the text of a broadcast made by the Voice of the Arab Nation. which is really the voice of Nasser. to the people of Jordan last April 30. Imagine a head of state in this hour of history using language such as this: Hussein. the 900.000 Palestine refugees on the western bank will tear you to pieces. and each of them will take a piece of your rotten body and throw it into the face of Israel to repay the Jews for the price of treason which your grandfather Abdullah received for Palestine. Those were Nassers exact words. On the following day. May 1. the same Voice of the Arab Nation added this appeal: Let the bullets whiz. let the guns roar and declare a raging revolution. Masses of our people [ Voice the cries of the revolution and rush to the guns with hearts that are not afraid to die. Those are certainly reminiscent of the words of Hitler and the terrible dictators who brought on the destruction of World War II. In the case of Yemen. Nasser moved from threats to direct action. This is significant. His quisling agents staged a coup in the city of Sana. But since those agents were completely without support. Nasser found it necessary to send in an army of 40.000 United Arab Republic troops to help maintain this regime in power. The cost of this military operation more than liquidated any benefits that may have accrued to the Egyptian people from the American foreign aid program. It must have done so. Unfortunately. it can be said that our aid to Nasser made it possible for him to conduct his military operations against the people of Yemen.",

Among other things. the article states: If the Midwest is to retain its leadership in providing consumer and industrial goods. we must unite the facilities and talents of industry. the research institutes. and our universities. My remarks at this time are directed to the Members of Congress who represent the States of Ohio. Indiana. Illinois. .Michigan. Wisconsin. Minnesota. and Iowa. . Mr. Murphy. who is a graduate of Ohio State University and is connected with the Goodyear Aerospace Corp.. further said: . Seven of the countrys top 10 producers of graduates in engineering and science are midwestern universities. But a recent study of persons who received doctorates in the Midwest in 1961 and then entered Industry shows that only 10 percent of them stayed in this area. In other words. the Midwestern States have 7 of the countrys 10 leading producers of graduates in engineering and science. Ninety percent of those graduates depart from the Midwest and move on to other States. The consequence is that the Midwestern States are suffering an erosion of their economy that ought to frighten the representatives in Congress of those States. We cannot cope with the problem of combating such erosion on an individual basis.

Princess Ileana of Rumania once asked Communist Ana Pauker why the Rumanians were being subjected to so many inhuman acts. Her reply was that the Communists viewed a newly conquered nation as a field with which a different crop was to be planted. the land had to be completely disheveled and everything burned. Then the new seed was planted. ThereforeAna Pauker saidwe have to terrorize the older generation into silence. so they do not dare to speak to the young ones and to remember. so that the young ones would not have any memory whatsoever of times past. that their minds would be absolutely empty of anything but what the Communist regime wanted to plant in it. And that is why (the Communists) had to use torture imprisonment. Ana Paukers statement has been disproved by the Rumanians. Despite the countless acts of unbelievable savagery. Rumanians have continued to cherish their nations historical values. The field of freedom and independence has been burned but not destroyed.

I do not know of any civil rights that are superior to those listed in the first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the United States. If I had to choose one procedural guarantee. and could not choose more than one. I probably would choose the right of trial by jury. I believe it to be the most precious of all civil rights in the Constitution of the United States. It is the greatest procedural civil right on the books. When I say that. I realize that it is difficult to choose one civil right above another. such as freedom of speech. freedom of religion. the right to petition the Government. the right to prevent the quartering of troops in ones home. and various other rights contained in the Bill of Rights which are essential and vital and valuable. These are substantive civil rights. However. the right of trial by jury when a man Is charged with a crime. when his very liberty is at stake. and his very life may be at stake. is the greatest procedural civil right. in my opinion. In such a case I would want 12 of my fellow countrymen to hear my case and render a decision. not 1 judge. who might be biased for one reason or another.

I think that most of us agree that this is probably a phaseout program. at least the people who have contacted me from our State of Michigan I believeare beginning to understand that it is a phaseout program. Up in Michigan we use Mexican labor now only in the pickle industry. in harvesting cucumbers. The people In that industry and the farmers who raise cucumbers have asked me to support this measure because they are at least a year away from any kind of a mechanical harvesting device which is practical. As a matter of fact. they know from experience that they cannot get domestic manpower. either migrant or local. to harvest pickles. It is stoop labor and they cannot induce the people to go out and do that kind of work. They are in the process of developing a machine and in the process of developing a variety of cucumber which will be uniform in its growth so that you can have a uniform size of the plant. and so on. So. with that in mind. I urge you to support this 1year extension. I think that the people up in that part of the country realize that very decisively after the way the measure was defeated in May. they cannot depend upon this importation of labor as any kind of a permanent proposition.

As has been emphasized by previous speakers. to do away with this program would have a particularly adverse effect on the family farm. In September of 1962 there were 8.332.000 total farm laborers. Of this number there were 228.000 domestic migrant workers and 106.000 Mexican nationals. A family farm. Mr. Chairman. if you want to take .a ruleofthumb definition. is considered a farm that is big enough for a farmer and his family to make a living on and. yet is not so big that the farmer and his family cannot provide over 50 percent of the labor at all times. except at harvest time. When harvest time comes labor is essential. The familysize farm has handicaps because of the availability of labor. Where are you going to get labor immediately so your perishable crop will not be destroyed? The family farmer is handicapped because of unemployment insurance programs. And I suppose nearly all of us in the Chamber have voted for unemployment insurance programs. But can you imagine the difficulty of getting a man to stoop to pick strawberries for $20 or $30 a day when he and his wife. according to the gentleman from California . may be eligible to draw $1.000 a month in unemployment insurance? It is a terrible matter. Mr. Chairman. that confronts the family farmer of America if. when he has available labor. properly certified by the Secretary of Labor. willing to work and the farmer is willing to pay him. to refuse him the privilege of obtaining that necessary labor.",

I have not been lobbied at great length either for or against the legislation. I do not regard the legitimate communications from the people I represent as lobbying in any sense of the word. And I wanted to say to the gentleman from Rhode Island who dwelt here on the use of this labor in cotton that cotton is one of the smallest users of the migrant worker in California. that the great majority of the workers are engaged in the harvesting or working on crops of tomatoes. lemons. oranges. asparagus. lettuce. and other truck crops.

They are the specialty crops and they are paying in the great majority of instances wage levels in excess of the national minimums prescribed for industrial employment.

Close and friendly relations with the other countries of the world and a deeper understanding of the world can be gained for this country by continuing and increasing the flow of American visitors traveling to all parts of the world. Such visitors are often called ambassadors of good will. This is not entirely correct. however. for while there may be certain parallels between the actions of our diplomats and our traveling American public. the people who venture to other countries on their own have a chance for the type of persontoperson contact which. by the nature of the official duties of the diplomat. are unmatched. Our visitors abroad have the chance to. and do. make the close personal contacts which. more than any treaty. can insure international friendship. It should be the job. then. of our Government to facilitate in every way the flow of Americans to the other countries of the world where people are anxious to know more of us and to meet us. As a step in that direction. I have today introduced a bill to establish a national passport policy and to reorient the administrative functions of the Department of State in this area to the greater accomplishment of this policy. It calls for a recognition of the beneficial effects of travel upon our international relationships. it seeks a minimization of travel restrictions and impediments. At the same time that it calls for an emphasis on travel and an elimination of the burdensome formalities that accompany international travel. this bill recognizes the clear and present danger which the international Communist conspiracy poses to this country and to the free world and it makes specific provision for limitations of the right to travel in cases in which this would work to the detriment of America or where such travel would be dangerous to the individual. I believe that much can be done to encourage Americans to travel abroad and make the kind of contacts that help cement a free and harmonious world. This bill. to establish a national passport policy and to establish an administrative mechanism to support this policy. would help us achieve the goals which are possible through friendly international travel.",

Printed herewith is a summary table of the burden of this discussion comparing circumstances and our positions when the conferences began in 1958 with what they now are. in 1963. It is emphasized that the subject of a test ban treaty was placed in a frame of reference by former President Eisenhower when negotiations began as aiming at a treaty. self enforced by adequate machinery to detect violations and inspection machinery to confirm their occurrence or nonoccurrence. Today the discussions proceed on a basis which would provide neither adequate detection machinery nor adequate inspection procedures. As a consequence. any treaty arrived at on this basis will not be cheatproof. Thus. it cannot be expected to forward the national security interests of the United States. rather it could imperil them.",

All the information we have had in the committee from the Secretary of Agriculture. as the Senator has indicated. shows there will be a drop of somewhere between $500 and $700 million in agricultural income this year if Congress does not act on the wheat situation. In the absence of additional legislation. it would represent i drop of about onethird in the income of the wheat farmers of this country. The President. in his agricultural message a few days ago. reminded us that the income of the farmers of the United States is only about 55 percent of the national average. At a time when we are talking about having some relief through tax legislation and other devices to stimulate the economy. it does not seem to make much sense to sit idly by and permit one segment of the economy that is already distressed to suffer another loss in income of between $500 and $700 million. I commend the chairman of the committee for almost superhuman efforts in having this bill reported from the committee. I think it is especially commendable in view of the fact that. though he personally objects to some features of the bill. he nevertheless worked harder than any other member of the committee to bring this legislation out in time. because he knew. if it was to be effective at all. it had to be on the statute books by the first of March.

This extra burden of overhead expense also applies to many companies which wind up the year under the statutory floor. If there is any chance that they may exceed the present minimum of $1 million. they must obviously keep the special records required to separate their renegotiable from their commercial business. If they are near the borderline. they must make careful checks to be sure their figures are accurate. \"And the minute one of these small companies has an even reasonably good year. making as much as perhaps 12 percent before taxes. it is then set to spend a year or more of spending money for legal counsel and special accounting costs. wondering whether it will be allowed to keep what it has earned.\" POINT IV Above all. the Renegotiation Act is unfair since there is no firm criteria upon which a contractor can rely to know whether profits are excessive or not.

    "speech": "In our State there are a great many small manufacturing jewelry shops. We have been anxious. because of the employment situation. to repeal the excise tax in order to stimulate more buying of articles which today are not considered as luxury items. The point that has been raised by the Senator from Illinois is that the retailer would be relieved of imposing the tax. which is true. but it would be imposed upon the manufacturer. The only difference is that while the burden has been upon the retailer to file his tax returns. the fact is that he had the money in hand at the time. paid by the consumer. he did that. He would not have to file any return to the Federal Government excepting in cases in which he had accepted the tax from a purchaser. Now we would levy the tax even before the article is sold. When an individual who is already hard hit. one who employs 20 to 25 people in a shop. and who is now selling to a jobber or a retailer. sells his product. he must pay the tax even though he has never collected the money. What we would do would be to add insult to injury. We set out to stimulate buying. We set out to relieve the people of the burden. Now what we shall have actually done is as follows: We shall have relieved the person who has collected the money from the burden of reporting. but we would compel the person who has not collected the money to pay the tax in advance. What we are asked to do is to make the situation even worse than before. I cannot understand the logic of the argument. if it is being made. that the proposal would save $260 million. which is about onehalf of what we are collecting now on these articles. Rather than make that tax 10 percent. why do we not cut the tax by 5 percent and leave the system the way it is? I cannot see any logic in adopting a brandnew system and forcing on a new group of peoplepeople who have been hurta responsibility they have not had before. I hope the Senator will indulge me-",

There are many retailers who sell a great variety of items. who then sell items that are subject to this tax. The burden of collecting and reporting the tax is very great. When the decision was made earlier this year to reduce tax revenues by about $11 billion. Congress. having made that decisionwhich I did not shareI felt then. and I feel now. that a repeal of these taxes. which are so burdensome on business. should be included. I did not vote for the provision that is in the bill. I did not support the motion to remove the retail taxes and impose manufacturing taxes. I believe. however. that the retail taxes should be removed. About half a billion dollars is Involved. In the light of all the circumstances. they should not be continued. My vote against this proposal was not because I wanted the retail excise taxes continued. I think they should be terminated. I did not believe it was wise to impose a new tax on any segment of American industry without a hearing and without notice. Therefore I would much prefer an outright repeal of these taxes. It should have been a part of the $11 billion package. I did not share in the view that that be done. but were we to reduce revenue by that amount. in order to support the economy. this is an item that should have had first claim upon the Congress. However. I rise at this time not to discuss the merits or demerits of the proposal. but to ask the distinguished Senator from Minnesota a few questions. in order to ascertain legislative intent. My first question is this: Is it the intent. in transferring these taxes from the retail level to the manufacturers level. to preserve all exemptions which are now in the law?",

We put a 20percent excise tax on all cosmetics that the barber and beautician use in the course of his trade in his shop. After years of effort. Congress. by a separate Act. removed that inequity. It was a gross inequity. We were dealing with a part of our business community made up almost entirely of small businessmen. We were dealing with individuals who make their living by the use of their hands. We put an excise tax on the tools in their hands.

A drugstore in Kentucky or Nebraska or elsewhere may sell many different items. The druggist employs a young girl to wait on the trade. A customer comes in and buys certain cosmetics or jewelry which are subject to tax. and also some other items. which are not subject to tax. There may be included some baby oil. which is not subject to tax. The young girl may or may not accurately. in the rush of the trade. charge the customer the right amount of tax. It is a very practical problem in operating a retail establishment. The Internal Revenue Service has been very firm and stern in this connection. I have been informed that a retailer has been approached by the Excise Tax Division and told. \"Your gross sales amounted to x dollars. We are applying a rule of thumb. We think that you sold this amount in taxable merchandise. Either pay or you can oppose the judgment.\" How can a little businessman fight the Governnent? How can he afford to have it known in the community that he is in tax trouble? How can he afford to hire a lawyer and how can he prove his case when it involves sales of many items that cost less than a dollar? That is why the tax is so burdensome. The agitation for the repeal of the tax comes not only from the customer. It comes primarily from the retailer. He has a justifiable case. He will get no relief if the tax is reduced to 5 percent. With the tax still imposed. it is questionable whether the reduction would speed up the sales. I believe that when the reduction was made from 20 to 10 percent. it did speed up sales. I believe the 20percent tax was so high that it frightened a great many customers from buying various items. The only solution is to repeal the tax.",

That precise question. as to whether that activity was interstate or intrastate commerce. was presented by a Pennsylvania case. In the Pennsylvania case. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania criminally prosecuted certain defendants operating a restaurant. The defendants had obtained the ingredients of food shipped Into Pennsylvania. Those ingredients consisted of such things as Jello. a pie mix. and certain lemon products. Those products were cooked into pies for serv. ice to the customers of the restaurant An artificial coloring was added to the pie. in violation of the State law of Pennsylvania. The restaurant owners were prosecuted for violation of the Pennsylvania law. In their defense. they urged that they were not subject to Pennsylvania law because the food had been shipped into Pennsylvania from the State of New York and therefore they were engaging in interstate commerce. the exact position which the proponents of the civil rights bill take in their attempts to regulate restaurants. The Pennsylvania court held that the ingredients came to rest. after interstate passage. in the State of Pennsylvania. that they had been converted into another product. and that they clearly lost their interstate character and were therefore. completely subject to the regulation of the laws of Pennsylvania. The preparation of the pies for sale and any sale that might be made was held to be an intrastate transaction. subject only to the laws of Pennsylvania. This is the same kind of case that was decided to the same effect by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington in the past few years. During the course of this debate.

Seward was making plans for a joyful celebration on the weekend of April 4 and 5. Then on Good Friday. 9 days earlier. disaster struckthe earthquake being followed by several engulfing tidal waves--Seward was left in ruins. On Friday night. Mayor Perry Stockton of Sewardwho had come to Washington earlier in the week as a member of Gov. William A. Egans commission to meet with the corresponding members of the Federal Commission to work on Alaska rehabilitation. appointed by President Johnsonwent to Alexandria. There was a hospitable gathering there to welcome Mayor Stockton. attended by Mayor and Mrs. Mann. members of the city council. and other interested Alexandrians. Mayor Stockton had the opportunity to express his appreciation on the part of the people of Seward. I would like to join in that expression of appreciation of the generosity and kindness that has prompted that action in the city across the Potomac. All Alaskans will be grateful. I ask unanimous consent that a news story headed \"Mayor of Seward Thanks Citizens of Alexandria.\" an editorial entitled \"A Visitor From Seward.\" and a column. \"Red Cross Reports\" all from the Alexandria Gazette of April 10. be printed at this point in my remarks.",

We have been brainwashed to believe that communism headed by Mr. Khrushchev is changing its spots. Surely it must never be forgotten that Stalin chose Khrushchev because of his innate cruelty to institute and carry out the food shortages in the Ukraine and caused the death of at least 8 million people. Moscow has tried for years to make the free world believe it no longer follows the terrorist measures of Stalin. Certainly the Hungarians and Poles in 1956 along with all the captive peoples have experienced Communist brutality. Supported by the Red army in 1945 the national Communist parties have established effective control over the economic. political and social life of 100 million people. A systematic campaign has been under way these past years to nationalize industry and trade. collectivize agriculture and enforce state economic planning. Characteristically the Communists have been tireless in their efforts to destroy all forms of individual liberty as well as religious worship and education. In turn an insidious program was introduced to indoctrinate the youth and destroy family loyalties by requiring blind obedience to the state. As Americans it is part of our tradition and heritage to stand clearly for freedom for all nations on all continents.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the political party system of the United States is often compared with the systems of nations with parliamentary forms of government. In such systems. party loyalty is strictly enforced on every issue and governments can fall on the loss of a few votes. Here in the United States. our political system has a greater degree of flexibility. but ties of party loyalty remain strong. After all we have operated with our existing two major parties for more than a century. As a result. it is always difficult for a Member of Congress to go against the wishes of the leadership of his party. But there are occasions when a deep belief in the rightness of a policy or a piece of legislation causes one to take unpopular positions. Such an occasion arose for my colleague. the gentleman from Massachusetts. SILVIO 0. CONTE. over the Foreign Aid Appropriations Act. Mr. CONTE felt that his long support for the foreign aid program and his consistent efforts to improve it required him to support the full amount authorized by the Foreign Affairs Committee despite considerable opposition within the Republican Party. It was a difficult decision to make and one which I know he did not like to make. He acted only after the most careful thought and consideration. His courage was noted in many parts of the country. Let me quote in part from editorials in the New York Times and the Boston Herald. The New York Times wrote: The administrations foreign aid budget has survived a Stormy passage through the House Appropriations Committee with comparatively minor damage. In previous years. the committee voted severe reductions. but this time it cut only $200 million out the $3.5 billion \"barebones\" request made by the President. It rejected a series of attempts. spearheaded by Representative OTTO E. PASSMAN and the Republican minority to make further cuts. * * * Although former President Eisenhowers announcement of his support for the program had little visible effect. with only Svro 0.

Mr. Lawrence Rifkin became upset about the Russians veto of the United States resolution In the U.N. to condemn Syria. so he picketed the Soviet Mission. His picketing sign said \"How come you did not scream when the Syrians murdered a few Jews\" He was stopped in his picketing and told that he was- not allowed to do this. Is it not strange how we protect our enemies and punish our friends? At this point. I ask unanimous consent to have recent newspaper accounts of this incident printed in the REC6RD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I would like to tell the Members of this House. more particularly the New Jersey congressional delegation. about gambling in that State. New Jersey is one of those 24 States that has had the sense to legalize. control. and profit from parimutuel betting. But. as in most other States so acting. only a half step has been taken. Illegal gamblingthe logical result of bluenosed governmental attitudesis keeping the crime syndicates fat and happy in New Jersey. A covert coalition of hypocrites and mobsters is keeping gambling illegaland bleeding the State in the process. In 1962. New Jersey ranked fourth in the Nation in parimutuel betting. Almost $325 million was wagered on the States racetracks. The public treasury of New Jersey made about a $30million profit from this turnover. However. most of the money gambled in New Jersey is doing nothing to swell governmental coffers. Instead. the revenues of illicit gambling are financing the underworld crime syndicates. New Jerseys share of the estimated figure for national offtrack betting presented to the McClellan Committee came to almost $1.7 billion last year. When it is realized that offtrack betting constitutes less than onehalf of the total illegal gambling. the full and stunning extent of illegal gambling becomes apparent. In New Jersey. Mr. Speaker. the total amount wagered illegally each year may approach $3 1/2 billion. This figure represents the turnover. The gambling syndicates retain only 10 percent of the turnover as profit. But this is enough to make New Jersey a gangland gravytrain. The gambling rings contribute much of their take to the financing of syndicated crime. The gross profit which may reach $350 million a year in that State is diminished by expenses such as bribes and payoffs to corrupt law enforcement. We all know that gambling cannot be eradicated. and so long as it is outlawed. but tacitly allowed to flourish in criminal hands. it will continue to spin a vast web of evil. Only Government control and regulation of gamblingbest exemplified by a Governmentrun lotterycan make it work for the people rather than against society. When are we going to remove our heads from in the sand? Centralization of Control of Public Education",

We need this central library. We need the other items also. but when we start to discuss the question of priority. it is a question as to whether we stop too soon in drawing the line of priority.

I am not suggesting that the other recommendations of the committee for enlarging facilities for the school system are undesirable. But I am simply saying the committee stops short when they do not include a library. Second. there has been a substantial increase in the estimates of the cost of a library. That is not justification for not building the library. That is only an argument that the committee ought to make very clear to the District of Columbia Commissioners before the contract is let. that they be certain that they need a library this size. and that the money is being wisely spent. It can be simply covered by the committee making clear in conference that they shall not spend more than this amount of money. They can impose whatever restrictions they want to impose on the District of Columbia Commissioners in order to guarantee to the taxpayers that they will get their moneys worth. As to the location of the site. it does not follow that the library must be located here. If we need to put any language in here to suggest this site or such other site as the Commissioners select. do that. But the point is that the longer we wait. the more it is going to cost. And the longer we wait. the greater the need is going to be. and the greater the harm is going to be in not providing proper library facilities. I refuse to believe that in the year 1964 we cannot build adequate library facilities for the people in the District of Columbia. The report furnished by the experts show that the city sorely needs the facilities. I do not think that any of the three reasons advanced by the Senator from West Virginia is justification for not going along with the House in approving the building of a library. But whatever restrictions are needed. language saying: \"You shall not spend more than this amount.\" could be inserted and then leave open for the determination of the District Commissioners. the location of the site.",

A year without atmospheric testing has left our air cleaner. This is a benefit to every American family. and to every family everywhere. since all radiation. however small. involves some possibility of biological risk to us or to our descendants. At the same time we have taken every precaution to insure the security of the United States. To this end. we have put into full effect the program of safeguards originally approved by President Kennedy on the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I can report that the Chiefs have reviewed the present program and agree that satisfactory progress is being made under It. Indeed the safeguards program leaves us much safer against surprises than we were In the period of moratorium begun in 1959. Even if this treaty should end tomorrow. the United States would be safer and stronger than before. We owe the test ban treaty. and this year of progress. to the determined and dedicated leadership of a great President. and the Senate of the United States and this leadership toward peace has had no partisan tinge. Fourfifths of the Democrats and threefourths of the Republicans in the Senate voted for this treaty.

The inference is made that a \"powerful beef lobby\" has used devious methods in securing consideration of legislation. May I point out Mr. Speaker that some 72 Members of the House have introduced legislation dealing with this matter. This does not seem to me a devious way tc go about securing consideration of legi.ation. It is also appropriate to point out that the other body recently passed by a vote of 72 to 13 a bill providing for modest restrictions on beef imports at times when domestic beef prices were severely depressed. This bill would not provide \"rigid import quotas\" as the editorial states but only limited restrictions at the past 5year average. when domestic prices were depressed. There seems to me no logical reason why the largest segment of our agricultural economy should not be deserving of this modest protection. Those of us who support legislation to provide the Nations livestock industry with modest relief from imports have been unsuccessful in securing consideration of such legislation by the Ways and Means Committee of the House. We would welcome an opportunity to present our case. In the absence of such an opportunity we would welcome an opportunity to consider the Senatepassed bill on the floor of the House. I hope the House leadership will not be a party to any attempt by opponents of this legislation to bypass the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives.

Bolivia has announced that it will break relations with Communist Cuba in the near future. and thus coincide with the action just taken by the Organization of American States calling for all OASmember nations to end recognition of Castros regime. Ironically. Mexico announced at the same time that it would reject the OAS action by continuing diplomatic ties with Castro. The statement made yesterday by the Mexican Foreign Minister flies in the teeth of formal steps taken together by the nations of this hemisphere. It is clearly a slap in the faces of all free people in North and South America. and will not strengthen the OAS itself. The Mexican position takes on added significance in view of the fact that Bolivia. along with Uruguay and Chile. sympathized with Mexico and favored a soft line on Cuba. Yet Bolivia announced compliance with the OAS 1 week after the sanctions were voted on Cuba. It seems that Mexico could do the same. If the Government of Mexico does not reverse its position and abide by the OAS action in the near future then Mexican membership in that interAmerican body must be reconsidered. For an organization to be effective it must first act. then move to enforce its own actions. If Mexico will not act with the OAS. then the OAS must act on Mexico.",

It Is not enough for many U.S. manufacturers to compete. pay taxes. meet payrolls. and maintain high product standards any more. many domestic manufacturers today find that they are forced to compete with foreign governments as well and I make specific reference to our Canadian neighbors to the north. Before an Indiana manufacturer can sell his products to a Canadian concern a tariff amounting to 25 percent in many Instances must be paid. Assuming that an Indiana manufacturer of automobile frames shipped $1 million worth of frames to Canada he would be forced to pay a duty of $250.000. If. on the other hand. this same company had a subsidiary in Canada. the Canadian Government would offer a rebate or bounty to the Canadian subsidiary if certain stipulations were met. . I do not have to go into detail to point out that this practice on the part of the Canadian Government is inducing many U.S. concerns to open plants in Canada. Nor do I have to point out that cheaper Canadian labor. as well as the dollar advantage of the Canadians. has enabled many Canadian factories to pay a 6percent duty and still undersell many automotive parts factories located in this country. According to the law if the Secretary of the Treasury learns of practices outlined above. It Is the responsibility of the Secretary to invoke a countervailing duty on the products equal to the rebate. Since the Canadian Government has been carrying on Its bounty program for quite some time it is. in my opinion. unfortunate that the administration has failed to take corrective measures rather than Members of Congress having to bring this matter to the attention of the public. Where there is a flagrant disregard for our tariff laws. it seems to me that the Treasury should take appropriate steps without being prodded into taking action. However. this problem seems to be like a- great many of our other problemsthe State Department feels that it has preeminence over such matters. To many of my colleagues my remarks this afternoon may seem strong. however. when jobs are at stakeand believe me they are at stake in my congressional district in IndianaI feel that the tone used in these comments in describing this situation is justified.",

This is the second opportunity that the Secretary of State has had to pull Wielands chestnuts out of the fire. If we are diligent we should watch closely to see what he does now. It has been reliably reported that a threeman panel has concluded that Wieland should not be fired from the State Department but should be reinstated. In the first instance Wieland was marked for discharge by the security division. Thereafter. the office of the Secretary cleared him and prepared to assign him to a highly sensitive post in Germany. On that occasion it was J. Edgar Hoover and the Attorney General who prevented this assignment. Now here the question is again. There seems to be no question but that it was William Wieland who failed or refused to forward data to higher officials which would have marked Fidel Castro as a Communist and. needless to say. this information was vital to the wellbeing of the American people.

Edgar Hoover intervened to prevent his assignment to a sensitive post after Otepka and his people had found the facts? Is it not true that the Attorney General himself prevented this assignment? Is it not true that Wieland had seen Castro on at least six occasions when he said he had seen him only twice? And is it not true that the State Department through some kind of motivation not made clear. has refused to undertake proving its charges of insubordination against Otto Otepka?

If the ARA is to employe a promotional and publicity staff. they should report both sides of the issues and all of the facts.

The information was compiled from ARA Directories of Approved Projects with recent supplemental information from other sources near the project. Although the ARA continues to report that all is well with all approved projects. a casual investigation will quickly reveal that much is wrong and worsening. There are other ARAapproved projects which are near bankruptcy about which I shall report later. The abovementioned data follow: SYNOPSIS UTAH Carbon County: Blue Flame Coal Co.. Price. Utah. In September 1962. ARA approved an industrial loan of $81.000 which has been disbursed. to expand mining operations. ARA claimed at the time that this project would result in creating 33 jobs. However. the May 1964 Directory of Approved Projects says: \"Employment potential uncertain.\" A check into the project revealed that the firm no longer exists. It is not listed in the current Price telephone directory. although it was listed in the previous issue. The Carbon County Industrial Department reported that ARA has foreclosed on this firm. The officer of record is now employed elsewhere. IDAHO Benewah County: Benewah Lumber Coop. Inc.. Plummer. Idaho. In September 1962. ARA approved a loan of $143.000. all of which has been disbursed. for replacing a lumber finishing plant. The ARA Directory of Approved Projects for August 1963. showed this loan would create 65 jobs. However. the May 31. 1964. directory shows: \"Employment potential uncertain.\" A check on this. through the Idaho State Chamber of Commerce. revealed that it was found that the mill had been located on marshy ground. A portion of the operating capital was diverted to solve the land problem and the mill has reopened on a limited basis. with a maximum of 40 jobsnot the 65 claimed by ARA. A further check disclosed that the firm is also suffering from lack of adequate capital making it impossible to carry any inventory. and necessary to cease operations in the winter.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. reference is made in the December 21. 1963. issue of the Army. Navy. Air Force Journal and Register to the fact that Secretary of Defense McNamara wants a $191 million pay raise for the armed services. The article says the effective pay adjustment will be October 1964. Meanwhile. as far as I know. the Defense Department. which operates the oversea schools for the children of servicemen. has done little or nothing about the salary schedule of teachers in these schools. Public Law 86911959provides that oversea teachers salaries are to be in line with the scale of teachers salaries here in the United States. According to a study of the National Educational Association. increases in U.S. teachers salaries since 1960 have averaged 15 percent. Since September 1960. however. the Defense Department has not provided any salary schedule increase for Oversea teachers. Yet a review was supposed to be made each year. I understand that these oversea teachers will get a $100 increase in 1964. but compared to their counterparts in the United States. salaries will still remain far below the level of teachers pay in comparable areas in this country. For example. an oversea teacher with 2 years experience and a bachelors degree receives $560 a year less than his counterparts here. At the next level above that. the difference is $678. while teachers with 6 years of college receive $1.000 a year less. In the State of Washington. the Washington Educational Association has declared recently that conditions prevailing in schools for dependents of military personnel in foreign countries are inexcusable. There are 300 schools in 26 countries involved and 7.000 teachers for 160.000 children of our military personnel. Mr. Speaker. I hope the House Committee on. Armed Services will investigate. This subject should be considered just as soon as Congress reconvenes in January. Certainly the pay scale of civilian teachers in our military establishments abroad should be adjusted and treated with the same fair..ess as the proposed increases in military pay scales. A National Educational Association report says Defense Department budget reA7782 quests have been insufficient to allow for adequate pay increases and other educational improvements recommended by their recent survey.

As a Californian I should like to add my statement to those which have been made earlier. I shall do whatever I can do to assist the able Senator from Alaska and his able colleague in organizing and mounting a maximum attempt at resuscitation by the Federal Government. In the backlash of the sudden fury my State and its people. too. were damaged. In the area of Crescent City. Calif.. people were suddenly drowned. The loss of life was severe in that small community. Private property owned by people in the area of Crescent City Harbor in great part was swept into the sea. The event represented a tragic loss for those of our fellow citizens who make their livelihood in and have enjoyed the northern coastal area of my State. It is rather difficult for one who only reads. but who did not see. to recall what took place in my State in 1906. when suddenly. with an awful din and roar. the whole city of San Francisco was pummeled. Buildings toppled. and the great fire which followed inflicted a tragic damage. Now. as I am sure my able friend from Alaska has correctly said. the sudden fury in Alaska is the greatest that the world has ever seen since the tragedy in San Francisco generations ago. I can only repeat that the hearts of those whom I have the honor in part to represent on the floor of the Senate go out to the Senators from Alaska and to those whom they represent.

The Senator from Alaska can be assured of the fact that the Congress of the United States will be ready to respond quickly to any program that may be recommended that meets the needs of the people. As the Senator has noted. the President of the United States acted promptly and effectively. Mr. McDermott. the Presidents personal representative. has demonstrated effective leadership and cooperation. While we note that agencies of the Government have already moved into action we are particularly reminded of the importance of civil defense and its worthwhileness to the national security in these moments of emergency. and we are also reminded of the interdependence of our Nation. The tragedy which befell Alaska was not confined only to Alaska. it went up and down the coastline. Not only did it affect the west coast and the areas adjacent thereto. but the entire Nation. if only by sentiment and emotion.

Today no insurance company will insure for damage by floods. tidal waves. earthquakes except at exorbiant rates. or other losses which may occur as a result of acts of nature. Insurance can be obtained for fire. wind. and casualties of that kind. but I feel that Congress has a responsibility to establish some kind of Federal program to enable people to insure against other Wpes of losses which are noninsurable under existing conditions. The people in all the 50 States should have a way of obtaining insurance for losses caused by acts of nature similar to that provided in the case of war damage. We know that no private insurance company can provide insurance for that type of damage. This suggestion would not be an invasion of private enterprise. This was discussed under prior administrations. under President Eisenhowers administration and under President Kennedys administration. and I am sure President Johnson is likewise sympathetic to such a program. During times of disaster we have a tendency to become enthusiastic about providing such a program. but we have a tendency to let our enthusiasm run out later. We should recognize this present catastrophe as a warning. and I suggest that we join at this time in a determination to find a solution to this problem.

These provisions of law recommended for repeal by the Joint Economic Committee are the only ones which place a restraint upon the printing of Federal Reserve notes and. in a measure. upon the management of the Federal Reserve Banking System.

The printing of money will be left to the discretion of men as distinguished from prescription by law. In the discussion which I had on the subject. I was joined by a group of Senators who expressed like apprehension about the recommendation. It has now come to my attention that William McChesney Martin. Jr.. the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. on November 5. 1963. in a reply to a letter written him by the Honorable PAUL H.

Attached is a copy of a letter I wrote to Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges Immediately following my attendance at the White House conference on export expansion. At that time. Secretary Dillon strongly expressed the need for increased exports to enable the United States to achieve a favorable balance of payments. As you know. since my letter to Secretary Hodges was written. the Canadian Government has broadened the number of items on which they will rebate tariff from engines and automatic transmissions only to all automotive parts. This. of course. makes the impact even more severe. We certainly cannot protect our national balance of payments if a foreign government is permitted to so subsidize Its manufacturers that it is wholly impossible for a manufacturer In the United States to compete In his own domestic market. We do not want subsidies. For that matter. we would like to see all tariffs eliminatedas long as it is a twoway street. We are enthusiastic about free world trade. However. in this Instance. we request that a countervailing duty be placed on automotive parts imported from Canada to counteract an actual subsidy by the Canadian Government to its manufacturers. If it is necessary for a formal complaint to be filed with the Department of the Treasury to start the procedure for Imposing such a countervailing duty. please accept this letter as that formal complaint.

One reason the Senate is in this position at this late hour is that it paid no attention to its duty to investigate thoroughly the subject when it was called to the attention of the Senate nearly a year ago. The Senate has been negligent in not having seen that all the witnesses were called before the committee. Had they been called and put under oath I believe that the subject discussed here today could have been developed. At any rate. it has been developed today. I believe that in fairness to the participants involved. Mr. McCloskey and all others. they should be given an opportunity at a public session to explain under oath their versions. The explanation ought not to be merely some snap answer that might be made to the press. They should be given an opportunity to make their statements under oath. Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Baker. and Mr. McCloskey could be put under oath. We have a definite responsibility. The investigation could proceed simultaneously with discussions of the pending bills. It should be made at the present time by all means. To delay the inquiry until after the election will invite the charge of whitewash.",

He has said. \"Here are certain facts that require and demand further explanation.\" Certainly that is true. When there is submitted to the Government a billing in the amount of $100.000 which. based on the files on record. should be in the amount of only $73.631.28. a prima facie case is made of a violation of law that would justify criminal prosecution. Any prosecutor in a district attorneys office or a U.S. attorneys office. on the basis of such evidence as is in the record. who .could not get a conviction would not be very much of a prosecutor. It may be that there is some explanation. There may be evidence that the $100.000 really means $73.000. But the burden would be on those involved insofar as prosecution is concerned.",

A modification has been proposed to the Senators amendment. about which I have spoken to him. that would for a half year require about $70.000 to employ 10 lawyers. I have discussed this question with the Justice Department. There is a feeling in the Department. as expressed by Department officials. that an additional 10 lawyers would be needed. I feel. however. that since. it is now almost midDecember. and since it would require a rather considerable period of time to obtain security clearance for the personnel. a smaller amount would be provided in the amendment. which would fulfill the needs of the Department. There is no need for asking more than Is required and more than can be constructively used. Therefore. I elicit the attention of the chairman. I feel a proposal to add $50.000 to the amount lined on line 2. page 16. to make the amount \"$18.707.000.\" instead of \"$18.657.000\" would mean that an additional $50.000 would be made available to the Justice Department in this particular category. and thereby permit the Justice Department to employ approximately between six and seven additional attorneys for the remainder of the year. Actually. the number might be more. because it would greatly depend upon the time required for security clearance. I do not believe it would be done in much less than 6 weeks. Therefore I should like to elicit the views of the chairman on- this matter. I know what the committee report states. I serve on the committee. I must say. in all candor. that I voted for the committee recommendation. Incidentally. I have received no complaints from the Justice Department. I read about the possibility of an inadequate professional staff for the Civil Rights Division. and I inquired about it. I was told that there definitely was a need for additional professional staff members. Therefore. I prepared the amendment. However. I have no desire to substitute my amendment for the amendment offered by the Senators from New York. who took the lead in this. matter. It is not a question of whose amendment is voted on. it is a matter of adjusting the figure to the point where we can obtain what we feel is needed. and nothing more.

This question was not raised either in the subcommittee or in the full committee. I am hopeful that what we have done can be sustained. As has been indicated. there will be very early consideration of this subject next year. We shall find that there will be an insistence on getting down to business on appropriation bills early in the next year. There will be plenty of time to consider this matter. I hope the committee will be sustained. If it cannot be sustained. naturally I would prefer the lesser amount.

They cannot all be handled by U.S. attorneys. If the U.S. attorneys tried to do so. their other work would become completely bogged down. They would not be able to handle the regular civil and criminal litigation which makes up the usual caseload in every district. Addressing myself to the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. it is true that the figure of $167.000 is for the full year. just as the other figure in the bill was for the full year. We are faced with an unprecedented situation. We are passing an appropriation bill when the fiscal year is half over. If additional lawyers were employedand most of the pressing need is for lawyers and not for clerical personnelthey would have to go through the normal FBI clearance procedure. which a Government lawyer must go through. and this would require about 6 weeks. as the Senator from Minnesota has indicated. Therefore. it might be adequate to make an allowance for the remaining 5 months of the fiscal year. That might be adequate to employ the 10 lawyers that are needed. for the balance of the fiscal year. In that case I would compute the amount to be closer to $70.000 than the $50.000 the Senator from Minnesota has indicated. I believe\" that some amount in that neighborhood would. as I envision it. do the job which the Department of Justice says is necessary for the balance of the fiscal year. I wonder if the Senator could. not see his way clear to agree to a figure of $70.000 as opposed to $50.000.",

The question to be decided is whether we want to add a few additional lawyers to handle the workload which the Senator frdm New York has so adequately. documented. My own view is that if $50.000 were allowed. it would be of significant help to the Department. because the $50.000 would not be earmarked.

A group of young scientists. two from each State in the Union. was invited to attend a 3week camp at Camp Pocahontas. near the site of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Lectures. field trips. and hikes were organized to investigate numerous earth sciences which can be studied extensively in the area. Dr. Charles N. Cochran. assistant professor of mathematics at the University of West Virginia. took the leading part in organizing and directing the activities of the camp. This year he has again taken on the project with still greater vigor.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. over the past several months. I have been quite concerned over the adverse effect the increased importation of beef and beef products has had upon our domestic cattle industry. Of equal concern has been the closure of lead and zinc mines in New Mexico as a result of excessive imports of these commodities combined with a decline in metal prices. I have appeared before the U.S. Tariff Commission on numerous occasions to request that tighter tariff restrictions be placed on these products so important to the economy of my State. The beef industry has been and is faced with a critical situation and their problem. in turn. translates into an economic dilemma for the State of New Mexico. For example. beef cattle sales are responsible for about 50 percent of our total agricultural cash receipts. Those receipts amount to about $114 million per annum. Such receipts account for the fact that agriculture ranks second. in terms of dollar sales. among our basic State industries. It is my carefully considered conclusion. based on the record. that the primary cause for our depressed market is the rise in imports as a percentage of our domestic production of beef. veal. beef cattle. and calves. which in 1962 was 10.6 percent as compared with 3.9 percent in 1957. With respect to the lead and zinc industry. at one time New Mexico depended upon its lead and zinc mines for substantial employment of its citirtns and for a large share of the States financial income. From 1948 to 1952. the average aggregate production of both industries approximated $12 million annually. In 1952. there were about 1.200 men employed in the leadzinc industry. while today only about 300 are employed. Because of the rapid decline in metal prices from 1952 to 1962 and due to increased imports. our leadzinc production dropped over 55 percent. The State has suffered severe unemployment. job insecurity. and a depressed economic condition in the communities completely dependent upon mining. The enactment of this legislation to amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would bring about some relief to both the cattle and leadzinc industries and immeasurably improve our overall economy.",

I am happy to associate myself with the efforts of the gentleman from New York to give some measure of protection to hundreds of American businesses and thousands of American workers. Through the years I have been among those in this body who repeatedly have tried to call attention to the very serious and harmful effects which rapidly mounting imported products were having on our own domestic production. There have been countless instances cited. As has been documented several times. the pleas of injured industries usually fall on deaf ears at the Tariff Commission. We have tried to get remedial legislation many times. at least to provide an effective means of relief when American industries and jobs are threatened with extinction by import competition. When the muchheralded Trade Expansion Act was before the Congress. we tried again in vain to write in adequate protection. So now we have the effort suggested by the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from North Carolina . What this legislation seeks to do is really simple enoughand a modest attempt under the circumstances. It does not propose any great rollback in tariff practices. It merely asks that the tariff cutting be suspendedthat it go no furtheron hundreds of articles which already have been limited by the competition from countries of cheap labor. The gentleman from New York already has pointed out that more than 800 industries appeared before the U.S. Tariff Commission and the Trade Information Committee to object to the inclusion of their production items in the current GATT negotiations. The legislation proposed establishes eight new catagories of articles which would be removed from further tariffcutting negotiation. Any articles which qualify under any of these eight criteria would be removed from the Presidents list of items offered for tariff reduction. Mr. Speaker. I for one believe we have delayed this protection far too long. - While we talk of stopping poverty. and of broad new programs designed to bring new jobs to Americans. yet we let more and more jobs be destroyed by the competition of cheap labor products from abroad. Let us give adequate protection to our own industries and workers. and then see how much additional help is needed to wipe out pockets of poverty and to stimulate new economic activity.",

They pointed out that between 1956 and 1962 imports of drawn wire excluding baling wire. had increased by 375.50 percent which represents a figure in tons of from 47.040 tons in 1956 to 223.673 tons in Mr. Speaker. in their statement to me this organization further pointed out that during the past 5 years at least three companies in the United States had given up completely the production of wires. These companies were the WickwireSpencer Co.. of Buffalo. N.Y.. the Pittsburgh Steel Co. and Bethlehem Steel Co. One of the reasons that they had to give up. of course. was that they just could not compete with the foreign imports of wire.",

While neither has ever directly confronted the realities of life with which less fortunate boys contend in their youth. both are. from what they say. exceedingly warmhearted. Furthermore. except in the tumult of political campaigns. neither has ever been engaged in the local life of the great cities. grappling. as local authorities must. with community problems. Both are dedicated politicians whose success in 1960 shows that they overlook no opportunity to build a following among the less fortunate denizens of our Nation. Finally. both are determined to expand Federal power far beyond its present limits. The antennas of warmhearted people who have had little experience in social problems vibrate violently because some people are poor. wayless. and often wayward. They want to do something without delay and with little consideration of the practical limitations which confront general social amelioration. If these considerations are joined to a thrust for political power. the way becomes clear. just as it appeared to Harry Hopkins 25 years ago. to use social welfare as a means to that end.",

All of us are vitally concerned with this overwhelming national problempoverty. Our attention is centered on how best to alleviate the burdens of unemployment. inadequate education. limited opportunity. and the lack of motivation. President Johnson has done an outstanding job of focusing public attention on this economically deprived area of the United States. His message on Appalachia reflects extensive analysis of the difficulties faced by the citizens and detailed thought as to the best way to aid them. Appalachia is a blight on this land of plenty. These 15 million people do not. unfortunately. receive an equitable share of our prosperity. Other citizens of this great Nation are also not participating in the economic abundance of our land. Many of the problems which confront the inhabitants of the Appalachian Mountain area are manifest in my State. Southern Missouri. especially that part right in the middle of the Ozark Mountains. is beset by the ills common to the eastern mountain region. In some of our counties over 60 percent of the population receives oldage assistance. over 12 percent of the children under 18 years old are recipients of aid to dependent children. and the median income falls considerably below $2.000 per year. In short. an environment. very comparable to that of Appalachia. exists throughout a considerable area in my State. I am not. of course. suggesting that one area is more important that the other. Rather. my intention is to highlight the similarities between the two areas and would suggest an extension of the Appalachian program to cover comparable areas of the country such as the Ozarks.",

Under it the leading minds of Poland with the strong backing of the Polish people formed the first liberal government in Polish history. That May 3. marked a great bursting forth of the Polish people. They did this after a century of repression and many centuries of medieval cruelties. They are now once again in a period of repression and cruelty. At every turn they are prevented from pursuing their own destiny. and determining their own fate. But Polish history should always be remembered by the rest of the world. We should not underestimate the power of freedom to inflame the minds and spirits of men. Since 1945 Communists have spread the great lie that happiness and peace prevail in Poland. We all know this is not the case. Soviet Russia has lost the minds of the captive people. It must soon lose the ability to hold them captive. The Polish uprising in 1956 was surer proof of the true feeling of Poland than all the lies of Communist propaganda. The people of Poland should. by right and desire. be free and independent. Let us urge on them the same courage and -conviction displayed so often before. most notably in 1791. when they adopted a constitution which was a milestone in the march of liberty and freedom. Yesterdays date also coincides with the .600th anniversary of the founding of the University of Krakow.the 25th anniversary of the GermanSoviet attack on Poland. and the 20th anniversaries of the Battle of Monte Cassino. of the Warsaw uprising. and of the founding of the Polish American Congress.",

Buffett. four times a Congressman from the Second District of Nebraska. died in Omaha Wednesday at the age of 60. Howard Buffett. a close personal friend of mine. will always be remembered as a hardworking and sincere Representative of the people of Nebraskas Second District. as well as the Nation as a whole. He was a respected Member of the House of Representatives during the 78th. 79th. 80th. and 82d Congresses. As a member of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. he was known as the \"champion of a sound dollar.\" When he decided not to run for reelection to the Congress in 1952. an editorial in the Omaha WorldHerald described him thus: We are not discussing whether Mr. Buffett is generally right or wrong or In between. but are only stating the rather obvious fact that he calls them the way he sees them and always in accordance with what he considers the welfare of the public. As many Members of the House recall. Howard Buffett spoke out on public issues as he believed. even when it was in conflict with his own Republican Party position. Many of my colleagues will also remember his forceful. conservative writing. which appeared in Human Events and other publications. He was a wellknown contributor to the Omaha WorldHerald. But his interests went far beyond the legislative issues he believed in and worked for. He was one of Omahas and Nebraskas most active civic leaders. He was a successful investment banker and businessman. Above all. he was a dedicated and devoted husband and father. No one can measure the loss brought about by the untimely death of Howard Buffett. I will miss him as a personal friend. The Members of the House of Representatives will miss him as an able. respected former colleague. His wife and children will miss him as a devoted family man.

I would like to add my remarks to those of the gentleman representing the Second Nebraska District. and say that our warm friend and former Congressman Howard Buffett was truly an outstanding man. possessed of a wit and sincerity of purpose that was truly amazing. Unfortunately. I did not become acquainted with Howard Buffett until I entered political life. But after we met I grew to admire his political stature and wide perspective of the national scene. Congressman Buffett. many here will recall. was one of the real constitutional conservatives. He was ever alert against encroachment of Executive power and spoke boldly against its erosion of the peoples right to rule themselves. In addition. Congressman Buffett was resolute. Once he had exercised his Judgment and determined his stand. it was taken with firmness. And he could not be prevailed upon to desert his position by the highest offices in the land. In conclusion. may I say that the Honorable Howard Buffett was a remarkable man. particularly in the field of economics. where his experience gave him an insight into monetary policies denied most. For that reason he buckled on the armor of combat to battle those who would destroy this country by the insidious practices of eroding our dwindling gold reserve and encouraging inflation. Succinctly and to the point. Nebraska lost one of its greatest Representatives. and the people of the United States a real patriot when Congressman Buffett decided to abandon his seat here after four terms of the finest representation on record. We know the news of his death will sadden many who will see in it the end of a chapter in which an articulate voice and pen spoke out in the conservative cause.

At the present time the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare is considering legislation which I introduced to assist police authorities in the control of dangerous drugs such as amphetamines and barbiturates by requiring producers and distributors of these drugs to keep strict reports. which are available to police authorities. of the exact amounts of these drugs produced and the outlets to which they are distributed.

I have had occasion to join with some of my colleagues in the past in protesting against our continued largeScale aid to the Nasser regime so long as it continues to engage in aggression against its neighbors and to threaten the annihilation of the State of Israel. I have taken the stand that continued aid should be made conditional on the abandonment of military aggression as an instrument of state policy and of an evidence that the United Arab Republic is prepared to seek a conciliatory settlement of the differences that now threaten the peace of the Mediterranean area. In the current issue of the Atlantic Monthly there is an article entitled \"Bomb Shop in the Nile: Target Israel\" by Terence Prittie. which I wish to call to the attention of all my colleagues. Mr. Prittie in this article presents detailed information about Nassers preparations for a war of annihilation against the State of Israel involving the use of shortrange rockets now being produced in Egypt and of subnuclear weapons. including packages of strontium 90 which could be used as instruments of total genocide in an area the size of Israel. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have the article by Mr. Terence Prittie printed in the RECORD at this point. I earnestly hope that my colleagues will find the time to read it.

The Corps of Engineers is authorized to select from among those surveys submitted to the committee. the ones they feel are most urgent. Sometimes. as the Senator may know. they may budget $25.000 to $50.000 for a survey. and then. after the Corps of Engineers spends $3.000 or $4.000 of that amount. they find out that further work on that survey is not feasible and. therefore. they give it up. We always provide a lump sum to take care of surveys which are presented to the committee and which show some promise.

Citizens of our Nation should recognize the scope. as well as the limitations. of this legislation. They should resolve within the provisions of this bill to make it work.

The Senator from Minnesota is stating only what occurred in 1957. I am not in any way being critical of how Senators voted then. or how they will vote now. In 1957. a House bill was intercepted. Senate bills were to be found in the Judiciary Committee. Those bills were not reported to the Senate. In 1963. and in this year of 1964. a bill that has come from the House is a House bill. and it is before the Senate today for the purpose of being placed on the calendar. The bills that are in the Senate committees are Senate bills. with the exception of two that have been reported to the Senate. There have been more hearings on fair employment practices this past year than at any other time in the history of the Senate. and a bill is on the calendar. There have been hearings on public accommodations before a duly constituted committee of the Senatethe Committee on Commerce. Those are two vital features of the House billnot in exact detail. Seldom are House bills and Senate bills alike. If they were alike. there would be no need to have reference to committees. But all of the substance. the total aggregate. of the civil rights bills has been testified to. heard. and examined by the appropriate committee of the Senate.

I feel it would be far better to follow the normal procedures and give the Judiciary Committee a week. or perhaps even slightly longer. to fulfill its function on the House bill. to magnify it by the publicity that would be given to its activities. a better understanding of all the many facets and titles to the bill. and leave the Senate with a feeling that it has gone the full course with respect to the traditions that have obtained for so long in the Senate. Unfortunately. I feel the rules are at variance and it is not clear exactly what the strict thrust of the rules might mean. therefore. I believe that a vote in favor of a motion to table at this time. with the feeling of assurance that either the distinguished senior Senator from Tennessee or the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon or other Senators would immediately offer a motion to commit the bill. to refer the bill to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to report on a day certain. would fulfill the best desires of Senators who would like to start this long debate with the feeling that the Senate has acted in fairness to both sides.",

I believe I should reiterate what I have said previously. that while this procedure is not orderly procedure under the rules. it is a procedure which is based cn precedent. It is a procedure which we can carry out under the rules. and the rules give a Senator the privilege to act in this manner. It is a precedent which. in my opinion. has not been unduly abused. I do not have to bring to the attention of Members of this body the realities of the situation affecting civil rights. because there have been hearings before three committees. there have been 8 or 9 days of hearings before the Judiciary Committee. and if my memory serves me correctly. one witness was present. and by and large that one witness was questioned by one member.

Senate bill 22. to release the right. title. or interest. if any. of the United States in certain streets in the village of Heyburn. Idaho. and to repeal the reverter in patent for public reserve. Since then I have studied the committee report on S. 22. I am satisfied it does not in any way violate the Morse formula. I want to say goodnaturedly that what was needed by the Department of the Interior when they first made this transfer. was a little better legal work. because if there ever was a transfer of property that was confused legally. it was this transfer in Heyburn. Idaho. What is involved is a transfer by the Department of a dedicated townsite which at one time was really a reclamation project. The streets were all balled up. The Department kept the reversionary right to the streets and sought to transfer the lots. and then seemed to be a little surprised when the title insurance company found it impossible. or refused. to give title insurance to the lots. Who could blame them for that? It could not very well give clear title. I am satisfied there Is no oil or gold or silver or copper or other precious metal under these streets. In fact. there was no good reason for keeping the reversionary interest in a dedicated townsite that was a part of a reclamation project. Ordinarily the street would be transferred to the municipality. and it would have the right to the streets In that municipality if there was to be a dedicated townsite. I see no violation of the Morse formula in this transfer. because there was confusion. and there was bound to be confusion in an attempt to hold the reversionary interest in the streets. Furthermore. it would be more costly to the Federal Government to hold the reversionary interest than to get rid of it. Therefore. I see no objection to the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is no greater problem facing the Nation and the world today than the prospect of unlimited nuclear proliferation. The continuing arms race already presents a grim and foreboding picture. and as the nuclear club expands the balance of terror becomes ever more precarious. President Kennedy. in his March 21. 1963. press conference. said: Personally I am haunted by the feeling that by 1970. unless we are successful. there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of 4. and by 1975. 15 or 20. With all the history of war. and the human races history has been a good deal more war than peace. with nuclear weapons distributed all through the world. and available. and the strong reluctance of any people to accept defeat. I see the possibility in the 1970s of the President of the United States having to face a world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these weapons. I regard that as the greatest possible danger and hazard. The road to an effective treaty banning nuclear testing and to a meaningful program of arms control and reduction is without question difficult. We are confronted with opponents who are all too often intransigent. But I believe that we must persevere in our efforts to secure such a treaty. As a distinguished group of American scientists reported in an open letter appearing in this mornings Washington Post: Careful studies by the formost experts in the United States and by the Presidents advisers on national security. including those in the Defense Department. have furnished the conclusion that the risk of continuing the arms race without a test ban treaty is considerably more than the risk that such a treaty might be violated by secret testing. Mr. Speaker. I believe that this very thoughtful letter and the excellent article by Mr. Max Freedman. which appeared recently in the Washington Post. deserve our attention. and I commend them to our colleagues for their consideration.

They total $5.153.000 in accelerated public works funds and will provide an estimated 7.569 manmonths or 630 manyears of onsite employment. If Congress approves President Kennedys request for a supplemental appropriation of $500 million. it may be anticipated that additional projects will be approved for Philadelphia. The funds approved for Philadelphia include a direct Federal project now in progress at Independence National Park. a new maternity building for the Albert Einstein Medical Center. a project under the Public Health Service oft partment of Health. Education. and Welfare. a number of projects under the Community Facilities Administration of the Housing and Home Finance Agency such as the Center Building for the Trade and Convention Center. a project involving the Fox Chase Pumping Station and the Torresdale Pumping Station. stream drainage at the North Philadelphia Airport. an intercepting sewer at Byberry Creek. and other projects which benefit other sections of Philadelphia. The Accelerated Public Works Act of 1962Public Law 87658authorized $900 million for construction of needed community facilities such as hospitals. streets. water and sewage systems. public buildings. and so forth. Prior to adjournment last October. $400 million was appropriated under the act to begin work on these projects and to provide jobs in A2192 areas of substantial unemployment. including Philadelphia.

I asked him how unemployment was figured. He said. \"I take a sampling of 35.000 families out of 180 million. On the basis of the replies we receive. the figure goes up or down.\" We know that the figure includes housewives who have never had a job. It includes boys who have dropped out of high school with no ambition or desire to work at anything. It includes those who have preferred to get exactly the job they want. So I say that the situation is entirely different. In addition. we have learned through bitter experience that pump priming does not lift a nation out of a depression.",

In the 1930s. when the Civilian Conservation Corps was created. our country was in a rather deseparate financial situation. At the time the bill was passed I believe unemployment was in the neighborhood of 17 or 19 million. Today unemployment is running at an unsatisfactory figure. but it is not running at that rate. The Civilian Conservation Corps program plus the other measures that were tried in the 1930s did not pull this country out of a depression. So I agree with the Senator from Virginia. who as a Representative at that time voted for the measure. and I agree with the attitude of the senior Senator from Virginia . If he were present. I know he would state that we have learned our lesson. I am not impressed by a vote of 389 to 7. Such a vote does not necessar\ufffdily mean that the bill was a good one.

In the Civilian Conservation Corps program the average was about 5.000 West Virginia boys a month. With regard to the figures for teenage unemployment. today it Is not the figure mentioned. but it is approximately 15.6 percent unemployed for teenage youth. Now. in reply to the Senator from Arizona . the programs of this administration have been of great value to the State of West Virginia. It was not expected that this or any administration would remake the State in 2 years. However. several new industrial plants have been established with the assistance of the Area Redevelopment Administration. More than 90 projects had been approved as of March 1 of this year under the accelerated public works program. including libraries. water facilities. sewage treatment plants. recreation facilities. and hospitals. And there are many others pending. These and other programs have contributed significantly to the economic development and higher employment of our work force in West Virginia. When we speak of the figures related to unemployment. I return to the statement that there is another America which calls for a program of the type proposed. It is not a leafraking program. The investment would not only pay 100 cents on the invested dollar. but would also return a dividend to the peopIe of America. and especially to the youth who would participate directly.",

I must remind the Senator from West Virginia that the problem is caused by virtue of the fact that the young people have not been taught skills. The statements I have read during the course of my remarks attest to the fact that unemployment exists today because the unskilled labor field Is being covered more and more by automation. What we should be doing for these young boys. in my estimation. Is training them in some skill. My remarks are directed toward title I. To some extent title II does get at this problem. I think I made my position adequately clear during the course of the discussions in the committee. I think we are very deficient in this country with respect to training boys and girls who have no intention of going beyond high school. We give them a good education in high school. and then they quit school or drop out and want to go to work. There are no longer a sufficient number of unskilled jobs available for them to fill. I previously mentioned the fact that in 1 day in Washington. D.C.. both the morning and the evening newspapers listed 1.500 and 1.100 jobs. respectively. waiting for people to fill. but those were skilled jobs. The want ad sections of the big metropolitan dailies list hundreds of Jobs going begging. because we have not taught the young people how to use their handshow to run a lathe. how to do welding. how to operate a drillpress. or how to work in a factory.

I called the attention of the Senate to the highly irresponsible attack on the Catholic press of this country. which had been made by the president of the American Medical Association. Dr. Edward R. Annis. The doctors wild charges were provoked by the widespread support in Catholic newspapers. of the Presidents health insurance proposal for the elderly. The doctor dragged out a very shopworn bugaboo. accusing the diocesan newspapers of being \"firmly fixed in their socialist philosophies.\" The \"socialist philosophies\" were. according to Dr. Annis. the result of the misguiding influence of Msgr. George G. Higgins. director of the social action department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference. Monsignor Higgins. in turn. was. of course. under the \"diabolical\" influence of the AFLCIO. All of this is tiresome arrant nonsense. Monsignor Higgins is a distinguished churchman who personifies and practices the finest ideals of the church. The support of \"medicare\" by the Catholic press and Monsignor Higgins is consistent with traditional Catholic social thought. A column written by Monsignor Higgins. which has just been distributed to some 25 Catholic newspapers. states that Dr. Annis \"has accused an important segment of the Catholic press of ignorance and distortion in its handling of the continuing controversy over medicare.\" Monsignor Higgins. however. in a reasoned presentation. supports \"medicare\" as a legitimate approach to a major social problem. wholly in keeping with Catholic teachings. Monsignor Higgins says thatCatholic social teaching does not say that the social security approach to medical care Is the only approach or necessarily the best approach under all circumstances. It does say. however. that the social security approach to this and related problems is legitimate from the point of view of sound social ethics and may be the best approach under a given set of circumstances. I suggest. Mr. President. that thoughtful statements such as these do not make Monsignor Higgins a \"political quack or charlatan\"-terms used by Dr. Annis to characterize supporters of the \"medicare\" proposal.

They are equally important. and they are intimately interrelated. It is disquieting. therefore. to hear reports that there is no great steam behind the measure just approved by the House Labor Committee to create a fivemember Equal Employment Opportunities Board empowered to eliminate racially discriminatory practices in hiring and firing among all business enterprises affecting interstate commerce. This is a thoroughly practicable proposal. And it is indispensable to the attainment of real racial equality. Fair employment practices commissions of various sorts are working successfully in a number of States. A national FEPC operated with great effectivenessand with very little friction--during the war. It is just as possible and just as reasonable to forbid racial discrimination in job opportunities as to forbid it in businesses offering services to the general public. Enforcement must. of course. be preceded and accompanied by tactful and skilled efforts in persuasion. But it also must be backed by the ultimate sanction of legal compulsion.

For example. an article in the July 15 Wall Street Journal describes a new study by Michael E. Levy of the National Industrial Conference Board that casts considerable doubt on the effectiveness of deficit spending as a stimulus to growth. Mr. Levy draws several interesting conclusions from his study. After analyzing the budgets of United States and European countries on a national income basis. Mr. Levy concludes that there is no systematic connection between budget deficits and growth. As a matter of fact. he shows that several of the countries with the most rapid economic growth also have had sizeable surpluses. In addition. Mr. Levy feels that the administrations analysis of the unemployment problem is inadequate. In his view the essential shortage may be in the skills needed for employment in todays technologically advanced economy. Mr. Speaker. I wholeheartedly agree with this conclusion. We are not going to solve the unemployment problem until we train our unskilled workers to fill the more demanding positions that are being created by the introduction of more advanced and complex machinery. NDIX July 24 Because of the important contribution which this study makes to the Nations continuing economic debate. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Wall Street Journal be included in the RECORD as follows: [From the Wall Street Journal. July 15. 1963]",

I extend my congratulations to Douglas. James. and Arthur. In the years to come. the ability of America to increase the wellbeing of its citizens while maintaining its place of world leadership will depend upon the advances of science and technology. To encourage gifted students of science and mathematics through programs such as the one sponsored by General Electric is to insure our country of the scientific leaders which will be needed.

An organization incorporated in 1910. chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1916. with the President of the United States as honorary president. and dedicated to the development of good citizenship among the rising generation. is an organization which we as a nation proudly salute. The young people of our great country are today. as in the past. faced with the task of preparing themselves to meet an uncertain future. one which holds many grave responsibilities and duties. both private and public. many opportunities. rights and privileges. both those granted by law and those gained through individual initiative. Perhaps never before in the history of our democratic process have the meeting of these responsibilities. and the utilization and exercise of these opportunities and rights been so necessary to the perpetuation of the doctrines and beliefs upon which this country is founded. The Boy Scouts of America is an organization in the finest American tradition. It teaches the Values of both responsibility and opportunity. The principles underlying the Boy Scouts activities and practices are \"framied to develop character. intelligence. skill. handicraft. physical. mental and moral health. selfcare and reliance. and the practice of service for others. The efficient individual becomes an asset to his community and in turn to his Nation. The thousands of men and women who have contributed countless hours to perpetuate the teachings of the movement deserve our respect and gratitude. for without their tireless efforts. the high ideals and purposes set down in the charter would not be fully met. The feeling of belonging to a group is a basic need in every young boy. and the competition. group activity. firm and able leadership offered to a Scout do much to meet this need. It is therefore not surprising that where the scouting movement is strong and vigorous. the amount of juvenile delinquency is proportionately less. The Explorer Scout has a code by which he tries to live. It is a code from which every American might profit: I believe that Americas strength lies in her trust in God and in the courage and strength of her people.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. so often. in the constantly increasing whirl of public activity and government involvement. we overlook the important role being played by countless voluntary private efforts to help those less fortunate. here and abroad. One such effort has taken place in Sussex County. N.J.. within the confines of my district. Two young missionaries. Joe and Jeri Blakeslee. son and daughterinlaw of Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Blakeslee. of Halsey. N.J.. have been serving unselfishly in the Amazon jungle reaches of Ecuador. A mission school has been established among the Indians. but a need was recognized also in relation to the task of making a living from the soil. For this reason. friends and neighbors of the Blakeslees in Sussex County organized a Mission to Ecuador Tractor Fund Committee. to buy a tractor and equipment for use in the jungle environs. The contributions and efforts have been rewarded with the shipment and arrival of the tractor in Ecuador. at the seaport of Guayaquil. Joe Blakeslee and two other drivers took the tractor on a truck over the Andes Mountains. From there. the Ecuadorian air force. free of charge. made three trips with the dismantled tractor to the mission area. . We can only speculate on the good will. as well as the good works. springing up from this voluntary effort by private American citizens. but there can be no doubt as to its existence. The following article from the November 25. 1962. edition of the New Jersey Sunday Herald gives further details on this inspiring activity: The young missionaries have been in Ecuador for just about a year now. and are slowly making progress in their endeavors to bring a better way of life to the Aucas. the seminomadic Indians there. With the Blakeslees is their young daughter. Jill. who is 16 months old. In his letters home. Joe refers with deep feeling to the people back home who made the gift of the tractor possible. With it. the backbreaking work of carving farmland out of the jungle is eased for the missionaries and the Indians. The mission project is based on the belief that. with civilization encroaching on the Amazon Jungle. these people will be pushed to the bottom of the social and economic ladder unless they can wrest a living from",

Frost was close to nature. and wrote of it as perhaps no other American poet ever has. His poetry was quiet and deep and brought the spirit of nature close. All Americans are familiar with the fields and woods of New England as Frost described them. We all know of his immortal. \"Road Not Taken.\" in which the poet faced two imaginary roads. He took \"the one less traveled.\" Few men indeed travel the road of art. and fewer still travel it with such success as Frost did. His poetry came to be read and loved more than that of any living poet in our country. In an age of cynicism and helterskelter. he provided a breath of freshness and rest. He has now passed.

February 13 marks the 20th anniversary of an important part of this organization. the Marine Corps Womens Reserve. now known simply as the Women Marines. The history of women serving in the Marine Crops. however. goes back much more than 20 years. During World War I. the Marine Corps was authorized to enlist and train women reservists in order to free men from clerical duties for combat in France. Over three hundred women thus served their country in this capacity from 191819. In February 1943 the call went out once again for women to serve in the Marine Corps. This time. under the great demands of World War II. women were needed by the thousands to free combatcapable Leathernecks from scores of duties which tied them down behind the front. Thus. under provisions of the. Naval Reserve Act of 1938. the Marine Corps Womens Reserve was formed on February 13. 1943. By June 1944 the authorized quota of 18.000 enlisted women and 821 officers had been met. and these women were serving in their assigned duties. Over two hundred skilled categories were filled by these women. supporting Marine Corps capabilities on the ground and in the air. They served at every major Marine Corps post and station in the continental United States. and by 1945. were serving in Hdwaii as well. Following the war. the need was seen to maintain a nucleus of trained Women Marines as a mobilization base. At the same time difficulties were seen in maintaining this nucleus as nothing more than a volunteer reserve organization. These difficulties were resolved with the passage in 1948 of the Womens Armed Services Integration Act. Today. the women marines. under its Commandant. Col. Margaret M. Henderson. numbers about 150 officers and 1.600 enlisted women on active duty with the corps. throughout the United States. England. France. and Italy. These women perform important duties in aviation. personnel. administration. management. intelligence. dommunications. supply. transportation. disbursing. and many other fields which support the activities of the combat arm of the U.S. Marines.

Last July. for example. some of the most famous zoologists. biologists. and ornithologists of the world appealed to Northwestern University in an open statement asking its trustees to abandon the path of expediency and reconsider their participation in the destruction of a key section of unit 2 of the dunes. I put in the CONCRESSIONAL RECORD of- July 27. 1962. a full account of this appeal by distinguished scientists in Europe and the United States. . A new appeal has recently- been made by 166 scientists and educators. working within the State of Indiana itself. These distinguished authorities. mainly biologists. zoologists. botanists. ecologists. geologists. geographers. engineers. physicists. and soil scientists teaching or researching at Indianas many fine universities. signed letters to President Kennedy which stated in part: If a port is needed. it should be located wisely in the light of all legitimate public needs. Because a Burns Ditch port would involve losing that portion of the dunelands having. the greatest recreational. scientific. educational and aesthetic values. we place the burden of proof on those insisting on this site. The evidence put forward for a Burns Ditch Harbor has failed to withstand critical examination. A port there would chiefly benefit automated steel mills and cost American taxpayers far more than the return in public benefits for a 50year period. The loss of the natural duneland around Burns Ditch would be a tragedy even if it were necessary. It has not been shown to be necessary. In our opinion. the best interest of Indiana as well as the Nations would be served by establishment of the proposed Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands also has on file impressive statements by numerous scientific authorities who have called for preservation of the dunes. Mr. President. on last Thursday. I had printed in the RECORD at page 1480 the new article by William Peeples on \"The Dunes and Pressure Politics\" which appears in the Atlantic Monthly issue for this month.

It should serve to remind us of the obligations we have to them and to enslaved peoples everywhere to aid in all practicable ways in their quest for freedom. The Congress has a special responsibility to provide leadership in this vital freedom movement. And it must be more than mere lipservice in the form of resolutions and declarations and observances. It must take the form of action. The Purpose of a Committee on the Captive Nations would be to conduct A69 inquiry into and to study satellite countries and captive nonRussian nations to help them to regain their national and individual freedoms. .In faith the people of the captive nations of the world are looking to the United States for guidance.

I have studied carefully all of the Farm Bureau resolutions adopted at that meeting. but due to many disturbing developments which have been brought out in the hearings before the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee on which I serve.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Webster says a pendulum is a device used to regulate the machinery of clockwork and other machinery. There are times when adjustments become necessary. For many years the labormanagement pendulum was swinging too far in one direction. Adjustments were made and the machinery appeared to be operating reasonably well. Gradually and imperceptably. foreign matter accumulated. causing that same machinery to malfunction to a greater degree than it had previously. The newspaper and longshoremen strikes furnish ample evidence to support that statement. The President of the United States has been defied. Irresponsible action is threatening our entire economy. including our national defense. The machinery of collective bargaining is threatened. The public welfare is completely ignored by certain leaders. The patience of the public is wearing extremely thin. Repercussions of the strikes are being felt in the 19th District of Pennsylvania. This has been attested to by communications from district residents. in the past few days. Some means must be found to again regulate that pendulum so that it may again swing in the interest of the masses rather than for a few irrespon-\" sible leaders.

I would like to call to the attention of this august body a feat of daring. bravery. and courage performed by a group of my constituents: the volunteer firemen from the villages of Franklin Square. West Hempstead. South Hempstead. Uniondale. Roosevelt. Elmont. Lakeview. Garden City. and Hempstead. On the morning of December 31. 1962.. a blaze broke out in a warehouse in the village of Hempstead which eventually destroyed Long Island Railroad station there and caused over $1 million worth of damages. During its course. several homes were threatened. The temperature was at near zero throughout many hours these brave men spent fighting the blaze. In a short time after they arrived at the scene. each man resembled a ghostly apparition. each was covered with a cake of ice. The cold was bitter. the fire raged. Despite these obstacles. these wonderful men fought on. eventually bringing the fire under controla fire that had all the earmarks of being the most devastating Long Island had ever experienced. Mr. Speaker. I call the attention of the House of Representatives to these men because they are volunteer firementhey receive no pay for their laborsthey are dedicated to the preservation of life and property in the community. Through the years they have performed their duties with courtesy. kindness. and efficiency. They are on call 24 hours a day. And when the siren sounds. they are on the go immediately without regard for personal comfort or safety. These men deserve the undying admiration of the people of their communities. The same admiration is due their wives and families who keep the fearful vigil. many of whom have formed auxiliary units which. like the male groups. travel to the scene of the fire and provide these hardworking men with coffee and doughnuts and aid during the critical firefighting time. I commend to your consideration all volunteer firefighting units. but especially. at this time. the brave men of the villages I have cited who performed so well in the recent. critical Hempstead blaze. These are men I suggest. who do not ask what their country can do for them. but in the tradition of the minutemen of Concord and Lexington. are actually doing right now.

We are under the assumption that we are going to be expanding juvenile delinquency study by $6.700.000. but instead we find that between $8 and $9 million more is appropriated in this bill for this purpose. When the authorization bill was before this Congress in 1961. we were led to understand that this would be a demonstration action project program limited to five to seven areas where the people all over the country could see what was happening. Some of us tried to have an amendment adopted providing that this would be done in the District of Columbia. that the District of Columbia would be the demonstration project because it is the Capital of the United States and the problem here is as great. if not greater. than any other place in the United States. This is essentially a Federal responsibility. a Federal role here in the District of Columbia because it is the responsibility of all 50 States. and yet to date nothing has been done other than some preplanning work. We are long on planning and short on action. The people in the District are thinking of some action programs this coming year. but when you take a look at activities after 2 years here in the District of Columbia you find nothing has been done. It shows again how slowly the Federal Government acts. how slowly the Government moves. Our Government people spend all their time planning. planning. and planning. and then make reports. There have been studies in many States. They have set up commissions and have been studying the problem continually of juvenile delinquency. There are volumes and volumes and volumes of studies. and now this money that we have appropriated in the past to the program has just added more studies to fill up the library shelves with additional volumes. I say it is time we had some action programs so we can see what happens when progress is made. rather than to make more studies.",

Born in Slovakia. then as now under foreign domination. he grew up in a scholarly atmosphere and left his native country town to take a doctor of philosophy degree at Charles University in Prague. Lack of freedom drove Stefanik to France in 1902 where. after years of struggle. he attained great distinction as an astronomer. doing valuable research in Europe. Africa. the Americas. and in the South Seas. In 1914. when Stefanik was 34 and a naturalized citizen of France. war came to Europe. He immediately joined the French Air Force. where his distinguished service brought him new honors and the rank of major general. Combining political foresight with his heroic military contribution. he joined Thomas G. Masaryk and Edouard Benes in the Czechoslovakia National Council. from which at wars end the independent State of Czechoslovakia was to grow. As Minister of War in the new state he dedicated himself to the preservation of its independence. While flying back from a conference in Italy. his plane crashed on landing at Bratislava. on the 4th of May 1919. All aboard were killed. This tragic loss to the world of science and to his newly founded nation was deeply felt by all. The sense of tragedy to his country was expressed in the funeral oration: By his death the Czechoslovak cause sustains an irreparable loss.

Now that the State of New Hampshire has recognized that the urge to gamble is a part of human nature and that this universal human trait should be regulated and controlled. I hope that the Members of this House will show equal wisdom and courage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was extremely saddened at the news of the passing of our good friend. \"TAD\" WALTER. During my first year in the Congress I had some difficult problems with immigration matters. Congressman WALTER not only assisted me in obtaining passage of a bill to solve them. but he did so in such a cheerful and willing manner that he made me well aware of the fact that he enjoyed giving new Congressmen a helping hand. He was always easy to approach. Every new Member soon found that there were a number of the older Members who were not only willing to aid them but wanted to go out of their way to help a new Member learn the ropes and become more useful to his constituents and the country as a whole. This was the kind of a man that \"TAD\" WALTER was. He loved his fellow man and he was willing to work long hours. go great distances. and devote himself wholeheartedly to a life of service to others. Congressman WALTER will be sadly missed. He has rendered a great service to the country as a legislator. The statutes. the committee hearings. and the committee reports on which he worked will long make him remembered as a Congressman who got things done. He nobly and ably served not only the people of his district in Pennsylvania but the people of all of these great United States. Our loss in the Congress is a great one. However. I feel that all who knew and worked with this great man had their lives enriched by this association. I offer my sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and loved ones. They can take great pride in the life and work of this great American.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. again the flag of our country flies at half mast over the Capitol. Again we gather within this historic Chamber to voice. as best we may within our frail human limitations. and all too inadequately. what is deep within our saddened hearts. For 30 years the Honorable FRANCIS E. WALTER was a Member of the House. He was seventh in seniority on the Democratic side. He was chairman of the Democratic caucus. He was chairman of the Democratic patronage committee. Ability of the highest quality and industry that knew no rest had brought to him a recognition by. his colleagues seldom equaled in unanimity and in measure. He was on many occasions Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and. no matter how bitterly controversial the issue. always when the Committee rose he had been thunderously applauded because of the fairness of his rulings and his matchless efficiency as a presiding officer. But it is not the power and prestige and acclaim that were his that is in our minds and hearts today. We are crushed in grief by the passing of a beloved colleague and friend. I shall miss \"TAD\" WALTER very. very much. I shall miss the warmth of his smile. the warmth of his human understanding. I am thinking now of that day and night in Chicago when he stood many hours. shaking hands and participating in all the activities. on the occasion of the opening of a new community house for the ChineseAmericans. He even then was not in good health The occasion held no political or personal advantage for him. But his presence there did mean a great deal to these good Americans of Chinese birth or descent who were joined with other Americans in the common cause of advancing the interest and the welfare of our own United States. So \"TAD\" WALTER came. at great personal inconvenience. and remained hour after hour until he must have been physically exhausted. His interest in the refugees. his drive to find homes in new lands for the homeless people of the world. was but one of the indexes to the humanitarian character of the \"TAD\" WALTER we knew through close association as colleagues here in the House. I have been enriched by my personal friendship with \"TAD\" WALTER during many years. To the members of his family I extend my deepest sympathy.",

The fact that all resources are interdependent is becoming better recognized.

This multipleuse concept of land and water resources was effectively outlined by Donald A. Williams. Administrator of the Soil Conservation Service. at the sixth annual meeting of the Wabash Valley Association. Administrator Williams set forth a whole packet of tools which are now available to help develop the natural resources of the Wabash River Valley. Some of these tools are new as a result of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962.

Although they. and sometimes we. do not realize it. all dictators operate at a serious disadvantage. They stifle dissent and rely on the ignorance of the people. As history has repeatedly demonstrated. this is an unsure foundation for stable government. Conversely. our democracy rests upon an informed citizenry. and no right is more fundamental to our way of life than the right to speak or write freely in accordance with ones own beliefs. Recently an important book was published chronicling the history and importance of this basic freedom. Entitled \"Freedom of Speech and Press in America.\" this book was written by Dr. Edward G. Hudon. assistant librarian at the U.S. Supreme Court. This book presents a scholarly and objective analysis of one of our most treasured rights. Some may disagree with Dr. Hudons views. none will fail to be stimulated by his thoughtprovoking comments. He reminds us once again that this right. and freedom in general. \"cannot be taken for granted. but must ever be a matter of vigilant concern.\" This book deserves the attention of allAmericans. Dr. Hudon. is. I am proud to say. a native of Brunswick. Maine. He attended public schools in Brunswick and graduated from Bowdoin College. He then embarked upon a distinguished academic and legal career and has since received four graduate degreesbachelor of laws and master of laws from Georgetown University. bachelor of science in library science from the Catholic University of America. and doctor of juridical science from the George Washington University. He has held his present position at the Supreme Court since 1947 and has been a frequent contributor to legal periodicals. The foreword to Dr. Hudons book was written by Mr. Justice William 0. Douglas. and I ask unanimous consent to have that foreword printed in the RECORD.",

In our society. it is the basic right of a man to own property and to say how this property is to be managed. A customer has the right to choose the place of business where he will buy and trade. It seems to me to be basic also that a man who owns that business has the right to say what persons he will serve. Is this not basic to free enterprise? As Evangelist Billy Graham said only this morning at the Presidential prayer breakfast. this problem will not be settled in the streets nor in the Halls of Congress. I believe him to be correct. Under the title of civil rights. we have a great emotional turmoil tearing at the heart of this Nation. I believe this bill will create far more evils for our society than it would purport to heal. It gives drastic powers to certain officials over the lives of the people of these United States. It violates our basic concept of a mans right to own and operate private property. This problem did not originate yesterday. it will not disappear tomorrow. In this great land of ours we have made magnificent strides. Even the most menial and poorest of the classes in these United States have a higher standard of living than the people of many nations. The answer to our problem lies in education and a vibrant economy that can provide good jobs for all men willing to work. and who are willing to make the necessary sacrifices to obtain the necessary education to fill those jobs. This is the challenge which faces us and if we can meet this challenge. then these problems which have been debated here can and will be solved. I contend that what is proposed here is not right. It violates basic freedoms of this Nation. It destroys certain basic and fundamental concepts of the free enterprise system. and this. my colleagues. is a more serious threat and problem than any that it is contended would be solved.",

Moreover. virtually no one wh is a transient could be expected to go to the expense of a suit directed against CX125 an establishment at which he may never need service again. and the requirement of a finding of inability to sue would be out of context. The requirements determined by the Attorney General which are appropriate in relation to suits for discrimination in public facilities certainly as to persons notresiding in the community in many instances would be unreasonable and inappropriate in suits with relation to public accommodations. Therefore. the gentlemans amendment is needless and unreasonable. It would hamper all efforts on the part of the Attorney General to redress a wrong. For that reason the amendment should be defeated.",

Sr.. has long carried the sobriquet of Mr. Orange County. He served on the board of supervisors for over 25 years and was chairman of that body longer than any other man. Willis was steeped in the history and early development of the county. leaving a hardware business in Huntington Beach to dedicate himself to a life of public service. During the difficult years of transition spanning the 1950s Willis Warner more than any one man was a stabilizing. constructive influence in extending the vital services needed to bridge the gap between a rural agricultural community. of some 200.000plus population. and the vigorous and varied complex of industry. commerce. agriculture in a mixed population of over 1 million which now exists. There are those who felt at times that Supervisor Warner relied more heavily on anchor than he did on sail when the winds of change blew most strongly. The strong and stable growth. the balance of the economy and the continuing bright prospects for the future should sufficiently confound his detractors. A6770 I feel a sense of deep personal loss with the passing of Willis Warner. From the time I first served as president of the chamber of commerce for Westminster. Calif.. I have had the wisdom of his counsel. As a practicing lawyer Involved in matters of dispute brought before the board of supervisors. I have had his sympathetic and judicial consideration. As a State representative. I enjoyed his ready cooperation and a share of the wealth of knowledge on county affairs which was so uniquely his. Mr. Speaker. I extend to his family. and the legion of those within Orange County that call him friend. my sincere expression of sympathy and regret. Rightwing Reactionaries Busy in Local Election Campaigns",

Every Member knows that any strong political trend that becomes evident will have an impact on legislation before the Congress. as well as on the important elections in 1964. What will be most interesting to watch will be the activities of rightwing extremists who are increasing their influence and power in the Republican Party throughout the Nation. On a national level the extremists seek to create confusion. suspicion and distrust of representative government. They seek to picture our high courts. the Congress and the President as enemies of the people. On a local level where these extremists have infiltrated civic organizations. luncheon clubs. schools and churches. they seek to brand Democrats as immoral. dishonest. corrupt. and disloyal. It is not difficult to see the connection between these local contests and the controversial legislation now before the Congress. Republican leaders tell the people that national issues are not involved in local campaigns but among themselves they talk differently.

Gansbrugh. vice president and chief economist of the National Industrial Conference Board on the subject of \"Job Vacancies and Labor Demand.\" In commenting upon the recommendations of the Presidents Committee To Appraise Employment and Unemployment Statistics. Mr. Gainsbrugh emphasized that todays measures of employment and unemployment are increasingly inadequate in the context of rapid technological change. He pointed out: We lack a feedback mechanism whereby the requirements of the new technology are reflected in organized knowledge about the demand for specific types of labor in the Industries and geographic areas where technological advance is particularly pronounced. Mr. Gainsbrugh stressed the point that existing data already show that severe shortages of certain skills occur even in areas where chronic unemployment is the norm. As he states: This. further underscores the need for vacancy data on what kinds of jobs are available. as well as where they are. As a possible solution to this shortage of statistics. he suggests a nongovernmental research organization should measure the volume and character of unfilled jobs in a particular area and relate it to an index of helpwanted advertisements and job vacancies registered with the State employment services. When a process such as this is perfected. it could be turned over to the Government for official use on a national scale. Mr. Speaker. the testimony of Mr. Gainsbrugh represents a valuable contribution to the improvement of our employment and unemployment statistics. As the nature and requirements of our labor force change to meet the demands of a technological society. the meins of measuring labor supply and demand must also change.

Mr. Higginson has not only had a distinguished career on the Capitol Police Force but also as a member of the Fall River. Mass.. police force which he served with for 29 years. Following his retirement from the Fall River Police Department in 1951. he came to Washington to be near his two children and his grandchildren and to go to work on the Capitol Police Force. Throughout his life. John has been interested in the youth of America. In his native town of Fall River he has served as president of the Council of the Boy Scouts of America and has been a director of that organization for 15 years. As a member of the Scottish Rite Masonic Order. he also served as adviser to the Order of Demolay. When World War I broke out. John enlisted in the Navy and served as a chief shipfitter until the end of the war.

And he left his imprint upon the history of the world. It was my privilege to serve as his parliamentarian during his pinchhitting respite for the temporary chairman of the National Democratic convention. On that occasion. in a very practical and direct way. he avoided an incident which might under other circumstances have proved embarrassing both to the convention and the party. He was not only able. competent. and resourceful but he was also a man of integrity and courage. He did not hesitate to take a position which at the time might have given pause to a less determined partisan in opposition to a formidable administrative campaign to pack the U.S. Supreme Court. When the United Nations treaty was before the Senate. disregarding protests of those in charge of the negotiations he proposed and secured a vital limitation since known as the Connally amendment. for which every American has been grateful in every world crisis since it became effective. He was a world figure. but he never lost his love or retracted his allegiance to the Lone Star State. It was his statementoften quoted under other circumstances since that timethat he was 21 years old before he knew that \"damn Yankee\" was two words.

His career highlights include: Pioneering efforts in many aspects of civilian uses of atomic energy. membership on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. Assistant Secretary of the Air Force under the first Air Force Secretary. now Senator STUART SYMINGTON of Missouri. membership on the Atomic Energy Commission. and many important advisory posts in the defense field. A native of New York City. he received his law degree from Yale University. As an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. from 1947 to 1952 Mr. Zuckert was one of the principal architects of the organization and the control systems of the Air Force when it became a separate service. During this period of time. under the civilian leadership of Mr. Zuckert and the military leadership of General LeMay. the Air Force has developed the missile program into a fully operational capability. It has built up its tactical air strength. its counterinsurgency forces. and has more than doubled its airlift capabilities. A forceful and dynamic personality.

Landgrant colleges form the heart of the Nations amazing system of farm research and extension education which put the results of experiments to use. The results of this research has been most impressive when we realize that 1 American farmworker produces enough food for himself and 29 other persons. In view of this splendid record of achievement through the landgrant colleges. the question is often asked: Why should not the countrys landgrant colleges enlarge upon their horizons to include rural development elsewhere In a hungry world? The record shows that these landgrant colleges are already carrying on extensive programs for the improvement of land use and the Increase of food production in many of the underdeveloped countries in the world. Kansas State University at Manhattan. Kans.. was the first landgrant college in the Nation to be created by legislative act. This institution has for many years carried on extensive programs In India and other areas of the world through the AID program for the improvement and expansion of agriculture. It is a record of which we are all proud. I can think of no field in the foreign aid program which has more possibilities than the continued expansion of this type of work. This week. representatives of landgrant colleges gathered in Washington to discuss ways of teaching agricultural knowhow in other countries of the world. All of these 119 schools are conducting research and training foreign aid specialists for the Agency of International Development. The program is geared to advise farmers and to help solve farm problems on a countrywide scale. AID has nearly 252 contracts with landgrant colleges to train personnel to solve problems in rural development.

United States Code Annotated. section 2253(b). provides retired pay only in the event of serviceconnected disability which was incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States or was caused by an instrumentality of war in line of duty during a period of war. or in the case of one who is eligible for military retirement benefits upon the completion of 20 or more years of nonRegular service at the age of 60. I emphasize that this is a provision of the existing law. and that H.R. 7381 would not in any way change the retirement provision of existing law. We are dealing solely with employment and compensation under dual compensation. In our discussion of July 10. the Senator from Montana summarized his reasons for opposing certain provisions of this bill. He propounded 11 interrogatories which are printed on pages 16189 and 16190 of the Mr. President. I hold in my hand the answers to those 11 interrogatories. and since the distinguished Senator from Montana who propounded them is not present in the Chamber at this time. I ask unanimous consent to have these answers printed in the RECORD.",

I should like to raise this question because I believe it is one which should be given consideration either on this bill or in connection with the next retirement bill. I am referring particularly to the Ruddock letter as it outlined a situation in paragraph 1 (b). which reads as follows: Under chapter 67 of title 10. United States Code (providing retired pay at age 60 after 20 or more years nonregular service by members of Reserve components of the Armed Forces). In this situation does this individual get credit for the same 20 years military service in computing both his military retirement and his civil service retirement assuming he works 5 years minimum under civil service? Am I correct that in retiring he can pick up. No. 1. his military retirement benefits for his 20 years or more in military service? That would be No. 1 retirement. Second. as a result of his 5 years of civilian service under the civil service could he retire and draw compensation for this 5 years civilian service plus the 20 years of military service? In other words. would he get credit for 25 years under civil service retirement even though he had only worked 5 years? This is what I had in mind when I referred to this as giving a man double credit for his military service.",

The records of the Treasury Department show that for the years 1958. 1959. and 1960 his total tax delinquency amounts to $464.234.03.

On January 30. 1964. the Maritime Commission sent Mr. Aadal a copy of the form of application to be filed for such operating differential subsidies together .with a request for more specific and detailed information. His attorney replied and indicated that since his client would not be eligible for U.S. citizenship until October 1964 the application would not be submitted until after his citizenship was granted.

It is my feeling that the people of the United States. in very considerable degree. are displeased with the failure of the Senate to come to grips by voting on amendments and then on final passage of the bill. It is trite to say. but it is true. that the Senate will either approve the proposed legislation or disapprove it. I believe the country wants us to do one or the other. The citizens of the Republic have a right to demand a determination of the question. For that reason. on the 55th day of Senate consideration. I rise to sayand I measure my wordsthat the senior Senator from West Virginia is ready now. not later. to vote for cloture. I CX--686 feel that. in the public interest and for the national good. we shall serve the high purpose not only through legislative consideration. but. also. after legislative consideration. by acting forthrightly as men and women of good will. Mr. President. I advocate most vigorously prompt action on the amendments and a vote on final passage. I hopefully express the belief that we are approaching the time when there will be a sufficient number of Senators who will vote to invoke cloture. if necessary. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the RECORD a statement released from my office on April 30.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in 1958. when I was a candidate for Senator in Ohio. I made two promises to the citizens of my State if they would elect me. One was that I would withdraw altogether from the practice of the law. I kept that promise. On December 15. 1958. my name was removed from my office door. and other than receiving. during 1959 and 1960. a small percentage of some thousands of dollars in attorneys fees owed to me before that date. I have not received any fees whatever from legal work. I have not directly or indirectly. engaged in the practice of law at any time since then. The other promise I made to the citizens of Ohio was that if elected to the Senate. I would fully disclose my financial holdings. so that citizens of my State would know whether any of my votes or activities as a U.S. Senator were at any time actuated by motives of personal financial aggrandizement. or were definitely and distinctly for the welfare of the people of my State. as I saw that welfare. and that I would always vote in accordance with my conscience and judgment following devotion of my full time and study to the issues before the Senate. I have kept that promise. Early in 1959. to the embarrassment of members of my family. I fully disclosed my assets. At that time I was a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. and at that time. as I am now. I was a member of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Science. I sold at a loss the stock that I owned in Pan American World Airways and in certain sugar corporations. as I believed that the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry dealt with that subject.",

In each election year we have given a pay increase to the civilian employees. In 1958. an election year. the pay increase was 10.1 percent. In 1960. another election year. it was 7.7 percent by way of an increase. In 1962. an election year. the increase was 5.5 percent. with an automatic pay increase included in the 1962 measure. to take effect on January 1. 1964. Again. in 1964. an election year. an increase of 4.2 percent was given. It may be that such increases are made by accident in an election year. There are some who will argue that that was by chance. not by deliberation. To accept that argument would require an absolute dismissal of reasoning on my part. It could not have happened that five pay increases were granted in election years without being the product of design and. in my judgment. of abject weakness. Why in election years do we give pay increases to 2.700.000 employees? Is it because it brings votes? Or is it because in election years the demonstration has been made that the increases are justified? Finally. if the civilian employees are entitled to pay increases. no one can argue to me that the military personnel are not. Although I voted against the civilian pay raise bill.

Jefferson. and Lincoln embody the highest principles of America. Shevchenko expressed the close tie between Ukraine and America over 100 years ago not only by calling for national independence but also for the coming to Ukraine of a Washington with \"his new and righteous law.\" Over 30.000 Americans of Ukrainian ancestry and their friends and over 10.000 schoolchildren have donated to the Shevchenko Memorial Fund to help insure erection of the monument. Recognizing the international importance of this event more than 150 prominent Americans have joined a national honorary or sponsoring committee for the unveiling.

Never in the entire history of American foreign aid has a President been successful in obtaining the total amount of money requested for foreign assistance. I think this is a significant milestone in the history of foreign policy and indicates the true support for this vital program. The following editorial which appeared recently in the Washington Star commends President Johnson on his judicious leadership in the field of foreign aid. I join with the Washington Star in commending President Johnson for his skillful leadership and want to bring the editorial to the attention of my colleagues in the House. The editorial follows: [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star. A GIFr President Johnson has good reason to feel a glow of gratification over the way the House has dealt with his request for foreign aid. By a rollcall vote of 230 to 175. it has authorizedalmost exactly down to the last pennythe $3.5 billion he has asked for. This has never before happened in the 17year history of foreign aid. Always in the past. the House has slashed away at the annual Presidential recommendations. But now. setting a precedent of sorts. it has accepted at face value Mr. Johnsons argument that $3.5 billion must be regarded as a preshrunk. barebones. rockbottom sum vitally needed to serve the Nations best interests abroad. We hope the Senate follows suit. Still to come. of course. is the vote needed to appropriate the authorized funds. But what the House has already done is a promising augury. It is a measure of Mr. Johnsons unique skill and persuasiveness in dealing with the Congress. It suggests that honesty may be a better policy than the traditional practice of padding appropriations requests in anticipation of their being cut.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. communities scrambling for ARA benefits lost no time in filing their overall economic development plans. By May 1. 1963. 81 percent of the designated areas850 areashad filed OEDPs. Most of them involved only limited thoughtful analysis of community resources and contained little that would provide a blueprint for future community economic development. Many were poorly conceived and failed to contain essential economic data. Most were choked with information having no bearing upon the purpose of the OEDP. Since many of the filing organizations were direct successors of the established local economic development groups--by 1961 there were more than 3.000 in existence according to SBA estimatesit was not surprising to find that the OEDPs followed the longestablished tradition of such groups by basing the \"plans\" for future development on enticing new manufacturing plants from some faroff place. In short. most of the OEDPs were \"pie in the sky\" documents. Actually. manufacturing employment is declining. ARA could scarcely base sound economic planning for its customers upon expanding manufacturing plants. The community OEDPs also emphasized the need for more public works and fLcilities. A good many of the \"needed\" public works projects had little relationship to the future economic development of the community. Few promoters paid any attention to the potential cost of the proposed projects even when they had relevance to economic development. Few bothered to compute a costbenefit ratio to justify the proposed public works. The planning process was not taken seriously. it was Just looked upon as a preliminary hurdle to obtaining Federal largess. Local communities of State economic development agencies often ignored the congressional and ARA desire for \"grassroots\" preparation. For one example. most. if not all. of the OEDPs for Kentucky were prepared by the State area program office in Frankfort. They were in such general terms that without basic changes they could have described almost any area. Incredibly. the ARA went along with this cavalier attitude. It faced the choice of either approving Inadequate plans or disqualifying areas for receiving ARA cash until better plans were produced. The ARA was no less anxious to help than the communities were to receive help. So it accepted the plans.",

Congress insisted on appropriating the money. but the Executive felt it was inexpedient to spend it. even though Congress forced the funds upon him. Immediately after the beginning of the Korean warwhich no one had anticipatedI visited bases overseas and came across the latest type of American planes which had been produced. Some of them were the most modern fighter jet bombers we had. They numbered approximately 45. They were. at that time. the latest and fastest plane available to attack the Soviet Union in the event the Korean war should develop into a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Our pilots were so courageous that they were willing to go only one way. if need be. in order to reach the heart of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately. the Nation had only approximately 45 fighter bombers at that time. each of which was capable of carrying an atomic weapon. with sufficient speed to outrace any interceptor and reach the targets. The testimony. as the Senator well recalls. that was later given before the committee Investigating the dismissal of General MacArthur. headed by the distinguished Senator from Georgia was to the effect that we should be extremely cautious in any move we might make in the Korean war. because we were not adequately prepared. Much of the lack of preparation was due to the fact that the will of Congress had not been carried out. that the Executive had not gone far enough with implementing the appropriations which Congress had voted. to make sure that the Air Force was second to none and in an advanced state of readiness in the event such an emergency should overtake us.",

I am told that nearly 200 additional inspectors would be required to fill the present demand for inspection services and. at the rate that new plants have been coming into this program in the past. another 80 will be required before the year is out. Meat inspection is an obligation that the Federal Government places upon packers who wish to sell in interstate commerce. and it is a service to the consumer. I am greatly concerned about whether our Government is treating the packers fairly when it requires that the operation be inspected but on the other hand fails to provide sufficient men in the inspection force to do the job. This means that many packers. including some in my district. must ask the Federal meat inspector to work overtime and this overtime must be paid by the packers. Moreover. in many cases the cost of overtime for the inspectors is minor in comparison with the cost of slowing down or shutting down any part of the packing operation because no inspector is on hand. The highly paid packinghouse workers must stand idly by while overhead costs mount. and this means a loss to the packer and to the ultimate consumer who must therefore pay more for her meat.

There is no hope for containment or eradication of this serious pest unless answers are quickly provided by a strong research program. It cannot be kept within its present boundaries by methods now being used. Quarantines have never stopped the spread of any insect. They have only delayed its movement.

I know that in our interrogation of the representatives of the Department in dealing with this problem they indicated their concern. I know that the debate here today has clearly shown that the committee is in accord with the views which have been expressed by the gentleman from Ohio. I believe our hearings will also reflect the same thing. I do not think the gentleman has any worry with regard to it. other than the worry we always have of money and research. Money and research constitute two different things. You cannot obtain research contracts without money. But. having the money. you still have the problem of handling it. They do need to handle this research in a manner where they can come up with something to do. instead of just broadcasting the funds. I believe I can assure the gentleman from Ohio that both the committee and the Department recognize the seriousness of it and that something must be done about it.",

Mr. Chairman. we must recognize that agriculture has gone way beyond the point of merely planting. cultivating. and harvesting of crops. In the term \"agriculture\" today we must include not simply production of the crops. but the processing and the distribution of the crops. The whole purpose of agriculture is to. feed and clothe the people of the United States. It provides the food and fiber for our citizens. We have done a very fine job of studying the factors which are necessary to increase production. We have increased production to such an extent in some circumstances we feel we have produced even more than we can hope to use in the near future. We have not done so good a job in the distribution of agricultural products. Food distribution has much which still needs to be determined. We have many unanswered questions. We all have a vital stake in the success of our food distribution system. the wholesaler and retailer as well. I want to question the chairman of the committee as to just what the disposition of the committee was with regard to funds which have heretofore been made available for research on food distribution. a study of the distribution system of the country? It seems to me that we ought to continue the work. There may be good reasons for not doing it. If there are the House should understand them.",

I would like personally to thank the subcommittee. particularly my good friend. the chairman. the gentleman from Mississippi . for the work done in connection with this bill. I am gratified with its results. I rise. however. to propound a question of my good friend. suggested by the passage on page 37 of the report entitled \"Sugar Act Program.\" I read the three paragraphs involved: Payment are made to domestic producers of sugarbeet and sugarcane who comply with certain special requirements. To finance .these payments. a tax of 50 cents per hundred pounds Is imposed on all beet and cane sugar processed in or imported into the United States for direct consumption. Parenthetically. this is another way of saying that the sugar program is selfsupporting. Then going on and proving the parenthetical measure. the report states: During the period 1938 to 1963 collections from this selfsupporting tax of $2.1 billion from excise taxes and import taxes have exceeded payments by $527.4 million. The committee recommends an appropriation of $86.400.000. The next sentence states: The 1964 supplemental estimate of $6.400.000 contained in House Document 203. dated January 21. 1964. has not been included in the bill. I understand. however. and assume that all amounts due for a crop that has already been harvested will. of course. in due order be paid. I suggest that because I represent the largest cane producing congressional district in the United States and I have had some communications to the effect that although the crop has been harvested as of January 1. many months ago. some of these payments have not been made by the Federal Government.",

If my information is correct. that Commission will have available. for the very same type of project provided under this section. $2.5 million. To me it seems to serve no useful purpose to continue a study of the pricecost squeeze on the American farmer both under the Economic Research Service. USDA. and also through the National Commission on Food Marketing. The proposal for establishing a National Commission on Food Marketing has been reported by the Committee on Agriculture and is now before the Coinmittee on Rules. It would authorize spending of $1.5 million. I suspect it will be before this body soon. The effect of my amendment simply would be to halt the spending of money by the Economic Research Service for this study of the price spread between the farmer and the consumer subsequent to the enactment of legislation for the National Commission on Food Marketing.

He and those of his family who have succeeded him have epitimized the spirit of our Republic which isan enlightened free enterprise system.

In this successful program a total of $14 million was spent. The value of this contribution to society can never be evaluated in dollars. it can be said that it has brought relief and protection to millions of people. This was. moreover. the real beginning of a mass attack on those debilitating diseases and might even be said to be the forerunner to our present National Institutes of Health. Starting with an initial endowment of $35 million it has spent more than $763 million or several times its income. More than 16.000 scientists have been awarded foundationfinanced fellowships and scholarships for advanced studies through grants totaling over $61 million. Twentyeight of these have won a Nobel Prize. The foundation has known no national boundary lines. no prejudices or fetishes in their efforts to improve the lot of humanity. It has had an ideal and labored ceaselessly to achieve it. The entire Nation owes this organization a great debt. we should endeavor to encourage such enlightened progress by our national policies originating in the Congress.",

This action is clearly in the interests of the United States and will help to fulfill our real responsibility to those persons living under the domination of foreign powers. There is one additional point that needs to be made and to which I want to give special attention today. It is now evident that Cuba is acaptive nation in every sense of the word. We should now add Cuba to the group of nations whose people no longer have the opportunity to determine their own form of government or to participate in the daytoday procedures of their governing authorities. As free citizens. we in this country must come to recognize that the captive nations as a group constitute not only a primary deterrent against a hot global war and further overt aggression by Moscows totalitarian imperialism but also a prime positive means for the advance of world freedom. The international Communist organization has consistently shown that it fears a growing world knowledge of and interest in the captive nations. Advancement of this kind of factual understanding serves to explode the myths of Soviet unity and exposes the true meaning of Imperialist totalitarianism and economic colonialism throughout those areas controlled by communism. We need to do everything we can to bring the facts to all the world.

I refer to the report to Congress by the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs. of the Department of State. entitled \"The Effectiveness of the Educational and Cultural Exchange Program.\" This report. the first submitted by the newly reconstituted U.S. Advisory Commission. set up under Public Law 87256 of September 1961. was called for under that same legislation. informally designated as the FulbrightHays Act. The Commission was directed to make \"a special study of the effectiveness of past programs with emphasis on the activities of a reasonably representative cross section of past recipients of aid.\" The idea and the language. which were gladly accepted during Senate debate. were suggested by the senior Senator from Ohio. and might well be termed the \"Lausche amendment.\" Here I want to pay tribute to my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee for his foresightedness. he wrought better than we knew at the time. I say this because. although there have been many and varied reports on the exchange programs in the past. the present one appears unique in its scope. thoroughness. and significance. The fact is that the report is a ringing endorsement of not only the concept of the exchange program. but also of its implementation and results. Indeed. as stated in the report: The Commission was frankly surprised. though gratified. at the wealth. variety. and convincing character of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the program is effective. I might stress here the distinguished composition of the group which conducted the study. Members of the Commission are appointed by the President on a nonpartisan basis. as directed by Public Law 87256. and it is clear that we can have the utmost confidence in their ability and fairmindedness. Mr. President. at this point I ask unanimous consent for insertion In the REcORD of a listing of the Commission members.",

I have discussed this excellent decision on several instances on the floor of the Senate. The Secretary of Agriculture has now proposed a redraft of Forest Service regulations on ingress and egress. Within a short time he will issue final regulations. There may be further changes which should be made before these regulations are finalized. On April 23. Assistant Secretary of Agriculture John Baker plans to hold a meeting which will give various groups an opportunity to express their views. I am certain that Secretary Freeman and Assistant Secretary Baker will. at that time. consider most carefully whether there ought to be revisions in these proposed regulations. It is my opinion that unless there are some substantial defects which are brought to light and which need correction. the Secretary of Agriculture should place the new regulations into effect promptly after the April 23 meeting. At this time I wish to place in the RECORD.

American citizens of Eskimo and Indian stock who live in inland Alaska rely upon caribou meat as their principal food stock. There Is reason to believe that the caribou are becoming increasingly contaminated with strontium 90 and cesium 137. This contamination cannot be of good effect and may well be of harm to these people and to their descendants. The time is approaching. Mr. President. when the Senate and the Nation must give real attention to the perils caused by the radioactive refuse of atomic testing. Practical action is needed and the Federal Government dare not duck its responsibility. Let me make it very clear. Mr. President. that I realize I am speaking of a highly technical scientific subject of which I have no expert knowledge. This is a subject on which there has been inadequate investigation and study. Scientists themselves cannot agree upon the implication and import of this contamination and certainly no layman can speak with any assurance. Although I am not a scientist. as a Senator it Is my responsibility to speak out when the health and safety of the people of my State are threatened. I am not an expert. but Iwill become one if it is necessary in order to get action and attention on this subject. The contamination of foodstuffs by radioactive matter is subject to a good deal of misinformation and fear. It is not my intention to stir panic. to make wild charges. or to confuse further what is already a dreadfully confused situation. It is my intention to obtain from those Federal officials responsible a clear statement of the facts as we now know them. I intend to press for active. continuing. and adequate onthespot investigations and a sensible and intelligent plan for securing and insuring the health and safety of Eskimo and Indian Americans.",

    "speech": "I quote from the Public Health Service. 1962: The grades are as follows: Range I. intakes in this range would result in only a few individuals. if any. reaching a large fraction of the radiation protection guide. range II. intakes in this range would result in average exposures to population groups not exceeding the radiation protection guide. and range III. Intakes within this range would result in exposures exceeding the radiation protection guide if continued for a sufficient period of time. The Federal Radiation Council has recommended that measures limiting intake of radioactive materials should be considered when indications are that levels averaged over a year will be within range III. I am informed that the recommendations of the National Committee on Radiation Protection indicate that the maximum permissible burden of cesium 137 for nonoccupational populations is in the area of 1.000 nanocuries. For individuals the maximum range permissible lies at 3.000 nanocuries. The average rate is set lower than the individual rate to allow for individual minimax variations of the contamination level within the group being averaged. Strontium 90 taken into the body finds its way to the bones. where it lodges for many years. Concentrations of this nuclide can cause leukemia or bone cancer. Because children are growing and adding to their bone structure they tend. on the average. to absorb eight times the amounts of strontium 90 absorbed by adults under the same conditions. This is why strontium 90 is so very dangerous to the young. Cesium 137 does not concentrate in any particular organ in the body but tends to spread throughout the system. The body eliminates roughly half of the cesium 137 within 100 days of ingestion. This short biological halflife of cesium 137 contrasts with the biological halflife of strontium 90 which is 11 years. Cesium 137 has as its main effect the mutation of gene structure leading to deformities in children yet unborn. In the light of the above. my statement today must be read with the understanding that the figures are sketchy and the guidelines elastic.",

When a report was finally prepared. after the committee was directed by the Senate to prepare it. it was a onepage report. The record of the Committee on the Judiciary with regard to civil rights bills is a record of death. It is as stale as the tomb. and everyone knows it.

I feel that he made a contribution to the legislative record of this bill. and to the interpretation that the courts will put upon it. The Senator from Oregon stated that when the bill was first brought up there was no committee report. All of these facts are a part of the legislative record. I am not familiar with the line of cases to which the Senator from West Virginia referred. But I would suggest that perhaps those are cases where. after the fact. some legislator came in and tried to testify as to the interpretation of the bill on which he voted. There is a rule of legislative interpretation to the effect that \"we will take an act by its four corners. and we will interpret it. just as we interpret a contract or anything else.\" But we also look to the things that were said on the floor of a legislative body before the act was enacted. And we can look into the conditions and the situations that arose. I am sure that the Senator from West Virginia has cited cases that are strong in States such as Montana where there is no record of what goes on in the Committee of the Whole and no way of ascertaining just what the legislators said about the legislation. But those cases do not apply to the Senate of the United States. where we have a CONGRESSIONAL RECORD before the fact of the enactment of the bill. and the statement that the manager of the bill made as to the impact of the bill upon the situations outlined. The important statement of the Senator from West Virginia will be taken into consideration when the Supreme Court. the circuit court. or district court is required to interpret this legislation. So I think this colloquy has been important. Again. as the Senator from Minnesota said. it needs clarification.

The Senator may not be ready to answer them now. but I think they must be answered before we are through. There are two categories of cases in which HEW has not given satisfaction in terms of what it can and cannot do about the use of Federal funds in federally approved programs which are in part segregated. One is the HillBurton hospital program. as to which the law itself provides that there may be separatebutequal facilities. That law has been held unconstitutional in the Cone case. But to rely on a suit in the case of each federally assisted hospital would be a painfully slow casebycase proposition. Certainly after Congress enacted title VI. I would hope that it would not be necessary to return to court for a decision in every federally aided hospital case. Also. the Morrill Land Grant College Acts contain the same separatebutequal provision. We know it is unconstitutional from decisions of the Supreme Court. But the HEW will have to be placed in a position in which it will not draw an. intendment from the striking out of the words from title VI that it was intended to leave those unconstitutional statutes exactly as they were. So my first question is whether the able Senator from Minnesota understands very clearly that sections 601 and 602. as they would be amended by the package amendment. establish policy and provide for the carrying out of that policy. which would require the HEW administrators to act with respect to programs which are segregated. notwithstanding that there is vestigial language on the statute books regarding the separatebutequal provisions for Negroes * and whites.",

I speak at other commencements. but the little high schools are entitled to public service. too. I explained to my whip that I would like to accept the invitation from this smaller high school. In fact I had accepted it but I wanted to make sure that I could keep the engagement. I asked about the date of June 10 and whether there would be a vote on cloture before then. I said I would not want to get caught in a bind and find that there would be a cloture vote. \"Oh.\" said my good friend. \"I am sure .there is no such danger.\" He made no commitment. But he assured me that he did not think there was any chance of their being a cloture vote before June 10. Even had I had a commitment. I would not have held my whip to It because of the nature of the situation. But I want to keep the record straight because of certain facts I want to bring out momentarily. He said. \"I do not think there is any danger of there being a cloture vote before June 10.\" I said. \"That is fine. I will take the chance.\" So I made my plans to keep the commencement engagement. I could imagine the disappointment that my not being there would cause if I could not go. I then went to the majority leader. after talking to the whip. I explained the situation to the majority leader. The majority leader said. \"Oh. I do not think there would be any danger of any vote before June 15.\"1 I felt somewhat relieved. Of course.

With and without our approval. gambling in this country has grown into a $100 billion a year taxfree monopoly. Unfortunately. most of this gambling activity is illegal and has become the chief source of revenue to the underworld crime syndicates. Mr. Speaker. today. I would like to bring to the attention of this House one type of gambling activity which last year had a turnover of almost $55 billion. Although every single transaction involved an element of chance. we. in this country. have recognized and accepted this kind of activity as legal and proper. To those Members of this House who consider a national lottery proposal conducive to sin. I would like to remind them the purchase of a Government lottery ticket is no more wicked or sinful than the buying and selling activities at every stock exchange where hundreds of millions of dollars change hands every day. Mr. Speaker. a recent report from the New York Stock Exchange shows that in 1963. the volume of stock sales on this exchange alone totaled over 1.350 million shares which represented a total market value of almost $55 billion. Are not these daily activities at the New York Stock Exchange games of chance? Are not stock manipulations subject to the risk of a loss for the chance of some gain? Are not the speculators in these stocks actually gambling? Does hypocrisy clothe this type of activity with respectability because we identify the gamblers in the stock market as investors? Was it not Shakespeare who warned that a rose by any other name smells the same. We can call a national lottery by another nameAmericas freedom planbut the aims and purposes would be the same. to wit: to raise at least $10 billion a year in new revenue. Whether we call it a lottery. or a plan. it will provide the same tremendous revenue advantages this Government needs. So. let us stop the hypocrisy.",

This sentiment is well reflected in an editorial which appeared in the Washington Evening Star last evening: SHOCKER The ListonClay fight was a shocker. all right. It was such a shocker that the whole business should be thoroughly investigated. There are too many questions. and they ought not be left dangling as was the public by Sonny Listons downfall. What really happened to Cassius Marcellus Clay before the fight? Was he. at the weighin. \"a man scared to death?\" Those were the words of the Miami Boxing Commissions chief physician. in a pronouncement hardly calculated to even the odds on the fight. Clays pulse was counted that afternoon at 120: he seemed glassyeyed and hysterical. Yet by fight time. his pulse had unaccountably dropped to 64 and he was clearly in full possession of his faculties. Was all this a hoaxjust part of the publicity buildup? For that matter. what is Clays mental condition? He continued after the fight to babble wildly in praise of himself. Have we now a world champion who draws his strength from some sort of kookie inner hypnosis. or is it all for our benefitfor public consumption only? Finally. what of Liston and his supposedly injured shoulder? Did this formidable battler really suffer a fluke accident early in the fightor did he merely feel disinclined to rise from his stool at the start of the seventh round? These do not seem to us frivolous questions. The most skillful scriptwriter extant could not have improved on the buildup and outcome of this weird affair as a setup for a fabulously profitable return match. Maybe it just happened that waymaybe not. A serious effort should be made to find out. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. once again we are beginning to hear more and more complaints from U.S. industries suffering from foreign competition. Steel. glass. and meat are only a few but meat seems to be the one causing the most widespread and alarming consequences. Without going into details. it is perfectly obvious that meat imports affect our whole agricultural economy. It means less cattle raising in the United States. which means less feed grain consumption. which finally means more surplus grain. Conversely. if we have less foreign meats shipped in. then we raise more domestic cattle and use more domestic feed grains and relieve our surplus grain problem to a considerable extent. Under these circumstances. it would seem that the problem would be met by agreeing with U.S. cattle raisers on some solution. But instead. our Government follows the unbelievable course of entering into agreements with foreign cattle producing countries. Last week agreements with Australia and New Zealand were published which. to many domestic producers. offer no relief to American cattlemen at all. They continue the present system of importing with a percentage of increased imports in succeeding years. These agreements were made by the Departments of State and Agriculture on February 17. 1964. While they no doubt satisfy foreign cattle raisers. they leave U.S. producers completely unsatisfied and disillusioned that our Government should take a position favoring foreign producers over our own. There are many facts and statistics to support the position of U.S. cattlemen which are not possible to relate here at this time. But the important thing to recognize is that they have no chance of receiving any relief from the executive departments of the Government. They must look to Congress which is the last and only effective source of protection to injured American industries. Various bills have been introduced to afford relief to the cattle and meat industry and I am hopeful that the Ways and Means Committee will schedule a hearing in the near future to consider these proposals.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for the last several months studies have been underway to determine the location for a new electric generating plant made by the rural electric system In Missouri. A number of sites were studied and recently a decision was made by the Associated Electric Cooperatives representing all of the rural electric cooperatives in the State of Missouri to locate the plant at Thomas Hill on the Little Chariton River in Randolph County. This conclusion was reached because engineering studies by Burns & McDonnell Engineering Co. clearly demonstrated this to be the most economical location. Following is a table showing the total cost over a 12year period as computed by Burns & McDonnell for the various sites considered: Total Mills per Plan 12year Differ. kilowattoperation enee hour delivered Thou- Thou. sands sands Thomas lill ------------- $175. 709 ---- 6.503 ChamoisSouth River__. 176.053 344 6.516 South RiverChamois.. 176. 539 830 6.534 South River ------------- 176.839 1.130 6.545 Chamois ----------------- 177. 446 1.737 6.567 Boonville ---------------- 177. 703 1.994 6. 577 The report also states: In addition to the financial savings shown above. there are also other factors which favor this site. More important among these other factors are the following: The Thomas Hill transmission system is the most flexible of any of the transmission plans. It is easiest to add additional future generation or substation at most points on the system. The transmission system has more available capacity remaining for additional loads after the end of the 12year period studied. The system is such that the unit scheduled for 1971 operation could be Increased to 300.000 kilowatts with little or no additions to the transmission system from that shown on the plan. When future generation is added after 1975. the additional capacity can most easily be added to the Thomas Hill transmission system. For the last year studied. 1975. the Thomas Hill plan is $78.000 per year lower in total cost than the next best plan studied. and a saving of at least this amount will be realized in each succeeding year over any other plan studied.",

I advocated that the only reasonable course for the Congress to follow was to submit the matter to the people in the form of a constitutional amendment and give them a chance to express their views. I made this proposal because I am convinced that a majority of the people of the United States are opposed to the provisions of that measure. In areas where the press and television have informed the people of the contents of this bill. there is majority opposition. Only in those areas. typified by the Washington area. where a liberal control of both media has kept the truth of this measure from the people is there any sentiment for it. Columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. in a recent column. reveal some interesting figures every Member of the Senate should study before they vote on this bill. For instance. one survey conducted by a supporter of the bill. showed that 53.1 percent of the Republicans opposed the measure and almost 80 percent thought that integration was being pushed too fast. Of the Democrats. which would include most of the Negroes. 65.1 percent favored the bill. but still. almost 50 percent agreed that integration was being pushed too fast. This poll is just one of a number of instances indicating that people from California to Virginia and from Texas to Maine are not in favor of this iniquitous bill. An earlier column of these two newsmen pointed out still other instances of public rejection of this measure in the States of Washington and California. Because there is apparently no way the truth about the contents of this bill can penetrate the blackout imposed by the liberal news media.

Our information at this stage is inadequate. As I pointed out in January: The paucity of literature in this field and the repetitive nature of much that has been written attests to the low priority we have assigned to this problem.

One need not concur in all of Professor Melmans conclusions in these notes. nor agree with all of his observations to appreciate that he is coming to grips with the problem directly. I personally do not believe that we will see the end of high rates of military spending for many years to come. Nevertheless. our military needs and priorities are constantly changing. a slight change in the contracting emphasis in the defense budget could throw thousands of people out of work. We cannot wait to meet these contingencies when they arise. we must plan for them now.

He became a member of the State railroad commission in 1913. continuing to grow stronger both in experience and in the hearts of his fellow Texans through these years.

We see on page 4 of the report that for the Gemini program $308.400.000 is proposed and that for the Apollo program $2.677.500.000 is proposeda total of close to $3 billion. That is as much as was appropriated last year for the entire foreign aid program. including military assistancein other words. one of the major aspects of our effort to keep peace in the world. The space program is one which promises no significant and immediate benefit that I can see to the solving of problems here on earth. I am willing to concede that we should pursue a space program for scientific purposes. but what I am trying to emphasize. as I did last fall. is that a crash program for putting a man on the moon by 1970 is not justified. There came to my desk recently a book entitled \"The MoonDoggie.\" written by Prof. Amitai Etzion. of Columbia University. I have not had an opportunity to read the entire book. but I ask unanimous consent that the introduction. which consists of only six pages can be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I invite the attention of the Senate to a statement by Professor Etzioni about the origin of the moon program. The first inclination of President Kennedy was to propose a joint program with the Russians. I quote a part of the introduction: Meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961. he proposed a joint AmericanRussian space program. (Later. when Khrushchev cabled congratulations on John Glenns flight. the President in his acknowledgment again suggested SovietAmerican cooperation in space. and followed through with specific proposals.) Unfortunately. subsequently to that meeting there occurred the Bay of Pigs expedition in 1961. It had considerable effect upon our relations with the Russians. not only in the field of space projects. but in all other fields. as well. It precipitated a much different climate. The author wrote: Meg Greenfield reported from Washington to the Reporter: \"The moon program was worked out over a hectic weekend in May of 1961 at the Pentagon following Alan Shepards successful suborbital flight. It was a political response to the Gagarin venture and to the Cuban disaster. among other things. Reportedly. Secretary McNamara. James Webb of NASA and a few others met round the clock starting Friday evening and worked out the crash program that was presented to the President for a decision the following Monday. We have been told. as one of the participants puts it. not to fool around. \" That was the origin of the moon program. according to Professor Etzioni. I am sure there was more to it than that. but what he wrote makes some sense. Because of the disaster of the Bay of Pigs and the success of sputnik. the United States was determined to do something spectacular to impress the world that the United States had not become a secondclass country. I have much more confidence in the capability of the world to judge whether or not the United States is a secondclass country. I do not believe that either of those events had any such actual effect upon the worlds thinking. I am not prepared to throw away $5 billion to show that we are a great country. Everyone knows that we have made mistakes. and this is one of them. But I do not wish to pay for it in any such fashion as this.",

I discussed this question with him before his unfortunate. tragic death. I do not wish to delay the Senate by going into detail. but in summary his attitude was that the project as originally started would contribute to moving this country ahead. that it had strong support. and that this would get money into the economy of the country and help get it to moving again. as he was anxious to do. Therefore. it had what they called a \"fallout\" effect. aside from its own merits. I do not believe that that is an inaccurate description of his attitude. In 1963. after things had calmed down-",

    "speech": "President Kennedy in his last speech before the United Nations stated: Why should mans first flight to the moon be made a national competition? Surely we should explore whether scientists and astronauts of our two countriesindeed. of all the world--cannot work together in the conquest of space. sending someday in this decade to the moon not representatives of a single nation. but of all our countries. That being in his last speech before the United Nations. it shows that he came back to his original idea that this project should not be a kind of childish competition to see who was first in a spectacular race to the moon. but that he had recognized that this was the kind of project to be pursued on a multilateral basiswith the Russians. or anyone else who wished to cooperate in it. So I say that the arguments which have been advanced to justify this crash program are wholly without foundation. There is one sentence in the introduction: The question is not an either/or proposition. but one of paceof haste and waste. I believe that summarizes the argument about as well as I can do it. Mr. President. there came to my attention an article published in the Arkansas Gazette which I believe sums up this situation in a rather striking manner. This reported a speech in my State by Dr. John R. Emens. president of Ball State Teachers College. Muncie. Ind. Dr. Emens said: Outer space is a great challenge to man. but the space between the ears is the greater challenge. I believe that sums it up very well. Here we are. in some fantastic manner engaged in a program involving more than $5 billion in 1 year. and neglecting the education of our people. In other words. we are neglecting the improvement of the space. and even the investigation of the space. between the ears. He says further: The challenge of inner space is under mens hats. It is the most undeveloped territory in America today. I know of no better way to put it. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the RECORD.",

When did we ever get $5 billion to enable the young people of this country to meet the challenges. even of the space age. There is much that must go unsaid under the limited time that we have today with regard to needs in other fields. particularly in the underdeveloped area of space between the ears. So. Mr. President. I hope that the Senate will take a second look at this problem. as I believe President Kennedy was doing before his untimely death. We got into this program under the impulse of the Bay of Pigs. and the orbiting of sputnik by the Russians. It was a highly emotional era. in which we were told that America was falling behind the Russians in the space race and that we must do something dramatic to reestablish our position in the world. Senators will remember that our prestige in the world became an issue in the last campaign. and a great deal was made of it. All this I believe is nonsense compared to the actual state of the world. I do not. for one moment. believe that there Is anything substantial to the argument the United States is behind the Russians either in this field or in any other field of any significance to the human race. I do not wish to downgrade the accomplishments of the Russians in any field. They have done and they are doing a competent job in space. particularly in the field of rocketry. But this is not a justification of this type of program. It is erroneous and false to base the project of going to the moon with a man on any such consideration as our prestige. Our prestige does not need support of this nature. There is one other item I should like to mention before I take my seat.

Education is. indeed. a local matter and a local responsibility. We. in South Carolina. are proud of what we have done in meeting that responsibility over the past years. We are proud of what we have been able to do toward giving increasingly improved educational opportunities to all our citizens. regardless of their individual economic circum: stances. Admittedly. much remains to be done. but it is not the Federal prerogative to step into the picture for that reason. Federal intervention can lead only to a corresponding decrease in local interest and support. Though one of the poorer States financially. South Carolina is striving desperately to give our citizens the highest educational advantages possible. Witness our being No. 1 State in the pioneering of educational television. They do hope that Federal expenditures will be reduced so that more money may be kept at home. We feel. and we think wisely so. that we can get more dollar value from local funds that remain at home than from funds collected at home and returned to us by way of Washington. When funds reach us by this route. we find them not only diminished in value but usually diminished in usefulness because of stipulations and conditions. And these restrictions are often designed more for political purposes than for the promotion of the best interests of our people. We. in South Carolina. as in other States. recognize that education is one of the basic cornerstones upon which is built the intellectual and economic strength of a nation. Much remains to be done in improved salaries and facilities. but our people are facing up to their educational challenge and responsibility. We are not pleading to the powers that be in Washington for financial assistance. Most of us feel that the current philosophy of running to Washington for everything must be halted. I submit.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which has been recommended by the Association of American Colleges. the American Council on Education. the Association for Higher Education. the National Education Association. and the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. This bill is designed to insure that private and public school personnel receive equal treatment in attending summer counseling and guidance institutes and language institutes. Under the provisions of the National Defense Education Act. public school teachers are eligible to receive stipends from the Federal Government while attending summer institutes in guidance and language training. Private school teachers are ineligible for these grants. These are areas vital to the programs in our elementary and secondary schools. and. of course. it is in the national interest that studies in these fields continue. The distinction between public and private school teachers in this context is artificial. Fully 51/2 million American children attend private elementary and secondary schools. and their needs cannot be overlooked. The stipend which is granted to public school teachers who attend summer sessions is $75 a week. with an additional payment of $15 a week for each dependent. This grant has made it financially possible for many teachers to attend. Since the inception of the program in the summer of 1959. approximately 21.000 teachers have taken advantage of it. The need for the amendment which I propose is emphasized when one considers that less than 5 percent of this number is made up of teachers from private schools. who are. in effect. prevented from taking the courses unless they are completely selfsupporting during the period of study. In the vital area of guidance. for example. 9.225 public school teachers attended the institutes while only 240 private school teachers could afford to do so. This wasteful and useless ignoring of potential talent is harmful. not only to these teachers and their 51/2 million students. but eventually. the entire Nation is the loser. and the basic purposes of the National Defense Education Act. to insure that in the national interest every young person has the opportunity to develop his gifts to the fullest extent. will be thwarted.

All of us who knew personally Americas poet laureate. all across the world who have read and will continue to read his poems. all those who have once climbed a birch or walked a mountain pasture. mourn his passing. He is one of those few people in a generation or a society who simply will never be replaced. Being an artist of spirit and clarity. this awesome thought is transcended by the sturdy fact that the truth and music of his words will be treasured and passed on by generation after generation. shared faithfully and happily by teachers and thinkers and artists to come. always alive. Robert Frost was a New England poet. and therefore specially beloved and perhaps specially understood by New Englanders. He wanted to be known more as an American poet. and was. But he transcended both regionalism and nationalism. because the spirit he imparted by writing of New England things and New England people is universal. cleanly understood by people in other contexts and climes. We in the Senate. joined by the Members of the House of Representatives. were honored last year. through the President of the United States. to award Robert Frost a gold medal in commemoration of his poetry and the profound contribution it had made to the enrichment of mankind. This poet once wrote. in a poem called \"The Death of the Hired Man.\" of one who. nearing death. had \"nothing to look backward on with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope.\" We look back for him upon his lifes work with the most profound kind of pride even as we ponder on the hope for the future which his poetry gives to us. Robert Frost knew tragedy. but knew beauty bettera strong and a kind man who ennobled those about him. His personality meant much to us in New England. We mourn his loss.",

Highly respected as a judge by the bench. the bar. and the public. Judge McCarthy rendered justice with mercy. While he was fearless in the performance of his judicial duties. he recognized the frailties of human beings. and in the disposition of criminal cases. administered dispositions not only with judicial logic. but with a heart. . A major test of the prestige of a judge isthe feelings of the members of the bar whether a judge is fair. recognizes the position. of trust he occupies. or if in the courtroom heis a judicial dictator. Judge McCarthy was -highly. respected .by the -members of. the bar because of his ability and his effectiveness. but above all. because he was kind and fair. Judge McCarthy. or \"Bill\" McCarthy as he was endearingly called. was a \"judges judge.\" Judge McCarthy had an outstanding career as a public official. as a lawyer. as U.S. attorney. and as a member of the Federal judiciary.

The administration is to be commended for withdrawing 7.500 men of its military force from the European theater. it should by now be apparent that the conditions .which created NATO. in the wake of World War II. no longer exist. France has not contributed its share and feels it no longer needs American military support. However unchanged the purposes of the. Kremlin may be in seeking to communize the world. it is in trouble at home and it is clear that U.S.S.R. troops will notmarch westward across Europe and conquer the countries between it and the Atlantic. Moreover. the success of the U.S. troop lift a few months ago has also demonstrated that keeping our present forces in Europe to the strength formerly specified is no longer necessary. Withdrawing this small contingent of 7.500 men is evidence that our administration has wisely begun to appreciate the need of revaluating our policies established over a decade ago. and that our balanceofpayments problem will be aided thereby. This withdrawal should be only a beginning. An even more desirable move. by which the United States will withdraw troops no longer needed abroad. .is presented in an admirable article written by our able and distinguished colleague. the Senator from Idaho . a member. of the Foreign.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it would appear that the Soviet Union is successfully and cleverly waging economic warfare against the free world. I recall that in the 18th century we were victims of British mercantilism. We are now seeing a revival of the old British mercantilism of the 18th century in the form of Soviet mercantilism. The Soviet Union provides the hub or center of the colonial empire. The Soviet Union provides the manufactured products and finished goods for the colonial possessions. and the colonial possessions. in turn. provide the Soviet Union with raw materials both for home consumption and for trade with the rest of the world. They also afford the Soviet Union markets for their goods. It is a very clever way in which to wage economic warfare. It would appear that the Soviet Union has made the full turn from Marxism to Adam Smith. It would appear that they are adopting some trappings of the capitalistic system in an effort to wage economic warfare against the free world. It is what we might call laissezfaire communism. I hope that there will be an end to useless and nonsensical talk about the vast cost to the Soviet Union of colonizing the rest of the world. They are actually making a profit from colonialism. We must take measures to combat the economic warfare of the Soviet Union. We must realize that colonialism for the Soviet Union is a profitable operation. Let us abandon the myth of the cost of Soviet occupation of Cuba.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. throughout the world today. Poles and citizens of Polish descent will celebrate the Polish 3d of May Constitution Day. a Polish national holiday. From coast to coast. in cities and towns. such as those in North Dakota. Americans of Polish descent are gathering together to pay tribute to the Polish people and to remind Americans that Poland was one of the first pioneers of liberalism in Europe. In my State of North Dakota. we have a large group of citizens of Polish descent. These citizens are among the finest in our State and among them are outstanding leaders in community and State government. They are extremely industrious and patriotic. We are proud of them and their achievements. This years celebration will mark the 172d anniversary of the 1791 Polish Constitution. which eliminated the most fundamental weakness of the Polish parliamentary and social system. This Constitution with its principles rooted in the Polish love and attachment to freedom and independence. incorporates enduring precepts of public policy and democracy. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the Polish uprising of 1863. There have been several Polish uprisings against Russian rule. beginning with the Kosciuszko uprising of 1794. but the one on January 22. 1863. was one of the greatest. longest. and bloodiest in Polish history. This movement spread. and there were instantaneous uprisings in all Polish communities under Russian rule. The Russians brought into Poland 35.000 seasoned troops and the uprisings were halted in April 1865. Over 20.000 Poles were killed in battle. thousands captured. 600 leaders were executed. the rest were sent to Siberia. In paying tribute to these Polish defenders for freedom. we also recognize those who have fought for Poland over the past 1.000 years. I am proud to join with the PolishAmerican Congress representing 7 million Americans of Polish ancestry in expressing hope for the ultimate triumph of justice and for a return to the life of freedom for the Polish people.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a very significant holiday is being observed on May 3 by the Polish people. both those residing in the free world and those still in their native land behind the Iron Curtain. On May 3. 1791. a constitution was adopted by the Polish nation. and It established in that country. for the first time. the principle of the responsibility of the ruler to the representatives of the people. That great document established a rough form of egalitarianism. assured the peasants of the protection of their governmental rights. abolished class distinctions. and provided for religious freedom. Certainly the ideals embodied in the Polish Constitution are ideals which we Americans cherish deeply. We sympathize today with these people. who presently are forced to tolerate the domination of alien forces. and are unable to enjoy the freedom in which they so strongly believe. Here in the United States we are privileged to have many fine citizens of Polish origin who have contributed much from the rich heritage of the Polish culture to our American civilization. I have had the honor of knowing and working with many of these fine PolishAmericans in Massachusetts. and have seen in them the admirable qualities which were characteristic of their nations great personalities. including Chopin. Kosciusko. and Pulaski. The times In which we live are indeed troubled ones for the people of Poland. While those who remain in that country must celebrate in silence this great day in their history. we want them to know that the free world has not forgotten their true hopes and aspirations. and is aware of their determination to achieve once again the freedom which has meant so much to them. I think it is fitting that all Americans should pay tribute to the Polish people on their Constitution Day. to let them know that as a freedomloving people we hope the time will soon come when the Polish nation can reestablish a government consistent with the goals and ideals which characterized their 1791 Constitution.",

I ask your leave to read a quote: All power in civil society should be derived from the will of the people. its end and object being the presentation and integrity of the state. the civil liberty and the good order of society. on an equal scale and on a lasting foundation. This is a perfect description of the very reason we sit here today. It could be from our empowering constitution. Indeed. it is from a constitution. But the country that adopted it today is barred from implementing it. The quote is from the constitution adopted on May 3. 1791. by Poland. This is the 172d anniversary year of that constitution. Tomorrow. May 3. Poles everywhere and citizens of Polish origin in many countries celebrate as a national holidaythe Polish 3d of May Constitution Day. The Polish Constitutiod waz adopted 2 years after our own. but obviously both were inspired by the same desire for freedom and individual rights. Today. we sit as individuals. representing the will of the people as the U.S. Constitution decrees. But the Polish are not so fortunate. Yet we know that. no matter how many times she has been trampled on. Poland has held true to these ideals that inspired the May 3d Constitution. Let us today. enjoying the life they desire. pruse to reaffirm our faith that Poland. too. will one day have again the freedom she holds so dear.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a part of President Kennedys tax program provides for significant help to people over 65 in all income groups. with the greatest benefit going to those with lower incomes. For example. the special credit for the aged would give 97 percent of its benefits to elderly taxpayers with incomes below $10.000 and 50 percent to those with incomes below $5.000. Although the overall effect of the tax program on people over 65 would give most of the $790 million in benefits to those earning less than $10.000. tax reduction would also be extended up through the $50.000plus bracket. These proposals deserve careful study. and I ask unanimous consent that a Treasury Department fact sheet dated February 15. 1963. on the tax program for the aged be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I further ask unanimous consent that two tables which are a part of this fact sheet entitled \"Illustrative examples to show the effect of present law and the Presidents recommendations on taxpayers 65 and over with various sources of income\" and \"Effect of the Tax Program on Tax Liabilities of Individuals Aged 65 and Over\" be printed in the RECORD.",

Tex.. the district I have the privilege to represent in the House. Mr. A. G. Hill. well respected for his patriotic participation in governmental affairs expresses the thoughts of many as to our inept and confused policy which led to the humiliation of this Government at the hands of riotbent mobs in Panama. The letter follows: To the EDITOR. The Pittsburgh PostGazette. Pittsburgh. Pa. The facts seem quite clear that the rioting in Panama was incited and encouraged by Communist agents. Panamanian politicians and local radio stations. There were no aggressive acts by American citizens and no invasion of Panama by any American personnel. All rioting took place in the Canal Zone. In view of these facts it would seem that our Government would be requesting an apology and indemnity for loss of American lives and payment of damages for loss of American property. However. no such request has been made. and it has now been announced in the face of continued bitter and unfounding charges by the Panamanian Government and the breaking off of diplomatic relations by them. that we will continue giving foreign aid to Panama if we are assured that our representatives passing out the gifts will not be harmed. What has happened to our national honor. logic. integrity. principles. and courage? Sincerely yours. A. 0. Hrt.. Memorial to God",

The author is Henry Harris. editor of the West Point (Miss.) Times Leader. It follows: (By Henry Harris) President Lyndon Johnson has proposed that all of Americas religious faiths join in erecting in Washington \"a fitting memorial to the God who made us all.\" The suggestion rings with both politics and paganism. What type of fitting memorial could be built for God. Were told in the 20th chapter of Exodus: \"* * * You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make yourself a graven image. or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above. or that is in the earth beneath. or that is in the water under the earth. you shall not bow down to them or serve them. for I the Lord your God am a jealous God. visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me. but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.\" The greatest monument to God which could be built in Washington would be in the form of dedicated Christian governmental officials who put the teachings of Jesus above the power of the ballot * * * who treat their own bodies as Gods holy temples * * * and who set an example of decency and dedication for the entire Nation to follow.

Chicagos Sunday American carried an editorial entitled. \"Goal for a Nation.\" which I should like to call to the attention of not only my colleagues here in Congress but to every single other American involved directly or indirectly. including the President. in the gigantic task of planning for Americas future. This is one of the finest editorials that I have seen. It clearly and succintly places the whole problem of racial unrest in its proper perspective and boldly outlines a realistic program which I am sure we Americans can carry out. This editorial quite properly points out that the time has come to take a second look at some of our efforts to help other nations when problems continue grave here in our own country. I am happy to say that Congress last year reduced foreign aid expenditures considerably. and I was privileged to participate in that reduction. This year the President himself has recommended substantial cuts and I am sure his request will be trimmed even further. by the Congress. As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. I believe the program outlined by Chicagos Sunday American offers all of us an excellent guideline for getting at the very root of Americas domestic problem of chronic and costly unemployment. This editorials plea for job retraining to put people back to work takes on even added significance when we recall that in the one State of Illinois alone. our State legislature last year had to appropriate $690 million for general relief in Illinois for this biennium. I know of no more costly problem to all American taxpayers than the unemployed American whose basic needs must be fulfilled by his fellow Americans through general relief or some other form of public welfare.

President Johnson issued a message saluting the event and from reports already received it is clear that a great many related activities took place all over the Nation. not the least of them. I am happy to say. in my own State of Pennsylvania. There are two facts most worthy of note concerning dental disease. First. that it is perhaps mankinds most widespread affliction. Almost no one is immune to it or free from its effects. Nine out of 10 people suffer from some form of dental disease and 85 million manhours of work are lost annually because of it. And yet. the second fact worth noting is that few diseases can be more readily controlled by the exercise of a little care and diligence. As in the past. the American Dental Association and its local societies carried out this year a massive educational effort. The 7th district and 10th district dental societies of Pennsylvania. to which the dentists in my district belong. were again an important part of this national effort.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my colleague has stated very well the need for this legislation we introduce today in behalf of the TlingitHaida people of Alaska. The TlingitHaida Jurisdictional Act. passed almost 30 years ago was well conceived for the most part but it was premised on the TlingitHaidi peoples continuing to live in the thenexisting Indian communities and following their traditional means of livelihood of hunting and fishing. Mr. President. this has all now changed. There are TlingitHaidas living in many of the predominantly nonIndian communities of Alaska as well as in other States. For example. there are considerable numbers in Seattle and San Francisco. As a result. the mode of distribution of judgment money and the language specifying who is eligible to participate in the judgment no longer makes any sense. Furthermore. no provision was made in the original act for establishment of an official representative body to make the necessary decisions as to how the judgment funds should be used and distributed. This I feel is one of the most urgent reasons for the bill my colleague and I propose to the Senate today. A decision by the Court of Claims that the TlingitHaida Indians should be compensated for lands taken by the United States in southeastern Alaska has already been reached and I understand a determination of the size of the judgment will be forthcoming soon. The need for enactment of our proposal is. therefore. immediate and pressing. Once the tribal governing body contemplated by the legislation is established. plans already in the making can be implemented which I am hopeful will bring. in one area. some of the same results anticipated by the President in his countrywide war on poverty.

I introduced a proposed constitutional amendment which provided for the determination of the disability of the President by a process which is identical with the impeachment process. But .I must admit that this Joint resolution is a vast improvement over my original proposal. It accomplishes the determination of whether a President is disabled to perform the duties of his Office with the least embarrassment to the President and in the most efficacious manner. At the same time. it combines action on the part of the Vice President and the members of the Cabinet. or such other body as the Congress may designate. with action on the Congress in case the President is unable or unwilling to make a determination of his own disability. By so doing. the Joint resolution makes it certain that in a time of great and violent partisanshipsuch as existed in respect to Andrew Johnson during Reconstructionwe are not likely to have under the amendment any exhibition of partisanship which is destructive of the welfare of our Nation. This Is true because it does not permit a single political party controlling the Congress when there is a division between the political affiliation of those in the executive branch and those in the legislative branch to assume sole power to act when a question arises as to whether the President is able to perform the functions of his office.",

As the Senator knows. there is a precedent in the election law which permits Congress to decide how a President can be elected in case one candidate does not receive a majority of the electoral votes. There is a precedent in impeachment proceedings. in which it is provided that one branch. the House. shall bring the Impeachment and the Senate shall try. and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside over the formalities and trial itself. As the Senator has said. I believe that by requiring cooperation by all branches of the Government. we shall arrive at the right answer. I shall discuss in a moment in detail what Senate Joint Resolution 139 provides. but I should like to remind the Senator from North Carolina of a conversation the two of us had when another proposed constitutional amendment was brought before the Judiciary Committee. We were both concerned about the security of the office of President. The Constitution provides for a twothirds vote in order to convict the President on impeachment. Can we imagine what would have happened in the Reconstruction Days if it had taken a majority to impeach President Andrew Johnson and a majority to declare him disabled? We know he would have been declared disabled.",

As a result of his efforts. many of us have laid aside pride in our own proposed solutions and agreed upon a common solution of this problem. I sincerely trust that the Senate and the House of Representatives will vote to pass the Joint resolution by the required twothirds majority. and that threefourths of the States will ratify the joint resolution in the shortest possible time. This is most desirable because such action would remedy two very serious omissions in our Constitution--omissions which must be remedied to insure continuity and stability of government. In closing.

The benefits that will be derived from this program are so important that to allow this amendment to stay in the bill would be a mistake in my opinion. The welfare officials of my own city of Minneapolis have told me that an effective food stamp program would permit a more orderly distribution of agricultural products. It would also serve more needy people because it would rely on the normal commercial channels of distribution. As the Committee on Agriculture has pointed out. the pilot food stamp program has proven to be the most effective method yet devised to provide needy. Americans with an adequate diet. In this way the food stamp program can be an important supplement to our State and. local welfare programs. The Federal Government will not automatically set up food stamp programs in all areas of the country. the agency responsibility for administering public programs in the States must request the establishment of a food stamp program. Those areas which have the greatest need for this type of program certainly will -not ask to participate in it because they will be unable to afford this additional program. They already have difficulty meeting the minimum welfare needs of their people. Thus. the people who have the greatest need for this assistance will be unable to participate in this program. The States most in need of this program will be forced to rely on the donated food program instead of being able to take advantage of the food stamp program. The bill does provide that States will be responsible for financing the costs of the administration of the program in the local areas. This preserves the important principle of FederalState cooperation and cost sharing. If the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota. Congressman QUIE is retained in the bill. this program will not supplement our existing welfare programit will either remain unutilized or it might even tend to replace them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since the Foreign Assistance Act of 1964 will now go to conference. I wish to take this opportunity to urge the House conferees to accept the Senate amendment to the bill.expressing the sense of the Congress that \"persecution of any persons because of their religion by the Soviet Union be condemned. and that the Soviet Union in the name of decency and humanity cease executing persons for alleged economic offenses. and fully permit the free exercise of religion and the pursuit of culture by Jews and all others within its borders.\" This amendment. Mr. Speaker. which I have quoted only in part. is similar to the resolutionHouse Resolution 872which I introduced on September 1. 1964. and which has been referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. My resolution is only one of many that have been introduced on this important subject in both the House and the Senate. Because of the approaching adjournment of the Congress. these resolutions cannot possibly be given consideration. but by the adoption of the Senate amendment to H.R. 11380. the Congress of the United States can go on record. now. against the infringement of one of mans most basic rights--that of freedom of religion. Although there is no doubt that the religious difficulties faced by the Jews in the Soviet Union are shared by other religious faiths. the reports of antiSemitism in other fields. particularly in the suppression of alleged economic crimes. gives evidence that the leaders of the Soviet Union have made the Jewish citizens of their land the target of dangerous propaganda. which cannot be justified for any reason. at any time. An important staff study published in the summer 1964 issue of the \"Journal of the International Commission of Jurists\" discusses the extent to which the repression of economic crimes is linked with antiSemitism in the Soviet Union. This study documents in great detail actual court cases involving socalled economic crimes and in what respects these cases may be linked to antiSemitism. The study concludes that Jewish participation in economic crimes has been magnified and that the Jews of the Soviet Union have been made the \"scapegoat for the transgressions of those whose guilt it would be dangerous to make public.\" I commend this revealing report to my colleagues. The \"Journal of the International Commission of Jurists\"-summer. 1964--is available through the Library of Congress.",

The Senate receded on six points. The House accepted the Senate language on one item dealing with widows. which disqualifies a widow from receiving a grant if she is receiving Federal Employees Compensation Act benefits as the widow of the Foreign Service officer or anyone else. The major difference concerned 177 annuitants who made no provision for a widows annuity. We accepted part of the Senate language which requires that if they elect a survivors annuity of $2.400 at the more favorable cost available since 1960. they will have to make a repayment back as far as 1960 of $300 a year. The repayment may be in a lump sum or at the rate of $25 per month. If they make such an election and if the wife dies before the retired Foreign Service officer completes the repayments. the widow is relieved of any liability for the unpaid balance.

We have one medical doctor to about 841 people. So we did not need any great. long study by the Secretary to tell us that we need more optometrists. Secondly. under the National Defense Education Act program. an optometrist would have to start paying his loan back within a year after he completed his professional education. Mr. Chairman. let me say this to the gentleman. There is a great deal of difference in the way an otpometrist starts out and the manner in which a medical doctor starts out. The doctor can go into a hospital. or he can go into a military program and can get his internship and residency at the expense of the Federal Government. with equipment furnished by the services. if he prefers that route. If he goes into private practice he has available to him hospitals that are fully equipped. An optometrist has to buy his own equipment. So there is a great need. we think. for more flexibility and more room in which to pay back the loan. Then. too. I thinkand the gentleman may disagree with what I am about to say. but this goes back to the matter of who should do this. whether the Labor and Education Committee should do it. or not. The gentleman says that is not true. But the fact of the matter is. every fight we have had has arisen out of a difference in philosophy. We say that optometry is a health profession. We think we have adequately demonstrated that in our hearings. The gentleman says that the Education and Labor Committee ought to have full jurisdiction over all education. They fought us on title III in S. 1576. now Public Law 88164. when we sought to educate people in the matter of rehabilitating the deaf and the blind. The gentleman said that that was not a health or a therapeutic matter. We disagreed. We think that if the optometrists want to come this way. we can give them a little bit more time in which to pay back their loans.

In that time. the enrollment has risen by approximately 5.000. In osteopathy. there is one school fewer than in 1955. Today there are five. as compared with six in 195051. The enrollment in schools of osteopathy has dropped approximately 300. In 195051. there were 42 schools of dentistry. today there are 43. Enrollment in schools of dentistry has risen. roughly. by 2.000. Referring to the table on page 93. the number of applicants taking medical college admission tests in 195253 was 14.744. The number taking such tests in 196263 was 15.435. and the total number of applicants has decreased since 195253. So if what we find in the explanation on pages 93 and 94 of the hearings is correctand I think we must accept it as correctthe number of students applying for admission to medical schools has risen substantially. As the Senator from Colorado knows. the University of Colorado has a reciprocal agreement with other colleges in the Rocky Mountain area which requires the very highest of grades.

The number of firstyear medical students has risen from 7.177. in 1950. to 8.298. in 1960. to 8.642. in 1962. The number of medical school graduates has increased from 6.135. in 1950. to 6.994. in 1960. to 7.324. in 1962. More firstyear licenses are being issued. There were 6.002 in 1950. and 8.005 in 1962. Last year. the physician population was increased by 4.500 based on the number of licentiates. minus the number of deaths. In 1950. the increase was only 2.208. This shows that the number of physicians is growing. while the ratio of patients to doctors is diminishing. largely because there is a slightly declining birth rate in this country. If this continues through 1970. we shall have 207.500 doctors. which would actually mean 147.8 physicians per 100.000 people. So that is a very favorable ratio.",

I cannot understand how any Senator can say more doctors are not needed in America or that it is not necessary to expand the graduate facilities. I recall that one of the first responsibilities assigned to me in 1951. when I first came to the Senatein December 1950and became a member of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. was to be in charge. on the floor. of the bill which had to do with grants in order to expand the graduate facilities. I need not tell the Senate what happened to that bill. It was very vigorously opposed by the American Medical Association. As a result. the bill was recommitted. and that is about where it has stood until this proposed legislation has come before us. I know from my own experience that we have had to recommend to young men who wish to become doctors that they study in medical schools in countries to which we are giving foreign aid. because in their own country there was no place for them to study. If any Senator wishes me to document that fact. I can document it in detail. Today. a very good amendment was proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire. It is regrettable that. because of the timing. we could not accept it. Much of the trouble in the rural communities arises from the lack of a sufficient number of doctors. The medical profession is not competitive enough. That is one of the causes that plagues our society today. I hope that the bill will pass. I strongly support H.R. 12. the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963. I urge my colleagues to give it the same overwhelming and bipartisan support it received from the Labor and Public Welfare Committee of this Senate. The legislation before us is part of the Presidents health program and its enactment is absolutely essential if we are to keep faith with our people in securing for them an adequate recruitment of trained health personnel.",

On the other hand. the private organizations which would ordinarily provide the funds for such an investment cannot by -themselves afford the outlay. Therefore. it is both appropriate and necessary that the agent of the peoplethe Federal Governmentprovide the requisite financial resources for this program. the purpose of which is to benefit the people. I will give a specific example. from my own State. A medical school is badly needed in San Antonio. which is the 17th -largest city in America. It is in the southern part of our State. There are 11/2 million Spanishspeaking people there. The people of San Antonio voted for a $5 million bond issue to build a new medical school. The Legislature of the State of Texas has already appropriated $6 million more. in cash. this year. to add to the amount available. We have heard that it requires about $20 to $25 million to build a medical school. The bill under consideration would provide either a 5050. or a twothirds. or a threefourths matching. For a conventional medical school it would be a 5050 matching. That would provide $11 million more. under the terms of the bill. to reach the $22 million necessary to build the medical school at San Antonio. It takes the combined unified help of all three governmentscity. State. and Federalworking together. to build a modern medical school for the needs of modern medical teaching and research.

I often wonder what will happen to this country someday. wondering if it will be under Communist rule or if it will be able to preserve its freedom. This problem really bothers me. sir. and I would be grateful if you would help me settle my problem. I reacted to this letter as any of you would. It really touched me that a boy of 14 is so worried about his countrys future he would sit down and write his Congressman. But then the next reaction was. what has created this fear that the United States might lose this ideological battle with communism? The only conclusion I could come to is. from where this young man stands. communism seems to be winning. Where is the pride and confidence which has historically provided the strength to keep America free? It is certainly not between the lines of this letter. And this is not the isolated concern of one student from Titusville. Fla. His words are occurring with great frequency in the voice of the next generation. His fears are a challenge to our leaders in this coldwar struggle. His concern is a warning to all of us who smugly take our freedom for granted. This 14yearold boy is concerned. and if we do not start acting like we are in this battle to win. his concern will slowly erode to complacency and cynicism. In answering this young mans letter I expressed confidence that we would preserve our freedom as long as we realize it could be lost.

Unfortunately. the people of Estonia. held in bondage by the Soviet Union. are not free to commemorate this day. In the free world. however. the people of Estonian origin and all others interested in restoring freedom to the oppressed citizens of communism are commemorating this day in most appropriate fashion. Since we. as a nation. continue to support the principle of selfdetermination of peoples. we should give the observance of Estonian Independence Day special prominence. If the people of that country had their choice they would not remain within the prison that is the U.S.S.R. On this day. in paying tribute to the brave people of Estonia and to the 46th anniversary of their independence. the people of Estonia and their supporters throughout the free world renew their pledge to work for the day when freedom can be restored to all peoples behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is surely appropriate that we pause a moment in our busy schedule to remember the plight of the oppressed Estonlan people. On their 46th independence day anniversary. Estonians are laboring under the same tyranny which the Soviet Union promises to bring the whole world. On the other hand. Americans do not speak often enough themselves about what they hope to bring the world. We must not accept our freedom as only our own right. Freedom is the right of every human being. and the great struggle presently encompassing the world is the manifestation of mans determination to throw off the last vestiges of suppression. Estonias tragic struggle against unconquerable odds in 1940 was a bitter end to 22 years of freedom. which brought Estonia to world prominence as a prosperous. progressive nation. Now it is a satellite of the Russian people. exploited and suppressed. How clear a warning its end is for other new small nations. Estonias misfortune has resulted in a great treasure for the United States. because we received many Estonian leaders. But we would be happy to have seen them return to a free Estonia. We would be less fortunate. but Estonia would be infinitely more fortunate. Let us wish Estonians everywhere success and happiness on their independence day. Despite the tragedy of Soviet imperialism. Estonia is not forgotten. If free people have their way. Estonia will rise again. stronger and more brilliant than before.",

It is not unusual to have a carryover of funds in programs such as this. and this carryover should not be deducted -from the new appropriation.

The potential carryover this year is about $525 million at the absolute outside. and most of this is in noyear funds which have already been appropriated and do not need reappropriation. The total economic aid carryover for AID is about $315 million. and the fact that this money is available now is one indication that AID did not spend its funds rashly in a rush to commit them for fear of losing them. It should be clear that carryovers are not unusual and that. indeed. the President takes them into consideration in asking for new obligational authority. The President w11 need this carryover to add to the $3.6 billion in new appropriations if he is to have an aid program strong enough to support U.S. foreign policy around the world.",

Obviously. no structurally standard building which meets the requirements of the Districts building. zoning. and housing codes and regulations should be included for purposes of qualifying an urban renewal project area. Mr. Mallon showed that nearly half of the 320 structures included in the AdamsMorgan urban renewal project for this purpose were structurally sound buildings. Far from qualifying as an urban renewal project area. an objective study probably would have shown less than 10 percent of slum and blighted conditions. instead of 21.7 percent. in 1959. Conditions have -vastly improved in the AdamsMorgan project area since that time. The manual of the Federal Urban Renewal Administration. part 1. chapter 1. states that \"the legal eligibility of a project area must be determined in the light of State and local legal requirements.\" but this directive was blandly ignored by the National Capital Planning Commission and the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency officials. The District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agencys Executive Director. Phil A. Doyle. told the House District Subcommittee that: We proceeded on the basis of modified standards recommended by the Committee on the Hygiene of Housing of the American Public.Health Association. hereafter referred to as APHA. in its publication \"An Appraisal Method for Measuring the Quality of Housing.\" Now these standards are not part of the requirements of the government of the District of Columbias housing code. and so were completely unknown to District property owners willing to comply with the law. The question. therefore. arises: in what ways has the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency satisfied the Federal Urban Renewal Administrations Manual requirement that \"the legal eligibility of a project area.\" such as the AdamsMorgan urban renewal project area. \"must be determined in the light of State and local legal requirements\"?

My purpose is not to single out these editorials to the omission and possible neglect or exclusion of others equally well written.

Under present law a large number of employees of the social. athletic. and sporting clubs of the United States are not receiving retirement protection from their employers primarily because of the particularly oppressive impact of the excise tax on club dues. \ufffd The clubs of this country employ over 310.000 people with an annual payroll of $750 million. They pay over $214 million in taxes each year. of which the Federal excise tax on club dues exceeds $70 million. This club dues tax is exacted at the extremely high rate of 20 percent. The only other items subject to a 20percent rate are admissions to dog and horse races. Moreover. under the present statute. this 20percent tax is imposed on all amounts paid to the clubs by their membersexcept those for capital construction or improvementsregardless of the purpose for which such payments are made. The harsh manner in which the present statute operates discourages club members from making contributions for the establishment of retirement plans for the clubs employees. In other words. unlike the normal employer who gets a tax deduction for the contributions he makes to an employee pension trust. the club member not only gets no deduction but must pay an additional 20 percent on any such contribution. He is thus severely penalized for making a payment which he knows will be used only for the benefit of the clubs employees. It is most inequitable that the retirement needs of such a large segment of the working population as that represented by the employees of the club industry are being neglected whereas persons performing identical work for employers who obtain a tax deduction are being afforded protection. In 1962 Congress enacted the SelfEmployed Individuals Tax Retirement Act in an effort to alleviate a similar unfairness which existed between employees and selfemployed persons. The bill I am introducing would be a real step toward providing more equitable treatment among groups of similarly situated employees.",

I think they should be allowed. in the normal way. to resolve those questions or issues. which are greatly different from the main issues. Second. like the Senator from Kentucky. I am taking on faith the statement I have heard on all sides that there is no reason why the parties to the dispute cannot solve these problems in the normal way of collective bargaining. There are always problems. but they can be solved by collective bargaining. So I take such statements on faith. Some person. do not agree with that view. However. I join the Senator from Kentucky in the view that the parties cannot expect the same kind of treatment from Congress if they do not bargain collectively in good faith. The issues that are before the Senate now can be resolved quickly in come cases. The two main issues are the knotty ones. and I can understand the problem Involved in them.",

I submit to the Senator from Wyoming that this is a good modification. and that it will make even more effective what we are trying to do. I do not believe the President will be unaware of what is taking place. In fact. I imagine that the National Mediation Board will enter into the situation. and that is what gave me the idea for this modification.

This means. to me. that the National Mediation Board will be in this picture. whether we like it or not. and that if nothing takes place after 150 days. the President can then certify to Congress the status of the other issues. so Congress will know how far it may have to go. and will have 30 days in which to legislate wisely.",

I did not suggest that the Senate divest itself of its responsibilities and place them upon him. I thoroughly agree with the Senator from Connecticut regarding the Senates responsibility. What I suggested is that the President. as the leader of our country. help us to obtain passage of the civil rights bill by exposing the misrepresentations about the bill. There have been many misrepresentations which the public. in my judgment. have apparently accepted. If the Senator from Connecticut quarrels with me on that. that is his privilege. and I could be wrong. although I believe that I am right. And before we are through with the debate. if we expect to exert a massive effort to enact the civil rights bill.

After all. Governor Wallace told the people of Maryland. for example. that \"a Federal inspector will tell you whom to hire.\" The law will be administered by the executive branch. and not by Congress.

In my memory in the field of politics. which goes back to 1933and it has been an active political lifeI do not recall a single issue facing the Nation which has been as fully reported by the press of the United States as the civil rights bill. The press of the United States has devoted page after page. day in and day out. to what is in the bill. The television networks have opened up their nationwide facilities to let men of the North as well as men of the South discuss it. Many analyses have been made. and many magazine articles have been written. The fact that people are against the civil rights bill. in many instances. does not mean that the press has failed. or that the President has failed. It is a fact that there are people in this country who are against civil rights. I believe that we would be better off if we acknowledged that fact. Not everyone supports this bill. but the Senator from New York supports it strongly. the Senator from Minnesota supports it strongly. and I support it strongly. and we do so because we believe it is necessary for the United States of America. The President of the United States has gone up and down this land to explain the bill and its purposes. His predecessor did likewise. so there is no question of lack of communication. The point I wish to make is this: I believe that one of the great tragedies in the civil rights debate is the impression which has been created that once the bill is passed. we shall have solved the problems of the civil rights issues.

This is our duty to achieve and our duty to accomplish.

I have said time and time again that what bothers me most is that people can always see problems 1.500 miles away. In the cities of the North. including the one I come from. mass meetings are held concerning the problems in Mississippi and Alabama. and yet those very same people who complain of what is happening in Mississippi and Alabama refuse to walk six blocks from where they live to straighten out their own problems around the corner. The problems are northern problems as well as southern problems. It will require a great deal of effort on the part of northern Senators and northern Governors. as well as southern Senators and southern Governors. to help solve the problems. What I am pleading for Is a realistic appraisal of one of the great social and economic issues which face this Nation. This is only the beginning. In the days ahead. after the bill has been enacted Into law. every responsible man in public office will have a Job to do. It Is the approach of President Lyndon B.

The State of Israel sprang full grown from the sands of Palestine. already populated by patriots old in the ways of government and politics. From its birth in 1948. Israel has grown and prospered in a most unprecedented manner. Its population has tripled in those 16 years. and its gross national product has multiplied untold times from its initial tiny base. Never in the history of nations have we seen such a fantastic success story. Not only has U.S. technical assistance long since been withdrawn as unnecessary. but Israel has for several years now taken up the burden of foreign aid on her own youthful shoulders. There is scarcely a nation in Africa where the blue and white flag does not flutter over some technical project intrinsic to economic development. Today Israel is beset by new problems. but these are the problems of an established nation. not a rump group of hardy pioneers seeking to establish and sustain a national entity. The war has been won. the immigrants absorbed. the economy launched. the desert watered. and a true democracy assured. The social. economic. political. and international questions facing this democracy today must seem a luxury compared with the matters of life and death which had to be overcome in the early years of independence. That these life and death matters were overcome is the ultimate tribute to the leaders and people of that land. It is a great pleasure each May to note the astounding progress that Israel has made in the prior year. It goes on year after year. without fail. In Israel a year is sufficient time for the building of a whole new city. the founding of a new industry. or the reclamation qf vast areas of desert. Their time scale seems wholly different from ourswe move in slow motion by comparison. And so today I am once again delighted to salute our dedicated and energetic friends at the far end of the Mediterranean. They have my profound respect and my warmest personal regards. I congratulate Israel on this memorable occasion. and I shall be waiting to see what new wonders she will accomplish by this time next year.",

It is to be hoped that the great majority of Americans will not. repeat. will not get over their shock at the size of the budget without importuning their legislative representatives in Washington to apply some sharp cuts in the nondefense spending area.

The spectacle of the Agriculture Department. with its warehouses groaning with surplus commodities. spending $7 billion a year and still producing lower general farm incomes. telling solvent States like Nebraska and South Dakota how to handle their tax money. borders on the fantastic. Who asked for this survey in Nebraska. Iowa. Kansas. Montana. North Dakota. South Dakota. and Colorado? My colleague. Representative RALPH BEERMANN. Republican. of Nebraska. commented: Washington bureaucrats have shown no great talent for managing the Federal finances. The economic planners in Washington at this time have the United States in A836 the position of paying $1 million an hour in interest alone on the national debt. Senator PETER DOMINICK said: The political organization of top Democrats believes its members should run the country because they think the American people are too stupid to do it. and they make no bones telling you this.

No longer will a college student be confident that his application for temporary summer employment will be considered in good faith or that he will be selected on the basis of merit. But rather. the student employment program is being turned into a farce. a sham. and a mockery. in outright violation of all the safeguards and protections that were intended to be afforded to Government employees and job seekers from the spoils system of the past. Henceforth. it becomes apparent that these summer jobs will be doled out as political plums. based not on ability. need. or deservedness. but instead. simply on the basis of who can supply the best political endorsements to satisfy some political hack in the White House as to how many Democratic votes he can deliver and how many big wheels in the Democratic Party can vouch for him. Mr. Speaker. I am terribly shocked at the temerity of the White House in taking this action and exercising dictatorial control over a substantial segment of the civil service system. and substituting therefor. a patronage system for more than 10.000 student summer jobs with the ederal Government.

For it was in 1918 that Lithuania shook off 120 years of czarist rule and became free. Hers has been a history of struggle. The light of freedom has temporarily dimmed for Lithuania under the grinding heel of Communist Russia. We who enjoy freedom join Lithuania in her fight for freedom. We hold resolute the faith that the joys of freedom will again .return to that land. I bring to the attention of the House a booklet issued by UNESCO. an internationally operated organization which continually attacks the United States while drawing 30 percent of its financial lifeline from our Treasury. This organization has distributed a booklet prepared by two Communists. The booklet claims that Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania joined the Communist A839 Feb ruary 21 world of their own free will. Anyone who knows these people. their fierce pride of homeland. their respect and longing for liberty knows that this is a heartless travesty. Our United Nations delegation undermines the cause of free Lithuania by its inaction in not stopping UNESCO from publishing and distributing this vicious untruth about these Baltic nations. Through years of Russian and German occupancy. Lithuania has risen from the ashes of oppression with renewed vigor. Let us take a moment as we cherish the memory of a man who did much to bring freedom to us. to express our sympathy and offer our moral and spiritual assistance to these brave people who want simply to live their lives in freedom.

Mr. Waters said. and I quote: We believe in all of our economic assistance programs we should first seek to achieve our objectives through the private enterprise system before undertaking direct governmental actionand cooperatives are an integral part of our free enterprise system. We want to work through such nongovernmental private organizations wherever possible. In fact. in my opinion. wed be better off keeping Government out of any services cooperatives can perform through the private sectorin our food programs as well as in our technical assistance programs. domestically as well as internationally. rve always felt that cooperatives should occupy a more significant role in our entire foodforpeace program. as nongovernmental grain merchandisers who can help build future markets for the private sector rather than favoring a growing pattern of state trading. Mr. President. one of the great cooperatives in the countryin the worldis the Farmers Union Grain Terminal Association.

The presence of Secretary Rusk at the GTA meeting indicates our Governments recognition that agriculture is important not simply for the food and fiber it produces for our own people. but also as a force in our international life for strength and peace. Secretary Rusk said to his farmer audience: The abundance of food and fiber you produce is a powerful element in our national strength. It is a powerful asset in the defense of our national interests and national life. and in promoting peace and freedom throughout the world. While the Soviet world strains under agricultural crop failure and new emphasis on chemical and fertilizer needs for agriculture. the American farmer continues to produce an abundance of food and fiber representing real wealth and real power.

The bill was designed for situations where there is a demand for labor. but in which prior training or a specific skill is a substantial prerequisite for employment in the given Job. It is not intended to cover industries. such as the garment and apparel industry. where minimal training is needed. where traditionally the employer has provided the necessary onthejob training. and where there exist a substantial number of experienced and able workers who are presently unemployed. As I understand it. we do not intend to give a competitive advantage to one employer over another by having the Manpower Development and Training Act pay costs which usually and traditionally the employer has assumed. nor do we intend hereby merely to transfer unemployment from one area to another. We do not expect use of the Manpower Development and Training Act training programs in highly mobile. highly competitive industries where minimal employee training is needed and now Is undertaken by the employer. I feel that Manpower Development and Training Act assistance in such cases would only add to industrial dislocation. It would be a waste of manpower resources. and in the long run would serve only to discredit the Manpower Development and Training Act and detract from its value. Is my understanding correct?",

Mr. President. 26 million young people will enter the labor force in the 1960s. This great influx of jobseekers at a time when we still have heavy pockets of unemployment is a matter of concern to all. Right now the unemployment rate is 5.9 percent yet many jobs are unfilled because we lack the skilled people to fill them. In April of this year I urged the Senate to accept as a substitute for the Youth Conservation Corps an amendment which would alter the Manpower Development and Training Act and make the young unemployed eligible for training allowances. My proposal was defeated at that time. A few days later a Presidential Commission endorsed the same plan and subsequently it was made a part of the administration program. The bill before us incorporates the idea I offered once before on the Senate floor and which I also introduced as a bill. S. 1691.

For a number of years my alma mater. the University of Rochester. has carried out a program of cooperation with the University of Hull in Great Britain. Through exchanges of various kinds and other joint ventures. these two outstanding institutions of higher learning have helped to strengthen the bonds of friendship between these two Englishspeaking giants. - This summer an experimental program. combining study and travel in the United States by about 100 English men and women. was carried out under the auspices of the University of Rochester. A recent article in the New York Times underscores the smashing success of this project. I know from my conversations with people informed about this AngloAmerican effort that much time and effort went into its execution. I am confident. based on the reports that have reached me. that the rewards in terms of increased understanding and friendship will make all that hard work well worth it. It is with great pride that I salute the officials and just plain men in the street who help make this \"short course in Americana\" such a success.

The delegation that I referred tothe Citizens Committee for a Nuclear Test Banmet with President Kennedy and pledged their support of the treaty signed in Moscow on Monday. Ambassador James J. Wadsworth. former Ambassador to the United Nations under President Eisenhower and chief disarmament negotiator during the Eisenhower administration. acted as the principal spokesman for the group. I am sure that Senators know Ambassador Wadsworth as a most distinguished. able. patriotic.. and courageous American. He knows the Soviet Union. He knows the issues that must be considered by the Senate in debating the treaty. His public endorsement is of great significance. Ambassador Wadsworth conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union at one of the most critical periods of our history and was one of the pioneers in fashioning many of the provisions of the treaty which will be before the Senate today when the President submits it to the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Wadsworths statement to President Kennedy and a brief press release commenting on the meeting yesterday be printed at this point in my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. under leave to extend my remarks I wish to briefly comment on H.R. 2440. the authorization bill. to authorize $15.856.391.000 for the use of the Armed Forces for procurement. research. development. test. and evaluation of aircraft. missiles. and naval vessels. At the outset I wish to compliment both the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. and the ranking minority members. the gentleman from Illinois . for their able presentation of this highly important measure. I particularly pay high tribute to my distinguished friend from Illinois for the position he has taken with respect to accepting cuts in the overall defense budget. and the willingness of his committee in not being obstinate in refusal of those of us who are deeply concerned about spending. to scan our recommendations for the cutting of fat where and when we can find it. The spending or at least the authorization of such a tremendous amount of the taxpayers dollar places a real responsibility on each and every Member of this Congress. Most certainly I for one know we must do everything in our power to keep ourselves strong. And I do not wish to do anything to reduce our military capabilities or to hinder our national security. I am not convinced however that all the fat has been rendered from this procurement bill. I feel there are many areas where savings can be effected. While I shall support the measure as presented today. I reserve the right to do all in my power to make substantial savings. and am hopeful the Appropriations Committee will go over this bill with a fine tooth comb.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this country is experiencing the most farreaching merger movement in its history. Fed by vast accumulations of liquid resources building up in the vaults of big business. this merger movement poses a serious threat to the survival of our competitive freeenterprise system. For some time a joke has been circulating to the effect that General Motors is saving up to buy the Federal Government. In some ways. this is no joke at all. for General Motors holds cash and marketable securities of some $2 billion. or more than the assessed valuation of 18 of the 50 States. What is true of General Motors is true of many of our giant corporations. Favorably treated by tax adjustments designed to encourage investment in new plants and equipment. these giant corporations are taking another route. They are using their new savings to gobble up other companies through mergers and acquisitions. Too ftw people realize that this utilization of corporate funds frustrates Government efforts to stimulate investment activity and economic growth in two ways. First. it diverts corporate resources into mergers instead of the building of new plants and the development of new technical resources. Secondly. through the merger movement. economic concentration and oligopoly are increased. making our economic system less competitive and flexible. Indeed. the more monopoly or quasimonopoly there is in America the more rigid are prices and the less incentive there is for business to reduce prices to stimulate consumer demand and business activity. As a consequence. the Government has to step in to cut taxes and put purchasing power in the hands of consumers. to enhance demand and enable our giant industries to put unused capacity back to work. In short. the very big business elements that decry the growth of big government bring it on themselves by inhibiting the free enterprise system which should itself be doing the job of increasing consumer demand and expanding business activity.",

General Motors has just announced an anticipated $2 billion increase in expenditures for plants and equipment--over $900 million of which will be spent this year and $1 billion in 1965. In making this announcement. Mr. Donner. chairman of the board of General Motors. said: This will represent the largest total of capital expenditures that General Motors has ever made in any 2year period in its history---about 30 percent above what we spent In 1955 and 1956 when our last major expansion was underway. Another measure of the size of this program is that our average annual expenditures for plant and equipment in the next 2 years will be about double the annual average over the 6 years following 1956. The record program. he explained. is needed to keep pace with a grdWing market for the automotive industry. which is expected to reach average annual sales levels of at least 10 million new passenger cars and trucks in the United States and 13 million outside of the United States by 1970. These levels would represent increases of 15 percent in the United States and about 35 percent abroad over current markets. Mr. Donner said: These planned plant expenditures may be said to be a measure of the confidence of General Motors in the futureits own future In the automobile industrythe economic future of our countrythe even broader future represented by the potentialities for increased trade and investment among the free nations of the world. About 75 percent. or nearly $11/2 billion. of the $2 billion in capital expenditures is scheduled for the United States. of which approximately $700 million will be spent this year and $750 million in Oversea expenditures for plants and equipment will total nearly $400 million for the 2year period.

Kay Bohrer was very helpful to me in my first term as a freshman Congressman and did much to help me over the rough spots during my indoctrination and transition from a State legislator to a U.S. Representative. For her advice and understanding patience I shall always be grateful. After these many years of loyal and devoted public service she is certainly entitled to a wellearned rest.

The editorial follows: We have never been red hot editorial supporters of the New Frontiers ZIP code at the post office. We have gone along with the program to the extent of putting the ZIP code on most of the return addresses on envelopes we print in our shop. Since the start of the program we cannot remember a letter that came with our ZIP code. although/Wlot of mail we receive has the ZIP code of the sender on the return address. This would indicate the program isnt getting very far off the ground. People in the post office are a lot more concerned with where letters are going than where they came from. One of the postmasters with whom we have occasion to converse says people should get on the ball with this ZIP code business because the Post Office Department is going to put in machines that will sort the mail according to the ZIP code. It takes a lot of faith to believe somebody Is going to build a machine that can read addresses. People dont make the pattern of their numbers standard enough to make a machine take the same action for each number even if by some mysterious electric A1502 eye. impulses could be gained from marks on paper. In fact. It appears such a machine hasnt even been invented yet. We read in one of the trade publications that the Post Office Department has just let one contract for a million bucks and one for $2 million to separate outfits that are supposed to come up with a ZIP code reading machine. It is easy to see we are advancing. In the early days Thomas Edison invented the telephone before anybody even thought about telephone numbers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Armenian people had become victims and martyrs throughout. their long and eventful history. During centuries of their subjection to Turkish rule in their homeland they suffered much and sometimes put up with inhuman treatment. including wholesale massacres. But the tragedy that was ushered in by the wholesale and unexplained arrests by Turkish authorities of some 1.000 prominent Armenians on April 24. 49 years ago. was the most appalling. On that day the cream of the Armenian community. clergymen. men of letters. teachers. merchants. and prominent men in all walks of life. were rounded up by the Turkish police. imprisoned and held incommunicado. then bundled off in small groups and under heavy guard deported to distant parts of the Ottoman Empire to be put to death there. Sad and stunning was this shocking event. even more tragic was what followed it. Gradually a largescale tragedy began to unfold itself which involved the fate of the entire Armenian community in Turkey. On a carefully and most secretly prepared plan. some 2 million Armenians of the country were uprooted from their homes in the spring and summer of 1915. Some of these met their death in massacres. others were starved to death. and still others died due to indescribable hardships. And by the end of fateful 1915. the Armenian community in Turkey had ceased to exist. it had vanished through the diabolical and inhuman machinations of the then Turkish Government. That is the awesome meaning of April 24 of 1915 to the Armenian people. and that is why its 49th anniversary is being observed as a day of mourning. as their Memorial Day. in all Armenian communities throughout the world. \"They Cannot Stand Alone\"-The Work of the Mennonite Central Committee",

More than 1.000 Armenians. good and honorable persons from all walks of life. were arrested and imprisoned by the Turkish Government. From the moment of their arrest they were held incommunicado. A few days later they were deported under heavy guard and then they were brutally executed. The arrest and execution of these Armenians proved to be the beginning of the end of Armenian communities in Turkey. The extermination of the Armenians and their communities was carried out so effectively. so ruthlessly. that by the end of that year all Armenians had been uprooted from their homes. Some were massacred. some were starved to death. the lucky- ones--only a few hundred thousand of themwere able to escape to neighboring Persia and Russian Caucasus. When the First World War came to an end. historic Armenian towns. the villages in which Armenians had lived from time immemorial. were dead towns and deserted villages. More than 1 million Armenians had lost their lives in this almost unprecedented human carnage. and those who had survived were on the verge of starvation. Such was the. cruel and cushing legacy of World War I to the Armenian people. Since that fateful April 24. Armenians everywhere observe the anniversary of that sad event as a national day of mourning. and pray for the blessed memory of the victims of Turkish genocide. On the observance of the 49th anniversary of that sad event. I join the Armenian people in their prayers. Washington Report",

CHAIRMAN: We are informed that on February 20. the U.S. Tariff Commission will consider copper for possible inclusion on the Presidents list of articles for consideration in trade agreement negotiations. Because copper is the leading mineral in the State of Montanas active mining industry. we wish to take this means of opposing any reduction on rates of duty on copper imports. We can find no justification for lowering the present duty on foreign copper. in fact. the original 4cent tax should be restored. based upon the statistical position of the industry. The domestic copper mining industry is at present at a disadvantage because of excessive production of high grade ores in Africa and South America. Should the tariff be lowered and the demand for domestic copper fall off. the domestic mines would be in severe economic difficulties. In addition. our foreign suppliers often enjoy cheaper water transportation and certain tax advantages. We wish to remind the Commission that copper tariffs are not and never have been .for the purpose of keeping out or penalizing foreign metal. but principally are to provide a balance of relative costs of those who supply world markets. Under present conditions. the excise of 1.7 cents per pound is too low to provide the necessary protection. therefore. we endorse the industrys request that the tariff be restored to 4 cents per pound. This would then put domestic mines on a competitive basis with foreign mines. In reviewing the tariff on copper. we ask that prime consideration be given to national security demands. We also urge that no recommendations be made which will be adverse to a healthy domestic copper mining industry operating under a reasonably balanced situation. Thank you for your consideration. and we ask that this letter be made a part of the printed proceedings of this hearing. With best personal wishes. we are. Sincerely yours.",

Occasionally in the limelight. more often in the background. Mr. Sorensen was a principal assistant in the design of the Presidents domestic policies. Because his thinking on most issues was close to the Presidents and because he was an expert at translating ideas and ideals into tangible policies. his work in the White House was of immense value to the Nation. After the assassination. Mr. Sorensen agreed to stay in the White House at the request of President Johnson. But now that the critical period of transition has been successfully passed. Mr. Sorensen is leaving the Government to write a book about President Kennedy. His qualifications for this task are unique. and I am sure that the product of his labors will be an enduring contribution to the historical literature of our times.

The reservoir of topflight scientific manpower upon which a nation may draw is obviously a matter of central concern. The Engineering Manpower Commission is a private body that has done excellent work in this field. Their 1963 report stated: In the face of growing need. the yearbyyear decline in engineering enrollments and graduations poses a severe threat to our Nations wholesome industrial and economic growth. as well as to its influence as a stabilizing force in the free world. I am pleased to note. Mr. President. that the National Science Foundation will devote the principal part of their effort. in the first year of implementing President Kennedys scientific manpower program. to the critical need for more graduate degree awards in engineering. We must increase not only the number of engineers working for government and industry. but also the number who will become teachers of engineering.

It cannot be brought about without a sincere. dynamic. and determined effort on the part of the Government. The recommendations of the bipartisan Commission. appointed by President Eisenhower. to recommend new industrial uses for farm surpluses. has never received sympathetic effort toward its implementation by the Washington bureaucracy. At another time I expect to speak at some length on the question of industrial uses. There is one other matter that I would like to mention in reference to farm prices and especially in reference to prices of cattle and hogs. Today the largest buyers of meat are our chain grocery stores. Their economic power exceeds the power of cattlemen. feeders. farmers generally. and the packing industry combined. I am reliably told that meat buyers for large chain grocery concerns approach packing companies. both large and small. and inform them how much they will pay for meat. The question is not asked. what is the sellers price. If the price offered by the chains does not appeal to the packer. the potential buyer merely walks out and the chainstore features something else as its leader in the retail business. This in turn. forces the packers to beat down the price to the farmers. ranchers. and feeders. or the business will be lost to imports or other protein products. What I have said about the power of chainstores in the buying market for meat has been reported to me. not by one or two sources. but by many sources over a period of many months. It is not a charge made by radical individuals or radical groups. It is an opinion held by many wellqualified conservative individuals who know the picture and have the interests of agriculture at heart. It might be well for the Congress to investigate the marketing of meat and the impact of the chainstores on the same. It would be interesting to know what the Department of Agriculture is doing about it. Thousands of our farm families would welcome such an investigation.",

Second. Vigorously oppose various pressure groups whose chief objectives are to secure for themselves certain advantages and emoluments which may be detrimental to the general welfare. Third. Insist on sound fiscal policies. knowing full well that failure to implement these could result in the destruction of everything Americans hold pre\ufffdcious and dear. including liberty itself. Fourth. Bitterly condemn any suggestion that the President should constantly seek more and more power for himself under the guise that this would be in the national interest. Fifth. Recognize that in todays world the luxury of isolationism which we as a nation enjoyed for many years is no longer possible. but fully comprehend that in formulating our relations with other nations the question must always be asked: Is this in the best interest of the United States of America?",

I would agree with the latter part of the Senators statement. namely. that there should be discussion of these matters. there should be consideration of the foreign policy of our country. and there should also be recognition as to where the responsibility for the conduct of our foreign policy lies. As for the Longshoremens Union being pilloried. I had not heard of that. this is the first indication I have had that anything of that sort was happening to the Longshoremens Union. As a matter of fact. it seems to me that I have heard more praise of the union than anything else. But let me point out the difficulty: If a Longshoremens Union or any other union can operate on this basis. what is there to prevent a businessmans union or a housewives union. or some other union from operating in the same way? Is a businessmans union or a housewives union to conduct the foreign policy of our country? The Constitution clearly states that the President of the United States is the one who has that responsibility. and the one who acts for him is the Secretary of State. Even Senators are circumscribed to some extent. because the power of the Senate in the field of foreign policy was set forth quite clearly in the Constitution. Although that power of the Senate has been broadened in recent years. it has been broadened. not because of what the Constitution states or does not state. but because of the fact that our country has become the worlds major power. and also because of the fact that. as the years pass. control of the purse strings is becoming more and more important in connection with foreign policy. So. Mr. President. although I would not wish to disagree with the statement the Senator from New York has just made.

I -believe -that voluntary organizations can do a great deal of good in support of an announced policy. The announced policy of our Government was not being wholeheartedly carried out by our Government.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. truly fantastic increases in scientific knowledge. in world population. and in the power of weapons of mass destruction are changing radically the old framework of our thinking. The philosophic assumptions underlying our democratic ideals and institutions are being challenged by great events as well as by men. It is. therefore. especially necessary for us to think deeply about democracy and particularly about our democracy. Just such profound consideration is being fostered in Milwaukee by means of a televised course in philosophy. centered on the understanding of our democratic ideals and institutions. This excellent program. which is coming into the homes of many citizens hitherto unconcerned with philosophy. is being conducted by Dr. Cornelius L. Golightly. professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. Professor Golightly has a remarkable breadth of experience as an educator. writer. and political and social leader. This wide experience and his erudition make this course an attractive opportunity for a large number of people to deepen their understanding of democracy. The course consists of eight halfhour informal television commentaries by Professor Golightly and two television panel discussions with other members of the University of Wisconsin faculty. The students study guide. which was prepared by Professor Golightly. is a handbook with background notes. commentaries. and pertinent questions for Americans to think about and talk about with their friends. Works to read include the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Thoreau. and Thomas Jefferson. who are primarily literary or political figures. of Thorstein Veblen. because his economic writings illustrate the influence of his philosophical studies. of Walter Llppmann. and of academic philosophers such as T. V. Smith and John Dewey. Dr. Golightlys course is one that commends itself to the attention of educational programers throughout the country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the ironies of postwar international developments is the contrast between the progressive liberation of colonial peoples by their European metropoles and the increasing subjection of the peoples in the Soviet empire. It is somewhat misleading to apply the label of \"colonialism\" to the Soviet form of expansion. Within the Soviet orbit there is a wide range from the fairly liberal and independentminded Poland to the completely subjugated national minorities within the U.S.S.R. The case of Lithuania and the two other Baltic countries certainly fits into the latter category. Their situation is all the more painful because of the brutal manner in which they were taken over by the Russians. There can be no denying that the methods of colonization during the 19th century and the early years of this century were often less than civilized. Nor can one refute that the motives of the European powers were frequently selfish ones of power rivalries. Yet in many cases there was a higher purposeone of bringing the benefits of Western civilization to backward people. of the \"white mans burden.\" The process of decolonization has been marked by the realization that this partronizing attitude is not the best way to promote the development of these areas. however much they can profitably learn from the more advanced Western countries. But the essential fact to recall is that the colonizing powers did not consider the peoples and territories which they took over as independent entities with recognized status and rights in the family of nations. These peoples and territories are now gradually earning this recognition as they free themselves and become nations. Against this background the perfidious Soviet takeover of Lithuania and the other Baltic republics during World War 11 is all the more distasteful. For the Soviets had signed a peace treaty with Lithuania in 1920. recognizing it as an independent nation and renouncing forever all rights of sovereignty. Yet in the early days of World War II the Kremlin imposed its will on the little republic and absorbed it into the U.S.S.R. The Soviets ruthless disregard of the rights of an independent nation is the lesson of the Lithuanian case. It is a bitter lesson for the Lithuanians. who on February 16 observed the 45th anniversary of their national independence day. Savings Became Almost Worthless",

I think these actions are improper. I think they are probably illegal. I have not researched to that extent. Certainly. they are not the ordinary practice of the Members of the House. and unless I am in error overwhelmingly. the Members of the House regard this as improper practice and something that they would not indulge in. I could not agree with the gentleman more. that the entire reputation of the Congress is at stake and the reputation of the House and of the Senate has been lowered in the eyes of the people because of these inaccurate and untrue remarks that have been made according to the press release. I do not know whether the statements actually were made. but if the press releases are accurate. and I know the gentleman has the press releases and read those accurately. but if the press releases are accurately reported. and I think they undoubtedly are. then I would say those are untrue statements. that this is not done by every Member of the House.

    "speech": "Member of Congress. House of Representatives. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR WHITENER: Thank you for your letter of January 21. in which you solicited my reaction to Congressman HAROLD D. COOLEYS cotton bill. I am in full agreement with the proposal of this bill H.R. 2000. While some of these foreign nations were in distress as a result of World War II. it was in order to assist them in every possible way to improve their economy. However. today when the \"poor have become rich\" and endanger our own economy. I feel it is time to change rules and regulations. I believe it is the Congress primary duty to look out for the welfare of its own Nation. European and Asiatic nations already have the advantages of considerable lower wages. and since we do not have adequate tariff protection it is hard to understand why we should further jeopardize our textile industry by giving an 81/2 cents cut per pound price concession on export cotton. Nobody minds to face competition as long as the basic principles are sound. That is the life (or spice) of business. But with two strikes against every batter. it is hard to win a game. I know that in order to maintain a reasonable export volume. foreign countries must earn American dollars to sustain their purchasing power for some of our products. But this should not be accomplished through the threat of sacrificing one of our own industries. As you know. textile employment has decreased very substantially. This was due to increased economics in our plants in order to meet foreign competition. In some cases mills liquidated as they could not operate profitably. I know that overproduction is bad. very bad. but why do we then encourage overproduction of cotton goods by selling staple at a lower price to foreign countries who in turn flood our market? Would it not be more advantageous to build mills with American money in foreign countries and then export the goods to the United States? And increase unemployment here. Did I write much and say little? If so. Im sorry. Respectfully yours.",

I am in favor of Mr. COOLEYS bill. but only because it prevents discrimination against domestic users of cotton. 2. It is purely a temporary and very expensive expedient because it obviously is intended to prolong a policy of \"high priced\" cotton to protect the \"little farmer.\" If there really are many of these left. surely the sensible thing is to protect only them and let cotton find a more realistic and competitive price level. 3. Although good. as a temporary expedient. the proposed bill. plus the high export and domestic subsidies. and the high loan for cotton will cost the Federal Government tremendous sums. If this bill could be geared to lower loan prices and lower export and domestic subsidies. starting now and possibly graduated downward year by year. we would really have begun a sensible solution. Cotton is losing ground to synthetics at a greatly accelerated -rate and the \"end is not yet.\" Surely In the long run cotton must stand on its merits. Where will the \"little farmer\" be then-? 4. I believe we simply must cut Government expenditures and that the Congress is the only hope of our country and of our children and -grandchildren. I believe we are about to start racing toward socialism. pure and simple. unless the awful cost of Government is reduced. Taxes are too high. yes. but Government spending is the cause. The end result is inflation and we shall all become \"wards of the state.\" losing our freedom in the process.

Early in life John Bell seemed marked for leadership. As a scholar and a prominent campus figure at the University of Texas. John Bell early made his mark. When I went to the Texas Legislature immediately following the war in 1947 John Bell. though a young man. was already a leader. a man among men. He was chairman of the powerful appropriations committee of the Texas House of Representatives. Major legislation already had borne the stamp of his authorship. Shortly thereafter he was elected a member of the Senate of the State of Texas. and it was perhaps there that he made his most brilliant and most lasting mark.. In every company in which fate had thrown him. John Bell seemed to stand out as a towering figure of strength. of wisdom. and of ability. In 1955 John Bell and I came to Congress together. He was a valued member of the Texas delegation. It was here that I came to know John Bell and his charming wife best and to appreciate their many outstanding qualities of friendship. of understanding. and the capacity of their great hearts. Mr. Speaker. words seem such fragile instruments to convey to his loved ones the sorrow that we feel at his passing. Perhaps it will serve to comfort his devoted wife.

John Bell was a descendant of an illustrious Texas pioneer family whose efforts helped in every single line of activitysocial. cultural. and economicin the very area that I represent and in which I was born. Bexar County. The Bell name is associated with the history and development of Bexar County. He represented the senatorial district and the congressional district. portions of which are adjacent to and surround Bexar County. As a result those of us living in Bexar County were aware of his contributions. his activities and his efforts exerted both on the State as well as the congressional legislative level. He contributed. for example. in the State Senate. some pieces of legislation that were intricate. difficult. He was a member of the most Important and powerful committees of the Texas State Senate.

So it is with a sincere feeling of sorrow and regret that I learn of the passing of John Bell at such a premature age. He was comparatively young at the time of his death.

Last year we passed a bill in this House setting up Federal aid and assistance to medical schools. If you will recall. that bill dealt with education. yet it was a bill brought to the House by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and not the Education Committee which normally handles educational matters. So that what we are doing here today is not without precedent. Nor is it without precedent for us to recognize that we are establishing certain responsibilities on local communities and States which are consistent with the U.S. Constitution. Rules have been laid down by the Supreme Court dealing with desegregation of schools consistent with the Federal Constitution. We are. therefore. imposing certain Federal responsibilities on local communities. It appears to me. in my humble judgment. that it is perfectly consistent for the Federal Government therefore to assume part of the cost of financing these added responsibilities imposed on the State and local agencies by the Federal Government. We in Chicago have encountered substantial additional costs in desegregating our public schools consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court orders. I believe the Federal Government should assume part of these additional costs since they involve Federal rights. I do not believe the local taxpayer should be compelled to assume the full burden of these additional costs. I believe my colleague from New York makes a very good point. I should like to associate myself with his remarks and point out that the committee obviously recognized here that there are considerable problems involved in desegregation. and rather than impose these problems completely on the local communities. which very often may not be able to afford these costs. the committee here recommends that the Federal Government assume part of that cost.

But there are those who by reason of their study of psychology. and I say this in partial response to the gentleman from Michigan. by reason of their study of sociology and by reason of their study of the relationships between people and their study of educational technique. may be able to render outstanding service in understanding conflicting situations or situations in which tensions develop.

I would suggest that not only the proponents on one side of a dispute which might have gone to violence. but also the proponents on the other side would be stigmatized by this. . We have had not only members of private organizations seeking to advance civil rights here. but we have had public officials on the other hand. I do not believe that by writing that limitation into this particular piece of legislation we make the task of the Commissioner easier. nor do we make any substantial contribution whatsoever to the problems at hand. This. I think. is the basic consideration here. In spite of the things that have been said about it. the main idea behind title IV of this bill is to be of some help. This Congress could. if it wished. simply impose the sanctions of this bill upon those school districts and other political subdivisions that are spoken about in this bill. and walk away.

The barbaric practices of antiquity have given way to the more efficient methods of the gas chamber. slave labor camp. and cattlecar deportation. It is the last technique in particular which the observance of Baltic Freedom Days on June 1416 brings to mind. for it was 22 years ago this week that the Soviets ruthlessly executed a mass deportation in the three conquered Republics of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. The goal of these mass deportations. along with mass arrests and exterminations. was the complete physical and spiritual destruction of these three small nations. The figures are staggering. During one night aloneJune 14about 10.000 Estonian men. women. and children were arrested and shipped in cattle cars to Siberia and northern Russia. From Latvia. 15.600 were transported to Siberia on June 1314. During the week of June 1421. Lithuania lost 34.260 souls to the remote areas of Siberia and the Arctic. The weeks total for the Baltic area was 59.860 deportees. What happened to these illfated people. Most of them died or went insane as a result of Soviet brutalities and inhuman living conditions. There were few survivors. but the testimony of some of these has documented one of historys most heinous crimes. It would be wrong to assume that these deportations are a thing of the past. to regard them as simply an excess of Stalinism. The mass deportation has continued throughout the postwar era to be an instrument of sovietization and coercion. The specific techniques have shifted from mass arrests and cattlecar shipments to the more subtle one of job and housing controls which force segments of the population to move from one area to another. These methods may be less offensive. but the hardship and disruption which they cause the Baltic peoples have not been lessened. Thus it is an illusion to believe that these peoples have any more freedom -under Khrushchevs socalled liberalized regime.. It Is well to be reminded of these hard facts of the cold war. lest we forget the human misery and suffering caused by Soviet imperialism. It is our fervent hope that the Baltic peoples will again be able to observe an occasion such as Baltic Freedom Days In their native land. A Peaceful. Prosperous Middle East",

Then the new law provides: \"That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this (law) shall not. in order to comply with the provisions of this (law). reduce the wage rate of any employee.\" Employees have been allowed plenty of time to adjust to the equal pay law. The provisions become effective in June 1964 for nonunion employers. Those operating under union agreements are permitted to work out the term of their contract provided it doesnt run beyond June 1965. Limited to those now protected by the wagehour law. the measure will cover some 8 million of the 24.500.000 women in the U.S. work force. Thats about a third. but it covers most of those in larger industrial establishments. The U.S. Labor Depirtment estimates that about 3.500.000 of the 8 million women are now working under union contracts. Most union contracts have abollahed pay differentials between men and women. Thus. the law mainly will help the 4.500.000 women not working under unionnegotiated agreements.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in this centennial year of West Virginia. my State is proud to recall the part It has played in the industrial development of our Nation. In a recent article. the Union Carbide Chemicals Co. describes how several of its important contributions to industry were pioneered by its workers in West Virginia. One of the first commercial ferroalloy plants in the country was established at Glen Ferris. W. Va.. in 1901. The new alloys developed in this plant helped to make possible the dynamic changes we have seen in the uses of stainless steelin the food handling industry. in building construction. laboratory equipment. and so forth. Another pioneering plant. in the field of petrochemicals. was started at Clendenin. W. Va.. in 1920. Petrochemical development is responsible for such modern marvels as permanent antifreeze. liquifled petroleum gas. vinyl resins. insecticides. and many others. As a salute to the industrial pioneers of West Virginia. I ask unanimous consent to have the article on the history of industrial chemicals in West Virginia printed in the Appendix of the RzcoRD.",

In answering this question for a contest sponsored by Newsday. two high school students have contributed winning essays for the month of April. Writing with significant insight and ability. Miss Pamela Gould and Mr. Richard Allen Watson. have each cited the moment they believe to be the greatest in American history. Miss Gould. a freshman at New Hyde Park Memorial High School. wrote thatOur country has a purpose: \"All men are created equal\"-and until the purpose is a reality. we cannot reach or even hope to reach our inherent greatness. But when the day comes when our purpose is a realityThen concluded Miss Gouldwe shall see \"Americas greatest moment.\" Mr. Watson. a senior at W. C. Mepham High School. in Bellmore. reviewed a series of singular events in the history of our country but wrote thatMere moments of high passion have not. and should not have been. the high points in our history. The greatest moment in any nations history comes when its governmental system reaches its fulfillment. when all the nations philosophical precepts are crystallized in a single act. Thus. the crowning point of a democracy is the act that gives it substancethe pulling of a lever in a voting machine or the casting of a ballot Into a box where all mens opinions are equally upheld. Certainly we have cause to be proud of the excellence demonstrated by the fine work of these two students who will be among tomorrows leaders. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks. the text of the two winning essays be printed in the Appendix to the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we have heard a number of varied comments on the merits and demerits of the ARA program. I think a significant revelation of fact has been made on the floor of this body during the verbal exchange. Very little reference was made to the basic intent of this legislationthe intent being to help areas help themselves. No one can find fault with this principle. 11owever. the derogatory remarks made have been directed primarily to the administration of the program itself. the politics involved. and the tendency to replace or compete with existing business enterprises in given communities. I believe most of the blame for breakdown of this program lies with the politicians themselves. In my district I have seen potential benefits of the program. I have seen good administration. but I have also seen complications arise as a result of the program. It appears to me the fundamental problem lies not in the principle involved. not with the dedicated public servants involved. but. more specifically. with the fact that duplications with other programs tend to conflict with one another. improper judgment in approving certain loans have resulted in unfair competition to existing businesses sometimes resulting in a shift of job opportunity and of tax base. rather than creation of new jobs and new tax base as was initially intended. I supported Mr. Boltons amendment because I believe it is designed to rectify existing discrepancies and strengthen the opportunity to help those areas actually in need of industrial and economic development. I supported Mr. Tafts amendment for the same reason. If these amendments do not pass. the program will continue in jeopardy. Liberty Lobby",

    "speech": "Mr. President. title VI is a very cumbersome title. It affects 50 or 60 different Federal departments and agencies. Furthermore. it provides for review according to the laws relating to the various departments and agencies having about 49 sets of procedures. A person practicing before such agencies must be familiar with all the procedures. instead of one procedure. Moreover. each agency or department has the power to cut off funds. The amendment is a very simple one. It strikes out all of title VI except section 601. It leaves standing the definition of discrimination. Whenever there is reason to believe that discrimination has been practiced. the amendment provides that the agency. instead of trying the case itself. shall refer the matter to the Attorney General. and the Attorney General may then conduct an investigation. and may bring suit to end the discrimination. The amendment provides that then the court may enter such order as it deems necessary to enter to prevent the discrimination from being practiced. Determination of the question of whether the alleged violation in fact is occurring shall be made by an impartial jury. upon application by a defendant. This question would be tried under a law written by Congress. not under a regulation made by any of the 50 or 60 departments. Furthermore the Government would have the burden of showing that the funds should be cut off. The question would be tried in the court. in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.

It leaves the definition of discrimination just as it is. It leaves the policy Just as it is. It provides that instead of having the laws made by 50. 60. or 70 departments or agencies. section 601 shall be the law. And. instead of having these departments or agencies act as courts. it provides that they shall transmit the matter to the Attorney General whenever they have reason to believe discrimination as described in section 601 is being practiced.

If the court finds that discrimination exists or Is about to occur. the court may enter a judgment to prevent it.

When it was first appointed. the then President of the United States. Dwight D. Eisenhower. undertook to appoint members of that Commission of every philosophy of government and every segment of thoughtthose who believed in States rights. those who believed in centralizing the power of government in Washington. those who believed that minority groups were entitled to special consideration. and those who believed that all Americans should be dealt with on equal terms. He appointed that Commission originally. but it has now wound upand as a member of the Democratic Party who has never scratched the Democratic ticket. I say with profound regretthat two Democratic Presidents have gone out of their way to appoint special pleaders. those of a definite school of thought. and those of a definite race on the Commission. where today those recommendations and those findings mean nothing from a factual standpoint. I listen to Senators on the floor of the Senate quoting the Civil Rights Commission as having decided so and so. Well. of course. they decided a certain way. They can make any findings necessary to a particular position. or to carry their point. because there is not a single member of the Commission today who has the slightest appreciation of our dual form of government. of the States within a Federal system. with the States having their rights and the United States having their limited powers spelled out in the Constitution. Today. all the members of that Commission believe that Federal power can be used in any possible way to achieve their ends. and to level all Americans to the same common denominator. whether it be from the standpoint of society. of social equality. of economic equality. or of any other issue which has been raised. Having seen this illustration of what has happened with the Civil Rights Commission. I apprehend that the Commission. which is proposed to be created by the bill. will in a relatively short period of time wind up just as biased. just as unbalanced. and just as prejudiced as we find the Civil Rights Commission to be today.",

It was not conceived to be a permanent body. But that is precisely what it has become. I agree that the Commission has not functioned in an objective manner. but that often it has proposed radical. impractical. and improvident solutions to human relations problems. A prime example was the proposal made to the late President to cut off all agency funds to the State of Mississippi. Of course the late President did not look with favor upon such a proposal. But virtually the same proposal s incorporated In the pending bill. It does not repose this responsibility in the President but places it on the shoulders of hundreds of anonymous agency heads. Thi. may be even worse. I have come to doubt that from the makeup of the Commission a balanced viewpoint is presented. It is for this reason that I should like to see title V of the bill amended to provide for only a 1year extension. instead of a 4year extension of the Commissions life. As a matter of fact. I believe the Commission has about run Its course insofar as its rendering service is concerned. I say further to the Senator from Georgia. in response to his reference to the laws which have been passed by New York and other States in the field of public accommodations and fair employment. that these laws have apparently not worked where they have been passed. If they have worked. why do the Senators from these same States join today in such an allout effort to see the Federal Government enact such an allembracive law? I believe the very fact that the laws have not been as efficacious as had been originally anticipated Is significant proof that a Federal law would not be efficacious and would be unwise. and should not be enacted.",

Many of these Senators. of course. are trying to cover up failures in their own States. and are appealing to the Federal Government to get into the picture. so that in running for reelection they can blame someone other than members of their own party for the failure in their own States of these socalled fair employment laws.",

The Senator from West Virginia believes that the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of literacy by Congress Is in reality the establishment of a voter qualification. I am sure that the distinguished Senator from Iowa would agree with me that any congressional power to enact a law must be traceable to a grant of such power in the Constitution of the United States. And I have just cited for the attention of the Senator article I. section 2. clause 1. of the Federal Constitution which says that electors of Members of the House of Representatives \"shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\" I have cited the 17th amendment. which provides that the electors of U.S. Senators \"shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\" I have also cited article II. section 1. clause 2. of the Constitution which deals with the appointment of presidential electors. That article says that they shall be appointed in such manner as each State legislature may direct. In these three places in the Federal Constitution there is clearly stated the prerogative of the States to establish the qualifications of electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures and. ipso facto. electors of Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The Senator from West Virginia would not draw a line anywhere.

Assuming now that we do not have the argument on constitutional grounds. and we are Just talking now about the practical application of a standard.

As long as we have a rebuttable presumption. that if the State of West Virginia feels aggrieved by such a line as the sixthgrade education. it certainly should be in a position to rebut the presumption that a person is literate by having a written examination which will leave it up to the provisions of title I. I venture to say that that is one answer to the question. Another answer is that if the State feels aggrieved by the fact that Congress has provided for a rebuttable presumption of literacy because someone has completed the sixth grade. the State has not been doing a good job of teaching literacy in the first six grades. Perhaps the State officials will \"get on the ball\" and start doing a job on education during the first six grades. That might be a rather salutary influence in that direction.

Like other Members who have introduced bills with respect to this matter. I have been very much disturbed about the effect upon the elections in the West of the earlier closing of the polls in the East. At the end of the primary election in California on June 2 of this yearan election in which I had some interestI actually sat in a television studio and observed the results. I could see the enormous impact on the millions of Americans which could result on the west coast and in the Mountain States as a result of receiving the actual reports. extrapolations. and forecasts which were announced at that particular time. Therefore. with the aid of Martin Eric Lowy. managing editor of the Yale Law Journal. I have developed this concept as a means by which I think this matter can best be handled. I believe there should be an official closing time at the polling places on election day. It should be a little later in the East. 11 p.m.. and somewhat earlier on the Pacific coastas early as 5 p.m. in the AlaskaHawaii area. This practice will give us some uniformity for the closing of the polls. It would balance out the whole situation in such a way as to avoid what I believe the modern electronic means have made a practical difficulty. There is no constitutional question about the power of Congress to establish a uniform closing time. Article XI. section 3 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \"determine the time of choosing the Electors\" for President and Vice President. In addition. article I. section 4 empowers the Congress to regulate the \"Times. Places. and Manner of holding\" elections for Senators and Representatives. and the Supreme Court has indicated that this provision may also be applicable to presidential elections.

I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to repeal the 10percent Federal excise tax on the sale of silverplated hollowware to purchasers who use these items in their business. This proposal should be considered on its own merits. distinct from the larger question of whether or not it is appropriate at this time to repeal or reduce some or all of the Federal retail excise taxes. I say this because it seems clear that the imposition of an excise tax on this category of sales. the sale of silverplated hollowware to purchasers who intend to use it in the regular course of their business. was not intended in the first place. These are not retail sales. as are other items listed in section 4001 of the Internal Revenue Code such as jewelry and sterling silver products. They are sales to hotels. schools. hospitals. and restaurants of essential food serving items. This silverplated hollowware is used to insure the adequate. proper. and sanitary serving of food in the respective establishments. not for resale.

On two occasions this year we were defeated in our efforts to repeal all of the retail excise taxes and although not happy with it I accept this judgment of the Congress. But the imposition of this tax on sales that are not in their nature retail is another matter and I think it is reasonable for me to ask Congress to correct this particular inequity.

The free world will miss him tremendously. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a brave soldier who defended his country in time of war fearlessly. wholeheartedly and voluntarily.

The energy. the faith and devotion that John Fitzgerald Kennedy put forth in this endeavor has reflected upon our Nation as a beacon light of freedom to influence the whole world in its fight for liberty.

I followed the course of the Kinzua project with careful interest since construction work began. I waited and waited in vain for the corps to complete negotiations for the property of the Senecas needed for the reservoir. I dont think the Pickering Treaty should have been arbitrarily abrogated by the United States but the courts have acted and a decision has been rendered. I find it difficult to see why this dam construction had to commence before the corps and the Nation could have come to terms. The Indians were given cruel and inhuman treatment. They saw their reservation being eaten away for the benefit of the corps. They saw the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. receive prompt and liberal payment for the removal and replacement of its rightsofway and rail beds. The Indians have not yet received one red cent for the loss of their holdings. They are fully aware that within 5 months the gates of the dam will be closed and their lands Will be flooded. They are anxious. and rightly so. about the payment for their land. I personally doubt if any group of nonIndians would have been as patient with the Government as the Indians have been. They know that funds have been made available to build the dam. pay the railroad company and nonIndiaR landholders. They know that the appropriation hearings are presently being held and that unless the amounts named in this bill can be authorized. the Appropriations Committee will be hard pressed to make rehabilitation funds available. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1794 faces a difficult course in the other body. A Corps of EngineersSeneca Nation compromise has been reached as set forth in this bill. It will cost Congress a sizable sum of money to meet its obligation to the Senecas. Time is running out on the Senecas. I am most hopeful that prompt and careful consideration be given to H.R. 1794. a bill which will prove to the Senecas that while we cannot heal the broken Pickering Treaty. we can to some degree make amends for our thoughtlessness.",

Uncle Sam is financing the construction of new and unneeded hotel space and at the same time stiffening regulations on existing and established hotels and motels. Imposition of minimum wage standards on this recreationdependent industry could be a serious financial blow to areas like New Hampshire that depend upon tourists and their patronage. Hotels and motels received a doublebarreled attack from the Federal Government last year. They lost substantial revenue because of changes in Federal tax regulations regarding business expense deductions. and at the same time. the Federal Government through ARA was financing competitive new motel and hotel operations in an industry that had an average occupancy rate of only 61 percent. ARA. for example. financed construction in 1963 of a $1.894.525 motor hotel in Detroit although the hotel occupancy rate in Detroit during 1962 was only 54 percent. While Federal policies are encouraging unemployment in the hotel business. proposals are now being made to extend Federal minimum wage standards to hotels and motels. General minimum wages could cripple the resort industry. where many employees are students receiving besides tips and wages. a free vacation. meals. and lodging. Certainly increased unemployment could be the result if resorts have to close because of the financial pressure put on them from the unwise establishment of minimum wages.

JAMES C. CLEVELAND. has received for his fine efforts to eliminate waste and discrimination in Government research activities. It is gratifying to place in the RECORD a resolution adopted on the part of the New Hampshire Optometric Association. in the course of its winter meeting. January 22. 1964: Whereas Congressman JAMES C. CLEVELAND. of New Hampshire. has displayed a great capability as a member of the House Select Committee on Government Research. and Whereas his concern for elimination of waste and discrimination in Government research activities will have inestimable value in future programs: Therefore be it Resolved. That the New Hampshire Optometric Association at its winter meeting. January 22. 1964. unanimously expressed its commendation and thanks to Mr. CLEVELAND for his overall interest in providing research in general and his particular interest in improving the climate for providing the best vision care for the American public by all disciplines.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently I received a letter from one of our constituents in regard to the socalled tax reduction bill which was passed by the House and I would like to quote two paragraphs from that letter: Thanks so much for the copy of H.R. 8363 on theproposed tax cut. You have gone out of your way to help me and it is greatly appreciated indeed. I have computed my own 1963 tax bill. as well as a number of other retired peoples for the same year. and find that in every instance. H.R. 8363 raises the tax. not reduces it. This sampling is a fair one and I think would be fairly close for the majority of the retired over 65. This seems to prove what I have contended all the time. that this socalled tax reduction bill is going to impose real hardship on all retired people and instead of giving any relief it will increase the tax take out of their meager income.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the Congress of the United States voted to build the Kinzua Dam within the Allegany Indian Reservation in New York and Pennsylvania it tore into shreds the first treaty this country ever made. It was a treaty made between the Seneca Nation and the United States. signed on behalf of George Washington November 11. 1794. This action was reexamined by Thomas Jefferson March 17. 1802. when he stated that these lands shall remain the property of the Seneca and Onandago Nations forever unless they shall voluntarily relinquish or dispose of them. But the treaty was broken and some twothirds or 20.000 acres of their best land taken to be flooded by this dam. The least we can do now is to compensate as adequately as possible these people who built their homes. educated their children and owe no man a penny. I would like to compliment our colleague. the gentleman from Florida. Representative JAMES HALEY. and his Subcommittee on Indian Affairs for the great interest they have taken in this matter. also the House leadership for bringing up H.R. 1794 at this time. Incidentally. a very appropriate number was assigned this legislation for it was in 1794 that the treaty was signed with the Seneca Nation. It is my hope that the bill will be speedily enacted and that the Appropriations Committee will follow through with the necessary funds so these truly wonderful people will have new homes in adequate time.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the cutoff by the Castro government of fresh water into the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay comes as no surprise. However. the action by the Communist dictator and the reaction by our Government demonstrates once again the need for a clarification of U.S. policy in regard to Cuba. Last summer I accepted an invitation from the Secretary of the Navy to join with other Members of the House in an inspection and briefing at our great naval base at Guantanamo Bay. My foremost impression at that time. and it is the same today. is that the United States must under no circumstances relinquish or leave or give up this excellent naval base. It is important to the security of this Nation as an ideal training station for our fleet. It is strategically located for protection of the Panama Canal. in fact. the sea routes to the Caribbean and Latin America. It is vital to the maintenance of American sea and air power. While we are concerned about the cutoff of the water supply at the moment. the Castro government. assisted by Soviet military troops and technicians in Cuba. could aim a greater blow at that vital base. On January 18. 1964. Radio Progreso broadcast from Havana a special message sent from Premier Khrushchev and Castro while the latter was in Moscow. The Soviet Premier was quoted as follows: We salute the peoples that fight for their liberation. those who are good fighters. and we wish them complete success in this fight * * * we salute the battle of the Cuban people for the liquidation of the Guantanamo military base * * * the soil of Guantanamo is Cuban soil and must be returned to Cuba. Mr. Speaker. we can expect new incidents in the Caribbean. Castro. with Soviet backing. will continue to flex his muscles and intimidate the United States until the administration displays the firmness and determination which Communists understand best.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is time that someone called President Johnsons attention to another approach to his \"help poverty\" program. where he has the opportunity to perform. Two thousand years ago our Lord Jesus Christ applied such reasoning to another ruler. as described in the Gospel according to St. Luke. beginning with the 18th verse: And a certain ruler asked him. saying. Good Master. what shall I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him. Why callest thou me good? none is good. save one. that is. God. Thou knowest the Commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother. And he said. All these have I kept from my youth up. Now when Jesus heard these things. he said unto him. Yet lacketh thou one thing: sell all that thou hast. and distribute unto the poor. and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come. follow me. And when he heard this. he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. If President Johnson should give away his millions to the poor it still wouldnt make much of a dent in poverty. But. if he did give away his considerable fortune to the poor. it would prove that he did sincerely mean his \"help poverty\" program: it would dispell the idea that he is currently delighted to help the poor by giving away other peoples money. \"Charity begins at home\" is a true proverb. It is true for those who give as well as for those who get.",

Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall refuses to recommend removal of these restrictions which could be accomplished by a stroke of the Presidents pen. Earlier this year I submitted for the RECORD correspondence I have had with Mr. Udall urgently requesting the dropping of the quotas (January 27. pages 11651166). Mr. Udall admits that the residual oil quotas impose \"moderate\" additional costs to the U.S. economy. We on the east coastfrom New England to Florida--do not share Secretary Udalls attitude of academic complacency that his restrictions on our muchneeded fuel supply is merely a \"moderate\" additional cost. It may be \"moderate\" to Mr. Udall. but it isnt moderate to the millions on millions of our people who every day have to pay higher costs for everything from electric lights to school taxes and hospital bills. Following on my continued efforts to get the President to abolish residual oil import restrictions. I met last week with J. Cordell Moore.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee today began hearings on various House measures. similar to my own in the Senate. dealing with cigarettes. particularly centering on the proposals of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare concerning cigarettes. disease. and education. My testimony before the House committee emphasized my view that Congress. either directly or by implication. should do nothing which would obstruct or impede the implementation of these agency programs. This morning the New York Times carried two items of special and timely significance to this issue. I was pleased to note that the editorial strongly supports the view that the Federal Government has the main responsibility to inform the public about the dangers in smoking. The editorial also wisely reminds the reader that following the expected promulgation by the FTC of the labeling requirement of cigarette packages. several other avenues of education remain open to the administration and should not be neglected. The news article reviews some of the issues raised at the current meeting of the house of delegates of the American Medical Association. Several of the State medical society delegations submitted resolutions urging that the AMA strengthen and clarify its stand on the hazards of cigarette smoking. One of the resolutions from the California delegation of the association expressed serious misgivings about the acceptance by the AMA of the $10 million from the tobacco interests to conduct research on the effects of cigarette smoking. My colleagues in the Senate will be interested to note that resolutions on smoking and health came from the delegations from California. Wisconsin. Florida. Texas. Illinois. New Jersey. Washington. Colorado. and Oregon. Mr. President. 2 weeks ago the Surgeon General. Luther L. Terry. addressed the National Conference on Smoking and Youth. He challenged the conference with this theme: If this generation of children and youth takes up smoking. as they assuredly will unless they are convinced otherwise. millions of them in later years will suffer needless illness and disability. and will die before their time. What an indictment of this generation of adults if it stands by and does nothing but mumble incantations about the necessity of more definitive research. I ask unanimous consent that the two articles from the New York Times and the text of the Surgeon Generals address be included in the RECORD.",

If a person mails a letter. he wants it delivered. The Department said that it needed $6 million more than the House allowed in order to haul the mail. We thought we would compromise those amounts. So we gave the Department $3 million more. We were satisfied that the estimate of 2.8 percent of increase in volume was a close estimate which could be greatly exceeded if we should have the kind of boom for the remainder of the present fiscal year that a great many people think we shall have. and which many people desire. So it is not a question of saving any money. It is largely a question of whether we shall appropriate now what is necessary to do the job or whether we shall imperil the operation of transportation and perhaps rush in a few months later with a supplemental appropriation bill to provide for the continued transportation of the mail.",

I regret that time has been limited and does not permit an adequate discussion of this tragic situation. However. it is a wellknown fact that during and since the Oxford crisis. the FBI. Department of Justice lawyers. and other Government lawenforcement officials have swarmed over Mississippi like locusts. Every alleged incident involving a white person and a Negro in Mississippi or other Southern States causes more FBI agents to be sent out to make an investigation. All it takes for an investigation to be touched off is for a telegram to be sent to Attorney General Robert Kennedy. charging some white person with violation of socalled civil rights. Such telegrams are immediately made available to the press and publicity is given the charges by every communications medium. and the FBI is sent to investigate. When it is determined that these muchpublicized charges are without foundation. neither the Attorney General nor the press makes any effort to furnish this information to the public and neither does the Department of Justice take steps to prosecute those who fabricated these charges. The recent unfortunate incident in Washington when a white policeman shot a fleeing felon is well known to all of you. Charges were made by certain groups that the white officer who killed the Negro did so without sufficient justification and. in substance. acted in an irresponsible manner. I would like to point out here that some responsible Negroes in Washington. as well as other respected citizens. took the side of the law in this incident. Although no direct charges were made that the white officer was guilty of a socalled civil rights violation. when he shot the Negro. that is what these irresponsible charges amounted to. Why did not the Attorney General launch a fullscale investigation of this incident? The answer appears to be that the incident occurred in the District of Columbia where no political mileage can be gotten from such an investigation. Had the same incident occurred In Mississippi or Alabama or any other southern State. General Kennedy would have immediately sent a small army of FBI agents and other of his representatives to investigate.",

I should like to read to the Committee of the Whole from the testimony at page 647 of the printed hearings: We hope that as a result of this activity the Peace Corps Idea which began in the United States would be adopted by most of the industrialized countries of the world and they would begin to enter into largescale programs to work overseas in underdeveloped countries. It is a part of our general policy to try to increase the contributions of other countries .to foreign assistance. This is the seed money from which we hope to get a very substantial contribution to oversea proposals in what we are vitally interested. As I say. contributions up to now are over $2 million in the first 2 months of operation. And by next year. at projected rates of growth. the value of the contributions of other countries should exceed $5 million. Now. I submit.

I have found in my limited experience that. in governmental -parlance. a provisional bureau usually means a permanent bureau. Furthermore. this proposal is an implied admission -that -the United Nations is failing. or has failed. as an effective international peace organization.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. sober second thought has emphasized the irresponsibility of the wholesale. acrosstheboard slashes which were made in the foreign aid bill through Republican leadership and almost unanimous Republican action. I made it clear during the discpssion of the Foreign Assistance Act that I made no claim that the foreign aid program was perfect in operation and execution. I have always conceded that there were broad areas in which improvement was necessary to maintain the required public and congressional support. On the other hand. I believe that certain parts of the program are essential to our national security and that we must necessarily bear with some waste and mismanagement in these sections where experimentation and improvisation are necessary. from the very nature of the shifting problems. One area where the wholesale slash was most regrettable was in the authorization for the Alliance for Progress. No one can maintain that the future of Latin America is not intimately tied with the security of the United States. yet. the reduction in funds for AID for the Alliance amounted to $150 million. This reduction would force a 30 percent acrosstheboard cutback in the entire Latin program. While the Alliance program has been slow in starting and was introduced with exaggerated claims. nevertheless. the fact remains that some solid advances are being made and it would be tragic not to give the administrators the benefit of the doubt in this area for a reasonable time to come. Incidentally. it is a strange commentary that those who are most vigorous in their criticism of Castro and most apprehensive about the danger of his influence spreading in Latin America are in the forefront of those who would deny funds to the Alliance for Progress which seeks to stimulate the private economic growth which would make Castrolike revolutions improbable. Along the line of these general thoughts. I should like to share with my colleagues an editorial which appeared in the Vision letter of August 27. 1963. The Vision letter is a normally temperate and informed commentary on Latin American affairs and the reasonable yet admonitory tone of this editorial is one that should be heeded:",

Because of the numerous complaints which have reached me on this subject. I contacted the National Bureau of Standards. U.S. Department of Commerce. I was advised that a technical investigation of the accuracy.of vehicle odometers was conducted by the Office of Weights and Measures. This was done at the request of the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the National Conference on Weights and Measures. I quote from the report dated Test results--odometer accuracy. The average error for all cars driven under city and highway conditions was plus 3.21 percent. The average error for all city runs was plus 3.50 percent. Conclusions. The test results indicated the average automobile odometer tested provided an overregistration error slightly greater than 3 percent under standard test conditions. Although this seems a rather low average error. when we multiply it by the many thousands of cars being driven on a rental basis throughout our Nation on _Any given day. the total figure can run into millions of dollars in a year. and these millions are paid by those who rent the cars. The fact that the bilking. of the public is not deliberate or done with fraudulent intent. has no bearing on the subject. In my opinion. the renting public should be protected against sucb overcharges. To show the seriousness of the complaints and the interest the problem has aroused.

P.R. I understand that this loan was made to the Howard Johnson Motor Lodges. Inc.. which. to my knowledge. is building motels all over the country presumably through private financing. Having visited Puerto Rico. I find it extremely difficult to classify it as a depressed area. Certainly thiire are sections of Puerto Rico which are depressed but there is a larger part that is the recipient of millions of dollars of investment in highrise hotel apartments and gambling casinos. This is another illustration of the foolishness of ARA. I find it hard to understand why the Area Redevelopment Administration would authorize this loan in view of the findings and admonitions of the House and Senate committees having jurisdiction over this bill. Why new hotels would be considered eligible in view of recent pronouncements by the committees is beyond me. I flew over Puerto Rico and I saw a great many opportunities for aiding the average Puerto Rican. If any money is to be spent on that island. it certainly should not be spent for the construction of new luxury motels and hotels. since my information convinces me that the banks are more than pleased to advance. particularly to an institution with the financial stability of Howard Johnson. adequate funds for these projects. The district that I represent. the First Congressional District of New Jersey. has a higher unemployment rate today than it has had in decades and yet it does not qualify for aid under ARA.

September 24. This improvement should prove a major asset for the people of this community and enable them to provide an adequate water supply for both domestic and industrial use. Albion is located in a socalled redevelopment area because of a substantial rate of unemployment. and this entitles this community to special Federal assistance under the area redevelopment program and the accelerated public works program. as well as the community facilities program.

There are convincing reasons for the Senate action in adopting each of these amendments and I support that action wholeheartedly. I also have been concerned for many years with the very real burden put on the main street store owner in every town around the country. and on the consumer. which is caused by the retailers excise tax on jewelry. furs. toilet preparations. and luggage. However. as much as I have been. and still am. in favor of removing or lessening this burdensome tax. I did not feel that now was the proper time to do it. particularly while this entire subject is undergoing hearings in the House Ways and Means Committee. There are very complex questions involved in this matter. and hundreds of millions of tax dollars are lost to our Government when we repeal longstanding provisions of the Tax Code. I believe the wiser course would be to wait until the facts have been thoroughly studied. Thorough study in both Houses produced the $11 billion tax cut earlier this year. and it was a balanced. equitable and workable bill when it was finally signed into law well over a year after it was introduced.

I congratulate my distinguished senior colleague for the victory he has won today by means of his amendment to repeal excise taxes on socalled luxury goods costing less than $100. The producers of such goods. many of whom are concentrated in our State. have labored all too long under the burden of taxes which have far outlived their purposenamely. the financing of the Korean war. Long ago. there should have been a comprehensive review of these taxes. but the executive branch has never taken sufficient initiative in the matter. Only recently. a beginning has been made in the long and arduous process of congressional review. We have already waited too long for such a review to take place. therefore we had no choice but to seize the initiative which was presented today and to take direct legislative action to remove the most burdensome of these taxes. The alternative presented to usnamely. the transfer of the retailers excise to the manufacturerwas totally unacceptable to manufacturers in our State. and would have resulted in little benefit to consumers. For these reasons. I was delighted to support and vote for the PastoreKeating amendment. and I congratulate my senior colleague for the initiative he has taken.",

Mr. Truman. who authored the successful Truman Doctrine in the dark days following World War II. rendered a service which preserved the freedom and political integrity of these two nations. If they would ask him to arbitrate a final settlement to the Cypriot problem. binding on both countries. they could extricate themselves from the highly explosive morass they presently are in.

President Johnson is. at this very moment. trying to resolve the Cyprus problem. in talks with the Prime Ministers of both Greece and Turkey. If he were to suggest Mr. Truman as the mediator.

    "speech": "Mr. President. once again the Congress is faced with a proposal to increase the temporary debt limit of the United States. this time to $324 billion. an increase of $9 billion from the currently applicable temporary debt limit of $315 billion. This proposal is occasioned by the deficit spending which Congress has authorized. In the current fiscal year in which the economy is operating at full pace. the deficit is estimated to be $8.8 billion and the current estimate of the deficit for the coming fiscal year is estimated at $5.8 billion. If experience is any teacher. both of these estimated deficits will prove to be less than the actual deficit. Time and time again Congress has been asked to temporarily increase the debt limit since I have been a Member of the Senate. On each occasion. I have opposed it. Congress. along with the executive branch. shares the responsibility for maintaining fiscal integrity. We shall never be successful in preventing an everincreasing national indebtedness unless we reject these continual requests for increases in the limit. This position may be a drastic one. but drastic steps are necessary to stem the tide of the extravagant spending which has been going on for years and which is threatening the security and wellbeing of our country. I shall oppose the proposed increase in the debt limit. and nothing would please me more than for the Senate to reject this proposal.",

In the past 75 years. this outstanding organization has compiled a remarkable record of service to the livestock industry and to Nebraska. In the threequarters of a century of its existence it has been led by men of vision and dedication. That tradition will be carried on in the coming year with the election of Forrest S.

Mr. President. to address the diamond jubilee convention. I had hoped to appear before the meeting in person. but the voting on the civil rights bill made this impossible. so my remarks were carried on a special teletalk circuit from Washington. In my address. I recalled that I had last spoken to the Stock Growers at their meeting in Norfolk. Nebr.. 3 years ago and that at that time. the stockmen had adopted a resolution which said. in part: We request the Congress to enact equitable and realistic legislation that will protect our industry against excessive imports of foreign meats and livestock. This is a reflection. Mr. President. of how closely attuned to the problems of the industry its leaders have been. They correctly saw. more than 3 years ago. the disastrous effects greatly increased imports would have on the cattle market. Mr. President. in the three decades or so that Government has intruded into the management and control of agriculture. the cattle industry has steadfastly resisted such encroachment and has consistently insisted on maintaining its position in the private sector of the economy. This principle was restated at the convention in Alliance. together with a number of other important resolutions. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the resolutions adopted by the convention.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the memory of Ukrainian freedom fighter. Taras Shevchenko. a statue will be unveiled in his honor Saturday. The unveiling ceremony will take place at 23d and P Streets NW.. where the statue is erected. Erection of the statue not only honors a patriot whose life symbolized opposition to tyranny. it is an additional symbol of U.S. concern for residents of the captive nations. Americans of Ukrainian descent are justly proud on this memorable occasion. The unveiling ceremonies will include a program in the Washington Coliseum. Two concerts of choruses with a symphony orchestra will also be presented in Constitution Hall on the same day and a banquet for 5.000 persons will be held in the National Guard Armory in Washington. D.C.. in the evening. A large delegation from Argentina and a huge crow] of CanadianUkrainians in chartered trains and buses are expected from Canada to take part in the Washington ceremonies. Shevchenkoa contemporary of Abraham Lincolnembodied in his poetry the \"holy ideas\" of Ukraine as did the American Declaration of Independence. and as the words of Washington. Jefferson. and Lincoln embody the highest principles of America. Shevchenko expressed the close tie between Ukraine and America over 100 years ago not only by calling for national independence but also for the coming to Ukraine of a Washington with \"his new and righteous law.\" Over 30.000 Americans of Ukrainian ancestry and their friends and over 10.000 schoolchildren have donated to the Shevchenko Memorial Fund to help insure erection of the monument. Recognizing the international importance of this event more than 150 prominent Americans have joined a national honorary or sponsoring committee for the unveiling. They include 33d President of the United States. Hon. Harry S. Truman. former Vice President. Hon. Richard M. Nixon. Governors of many States. presidents of universities and colleges. leaders of nationality groups. leading journalists. civic and church leaders. U.S. Senators and Representatives of both parties. The Shevchenko statue in the heart of Washington. our Nations Capital. symbolizes a long and lasting friendship between the people of Ukraine and the United States.

In America. where all people have the right of selfdetermination. it is appropriate that so many of our citizens retain such an active interest in their ethnic backgrounds and heritages. The LithuanianAmericans are among our finest. most publicspirited citizens. It is particularly fitting that they have chosen Washington. D.C.. as the site of their convention. for our Government continues to recognize the prewar Lithuanian Council. We have remained inflexible in our refusal to grant recogfnition to the Communist puppet regime which denies liberty to the people of Lithuania. By their presence in Washington. the Lithuanian American Congress reminds us once again that there are untold thousands in the world who are not free to convene together and who must endure governments which would deny to each man the right to his own thoughts and political beliefs. I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Lithuanian American Congress Convention to Washington and hope we can look forward to having them return to our Nations Capital soon again.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it gives me great pleasure to observe that this Saturday afternoon the statue of Taras Shevchenko. the great Ukrainian poet and patriot. will be unveiled here in Washington. As a member of the national committee sponsoring the memorial. I know how much it means to UkrainianAmericans. many of whom fled from the same Russian tyranny under which Shevchenko himself lived. Thousands of these people will be in Washington to attend the ceremonies surrounding the event. We welcome them to our city. This memorial has been erected not only because Taras Shevchenko was a great believer in democracy and freedom for the Ukraine. but because he sought selfdetermination for all of the slavonic peoples. His thoughts. expressed in beautiful Ukrainian poetry. were translated into many different tongues to inspire other suppressed groups in the Austrian and Ottoman Empires as well as in the Russian Empire. Thus. it is only right that we. the leader of the free and democratic world. should construct a memorial in our capital to this great freedom fighter who spent most of his years in subjugation either as a serf or political prisoner or under police surveillance. Yes. Taras Shevchenko knew the value of liberty. And so do many millions of his compatriots and Slavic brothers who today find themselves under Russian tyranny. This memorial is a reminder to us that these people. some of whom temporarily gained their independence and established their own republics. remain in a subjugated state. It is for us to proclaim this fact constantly to the world. I look forward to the unveiling of the statue of Taras Shevchenko and hope that when all who are here pass by it they will think of this great democrat and patriot and then remember the millions still living under foreign tyranny.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Saturday. June 27. thousands of UkrainianAmericans and their friends will gather here in Washington for the unveiling of a statue honoring Taras Shevchenko. the Ukraines outstanding poetpatriot. In this. the 150th anniversary year of Shevchenkos birth. and on the occasion of the unveiling of his memorial. I think that all Americans should pause and consider the contributions Taras Shevchenko made to human liberty and the great effect that our American move toward independende had on the Ukrainian struggle against serfdom and Russian colonialism. Shevchenko was the voice of the Ukrainian freedom movement and his views on freeing the serfs and establishing a Ukraine free from czarist domination were shaped by his knowledge of the American colonists success in the fight against English rule and the qualities of the early American patriots. This Influence is clearly shown in the lines of a Shevchenko poem which state: When will we receive our Washington With a new and righteous law? And receive him we will some day. Our revolution showed the way to Shevchenko and he spread freedoms word throughout the Ukraine. Because of his beliefs. the young poet. born a serf. spent most of his life in prisons and forced military service. Yet. he never stopped telling the story of liberty in his poems. books. and pictures. The erection of a monument to Taras Shevchenko in this city. the capital of the free world. is indeed fitting and proper for he belongs not only to the Ukraine. but to all freemen. As an apostle of liberty and an avowed enemy of oppression. his genius extended far beyond the limits of his native country. The dedicated citizens who have worked so hard to bring the Shevchenko memorial plan to fruition are to be commended for creating a permanent reminder of his contributions to all humanity.
