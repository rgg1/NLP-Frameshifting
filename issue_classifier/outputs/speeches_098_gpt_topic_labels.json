I was so deeply impressed. What a marvelous. marvelous human being he is. All of us recognize the extraordinary intelligence and the greatness of knowledge that Jake Javits has on every kind of a subject. But his testimony was really heroic. Here was a man barely able to talk. and he told us about the ravages of this disease. And he appealed to the appropriations subcommittee so eloquently. I will never forget it. It was as profound an experience as I have had since I have been in this body. I apologize to the leader for mentioning this. but I cannot resist pointing out that the real hero in my view of fighting for the Genocide Treaty was Jake Javits. Nobody worked harder for that. Nobody feels more deeply that we should ratify that convention. If we should ratify itand I am convinced that this administration will support itI think Senator Javits deserved the great bulk of the credit for our doing so.",

Anyones death diminishes us all. but the loss of a young person is especially humbling. David Kennedy. only 28 years old. reminds us of the promise of youth. That promise is fixed in our minds in Davids case by the memory of the vitality and energy of his father. who had such a zest for life. and a passion for trying to make a better world. How precious our days. how limited our time. and how indiscriminate is the hand of fate. We are forcefully reminded once again of the mortality of us all. Mr. President.

Emphasis must be placed on 1year savings in light of the usual 3year approach to deficit reduction. because of the historical tendency of Congress to load 3year plans with heavy future savings and optimistic economic assumptions which seldom materialize. The response of the financial markets to favorable action on this plan should be immediate and I believe dramatic. By sending a clear signal that we are ready to addressrather than finessedeficits. we can demonstrate the fiscal responsibility necessary to insure continued economic prosperity. Mr. President. the bipartisan 1year freeze proposal provides an ideal opportunity to not only address deficit reduction. but initiate more effective budget procedures. Our distinguished colleague from Delaware has introduced the Budget Reform Act of 1983. an excellent piece of legislation. The Budget Reform Act proposes procedural changes that will help rationalize the budget process. This act would establish a 2year budget cycle. where budget and appropriation activities are restricted to the first nonelection year of the 2year period. In addition. the act would establish more realistic budget and appropriation timeliness. allow Congress to address more nonbudgetary issues of national importance and provide for greater consideration toward more informed decisions. especially during the second year of that cycle when Congress would have what it desperately needsan opportunity for more significant oversight of current activities we have authorized in past years. and it would assist State and local governments in coping with uncertain and flexible Federal budget processes.

By designating today as Armenian Martyrs Day we honor the memory of those who suffered and died. We also call the attention of all Americans to this tragedy so that similar atrocities can be prevented in the future. At the beginning of World War I. about 21/2 million Armenians were living in the Ottoman Empire. In 1915. in the midst of the war. a desperate and disintegrating Ottoman Empire turned on its Armenian population. Armenians throughout the Ottoman Empire were deported on short notice. Men were usually separated from their families and murdered. The women. children. and elderly who remained were marched to the Syrian desert and constantly attacked by \"guards\" who were supposed to offer protection. Most of the deportees were massacred or died of starvation. disease. or exposure. Thus. the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire were virtually eliminated from their ancestral homeland through a carefully executed government plan of genocide. Today. fewer than 100.000 declared Armenians reside in Turkey. Unfortunately the world did not soon enough learn a lesson from the Armenian genocide and it became distressingly clear -that history does repeat itself when lessons are not learned from past tragedies. There have been too many acts of mans inhumanity to man during this century. Besides the slaughter of the Armenians. the 20th century has seen the Sovietinduced Ukrainian famine of 193233 which caused the starvation of 7 million Ukrainians. the Holocaust of the Jewish people in World War II. and the recent massacres in Cambodia. Eli Wiesel. a survivor of the concentration camp at Auschwitz. once said. \"Memory is our shield. our only shield.\" to protect mankind against a repetition of the slaughter.

I had the privilege of meeting Ansel Adams. His passing will leave a permanent void in the worlds of art and activism. his twin pursuits. For his devotees from both of those worlds. he leaves behind a legacy that will be honored. invoked. and built upon for years to come. Mr. Adams photographs are among the most admired and respected of any American photographer. past or present. He pioneered photographic techniques and a unique style that helped to transform photography from a novelty to an art form. Ansel Adams photographs of the American West not only changed photography. but also enormously expanded Americans knowledge of their country. Literally millions worldwide who would never travel to or experience otherwise the beauty of Californias Yosemite Valley. New Mexicos desert. and other wilderness areas. were permitted to do so through Mr. Adams photographs. Through Ansel Adams art and advocacy. there has come to be a wide awareness of and keen appreciation for the Western wilderness. That awareness. coupled with Ansel Adams environmental activism. brought about changes in the Governments attitude toward wilderness. In the 1930s. Mr. Adams packed up his photographs of Kings Canyon in California. came to Washington. and successfully lobbied Congress to make the area a national park. Up until the moment he died. Ansel Adams remained active in photography and conservation. He often wrote to me to offer counsel and constructive criticism on environmental issues. I valued his opinion. I only wish he could have lived long enough to see the resolution of the longstanding controversy over the California wilderness issue. I hope we will resolve this impasse very soon. and can perhaps in some way properly honor Mr. Adams memory in doing so. Ansel Adams will not be forgotten.

As I have said on previous occasions. this legislation is essential if the Federal Government is to continue its historical commitment of striving to provide a decent. safe. and sanitary home for all Americans. One provision in H.R. 1 which I would like to point out is the $100 million for shelter grantsa provision added by the committee amendment offered by Chairman GONZALEZ yesterday. I am very pleased that the House has accepted this provision. but I am disappointed that we needed to pass this provision again.

By attaching the shelter grant provision to H.R. 1. we will have a better chance of getting this critical program enacted into law. In my district the problems of the homeless are acute. Although a number of local governments and nonprofit organizations are attempting to provide shelter for such people. the resources are limited. The shelter grant program we have provided in H.R. 1 will augment these local efforts by providing localities with additional funds that they can leverage with private resources in order to better meet the shelter needs of homeless individuals and families. I thank my colleagues who voted in favor of H.R. 1 and hope we can quickly move this legislation to enactment.o",

I referred in my debate on the amendment yesterday to studies which have been conducted by HUD. by Nobel prize winning economists and editorials all over the country on the subject of rent control. No one. virtually no one. disagrees that rent control is a disincentive to the construction of rental housing. The problem of rental housing cannot be solved with federally subsidized funds. The problem is too great in those cities which need the capital to construct new rental housing units. Only the private sector can provide the necessary capital to do this in cities such as New York and Washington. D.C.. which are worst case situations. both cities with rent control. What my amendment says. Mr. Speaker. is that we will help you solve your problem. but you have got to help yourself. You cannot receive money under this new multifamily housing program if you impose rent controls on new private capital investment in rental housing projects. Incidentally. local rental controls would not apply to the Federal Government. The Secretary of HUD has the authority to fix the rent on Governmentassisted housing to provide a reasonable return on investment.

It is a fact that as a general proposition there are more rental housing units available in nonrent controlled cities than there are in rent controlled cities. My amendment would have no impact on present renters or on existing housing. It would apply only prospectively. and I want to make that clear. it would provide cities with a choice as to how they would approach local rent control practices. It does not force them to change existing law. It would eliminate a builtin bias that would reward rent control cities. As drafted. cities that would qualify or try to get funds from the multifamily housing program in this bill would benefit and those with the lowest vacancy rates are the rent control cities which would benefit.

It is vital that the House act promptly on this most important piece of legislation.

When President Reagan first proposed the CBI almost a yearandahalf ago. the urgent needs of the region required immediate action. Too much time has already passed without having approval of the entire CBI package. We must act with all deliberate speed toward getting the trade. investment. and tax provisions of this program in place. Our allies in the region look to us for help and seek an approach that will avoid the crisis affecting El Salvador. Only today. I have received information from the Congress in Honduras of their active interest and support for the Caribbean Basin Initiative and their hope that our Congress will act promptly to pass this bill. Earlier I learned of the strong support of Honduran free trade unions. especially the banana workers. For those Members who are concerned as well about the domestic impact the provisions of this bill might have should consider the even greater impact on the U.S. economy of not passing this legislation.

If some means is not found to provide hope for economic development for the future. then it will be virtually impossible to stem the tide of both political refugees and illegal immigrants into this country as a result of social. economic. and political unrest in the Caribbean and Central American region. I urge my colleagues to pass this rule so that we might move quickly to expedite consideration of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.",

Let us take close scrutiny at exactly what it is this rule would do. It is neither prudent. wise nor fair. It offers Members in this Chamber neither a choice nor a voice in meaningful regional policy discussions about the problems of our nations. allies and friends to the south. Many of us are interested in true economic development in that region and recognize it as the lynch pin around which any success. both of an economic. social. and indeed probably even of a military nature may occur. but the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Initiative do not encourage that economic development. Rejecting this rule and allowing us to at least offer responsible policy initiative alternatives. I think are in the best interests of this House. the Caribbean nations as a whole and perhaps even for public and foreign policy. We will offer local content protection. We will offer human rights protections. We will offer exclusions for export and import sensitive items. but most importantly. we will offer some hope to the millions of Americans who stand in unemployment lines all across this Nation. asking what it is that the Congress and the administration have done for them. Mr. Speaker. I come from a part of the country and from a family that told me that charity begins at home. With the legislation on the floor before us today under this closed rule we are not beginning with our charity at home. we are turning our backs on the American taxpayers and providing for the exporting of thousands of jobs. jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of Americans. We will not export prosperity. we will only import higher levels of unemployment.",

And I am going to be proposing an amendment in the nature of a substitute at the proper time to do just that. This is not my idea. This was the suggestion that was made. again. by Ralph Neas. the executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights at the subcommittee hearing on March 24. He says: The one major gap in assuring the independence of the agency is in the failure of Congress to provide fixed terms of office. as it does with regulatory agencies. Because the agency was viewed as temporary. no terms were specified. and the Commissioners have served at the pleasure of the President. Now. it seems to me that unless we address this issue here and now. we are going to go on for 5 years or 15 years or 20 years. or whatever comes out of this. without addressing the real fundamental problem. and that is that under the present law. the President can get rid of them all in one fell swoop. and the only way to address that problem is to provide for fixed terms of office on a staggered basis so that the terms of two commissioners expire every 2 years. Now. again. this is not my idea or the idea of the minority. This was the idea of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. as was the 15year extension. And I think it is really strange that the gentleman from Wisconsin has been fighting for what the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights told us to do in the hearing on March 24. and my friends from California and New Jersey and. regrettably. from Pennsylvania. have been going against everything Mr. Neas said.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from California . Historically. for 25 years. the U.S. Civil Rights Commission has not been the handmaiden of either political party. whether in or out of power. I think the gentlemans amendment will continue this tradition. Each President now has the opportunity to appoint new members to the Commission. Mandating fixed terms would politicize the period of time for which Commissioners serve. The long tradition of independence which has enabled Commissioners to speak without fear or favor when criticizing shortcomings or praising progress in the field of civil rights would be ended. Unlike most other Federal agencies. a majority of appointees may not by law be from a single party: they do not resign when administrations change. This unique character of the Commission stemmed from a recognition by Congress in 1957 that race discrimination was a deeply entrenched national problem that called for unusual and creative Government action. I believe that the Commissions record over the years has vindicated this judgment and has demonstrated why it cannot be a part of any administration. There is no need for further legislation simply because one administration disagrees with the current legislation and its legislative history. The Commission now operates independently because the inherent prohibition against Commission stacking is already law. The Commission has functioned smoothly and efficiently for 24 years: the questions of tenure have only been raised because the administration has attempted to circumvent the current process. The Nation today needs a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights with the unshackled ability to conduct its own factfinding and to speak its mind. about what should be done to make equal opportunity a living reality. I urge my colleagues to make sure that this need is met by voting against any effort to bring the Commission under the control of the executive branch.",

Mr. EDWARDS. to extend the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for 5 years and to provide that the President may only remove Commissioners for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. I commend my colleague for offering this important amendment to preserve the integrity and independence of the Civil Rights Commission. President Reagan recently fired three Civil Rights Commissioners because he did not like what they had to say. He did not want to hear that his policies were turning back the hands of time on the progress we have achieved in the area of civil rights. His chosen replacements are not an issuethey are fine candidates. The issue is the continued independence of the Commission. The Edwards amendment will simply make certain that the Commissions statements are unbiased and impartial observations of the status of civil rights in this Nation and not colored by the administrations political views. For 26 years. Hispanics. native Americans. and other minorities have looked to the Commission as the only independent. nonpartisan Government agency that works to protect their civil rights and to assure that they are afforded the same privileges as all Americans. I am hopeful the Commission will adhere to the language in the committee report on this bill and not only continue to take special notice of civil rights violations against Hispanics but to also incorporate Hispanic concerns in studies which more generally examine discrimination against women and minorities. Mr. Chairman. it may be disheartening to some in the White House that we have a long way to go before we reach the goal of equality under the law for every American. But this Nation will not realize its true potential for greatness until this goal is achieved. Without a strong. free. unbiased. and independent U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. I am not confident we can achieve our ultimate goal. Earlier this week. we voted to make Dr. Martin Luther Kings birthday a national holiday. With that vote we sent a message across this Nation and around the world that America wants to make Dr. Kings dream of equality come true. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Edwards amendment so that this dream can have a chance of becoming a reality.",

That perfect society does not exist. and even in todays more enlightened society. sensitive and responsive to the needs and rights of minorities. we do need an independent Civil Rights Commission. The independence and integrity of the Commission. its freedom from political pressures. are all the more important because the Commission has no enforcement power. except that of public exposure of injustice. Its independence and its 25yearold reputation for impartially and for accuracy give the Commission its influence. President Reagan wants to replace five of the six Commissioners. If he succeeds. he will destroy the Commissions independence. which is the source of much of its effectiveness. Apparently. the President does not like the message of the Commission. Change the Commissioners. change the message. The Commission. however. does not develop policies. It does not choose among options. It reports the realities of discrimination in the United States. If the President does not like the reports of the Commission. he should work to eradicate the discrimination which exists in this country. and which is the subject of more reports.

H.R. 2173. the Contract Services for Drug Dependent Federal Offenders Authorization Act of 1983 reauthorizes for fiscal years 1984. 1985. and 1986 the existing program. which provides drug treatment for Federal convicts who are on probation or parole. The program monitors all of the participants by frequent and regular urinalysis to assure that they are not using drugs. The program plays a significant role in reducing crime because a major study of the criminal patterns of drug addicts found that when they are in treatment. they commit 84 percent fewer crimes. This program addresses one of the major problems of our correctional system. After a person has served a prison sentence where there are extensive programs. including drugabuse detection and treatment. when the defendant returns home there is often inadequate support and supervision. The need for such supervision is especially acute for those addicted to drugs. If they return to the same neighborhoods where they got into trouble in the first place. the probability is high that without close supervision and assistance. they will go back to using drugs again. The extensive counseling and frequent urinalysis testing of this program provides the support that helps keep a lot of these former addicts from returning to drugs and the life of crime. This bill is modeled on H.R. 3963. which passed the House and Senate overwhelmingly in the last Congress but was vetoed for unrelated reasons. The bill authorizes $5 million for 1984. $5.5 million for 1985. and $6 million for 1986.

Drug addicts. and those criminals with a record of drug dependency are released on probation with the special probation conditions of the aftercare program.

This is a substantial cost savings when compared to the average $25.000 cost of incarcerating an individual for 1 year. There are societal savings as well.

The Administrative Office has done such a fine job of carrying out the requirements of the program that they have stayed consistently within the program budget. The Administrative Office is to be commended for their excellent work in the drugaftercare program. This program places parolees. with a history of drug abuse in a special program. Drug aftercare. which is contracted to private organizations. is incorporated into the regular probation program for these persons. Counseling and urinalysis are used to help the drug abuser on probation to avoid reuse of drugs on release from prison. The program benefits society in two ways. First. when an addict is treated. his criminality is reduced by an average of 34 percent. Thus. H.R. 2173 will help reduce drugrelated crime. Second. the alternative to the aftercare program is incarceration. with an annual cost of $25.000. The aftercare program. costing an average of $1.300 per participant. provides a substantial cost savings to the State and Federal prison system. I urge your support for H.R. 2173. the aftercare program.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I urge your support for the aftercare program. through which the administrative office of the U.S. courts contracts for certain services for drugdependent offenders. This program generated no controversy at the subcommittee. full committee. or full House level during the 97th Congress. Unfortunately. it became the vehicle for more controversial matters and became the subject of a Presidential veto. Hopefully. we can move this bill quickly in the 98th Congress. and achieve less flamboyant. but more successful. results. Current Federal law establishes special sentencing procedures and supervisory aftercare treatment for drugdependent offenders. In addition. narcotics addicts released on probation are eligible for such supervision. The primary services provided are counseling and periodic urinalysis to determine if offenders are using narcotics. Since October 1982. this program has been funded through a continuing appropriation with an expired authorization. I commend the gentleman from New Jersey for moving swiftly in the 98th Congress to remedy this situation. In the absence of the treatment and supervision this bill would provide. the alternative is costly incarceration. I believe H.R. 2173 is the preferable route. and I am pleased to join Chairman HUGHES in urging the adoption of the aftercare reauthorization legislation.",

It prohibits the tampering with consumer products and provides stiff penalties for those who commit such acts. Ever since the tragic deaths of seven people in Chicago last fall from a painkiller laced with cyanide. consumers in this country have had legitimate concerns about buying overthecounter drugs and food products sold on open shelves. This concern has had nationwide effects on consumer confidence and on sales of these products. Because of these nationwide effects. Federal intervention is appropriate and necessary. We recognize that Federal intervention must always be carefully limited to those situations that are of particular Federal concern. and where the State and local authorities are in need of Federal assistance. The hearings held by the Subcommittee on Crime proved that this is one of those situations where Federal intervention is appropriate. H.R. 2174 is similar to the antitampering bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the House in the 97th Congress but. along with several other anticrime provisions. was unfortunately vetoed by the President in January. Since that time. the bill has been modified and improved. I believe it is the best possible legislation and will serve its purpose well. to protect the consumers of this country. and to punish those who would tamper with the products on which all of us. as consumers. rely in our everyday lives. I strongly urge your support of H.R. 2174.e",

Mr. Speaker. how anyone could imagine the mind that poisons pain relievers. thereby killing unknown victims at random. is beyond me. This criminal mind is deserving of our swiftest criminal enforcement. All consumers are harmed by tamperings. threats to tamper. and false claims that tamperings have occurred. News of such an event has little to offer in addressing consumer fears. Businesses are severely harmed when loss of consumer confidence undermines years of successful marketing and consumer orientation. Our society cannot expect consumers to know when a purchased product has been the subject of a tampering. Indeed. locating the tampered product prior to injury seems virtually impossible. A Federal criminal penalty and swift enforcement is designed to deter this horrible activity. I introduced an antitampering bill in the 98th Congress which. along with other proposals. has been perfected by the Subcommittee on Crime. This legislation. H.R. 2174. is complete in its attempt to address the act of tampering. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2174. I urge your support for this all important Federal Antitampering Act.",

Until recently. such a law would have seemed unnecessary. for whom of us could have foreseen the horrible Chicago area deaths caused by the random poisoning of a common pain reliever. The act of poisoning products to appear on store shelves. without regard to the identity of the victim. demonstrates a grotesque criminal mind. As if this one incident was not enough. all consumers were suddenly the victims of copycat tamperings. threats to tamper. and false claims that tamperings have occurred. These types of crimes must not go unpunished. Swift and effective Federal law enforcement is necessary. Federal investigation is required to adequately address the national scope of the problem. Often. the product will be made and shipped through several different States before purchased by the consumer. One lone State cannot be expected to trace the tampering through the chain of distribution. With Federal investigation. Federal enforcement follows. and this bill contains stiff penalties. Tampering is unacceptable in our society and should be swiftly punished. When a threat. a false scare. or a tampering victim appears on the evening news. the entire Nation is held hostage. Businesses lose millions in revenue and consumer confidence. Consumers lose confidence in any store purchase. H.R. 2174 will punish the inexcusable acts which lead to these costly results. I urge passage of the bill.",

However. there is one additional reason that has not been stated why this bill ought to pass and pass promptly. Under the current law. the FBI can only get involved in investigating drug tampering or adulteration cases if an extortion threat has been posed. because extortion is a violation of the Federal Criminal Code. The sick mind who poisons or adulterates foods or drugs but does not accompany that with an extortion threat to try and get money into his own pocket. under the present law has not committed a Federal crime and. consequently. the FBI is not able to get involved in tracking down this very despicable and criminal activity. So. by plugging this loophole and creating a Federal crime in this respect. we will get Federal law enforcement in the investigative end sooner on. hopefully to get people indicted and prosecuted and sent to jail later on in the criminal procedure.

This legislation deals with a problem which has faded from the headlines. but which clearly needs to be addressed. The Tylenol murders created not only a terrible trauma for the families of the victims. but also raised concerns that \"copycat\" crimes. as they were dubbed. might lead to contamination of a whole range of consumer products. Consumers were understandably afraid that they might be victimized. Then we encountered the problem of allegations that products had been contaminated when they in fact had not been. Here. in the Washington area. that happened with an eyewash product. The result was that unfounded concerns were raised about a safe product. and the manufacturer had to bear a loss that should never have occurred. Clearly. these are problems of interstate commerce that can only adequately be addressed at the Federal level. The legislation drafted by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and approved by the full Judiciary Committee seeks to deal with this problem. It has strong bipartisan support. and I encourage all of my colleagues to give it their favorable vote.*",

For example. the administration refused to allow Taiwan to buy the F20.

The church is one of the last remaining organized forces of any size protesting the Sandinlsta government and its legacy of broken promises. The rest of the organizations have been disbanded or frightened off by government forces. In their latest attempt to undermine the Cathloic Church. the Sandinistas earlier this month deported 10 priests who participated with 300 other Nicaraguans in a march protesting the governments house arrest of their colleague Rev. Luis Amado Pena. Reverend Pena is one of many Catholic priests who the Sandinistas have attempted to discredit through their disinformation campaign. Earlier this year. in a similar propaganda campaign aimed at undermining Catholic leaders. the Sandinistas tried to link Managuas Roman Catholic Archbishop Obando y Bravo to former Nicaraguan President Anastaslo Somoza through false headlines and reprints of old photographs. In April. a pastoral letter was read on Easter Sunday asking that all Nicaraguans enter into negotiations for peace. The Sandinistas Interior Minister Tomas Borge promptly denounced the priests and their call for peace by saying it was a criminal suggestion. It was the same Sandinista leaders who 1 year earlier organized protests to humiliate Pope John Paul II during his March 1983 visit to Managua. Sandinista followers were ordered to interrupt an outdoor mass given by the Pope and to heckle him as he passed through the city streets. Freedom of religion is just one of the many basic human rights the Sandinista government promised the Nicaraguan people 5 years ago. but have failed to deliver. This is despite the fact that. in 1979. the Catholic Church supported the Sandinista rise . to power.

My bill would not require renomination. which is political. but would simply require that every 6 years the Senate look over the list and reconfirmor notall sitting Federal judges based on performance and ability..",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Monsieur Bertrand Barre will be returning to France this month after having served nearly 4 years as nuclear attache to the Embassy of Prance. During his tenure. Mr. Barre has been an eloquent spokesman for the French nuclear energy program. and I have regarded his expertise on nuclear matters both here and abroad with great admiration. He was the first foreign national to present his Governments viewpoint on nuclear energy and breeder reactor technology before our subcommittee hearing on the Clinch River breeder reactor last year. As many colleagues know. France is a leading proponent of breeder reactors among our allies. and has assumed a position of world leadership in developing this technology for comercial use. The 1.200MWe Superphenix reactor will be the largest operating breeder reactor in the free world when it goes on line next year. Mr. Barre has always counseled the Energy Research and Production Subcommittee that the United States must participate in a substantive way in this worldwide enterprise. In his testimony before my subcommittee last September. he stated that. \"The world needs a U.S. breeder program. as [the U.S.] needs a European and Japanese program.\" He went on to say. \"If you give up. I dont think that will doom the breeder programs elsewhere in the world. but we will certainly miss yOU.\" Well. we will certainly miss you. Mr. Barre. On behalf of myself. the subcommittee. and the staff. we bid you a fond \"au revoir.\" and wish you well in your future assignments.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the ruthless Soviet Army has massacred thousands of innocent Afghan villagers in the 5 years since the Kremlin directed the invasion of Afghanistan. It is a record so repulsive that many Soviet officers and soldiers have defected and given themselves up rather than continue to obey their orders to slaughter the Afghan people. Afghan refugees crossing into Pakistan recently told of Soviet massacres in three villages near Q(aidhar. Joiathan Broder of the Chicago Tribune has written of their horrifying recollections of one day last fall when Soviet troops killed 360 Afghan civilians. Survivors described in detail how the Soviets entered in tanks. armored personnel carriers and on foot. cutting down old people. women and small children where they stood. They said some villagers were lined up against walls and shot. others were gunned down in their homes. Bloody and inhumane scenes such as this have been repeated time and again by Soviet troops throughout the world. Unlike the Soviet Union. we have never used our military to slaughter innocent men. women. and children as the Soviets have done in Afghanistan. We have never used our powerful military strength to eliminate the national identities of nations as the Soviet Union has done in the Ukraine and the Baltic States of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. We have never used our military power to oppress the rights of people as the Soviets have done in Hungary. Poland. and Czechoslovakia. We have never created surrogate hoodlums to roam and terrorize the world as the Soviets have done with Cuba and Vietnam. Instead. our Nation has sought to preserve freedom and liberty for ourselves and our allies. Our military has been a deterrent force to those who would seek to deny those freedoms and has proven to be ready to respond to aggression by our enemies. Never has our military been ordered to deny the freedom of a nation or randomly slaughter people as the Soviets have done. Following my remarks is one of many stories of the Afghan refugees. It is a stirring reminder of the great differences that exist between the Soviet Union and our own Nation.",

Youth. and Families. on which I serve as chair of the Economic Security Task Force. has held extensive hearings which reveal that families have suffered as a result of the budget cuts during the last 3 years. These cuts represent a step back from this countrys commitment to children and their families. Programs that serve children. youth. and families will be cut by almost $62 billion during the Reagan administration. These figures are based on proJections of the Congressional Budget Office. They are literal estimates of reductions in outlays based on 1980 law before the legislative changes instituted under the Reagan administration. The damage done by these cuts would have almost doubled if Congress had not rejected an additional $52 billion in cuts proposed by the Reagan administration during fiscal years 198284.

Because he was a good and valued friend. as well as a neighbor while at Harvard. let me simply bring that debt to the attention of my colleagues.

Certainly his was an extraordinary career. as singular in thought as it was prodigious in achievement. While others drew conclusions from the broader sweeps of human history and events. Dr. Goffman found meaning in the routine of everyday life. arguing that even small and seemingly inconsequential actions are in fact calculated maneuvers designed to enhance ones identity.

No one knows this truth better than the Europeans themselves. It is a useful reminder to Senators and to the American public. The United States does not seek a permanent policy of export subsidies.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to offer my support for the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey . The issue of raising the retirement age is one which certainly cannot be taken lightly. The amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey sufficiently addresses serious inequities which would exist if the retirement age were simply raised without regard for those who find that they no longer can work past a certain age. I have had grave reservations over raising the retirement age above 65 because of its adverse effects upon the early retirement benefit formula. For many workers. particularly those in stressful or physically demanding occupations. it is important to keep the option to retire early open. Very simply put. there are many individuals who cannot work past the age of 62. These individuals must be afforded protection from an unwarranted reduction in early retirement benefits. The Bradley amendment provides this protection. Supporters of raising the retirement age point to demographics: longer life expectancy rates and labor supply shortages in the coming century. These statistical calculations. however accurate. fail to take into account workers with poor health. low skill levels. and inconsistent work histories who will be unable to work or will be unable to find employment when they are older. The Bradley amendment would establish a new program that will allow a limited group of workers aged 62 up to the \"normal retirement\" age to qualify for \"disability retirement benefits.\" Workers qualify for these benefits if they can demonstrate inability to perform the major occupation they had held during the 10year period before the onset of their disability. The costs of the program are minimal. estimated to be 0.04 percent of payroll. and benefits would be paid out of the OldAge and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Without this amendment. I believe it would be very hard for many of us here to support raising the retirement age to conform to the Senate Finance Committee recommendations. Thus. I urge my colleagues to join me in lending support for this needed amendment.",

The Senator from Kansas offered a similar amendment earliermaybe the interest rate appeared too low. maybe everybody does not believe that we can get it down to 6 percent. so we raised it to 8 percent. If that happens then. of course. you delay withholding. as the Senator from Montana wishes to do. for a 6month period. Apparently Members here do not want small savers. working people to buy money market funds. so we raised it from $300 to $500. The minimum now is $2.500. I hope that. with this change. again we can focus on the real issue. Now. if we are concerned about delay and if we are concerned about depositors. let us make it clear. You cannot put your $500 savings in a money market insured account. It has to be at least $2.500. Why can you not put less in a money market account? Because that means that much of the money will come out of the passbook savings which pay only 5.5 percent. This would make it possible for people with only $500. which would be most Americans. to go in and get a money market fund rate of interest. to receive 9 percent rather than their passbook savings rate of 5.5 percent. It is a serious amendment. If. in fact. you are concerned about the delay of withholding. as the Senator from Montana is. then I believe this would tie it to that and would make it feasible. So. Mr. President. I hope that at the appropriate time we might act favorably on the amendment.",

This is not an idea that has sprung up overnight in this country. In fact. I believe it has been in the law. off and on. for well over 100 years. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North Carolina for a question.",

I had a confrontation with \"Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer\" last December. and now the Senator from Kansas is apparently going to have one with the \"Easter Bunny.\" But. Mr. President. I do admire the Senator even though I do not agree with him on this particular issue. though I may later on with the persuasive powers which he has. I do want to refer to a comment made earlier that it was demagoguery. as I heard the comment. to vote in favor of repeal or delay in the implementation of the withholding on dividends and interest. It is not demagoguery. I would say furthermore that when the unanimousconsent agreement was offered and agreed to. I specifically asked the leadership if that would exclude this matter being considered on the social security bill. The answer of the majority leader. of course. was it would not. I even asked if anybody would be offended if the repeal were to be considered. and the answer to that was in the negative. I will say that in my judgment. Mr. President. the offer that the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin accepted and agreed to was scarcely any offer at all because the reciprocity bill on its face is unconstitutional. It is never going anywhere. A vote on that would be absolutely meaningless. I did not mean to digress so far. Mr. President.

My question is. how have the banks been able to figure out a way in which they can deduct from their expenses all of the costs which they have incurred in connection with this lobbying campaign when the code specifically spells out that that is not permissible? What steps. if any. will be taken by the IRS to cause the banks to pay out of their own funds these dollars?

I am most proud to bring to the attention of my Senate colleagues a major development at the Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago that has captured worldwide interest and enthusiasm in the medical community. Two researchers at Loyola recently discovered a microorganism that they believe is the cause of toxemia of pregnancy. a condition that may cause the deaths of as many as 5 million mothers and fetuses worldwide each year. Toxemia of pregnancy. which annually affects as many as 300.000 expectant mothers and claims as many as 24.000 lives in the United States alone. has eluded medical researchers for more than a century. according to Dr. Silvio Aladjem. chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Loyolas Stritch School of Medicine. Dr. Aladjem and his coresearcher. Dr. Judith Lueck. have performed experiments during their 8 years of study that show the syndrome is associated with a microscopic organism previously unknown. The researchers have named the newly discovered organism Hydatoxi lualba. Toxemia frequently produces intrauterine growth retardation and fetal death. as well as hypertension. swelling. andin the most severe formsconvulsions in the mother. It is also a common cause of premature births. All current medical treatments attempt only to minimize the symptoms of the disease. However. the discovery of the organism and its association with toxemia of pregnancy paves the way for eventually finding a cure for this terrible disease. I ask unanimous consent that two articles on this significant medical breakthrough. published in the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times. be printed in the RECORD.",

Roughly 100.000 Soviet troops have attempted to occupy Afghanistan. They have killed thousands of Afghans. and have sent 4 million Afghans into homeless and impoverished exile. Chillingly convincing evidence has mounted of Soviet use of chemical weapons to maim and kill Afghans. Against appalling odds and brutality. the fiercely independent Afghan people have fought on for the freedom of their wild and beautiful country. Soviet aggression has proved foolish. as well as infamously wrong. Elusive bands of Afghan freedom fighters have defeated Soviet attempts to subjugate their country and legitimize the puppet Babrak Kramal regime. Indeed. Afghan freedom fighters have kept Soviet troops from occupying most of the country. limiting them to an uneasy presence in principal towns and roads. The brave Afghan people have on their own so impressively confronted the Soviet military machine. The very least we here in America can do is to let them know that we have not forgotten their brave fight. and to express our support for their efforts against such odds. I am pleased to cosponsor the Senate joint resolution which requests the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to honor the heroic Afghan freedom fighters on March 21. 1983.",

While I respect the gentleman who offers the amendment. I do have some kind of pertinent observations to make about this. As a sense of the Congress substitute for the resolution I think the first thing that is quite clear is that the gentleman in the well. who is the proponent of the amendment. is against the freeze or he would not offer this substitute. So you have to make a decision right there which one you are for. That is a useful purpose. I suppose. for the opponents of the pending resolution. By offering his substitute we will pretty much know where everybody is once we vote on this. The other thing is that one should not be misled by the milk and honey of the language of whatever. the substitute says because one has to assume certain things in achieving the objective that the gentleman spoke about so sincerely and so eloquently. One of those presumptions is that neither country will do nothing while the builddown process is negotiated and is proceeding. That is one presumption I think that all of us can agree just is not realistic. Each country will be working feverishly to improve the capabilities of each of the new missiles and warheads for the two old missiles. The other presumption. in the pending substitute. is that you would honest to goodness have a negotiation whereby you would reduce warheads and that in some way you would ultimately get to a kind of position where nobody would be threatened. If we are on a drive right now to reduce common probable error to less than 800 feet on both sides. you can just believe me. whether we reduce the warheads or we do a 2 for 1 or 3 for 1 or whatever. that the drive is going to continue to get a launcher and a missule that will go down the smokestack especially with the concern expensed for hardened silos.",

I would prefer we do other things in the freeze. And I made that point. But you could under your freeze change as an example the SSSN18 warhead. 40 KT warhead. reduce it and put 25 megaton warheads on SS18s. There is nothing to guarantee that the overall megatonnage would go down. That would be a 2for1 increase. Also it has been made here. the point has been made a number of times that the Soviet systems are newer and that therefore they are somehow better or therefore somehow more maintainable. 97 percent of the Soviet landbased missiles are liquidfueled missiles. harder to maintain. more difficult to maintain. The Soviet submarines. the brand new Delta class submarine remains on station onethird as long as our supposed antique Poseidons. So.

Let us start the process right here and now of reducing the numbers of warheads in the world. Let us do the job of speaking to that concern of the American people that has been expressed over and over again that there are too many warheads. that both sides have too much capacity to destroy the world.

Let me make clear that I do not mean onesided disarmament by the United States. I do mean that a twosided halt in the nuclear arms race by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Nor is a workable freeze a bonnet full of wishful thinking about Soviet good intentions. It requires. on the contrary. tough negotiations to insure that we can check against Soviet cheating and take appropriate steps if that should occur. I do not argue here that arms control is without risks. But I also believe that without the right kinds of arms control. we face even greater risks. We are entering an era of such advanced nuclear weapons. that we may soon lose control over our own destiny. Now is the time to negotiate with the Soviets and to step back from the brink.

I have heard some of the proponents of the freeze resolution talk about supposed qualitative advantages that our systems still have. but they have really ignored the ages of our systems. It is a fact that our bombers were built in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The youngest one is going to be 30 years old in the 1990s. The last Poseidon system was launched. I believe. in April 1967. They are going to be nearing the end of their projected life in the mid1990s. and I would like to remind my colleagues that we have never had a 30yearold ballistic missile submarine before. We do not know if they will work until they are 30 years old. Some of our colleagues who have opposed the Levitas substitute have brushed off this modernization argument. but I think it is extremely difficult to brush off facts surrounding the mishaps that have occurred with regard to our B52 force since I have been in Congress. I am looking at a list of accidents: A wing fracture in March 1983. A fire during a fuel system maintenance. five killed on January 27. 1983. A crash on takeoff. December 16. 1982. And finally. I think most of my colleagues are aware that there is presently a B52 missing somewhere over Nevada. In fact. these systems are aging. They need to be replaced. If we are going to have any consideration for the people who operate these systems. we should support the Levitas substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I think that my colleague from New York pointed out something that our colleagues need to remember. This is not an amendment to the freeze. This is a substitute for it. So for those of my colleagues who like the idea of the builddown and like the idea of a freeze. you cannot have both. You can either have the freeze or the builddown. and that is an important point to remember. Second. one of the things that the freeze supporters feel strongly about is that the freeze stops both the qualitative and the quantitative increase in new weapons on both sides when the treaty is agreed to. That is not the case with the builddown. As my colleague from North Dakota pointed out. what you have is the possible replacement of two Derringers with one new Winchester rifleolder weapons for newer. more destabilizing one. While the gentleman from Georgia says that this will lead to the deMIRVing. there is nothing to guarantee that and there is nothing in the language of this resolution that would guarantee that we would move to deMIRVing. The contrary could be the case. We could have more Soviet firststrike weapons and more U.S firststrike weapons. and we would seriously undermine stability and deterrence. One of the things that all of us who have been advocates of arms control have to recognize is that SALT I and SALT II were designed as arms control agreements to reduce destabilizing capability. In a way. we failed the American people and the people of the world with those agreements because they really have not done that. That is why people feel so strongly about a freeze. They believe that with a freeze. you can eventually have reductions. but that if you only talk about reductions. as we have heretofore only talked about. what happens is that you have the continued arms race. \"Reductions\" do not really mean reductions. Reductions usually mean more weapons. So what the freeze gives us is the basis from which to reduce. I urge the defeat of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. a couple of quick comments. It has been said that the Levitas amendment is lacking because it covers the question of prohibiting a quantitative increase but does not address qualitative improvements. However. if that charge can be made against the Levitas amendment. I think the charge can be made against the Zablocki resolution that it speaks to the prohibiting of qualitative improvementsmodernizationbut does not speak directly to quantitative improvements. So if one falls because of one problem. then the other falls down because of the other problem. Most importantly. I am not sure that the debate as it has proceeded has focused on the issue of stability. If a target becomes more attractive. then we have a less stable world. A target such as a Trident submarine with 18 Trident missiles with perhaps 10 individually targeted warheads becomes a more attractive target if we start building down and do not permit modernization. do not permit the construction of the Midgetman. and do not permit the construction of missiles that have one warhead. The beauty of the Levitas amendment is the fact that it addresses the issue of stability. It protects against the situation where we freeze now. eliminate single warhead vehicles. thus increasing the attractiveness of a target such as a Trident submarine with approximately 180 warheads. That would create instability. the Levitas amendment speaks to that very crucial problem.",

While the rightwing death squads and security forces are directing a tragic pattern of indiscriminate killings and abductions of civilians. political party leaders. and activists are facing Governmentsponsored intimidation and violence that undermines Gen. Oscar Mejia Victores commitment to a political opening. Widespread reports of the militarys past reliance upon electoral fraud to empower its chosen candidates have left many Guatemalans highly skeptical about their countrys political system and the efficacy of the upcoming election. In all likelihood. the July 1 vote in Guatemala will not present a step toward democratic rule if current conditions persist. Members of the countrys moderate Christian Democratic Party have already suggested that the military plans to fix the election in order to give ultrarightwing parties a majority of the assembly seats. I wish to introduce into the RECORD a staff report by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. prepared by David B. Lawrenz of that research organization.

I am pleased to inform my colleagues in the House that the city of Birmingham. which I am honored to represent. has recently been cited as having one of the top citizen participation programs in the country. As my colleagues know. citizen participation is a key element in the successful operation of a community development program. and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the city of Birmingham and its citizens on this achievement. The citys program consists of 95 neighborhoods. covering the entire population. each of which elects its own neighborhood officials and makes spending recommendations on community development and other Federal funds in the neighborhood. As these neighborhoods have become active in these programs. they have also expanded their roles and become involved in a wide range of other neighborhood issues. such as zoning changes. traffic control. anticrime programs. transit routing and scheduling. cleanup campaigns. and even local fundraising events for other neighborhood services and improvements. These neighborhood groups also are assigned specific staff members in city hall to coordinate neighborhood activities and to provide support services. Thus. the citizens have ready access to city officials and program information. yet they maintain. through their independent neighborhood elections and meetings. the necessary autonomy to be a truly grassroots effort and organization. I would like to enter into the RECORD an article from the Birmingham News announcing this achievement. as well as excerpts from Citizen Participation. a publication of Tufts University. which made the award. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend the elected officials of the city. Mayor Richard Arrington. Jr.. and the members of the City Council. who have strongly supported this program.

Thus far. over 80 Members of the House of Representatives have joined me in cosponsoring this important resolutiona resolution which will help promote public interest in the protection of these ecologically significant birds. The designation of \"National Birds of Prey Conservation Week\" will cause the public to recognize the value of these birds in wildlife communities and spawn support for the management of their habitats and the preservation of important hawk migration outlooks. These birds play an important role in the ecosystem because they are a key segment of the food chain which is sensitive to environmental changes. Protection of these birds is crucial if a balanced ecosystem is to be maintained. In the past. the public has not recognized the significance of these birds and in 1982. 40 of the 53 birds of prey species were listed by one or more State conservation agencies as endangered. extirpated. threatened. or of concern. The creation of \"National Birds of Prey Conservation Week\" would direct the public toward esthetic appreciation of these splendid birds and encourage people to understand why the preservation of these birds is so vital. Every autumn. over a million birdwatchers observe hawks. falcons. owls. and even the great bald eagle. the symbol of our Nation. on major raptor flyways scattered across the country.

For a number of years. the Veterans Administration had been treating nonserviceconnected disorders on an outpatient basis. This included dispensing needed medications. In an apparent effort to administer costsaving measures. the VA recently reversed this policy and told veterans who had been receiving this medication that it would no longer be available. Approximately 50 veterans contacted my office. many upset and discouraged because they were serviceconnected disabled. but had been receiving medications for nonserviceconnected needs such as serious high blood pressure. heart disorders. and di. abetes. Few thought they would be able to afford their lifesustaining medications if this program for our veterans were stopped. On their behalf. I contacted Mr. Walters for a thorough explanation of the facts the VA used to make this decision. 12 weeks and at least 5 phone calls from my staff later. no explanation has been received other than a form letter. in essence saying. \"the check is in the mail.\" My request was relatively simple. I asked for the number of veterans this decision would affect. the amount of money proposed saved. other costsaving measures which the VA has implemented. and the future of the medication program. The Veterans Administration obviously has not fully thought out its policies before implementing them. nor seems to care what the consequences may bring to those affected. This is not the way to treat those who have served us so satisfactorily and so well.",

Treasury Secretary Regan apparently does not believe that $200 billion deficits mean high interest rates. But I do. The White House claims to be baffled by the recent increase. and blames it on fear of the future. Mr. Speaker. given the size of the deficit. there is ample ground for concern in the marketplace. as well as here in the House. It it time to acknowledge that massive deficits do mean high interest rates. It is time our leaders faced this fact and addressed the seriousness of the deficit.

It is this famine. probably more than any other international tragedy. that exemplifies the significance of the Bread for the World organization. For the past 10 years. Bread for the World has diligently worked to eliminate longterm hunger problems and rapidly alleviate critical food shortages. As it celebrates its 10th anniversary. Bread for the World continues to center its work around informing and educating Americans about the food needs of the world. The organization has also devised initiatives that go beyond its valuable efforts to educate the public. Bread for the World has committed itself to longterm solutions by supporting aid programs that help developing countries become agriculturally selfsufficient. and by urging the highest possible nutritional standards for the food aid that is distributed by the United States. It is the grassroots effort of the organizations 45.000 members that truly merits commendation. For the past 10 years. these compassionate Bread for the World members have diligently urged public support for the food assistance programs passed by this Congress. At the same time. these individuals have informed their friends and neighbors of the even greater hunger needs that still exist. It is for this 10year commitment to the vital task of ending world hunger that I rise and offer my grateful commendation to Bread for the World.",

I think that it is incredible that at the same time Secretary of State George Shultz is speaking of the need to increase the fight against international terrorism. the Reagan administration issues a visa to Roberto DAubuisson to enter this country. Over the weekend. press reports indicated that DAubuisson may have been involved in a plot to assassinate U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Thomas Pickering. And even if he wasnt directly involved in the plotting. he is implicated to the degree that he was in a position to stop it until U.S. officials talked to him. Granting of a visa to Mr. DAubuisson is especially outrageous because just last December. Vice President GEORGE BUSH assured me: * * * we have no intention of knowingly admitting anyone to the United States. either on a temporary or permanent basis. who would pose a threat to you or to any other American. BusH went on to say that * * I the State Department is working with the El Salvador Government to come up with lists of individuals suspected of being tied in with death squad activity. These lists will be sent to INS to ensure that these people do not gain entry to the United States. Mr. Speaker. in June 1980. Mr. DAubuissons visa to the United States was revoked because he was declared a danger \"to the welfare. safety. or security of the United States.\" Last November. this administration denied Roberto DAubuisson a visa to enter this country because it was contrary to \"the national interest.\" an apparent reference to DAubuissons extreme rightist views and activities. And 3 years ago. a Reagan appointee in El Salvador said that a machinegun attack on the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador \"had all the hallmarks of a DAubuisson operation.\" Mr. Speaker. the attempt by this administration to convey legitimacy on Roberto DAubuisson by granting him a visa is reprehensible.

Internal Revenue Service figures show that. under current practices. Federal employees end up paying an average of $8.000 worth of moving expenses out of their own pockets. This happens to many Federal employees each year because agencies such as the FBI. the Secret Service. the IRS. and Defense. must move many of their middle- and highlevel employees in order to staff their field offices with high quality managers. Everyone is losing in the current situation. Federal employees are faced with undergoing financial hardship or leaving the Federal service. Agencies are hampered in their ability to recruit and retain wellqualified professionals. managers. and executives. The taxpayers lose when these practices lower Government productivity and effectiveness. This amendment will go a long way toward relieving these problems.

I am sure that any Senators from the intermountain region who have looked at this amendment will say that is is inadequate to the problem. The problem we have out there is an excess of timber sales that have been made in the past. during inflationary times. where people were constantly bidding up the price of timber. when the Government sales agencythe Forest Service. in this casewas encouraging that we could always pay this high price for timber sales because there would be no tomorrow. and there would always be a higher price. So a great many companies overbid what they could actually get out of the sale of that timber. This particular solution. if I understand it correctly. only takes care of a few mills in the west of the Cascade region. All those people east of the Cascades and in the intermountain region have a problem because the cost of the roads. due to Government regulations. in many cases becomes as excessive as the price of the timberequal to or higher than the cost of the roads in some cases. I should like to make it very clear that this is a solution that I do not believe is practical. It does not solve the problem we have in the intermountain region. The administration has already made an administrative decision on this. I think the proper way to solve this problem is to let stand the solution that the White House and the Interior Department have made administratively. to delay some of these timber sales for 5 years. until Congress can hold hearings on this problem and make a solution of the problem that is equitable to all parties. This is not an equitable solution. This does not solve the problem in the State of the Presiding Officer. the Senator from Colorado . It does not solve the problem in Wyoming.

I have stated that our trade laws are ineffective. and that foreign nations have taken full advantage of every weakness in those laws.

It is difficult for the Customs Service to fully verify the exact nature of each incoming cargo. The pending amendment would help provide the Customs Service with some of the manpower it needs to check incoming cargoes with greater precision.

The evasion of import quotas. the falsification of customs documents and other violations of present civil and criminal statutes all pose a grave threat to the stability of our Nations steel industry. This industry is already plagued by intolerably high unemployment. low capacity utilization. and unfair foreign competition from subsidized and dumped imports. This amendment will help assure that it is not prey to unscrupulous foreign producers who willfully violate our customs laws. The proposed amendment. which would add $1.000.000 to the budget of the U.S. Customs Service. also stipulates that $4.240.000 of the total amount appropriated be used for direct investigatory manpower devoted specifically for the enforcement of steel customs fraud. I believe that this targeted appropriation. along with the provision requiring the purchase of four mobile chemical spectrometers. is a sorely needed reform. as well as a costeffective expense.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. todays special order calls attention to a very serious health problem which for too long has remained on the back pages of newspapers. or has not been reported at all. It is a problem the likes of which we have never seen before. The disease. for which no known cause or cure exists to date. strikes at the heart of the bodys defense system and leaves its victims prey to numerous other lifethreatening diseases. As such. it has been given the name AIDSthe acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Though the first reported case was in 1979. it has taken some 4 years for the public to become generally aware of the seriousness of AIDS. To date. over 1.300 cases have been reported to the Center for Disease Control. of which 500 were fatal. Further. the mortality rate for those who contracted the disease 4 years ago is now 100 percent. AIDS. which by destruction of the bodys ability to fight disease leaves its sufferers prone to multiple chronic conditions. is surely one of the cruelest outbreaks in memory. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. there is little incentive for private research into the causes and cures for AIDS. Because the disease strikes a relatively small number of people. as compared to other chronic conditions. the millions of dollars required in the battle against AIDS will not be recovered by private pharmaceutical interests. Therefore. like other \"orphans.\" Federal intervention provides the only realistic key. It is this spirit that I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2713. introduced by Representative WAXMAN. The bill would provide $40 million for the establishment of an emergency Public Health Services fund to combat sudden health emergencies such as AIDS. This would cut through the redtape which has hindered the Governments response to this serious problem which was not the case with victims of toxic shock syndrome and Legionnaires disease. Again. Mr. Speaker. the numbers may appear small. but the devastation is immense. The time for action is now. and I urge all my colleagues to assist fellow Americans who are in fact facing a life and death situation due to AIDS.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to express my support of this effort to focus national attention on acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]. a deadly and unrelenting disease which destroys the bodys immune system. A growing number of AIDS cases began surfacing in 1981. Since that time. the disease has struck 1.300 Americans. 486 of whom have died. This disorder is one which has baffled the medical professionand for just reason. To date. the diseases place of origin has not been determined. its cause is unknown. and its cure has yet to be found. To further complicate matters. doctors are not experiencing much success in treating victims with the disease. As a result. a victims immunity system becomes increasingly weak. thus leaving him or her vulnerable to a host of other diseases. Early records show that the disease primarily claimed homosexuals as its victims. However. more recent records show that the disease has spread among other groups as well. namely intravenous drug users. Haitians. hemophiliacs. and children. And. as time goes on. it appears that more and more heterosexuals are contracting AIDS. It is anticipated that by years end. there will be 2.000 cases in the United States. Mr. Speaker. while experts have begun studying this lethal disease. and its victims. more research and greater public awareness is obviously needed. It is my hope that this special order will help galvanize support toward this end.9",

Chief of the Endocrinology Department at the New Orleans VA Medical Center. Dr. Kastin. an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine. received the award for his \"pioneering contributions in bringing about a better understanding of brain chemicals and their actions.\" The award is named for the late Dr. Middleton. a researcher. clinician. and educator who led the VAs Department of Medicine and Surgery from 1955 to 1963. Dr. Kastins 20year study of neuropeptides has opened doors to new lines of research that could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders. including Parkinsons disease. depression. and mental retardation. His findings are based on the theory that naturally occurring brain peptides exert direct effects on the central nervous system separate from and in addition to stimulating the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. This activity was confirmed in Parkinsonian patients. and subsequent studies by Dr. Kastin and others suggest that these studies represent a promising approach to the search for an effective treatment for Parkinsons disease and mental depression. A native of Cleveland. Dr. Kastin graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1960. His association with the VA and Tulane University dates back to 1964. when he was awarded a special National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellowship to work with VA endocrinologist Dr. Andrew V. Schally. who himself won the Middleton Award in 1970 and the Nobel Prize in 1977. The award was presented to Dr. Kastin yesterday afternoon at VA Central Office by the agencys Deputy Administrator. Everett Alvarez. Jr. I know my colleagues join me in expressing to him warm congratulations and appreciation.

I know that many of my colleagues also share this preoccupation. At the beginning of this year I traveled to South America. and I came away with the impression that if there is one thing that concerns everyone regardless of nationality. political belief. or social class. it is the economic crisis and how it is disrupting their lives. The economic recession is a worldwide phenomenon. but in our hemisphere it has manifested itself in the form of a foreign debt that has achieved crisis proportions. Because of this. and because of the desire of the Congress to be better informed on the subject. I will shortly conduct a series of hearings on the economic situation in Latin America and the Caribbean. The purpose of the hearings is to provide the Congress and the American people with a comprehensive analysis of: Economic conditions in Latin America. the factors responsible for the crisis. the symptoms of the crisis. including the international debt situation. the sociopolitical impact of the crisis and of the prescribed remedies. the role of the IMF and other financial institutions. and the prospects for an economic recovery. In preparation for the hearings I would like to submit for the RECORD two articles that appeared recently in the Washington Post. In the first one. Joseph Grunwald provides a historical perspective on the economic recession affecting the newly industrialized countries in Latin America and Asia that is responsible for unprecedented levels of foreign debt. He also proposes possible mechanisms for postponement of debt repayment. as well as other ways to deal with the economic crisis. In the second article. our own friend and colleague.

I would like to take this opportunity during \"National Child Abuse Month\" to bring to the attention of Congress and the Nation the fine achievements on behalf of Americas children of an organization of citizens in ColoradoSocietys League Against Molesters (SLAM). SLAMs goal is to assist in the creation of a healthier environment for our Nations children. Their special focus is the problem of child molesting in my home State of Colorado. Of course. one of the most significant obstacles the group has to overcome is public lack of awareness of the problem. The Justice Department estimates the number of children who are sexually abused is between 100.000 and 500.000 annually. often causing irreparable harm to those children. Yet. this is an area of child abuse that most people are unaware of or would rather not talk about. SLAM has a community outreach program to make the public aware of the tremendous proportions of the problem. and I commend their spirit and tenacity. But their efforts only begin with their educational work. They also have an active and effective legislative program. encouraging and working for implementation of legislation to help solve the difficulties we have. I have firsthand knowledge of their hard work. While serving in Colorados Legislature. I worked with SLAM in a successful effort to toughen the States laws protecting children against molesters. I intend to continue the efforts we began in Colorado here in Washington. and I am looking forward to working with SLAM on these new challenges. The responsibility of protecting our children. the future of this Nation. is immense. Thankfully. due to SLAMs work in Colorado and to SLAM chapters in other States. we are making nationwide progress in heightening public awareness and finding solutions to the many serious problems involved. I encourage any interested party to get in touch with my office if they would like additional information on SLAM.o",

This will enable them to be full partners in the orderly and expeditious development of our potentially vast OCS energy reserves.

The bountiful resource of the ocean can be developed with regard to the capabilities of our coastal areas to support renewable and nonrenewable resource development if we take the proper steps now. Besides the contribution the OCS can play in domestic energy supplies. there are other resource considerations. Full harvesting of our fisheries within the 200mile limit. the use of our ports to increase exports of coals. timber. and other domestic products. population shifts. tourism. and recreational demands reenforce the need for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to balanced decisionmaking and longrange resource reliability in the OCS and the coastal areas. Along with a renewed emphasis on the OCS should come an elevated sense of responsibility requiring that we shepherd multiple use of the region carefully to guarantee productivity with consideration for all resource values of our coastal regions. For years. the Congress has fashioned a series of policies and enacted a number of programs to address the concerns generated by the multiple use concept on our Nations coast. Wisely.

At the same time the Department of the Interior is proceeding with a greatly accelerated 5year oil and gas leasing program. The pressures on coastal communities and the need for locating a source of funding that would not burden the Federal budget or the taxpayer have never been greater. I am pleased to be a part of this effort to insure continued funding for important ocean and coastal development and to achieve equity for coastal States in longterm compensation for the effects of federally generated resource exploration and development. The State of Washington. the first State with an approved coastal zone management program. has a deep and longstanding interest in the programs which will receive funding under this program. The coastal zone management program. the sea grant program. and commercial fisheries research and development. are all programs which significantly contribute to the quality of life and to the economy of Washington. I invite the support of my colleagues for this legislation.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as St. Patricks Day nears. our attention is once again drawn to the conflict and violence which has devastated the six northern provinces of Ireland. The streets of Belfast. Londonderry. and other communities in the region have been stained with the blood of the hundreds of men. women. and children who have lost their lives in the turbulence which has engulfed the North. While violence has sporadically broken out since the division of Ireland in 1921. the brutality has reached unprecedented levels since the late 1960s. This tragic situation has been further complicated by the presence of British troops. As evidenced by violent outbreaks such as \"Bloody Sunday of 1972.\" The seeds of hostility in Ulster are rooted deep in the soil of discrimination. Today. the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland continues to suffer the effects of discrimination in housing. employment. and political representation. Tension has spawned a variety of paramilitary organizations which have. in time. continued the cycle of violence which has included firebombings. vandalism. street clashes. and senseless killings. These acts of violence have clearly frustrated attempts to resolve hostilities in Northern Ireland. Little progress can be expected under these circumstances. Therefore. I would encourage all parties to resolve their differences through peaceful means. As we look to the future. we are reminded of the unique ties which exist between the United States and Ireland. The Irish have made significant contributions to the growth and development of our Nation. Today. there are more than 43 million IrishAmericans living in the United States. I ask them and all Americans to join with the people of Northern Ireland in prayer for a Just resolution of the conflict. injustices. and deprivations of human and civil rights which continue to divide Northern Ireland.9",

This is the common perception of the majority of the people of the free world. In those countries where citizens are able to debate and criticize. where news and commentary flow freely. there is a loud clear message to the Government and leaders of these countriesreduce the nuclear threat.

The Senate of the United States further believes that both our Government and the Soviet Union should dismantle two nuclear warheads for each new warhead deployed. This is back to basics. By deploying new strategic weapons. both countries would reduce literally their nuclear arsenals of thousandsyes. thousandsof warheads. Without discussing the complicating Issues of verifiability and strategic maneuvering. the mutual guaranteed builddown agreement serves as a definitive basic for determining United States and Soviet arms control obligations while a nuclear disarmament treaty is negotiated.

This year the group. now known as the Dayton Ballet Company. has just completed its 45th anniversary season as the second oldest regional ballet company in the Nation. The Dayton Ballet Company is truly one of Daytons great treasures. It is ranked among Americas top regional dance companies and is widely acclaimed for its quality of performance and diverse repertoire. It is consistently awarded major company status by the National Association for Regional Ballet and has performed widely in the United States and Canada. The ballet is a valuable community asset which has entertained. enriched. and instructed two generations of Daytonians. During 14 regular performances in its past season. it reached a total audience of over 20.000. In addition. the ballet gave lecture demonstrations to schoolchildren. free performances to senior citizen groups. and other special programs. The ballet also serves as a cultural ambassador of Dayton. During the last year. it performed before 30.000 in 19 touring appearances in the Midwestern and Eastern States. Behind all of the ballets success is founder and guiding light Josephine Schwarz. or \"Miss Jo\" as she is known in the dance world. A knee injury forced her to turn from performance to helping others perform through teaching. choreographing. and directing. She is a founding member of the National Association for Regional Ballet and served as the first chairman of the Ohio Arts Council Dance Advisory Panel and as a member of the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts. Since she began teaching ballet at the age of 14 when she charged 10 cents a lesson. she estimates she has worked with \"thousands of students.\" They are now scattered around the country. many ballet stars in their own right. Though she celebrated her 75th birthday only last week. Miss Jo remains actively committed to dance. She still teaches 6 days a week in her downtown studio above the old Victory Theatre. She still works with the Dayton Ballet Co.. serving as artistic adviser. Even yesterday she journeyed to Washington to testify before the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior in support of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.

This year marks the fourth time the community council has presented the award and the first time the award was even shared by two recipients in 1 year. Each month of the year. one police officer is chosen for performing a courageous deed or for displaying remarkable leadership qualities. at the end of the year. a committee chooses the CopoftheYear from the pool of 12 candidates. I understand that this years decision was extremely difficult and that two officers were chosen instead of one. These gentlemen have certainly earned such favorable recognition. Police Officer Brennan. a member of the force for 12 years. distinguished himself this year by convincing a dangerous man with a gun to give himself up. The man Brennan pursued locked himself in a room in an apartment after shooting his girlfriend and her daughter. After a tense and trying exchange of words. Brennan was able to take the man. preventing any further injury to those at the scene. Brennans ability to take risks and to act decisively in this situation is quite impressive. Detective Rocco Pascarella. a member of the force for 14 years. displayed amazing courage by inspecting police headquarters in the midst of a frightening bomb scare. After the explosion of two bombs. Pascarella did not hesitate to search for any remaining explosives planted in the building. He discovered another bomb during his search and. unfortunately. it exploded causing him serious bodily injury. Pascarellas unselfish willingness to risk his life is a commendable feature of his character. Brennan and Pascarella are fine examples of individuals who make their community a strong. healthy. and safe environment in which to live. These two men are assets to their community both as keepers of the peace and as leaders of outstanding character whose courageous contributions serve as an inspiration to all of us.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a resolution which will require the agencies which comprise the Federal inspection system to give equal emphasis to both law enforcement and the facilitation of passengers and cargo through our international airports. The resolution also requires the appropriate agencies to develop and jointly implement a national plan to consolidate their functions prior to the 1984 summer Olympics in Los Angeles. It is imperative that we move forward in our efforts to improve our outdated inspection system at U.S. gateway airports. Laws and regulations affecting the inspection of visitors and cargo today were originally enacted in the early days of steamship travel and as a result now impede the flow of international air commerce. With passage of the Tourism Policy Act. the Congress mandated the stimulation of travel to the United States through the encouragement of free and welcome entry of individuals traveling to the United States. consistent with current law. Nevertheless. little has been done to modernize the inspection process at U.S. airports of entry. The time has come for us to take advantage of the many economic benefits of increased international travel and trade. We can no longer ignore the demonstrated employment and tax revenue generating potential of the tourism industry which provides employment for 4.6 million Americans at every level of skill. or the $19 billion in Federal. State. and local tax income generated from travel related spending. For every 54 additional travelers to the United States one job is created in travelrelated businesses. An improved inspection system will help to make the United States a more attractive travel destination. therefore. creating more jobs and increasing revenue for the Treasury. Changes are badly needed at our airports of entry to relieve congestion and long delays for the traveling and shipping public. This resolution will initiate action which will not only focus attention on the issue. but will also create the opportunity to find needed solutions to an ongoing problem. This measure will not require the appropriation of any funds. nor will it intrude upon the jurisdictional authority of any committee. For these reasons. I urge your support for the resolution.*",

    "speech": "Madam President. the great expansion in production which precipitated the rise in program costs and corresponding growth of Governmentowned surpluses was the result of a number of factors. In the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977. Congress. fearing projected milk shortages. decided to increase the price support level to 80 percent of parity. adjusted semiannually. From 1978 through 1980. the unusually high support price was continually increased because of inflation. Specifically. from the beginning of fiscal year 1978. to the beginning of fiscal year 1981. the support price increased 40 percent. The distorted increases in the support price. along with low feed costs. reduced prices for beef. and depressed markets for other commodities combined to encourage many dairy famers to increase production. and some farmers outside of dairying to take on milking cows. In addition. over the past few decades. dairy cows have become increasingly more productive. Well established. and continually improving genetic procedures have increased the productive capacity of each dairy cow at an average rate of more than 2 percent per year over the last three decades. Coupled with this increase of productive capacity has been lagging consumption. Thirty years ago. the average American consumed the equivalent of 700 pounds or 350 quarts of milk a year in the form of fluid milk and dairy products. Today. per capita consumption averages the equivalent of 520 to 530 pounds or 260 to 265 quarts of milk. Over the past 20 years. there have been substantial decreases in the consumption of butter. cream. and plain whole milk. Consumption of lowfat milk and cheese. however. have increased significantly during this same period. The lagging consumption of milk can be attributed to a number of factors. However. a major cause has been the price support program. By guaranteeing a market for all dairy production. the Government reduces the incentive for the industry to go through the expense of promoting its products. Furthermore. attempts at voluntary promotion programs have traditionally faltered. as all those who benefit from the programs are not always willing to pay for the promotion. Advertising expenditures for milk lag well behind that for competing products. Madam President.

As one who has been very active in regard to this program and often critical of the action of the Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry Committee on this subject. I would like to take this opportunity to say that the committee has finally brought a piece of tobacco legislation to the floor that I can support. Over the past few years. I have pointed out to my colleagues that the tobacco program was actually working contrary to the interests of the farmers who grew tobacco. that the United States was losing its ability to compete in world tobacco markets. and that tobacco imports were reducing the sales of domestically produced tobacco here. Unfortunately. those who claimed to be concerned about the interest of the farmers would not recognize what their blind dedication to the existing program would mean to farmers. Instead they delayed and the situation went from bad to worse. The bill reported by the committee seeks to correct many of the problems I have pointed out to my colleagues over the past few years. It will move more allotments out of the hands of nonproducers and into the hands of farmers. It revises the price support level and places new controls on the lease and transfer of allotments. These changes are a welcome addition to the revisions made in the program by the No Net Cost Tobacco Program Act of 1982. and I urge my colleagues to support them.",

Mr. Speaker. 5. 1151 is a bill to compensate heir. of deceased Indians for improper payments from trust estates to States or political subdivisions as reimbursements for old age assistance received by decedents during their lifetime. For a number of years prior to 1962. the Department of the Interior followed a practice of reimbursing States for old age assistance paid to a deceased Indian during his lifetime. However. in 1962. In the case of Running Horse versus Udall. this practice was declared to be a violation of the law shielding trust property of Indians from any lien or encumbrance. As a result. it appears that these funds should be reimbursed to these estates and given out to the legitimate heirs. It is not clear exactly how much money was paid to the States but the Department of the Interior is estimating the figure to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million. 5. 1151 would allow the Secretary of the Interior to locate the heirs of such estates and reimburse them for their shares of the funds taken from the estates and given to the States. The bill authorizes $2.5 million for this purpose in each of fiscal years 198687. Mr. Speaker. 5. 1151 was introduced by Senator ANDREWS at the request of the administration. It is a bill which would give back to these heirs what was illegally taken from them in the first place.

I am proud of the hard work and the willingness to compromise that has characterized the Pennsylvania delegation in its efforts to make this bill a reality. Congressman CLINGER and I negotiated long and hard on the Pennsylvania wilderness bill which first passed the House in May. We are. of course. extremely happy that the bill was approved by the Senate this week. has been sent back again to the House and will be ready for the Presidents signature. The creation of wilderhess in the Allegheny National Forest was complicated by the fact that private subsurface mineral rights have to be bought outright. While we have received assurances from the Senate that $2 million for the subsurface rights in Hickory Creek will be appropriated. funds to buy out rights in other areas of the forest are not available. Thus. some areas with unique and valuable wilderness characteristics have been placed in a national recreation area for future generations to enjoy. The national recreation area should be managed to preserve and enhance its existing primitive and semiprimitive components. Protection of natural. scenic. scientific. historic. archaeological. ecological. and wildlife values is of primary concern. If mineral exploration or development must take place. it must be done in an environmentally sound manner. An environmental impact statement must accompany the management plan for the NRA. Standards for the protection and preservation of historic. archeological. and paleontological resources must be included as well as standards relating to the protection of surface and ground water. and stand. ards relating to revegetation and restoration of the surface of the land disturbed in performing exploration or development.

The Senate has amended the bill to make a minor boundary change in the proposed Indian Mounds Wilderness and to modify Housepassed provisions pertaining to a land exchange and the cancellation of timber sales. I find the changes acceptable. and urge my colleagues acceptance of the Senate amendments. Briefly. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3788as amendedwould designate five national forest wilderness areas in Texas. totaling approximately 34.346 acres. Not only would these areas be the first national forest wilderness in the State and the only wilderness in east Texas. but their wilderness value is enhanced by the fact that they be within a 2- to 3hour drive of Houston and a 4- to 5hour drive of Dallas. Residents of those two large population centers are increasingly utilizing the five proposed wildernesses for primitive recreation. Mr. Speaker. I am personally familiar with the two largest of the proposed wildernesses. Indian Mounds and Upland Island. by virtue of the subcommittees 1980 field inspection visit to east Texas. During that visit we spent several hours walking through the areas. and while they are not the classic mountainous terrain found in many other wildernesses. I nevertheless believe they will provide excellent opportunities for hiking. camping. hunting. and fishing in an area of the Nation that is largely devoid of such opportunities. I also believe that it is important to leave this small portion of east Texas in its wild state so that future generations will have the option of experiencing and studying some lands that have been largely unaltered by mans management. In considering the Senates amendments to the billand as I said. I find them acceptableI would underscore the fact that there are some lands within the proposed Indian Mounds and Graham Creek Wilderness that are privately owned. As is indicated in both the House and Senate committee reports on the legislation. it is Congress explicit intention that the Forest Service expeditiously acquire the private inholdings by exchange. We felt strongly about the acquisition on the House side that we actually referenced specific exchange parcels In the Housepassed bill. Due to certain perceived valuation questions. the",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3788. as amended. a bill designating wilderness areas in national forests in the State of Texas. The bill. which was referred jointly to the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. was passed by the House on May 8. 1984. The bill was amended by the Senate to encourage. rather than direct. the Secretary of Agriculture to make certain land exchanges that would enhance the management of the Upland Island and Indian Mounds Wilderness. I understand that the Sec. retary is agreeable to making the exchanges. Further. the Senate amendment would give purchasers of small acreages of timber within some of the areas to be designated as wilderness an option to cancel their contracts with the Secretary without payment of damages by either party. rather than to require the Secretary to terminate such contracts. Except for the changes I have described. H.R. 3788. as passed by the Senate. is subtantially the same as the Housepassed bill. It has the support of the Texas delegation and is not controversial. I concur in the Senate amendments and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.* Mr. Speaker. I withdraw my reservation of objection.",

Black Creek. comprises approximately 4.560 acres. and protects the watershed of a creek that is under study for wild or scenic. river designation. The second area. the 940acre Leaf area. represents a landform typical to southern Mississippi and would preserve an interesting mix of local flora and fauna. The areas would be the first onshore wilderness areas in the entire State. I believe S. 2808 is entirely without controversy and note that the Black Creek Wilderness proposal previously passed the House in 1980 as part of an omnibus wilderness bill . The gentleman from Mississippi introduced companion legislation in the House. H.R. 5965. on June 30 of this year. and the Subcommittee on Public Lands and National Parks held a hearing on the bill on September 27. The Reagan administration recommends enactment of the bill. In summary. therefore. I believe S. 2808 is meritorious legislation which deserves our support.",

The Senator from Kansas is correct: The understanding was that we would rotate the next time around. but no decision was made as to exactly when this would happen. Frankly. the Commission is functioning very well. I think that Congressman FASCELL is doing an excellent job as Chairman and he certainly is dedicated to the Commission and its work. Over the years I have noted that attendance by Commission members from the Senate. myself included. has often been poor. Whether this was due to a lack of time or of interest. I am not sure. But from the viewpoint of the national interest and of the Commission. it seemed best to leave the Chairmanship in the House. My colleagues know that I do not like to engage in partisan battles or squabbles about turf. I have felt. and I continue to feel. that Congressman FAscELL has run the Commission well. He has acquired a good deal of expert knowledge in the last 7 years. He is an enthusiastic and effective Chairman and I believe that he should continue to serve in that position. Also. frequent rotation of the Chairmanship creates the possibility of the staff running the Commission rather than the Chairman. Finally. in view of the tremendous amount of work all of us have as Senators. I question if any of us has the time to devote to the Chairmanship of the Commission. For all these reasons. I believe the present arrangement should be left as it is. When the time comes that Congressman FASCELL loses his vigor or his interest. than we can and should reconsider this issue.",

They gave up old weapons. and we cannot expect them to stop modernization. You can have a reduction in the numbers and still modernize so that you are not getting technologically behind which could result in an increase in the threat. There is a very basic change that I advocated in SALT II. The numbers would not have been that bad. We would be limiting warheads. The reason it became inconsequential was they had 2.500 Soviet launchers. It was widely played all across the country we were requiring them to reduce the number of launchers by 10 percent. which was true. They would destroy 250 launchers. bringing their total down to 2.250. That was fine as far as it goes. That is an elimination of 250 single warhead launchers. The only kicker in it was in landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles. It allowed both sides 820. The Soviets had approximately 500. That was an increase of 320 missiles with 10 warheads on each one that were allowed by the treaty. That is an increase of 320 with a reduction of 250. and that is not arms control. I am accused of being against arms control. That is not true. I am tough on arms control. I did not want a fraud imposed on the American people by approving an agreement that on the one hand reduced 250 singlewarhead launchers and let the Soviet deploy an additional 300 plus 10warhead missiles. We should be talking about reductions in the threat. which is posed by warheads. Holes in the ground. or launchers. are not a threat. That is why this new MX Commission recommendation to seek reductions in nuclear warheads makes a great deal of sense to me. If we want peace and stability in this world. you eliminate what can kill you. A launcher cannot kill you. but a warhead can. I want reductions in warheads. and I think that it is incredibly important in arms control negotiations. regardless of what administration is in office. that the goal be to reduce the number of warheads on both sides.",

I asked him about the United States not deploying any more landbased ICBMs. in effect freezing those systems at 1.054 since 1970. I asked Mr. Warnke about the cancellation of the B1 and other examples of U.S. restraint in deploying weapons systems. I asked if he could give me one single example of where the Soviet Union had reciprocated as a result of our own restraint. He could not. Therefore. I would assume the Soviet Union would have gone ahead and MIRVd as soon as the technology was available to them whether we did so or not. So I think we were forced into a situation of MIRVing. The Senator has asked me about these bargaining chips becoming part of the arsenal. But. on the other hand. is there any logic in your study of weapons control systems where you can show me when we have made unilateral decision after unilateral decision that the Soviet Union has backed off? I will ask the Senator the same question I asked Paul Warnke. Can you give me an example of where they have? In other words. if we do not go ahead with the MX. do you think they are going to cut a half or a third or 20 percent of their SS18 force? How do we get them to do that? What incentive is there for them to do that?",

The Soviets are playing a strategy that. in the end. the West will not move ahead with the bargainingchip arrangement because of the sentiment developing in the European countries. It would seem to me. if the administration wanted to address that problem. their single most constructive decision would have been either not to have sent Mr. Adelmans nomination to the Senate or to have withdrawn it when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to delay the vote. or following the adverse vote in the committee. They are failing. as a consequence of not having taken that action. to establish the bona fides or their credentials on this very important arms control issue as it affects public perceptions in Europe and in this country as well. This nomination has a dimension beyond the substance of Mr. Adelmans views. It goes to the question of his qualifications. the nature of his testimony before the committee. the perception of his own commitment. and knowledge in the arms control field. The administration could have sent to the Senate a nomination of which virtually every Member of the Senate would have said. \"Well. I may agree or disagree with this or that view of his. but this is clearly a person of tremendous stature. of clear competence. and a real heavyweight to be dealing with what may be the most critical issue of our time.\" that would have created a perception on the part of our European allies. or parts of their public. and in our own country of the seriousness with which we are approaching the arms control issue. This fellow is to be head of the Agency in our Government established to address specifically arms control and disarmament and he is charged by statute with primary responsibility within the Government for arms control and disarmament matters. We clearly need someone in that job who. in effect. creates a sense in our public and in the public of our allies that we are in earnest about this arms control business.",

This administration is serious about arms control. I talked to President Reagan. then just private citizen Reagan. all during 1979. I constantly had conversations with him because he was interested in SALT II. He wanted to learn. Since he became President. I have had numerous opportunities to talk to him about these issues and there was nothing that concerned him more than arms control. He said he wanted to be very well prepared before starting the negotiations because the Soviets had the same bargainers there that they had for the last 12 or 13 years. Maybe I am betraying some confidence. but I told some of the people down at the White House. \"Look. with what is going on. I recognize you want to be well prepared. you want to have well thoughtout options. you dont want to go over there cold. but this movement for immediate arms control is going to come along.\" So the only mistake I see the Reagan administration has made is not agreeing to some talks. or about the shape of the table soon enough. so that the socalled peace movement could not say in June 1982 that they finally forced Ronald Reagan into negotiations. I resent that constant implication that the President is not serious about arms control. This man is as serious about it as you or any other Member of this body. There is a difference of opinion in how you treat the Soviet Union. and history tells me and tells President Reagan that you do not treat them the way we have in the past. turning the other cheek and handling them with kid gloves.

In a matter of this consequence. we ought to have before us a nominee about whom Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. of differing views on the nature of the approaches to arms control. agree that. yes. this is a person of the highest quality to deal with an issue of top priority.

In this case I am not advancing my opposition to this nomination essentially on the basis of his positions as much as I am his lack of reaching that important threshold with respect to qualifications. experience. knowledge. and with the perception of him as a heavyweight in this field.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. in January of 1980. some 1.700 delegates assembled to hold a National Conference on Small Business in Washington. These delegates had been elected by the 25.000 fellow small businesses who previously attended 57 local conferences or had been appointed by elected officials. After a weeklong conference. these delegates approved 60 recommendations. Of this number. the top 15 involved taxation. inflation. and regulation and were given top priority status by the conference. The Small Business Committee promptly considered legislation. where necessary. to implement the recommendations. I am proud to report that subsequently enacted legislation included the Regulatory Flexibility Act. the Small Business Innovation Development Act. the Prompt Payment Act. and several procurement initiatives. as well as the inclusion of some of the tax recommendation in the Economic Recovery Tax Act. I am also pleased to report that these measures are being used as models and legislation is being enacted in many States to deal with these subjects. Mr. Speaker. next January. 5 years will have elapsed since the prior conference. I believe that after the election this year. it is time to convene another conference. Much was accomplished last time. but much more can be done. As a result. I introduced H.R. 5298. and I was joined by more than 50 other Members as cosponsors. including my ranking minority members. JOE McDADE. Very simply. this bill authorizes the President to hold a Small Business Conference between January 1. 1985. and September 1. 1986. This action would be preceded by State and regional conferences to elect delegates who would be joined in Washington by delegates appointed by the President. Members of Congress. and Governors. At the conclusion of the conference. a report with findings and recommendations would be made to the President and the Congress. Mr. Speaker. this bill unanimously was endorsed by small business associations. It was approved on a bipartisan basis by the members of the Small Business Committee and I want to thank all of the committee members for their cooperation in facilitating expeditious consideration of this bill.

I want to commend the chairman of our Small Business Committee. the gentleman from Maryland for the work that he has put into creating a very important piece of legislation that I think deserves and merits the support of all of our colleagues in the House. Having attended the 1980 White House Conference on Small Business. I believe that it was indeed a great success. It called the attention of the President and the Congress to the special problems faced by small business owners in the areas of capital formation. minority business enterprise. innovation and technology. procurement. tax and Federal regulatory policiesjust to name a few. In the 4 years since that conference. as the chairman has just indicated. a number of pieces of legislation have come to fruition as a result of the recommendations of that conference. We have. as a matter of fact. accepted 11 of the 15 priority areas and ranked those issues accordingly. Those were the choices made by the delegates to that particular conference. The conference was also important because it focused on the vital role played by the small business sector in the wellbeing of our American economy. and it particularly talked about ideas such as innovation. jobs creation. and generally regulated tax issues. It is time to reassess the status of small business. This bill sets in motion the mechanism whereby small business owners across this country can meet at State and regional levels to discuss and offer solutions to problems which concern them. These grassroots proposals will be brought by elected delegates to this White House Conference where an agenda for possible legislative action will again be developed. The passage of this legislation will provide a tremendous service to the small business community. and will underscore our commitment to its success. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5298.

Mr. Speaker. small business is the infantry of American capitalism. and that is the place where any recovery that deeply affects the future wellbeing of this country is going first to occur. That is the place where the new jobs will be generated. that is the place where a breakthrough will be announced that the matters that have been troubling our economy in past years are no longer with us. Our economy is changing. though. and it is becoming increasingly complex. which means that small businesses face obstacles and opportunities that were not around 10 years ago. The Federal Government especially. given the size of its budget. has got to be responsive to the changing demands of small business. Last February. in Tucson. Ariz.. a conference was held to assist small businesses in Federal procurement. The thirst for this effort is revealed by the fact that over 500 people paid $12 each to come and hear for 2 days from people representative of the whole range of Federal governmental activities. All of them qualified for the designation of small business. As of today. five of the people who attended those conferences have received Government contracts. and that kind of cooperation between Government and small business needs to be nurtured. It is good for small business. it is good for the Federal Government. and it is good. most of all. for our sense of wellbeing. Mr. Speaker. numerous economic profiles and projections point to the role that small businesses will continue to play as the Nations primary job creator. As legislators. we need to understand the role and function of our Nations small businesses and be responsive to that vital sector of our economy. Heightened awareness of the problems and contributions of small business is necessary to identify the executive and legislative action that is needed. So the bill that we are considering today addresses that need in a most appropriate way. and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage.",

It is important to remember that over 98 percent of the businesses of this country are classified as small businesses. They employ 47.8 percent of the nongovernmental. nonagricultural work force. Small businesses generate 42 percent of the sales in the United States and comprise a healthy 38 percent of GNP. The bill calls for consideration of various issues of vital importance to small businesses in Puerto Rico: The Conference will assist small businesses in carrying out its role as the Nations job creator. our State currently suffers from an unemployment rate of over 20 percent. the Conference will examine the status of minorities and women as small business owners. most small businesses in Puerto Rico fall into one of these categories.

These amendments. along with the other changes proposed by the bill. will refine and improve the longshore compensation program. Insurers will be able to make more accurate projections to set rates and reserves for future payment. thus making their risks more \"insurable.\" Employer will benefit from reduced costs of insurance.

I recall so very well when we were debating wilderness bills recently before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs that new findings that 6 months ago had not been true in the industry but were true at that moment of the debate. was changing the attitude considerably of the members of the committee and of the support of a given piece of legislation simply because new knowledge was available. If we are to believe that all knowledge now exists in this area. if we are to believe that further research and the direction of students in the area of research in the minerals field cannot benefit us short term and long term. then I think we are very shortsighted at best. Not only is this a benefit to the University of Idaho and the School of Mines there. but to a good many other institutes across the country and most assuredly it offers to this Nation the kind of informational and educational base that will serve us so well in the years ahead as we continue to strive to maintain a degree of independence as a nation when it comes to being able to effectively utilize and to research for new areas of mineral exploration.

The products of this industry. energy. minerals. and metals. are crucial to our economy and to the maintenance of our standard of living. Today our mining industry faces many serious problems. The grade of our ores is declining while labor. transportation and environmental costs are increasing. To stay competitive in the international field. we must continually increase our productivity and find innovative methods of production. The key to this is our people. We need the best educated and trained individuals in the world. I believe this bill will help accomplish that goal. By providing financial assistance to several of our institutes of higher learning. we facilitate the ongoing development of programs which will produce the research and instruction vital to a modern education in the mining industry. In addition. this bill recognizes that States and industry cannot do this alone. They need Federal assistance. In a matter of such critical importance to our Nation. the Federal Government should be involved. But just as importantly. this legislation continues to recognize that this area is not the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. While the current law provides for Federal funding to be matched dollar for dollar with nonFederal dollars. this bill specifies that in fiscal 1985 and 1986. each Federal dollar be matched by $1V2 nonFederal. For fiscal 1987 and beyond. each Federal dollar will be matched by $2 nonFederal. I believe this bill will make a significant contribution to our Nations mining industry. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.o",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4214. a bill to reauthorize the State Mining and Mineral Institute program. The program provides significant benefits to both the industry and to the Nation. The institutes train individuals in a wide range of disciplines relating to mining and these individuals. after completing their education. find jobs with the mining industry. and share their training and knowledge. The institutes also make research available which is of great value to the industry for maximizing the recovery of minerals that are needed for our Nations domestic supply and for our national security. H.R. 4214 would authorize $7.5 million in fiscal year 1985. to be increased by $1 million per year through 1989. The bill requires the matching of Federal funds from State and private sources on a 1 2 to 1 and then on a 2toi basis. In this way. Federal dollars are used to encourage State and private investment in minerals research. Given the importance of our efforts as a nation to achieve independence from unstable foreign sources of minerals and energy. I am firmly convinced that the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote research and development of new mining technologies. I strongly support H.R. 4214 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting to suspend the rules and pass this very important piece of legislation.9",

I am an original cosponsor of this legislation introduced by Congressman JIM MCNULTY. to reauthorize and improve the State Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Program. I want to commend my friend and colleague from Arizona for his outstanding work on bringing this important legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker. the State Mining and Mineral Institutes across the country have proven to be very effective in training people for careers in mineral and mining industries and in improving our mineral research capabilities. However. we must continue to improve our mining techniques in order to remain competitive in the world marketplace. According to the State Mineral Resources Research Institute at New Mexico Tech. our lack of improved technology in the mining field has become a serious problem. The United States is being forced to purchase an everincreasing amount of mining technology from other nations. We must put a stop to this dangerous trend. This legislation makes a number of improvements in the Mining and Mineral Institute Program by requiring an increased financial support from the community and industry and by assuring coordination between educational facilities. industry. and Government. Mr. Speaker. I am confident this legislation will revitalize the Mining and Mineral Institute Program and make certain that our mining industry is supplied with the best technology and the most talented employees possible. I urge Members to vote for H.R. 4214.0",

But you have the option then of using it as an SS20 is used in the Soviet Union. as we asked the Europeans to base the Pershing. It is available in a crisis situation where you might want to disperse your raid point even further to go out on highway systems or to have a system that is not even necessarily wedded to highway systems. You could have a large tracked vehicle or a largetired vehicle that can go off the highway. even. but that is less likely. But the whole concept of the mobile. whether it is the SS20 in the Soviet Union or the Pershing in Europe. is that it could. in a crisis situation where we really need it for survial. go anywhere. I say that I am not proposing that we get out and have these running up and down the highways of the country all the time. now. I am saying in a crisis situation. if you have that kind of flexibility of maneuver. that is exactly the doubt that is put in the Soviet mind. that is the perception in the Soviet mind that you have that. and that they cannot possibly hit all the targets where this mobile missile might be.

Then you have to have one guidance system per warhead as opposed to one guidance system in the MX for 10 warheads. That is an expense. The comparable man/woman power situations with the two systems are that the fixed MX system is relatively less manpower oriented compared with the mobile system. And lastly. you have a very expensive concept just on the drawing boards at this time with respect to the hardened launcher. So the aggregate of these new elements indeed I do not believe allows the argument that this is going to be a cheaper system.",

I quote from page 15: The development effort for such a missilethat is. a small oneneed not and should not be burdened with the uncertainties accompanying a crash program. thus its timing can be such that competitive development is feasible. Decisions about such a small missile and its basing will be influenced by several potential developments: the evolution of Soviet strategic programs. the path of arms control negotiations and agreements. general trends in technology. the cost of the program. operational considerations. and the results of our own research on specific basing modes. Although the small missile program should be pursued vigorously. the way these uncertainties are resolved will inevitably influence the size and nature of the program.",

It is an engineering matter. It is a matter of putting enough time and people on it to make certain that we do have the kind of vehicle we want. We do not need to invent anything new. We do not need a whole new concept or technology developed. I note in the committee report. however. on the Scrowcroft Commission letter to the President dated March 21. 1984. it says: For the current and anticipated environment. a planned deployment of 100 missiles is appropriate. The committee report goes on to say. right after that: While this deployment plan does not provide the desired degree of survivability. on balance. the committee believes it essential that deployment proceed to achieve the December 31. 1986 initial operational capability. So the committee in its reports says that it does not achieve the desired degree of survivability by its very nature. and so why go ahead with that? Why not come up with something that does get survivable so that we will really have something that the Soviets know is not a paper tiger. is not something that they can shoot at and knock out. is not an even more attractive target than that which we are giving up. so it becomes a priority target in case war starts.

So. on its face. this proposal was going to be rejected. Now there are those that can say. \"Well. it is an opening position. It was subject to negotiation.\" But what many of us have urged this administration to do and what the American people have urged their President to do is to recognize that we have the capability of mutual destruction in this world. And recognizing that any first strike. whether by the United States or the Soviet Union. is going to bring about national suicide. then why not go ahead and say to the Soviets: \"We recognize that you are ahead in landbased missiles. We are ahead in the seabased and as well as in the airbased weapons. Therefore. lets go for a verifiable freeze and then move toward reductions.\" I think that would have been a good deal simpler. It would have been more comprehensive and it would have provided. I think. a more responsible opportunity for constructive negotiation.

I have long supported the concept of this missile as a logical and defensible step in our national security effort. But for just as long a time. I have maintained that the basing mode for this missile must be mobile or deceptive. To make this extraordinary expenditure of funds. only to place the missile in the totally vulnerable. precisely targeted Minuteman silos. has always seemed to me an unacceptable proposal. It just makes no sense to me to vote for the MX if we put that weapon in soft silos in our Western States. where their locations are already known to the Soviets. Such vulnerability is simply inviting disaster. The Soviets can very easily pinpoint and destroy our MX system in soft silos. I cannot in good conscience vote for a proposal which says. \"Put the MX where everyone knows where it is. and where it cannot be protected.\" That approach is a terrible waste of money. and a total waste of a weapons system that would otherwise offer a strong defense for our Nation. It is my firm conviction that the American people want a basing mode offering deceptivity and mobility or at least. in the alternative. deceptivity of mobility. Unfortunately. the proposal we have before us today doesnt even come close to that view. In short. Mr. President. with a mobile or deceptive basing mode. I could support the MX.

I believe it is important not to eliminate all activity on the MX in the context of the Soviet Unions withdrawal from the Geneva arms reduction talks. The authorization in this bill is only a half step since funding will have to be completed in the appropriations process before the MX program can go forward. Last year. I voted in favor of authorization for the MX as part of an arrangement where President Reagan took significant steps on arms reduction including commitments to support builddown. retaining the Scowcroft Commission as a permanent disarmament body and the beginning of work on the new Midgetman single warhead mobile missile. Later in 1983. I voted against appropriating funds for the MX program because it was my view. at that time. that the United States should be taking more affirmative steps on promoting arms reduction talks with the U.S.S.R. For the same reason. I voted in late 1983 in favor of the mutually verifiable nuclear arms freeze. In my judgment. the international climate is substantially different at this time because of the Soviets withdrawal from Geneva talks. The President has recently repeatedly stated his willingness to discuss nuclear arms reduction with the Soviet Union. President Reagans personal appeal for support for the MX at this stage is compelling as he seeks this extra measure of strength and congressional support as an inducement to bring the Soviets back to the bargaining table. The whole concept of armaments as a basis for deterrence raises subtle psychological factors as a matter of judgment and feel for U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations based on a wide variety of factors. After studying the matter intensely and talking to people about this subject. including thousands of Pennsylvanians at open house/town meetings over the past 31/2 years. it is my considered judgment that the MX missile program should not be abandoned at this time.",

It is important that they as well as we remain. so that the Government of Lebanon can get its activities together for the purpose of imposing controls once again over its territory. I know. as does the Senator from New Hampshire. that a great tragedy occurred there. Perhaps it is not inappropriate at this time to assess the blame. Great tragedies have been imposed upon the Lebanese people for years. and we hope that will soon be coming to an end. But while the serious restrictions spoken of have been placed on the military activities of our own people. they are far more secure and they are in better positions than some of our allies in the multinational force. who have also come in the hope of bringing a peaceful solution to the affairs of Lebanon.

The Senator from New Hampshire is one of the most valued members of the Armed Services Committee. He has been to Lebanon He was there at the time when the unfortunate bombing occurred. and I think he feels very strongly about doing everything we can to prevent a recurrence of this type of thing. In that objective. I agree with himHowever. I do have grave reservations about trying to legislate on this matter. even though it is not statutorily binding. It is simply a sense of the Senate on a matter of some detail regarding some security arrangements with which most Members of the Senate are not familiar. with which there is not perhaps an adequate record of hearings and information that needs to be available to Senators. I hope we can avoid doing this kind of thing. I think it gets us too much into the detailed business of the micromanagement of the implementation of foreign policy or national security policy. I hope that the Senator from New Hampshire will not persist in this. It is not germane to the matter at hand. Again. I have some concerns about offering issues of this sort in the form of amendments to a reconciliation bill It is my understanding that a point of order could lie against this proposition. But I think that. aside from that. in principle it is not a good idea to try to legislate on matters of this kind on short notice. on the Senate floor. without anything that has gone before in the way of hearings of building up a record or some general information on the part of the Senate. The way the amendment has been reworded and rephrased. I think it removes some of the more objectionable provisionsnot objectionable from the standpoint that the recommendations contained therein are not good. but objectionable to the extent that it gets us into the business of the micromanagement of maintaining security for troops in foreign areas.

We had considerable debate earlier today and it was detailed by Members of a number of instances where human knowledge has been advanced as the result of such research. In this amendment a waiver procedure allows for fetal research. which would have to be approved by six levels of peer review: An institutional review board. NIH study section initial review. a National Advisory Council review. the Institutes staff and directory review. the Department of Health and Human Services Ethical Advisory Board and also the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In any of these six levels of peer review. an application could be barred from funding if it is found that the research would lack adequate protection for the fetus. Mr. Chairman.

It seems to me that the amendment we have before us deals with that very drafting problem that I pointed out before. that it says that in circumstances where there is little or no risk to the fetus we can indeed conduct that kind of research if after all sorts of levels of reviews there is a finding both of lack of harm and of the potential benefits.

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program at NIH is off to a fast start. On September 30. 1983. the NIH made 123 research grant awards totaling $6.2 million to small. high technology companies. The NIH staff. from Secretary Heckler on down. is very enthusiastic about the potential that the SBIR program offers to our Nations health research efforts. Earlier this year. Mrs. Heckler wrote me that: The Public Health Service is expending a vigorous effort to make small businesses an integral part of its research and development programs. P.L. 97219 as it currently stands provides the Department of Health and Human Services the opportunity to continue to ensure that the SBIR program will be carried out to its maximum potential and it is our intent that the Department will be at the forefront in making this legislation a success. In the summer of 1982. after passing the House by a vote of 35357 and the Senate by a vote of 900. the President signed Public Law 97219. the Small Business Innovation Development Act. into law. This landmark small business legislation established highly competitive research and development programs for small. high tech companies at 11 Federal agencies. Each of these agencies is required to support their SBIR program with a small portion of their extramural R&D budget. sixtenths of 1 percent of fiscal year 1984. This program had been modeled quite successfully at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. The NSF experience showed that SBIR winners had very high rates of job creation. In addition. NSF research funds invested in SBIR winners have been leveraged almost 10 times by private sector funds. No other Federal program can boast this record.",

The first provision authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to arrange for the conduct of a study by the Institute of Medicine regarding the use of animals in behavioral and biomedical research within 18 months of enactment of the bill. The second provision requires that each facility that receives research funds from NIH have an internal Animal Care Committee. This requirement for a functional Animal Care Committee is intended to increase institutional accountability for the maintenance of animals used in research. Many facilities already have such committees. This provision would provide assurance that every institution would have an appropriately constituted and functional committee. The third provision directs NIH to systematically develop alternatives to the use of animals in research and testing. The development of alternatives is now being done by private industry and by privately funded university programs. Alternative methods are not only more humane. they are faster. cheaper. and often more reliable than using animals. The Government is now using approximately 45 million animals a year. including primates. dogs. cats. rabbits. and other species. and spending between $2 and $3 billion a year for research using these animals. It would be inhumane and fiscally irresponsible not to develop alternatives to animal use. These animal provisions are a progressive step. I urge your support of them.*",

In light of the recent Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of a congressional veto. the bill simply addresses that problem by changing concurrent resolution to joint resolution. This would of course make it compatible with the existing Supreme Court decision on that subject. So it is a simple extension of the act with that provision. Mr. Speaker. the use by the President of emergency powers to implement export controls for purposes of U.S. national security. and to further certain U.S. foreign policy goals. is",

I think we are creating somewhat of a problem in that we are now under a state of national emergency under IEPA and if we pass an extension of the Export Administration Act. does that mean that the President is then going to do away with the national emergency and go back under the Export Administration Act? There is no way we are going to have an Export Administration Act by February 29. I do not think we are extending the date long enough because if we come back January 23. by the time the other body acts. by the time the conferees act. it comes back to this House. we are not going to get the job done by February 29.

Indeed. the Soviet invasion and continued occupation violate the principles of that act. At the same time we persist in opposing this unconscionable Soviet behavior. we should also give all appropriate support to those who are enduring the most hardshipthe people of Afghanistan. Opportunities are readily available for the Soviet Union to negotiate a settlement that would lessen world tensions and return freedom to Afghanistan. Regrettably. the Soviet Union has not yet taken advantage of the possibilities. The world needs to persist in opposing the Soviet behavior and in aligning with the people struggling for freedom.

I want particularly to commend Chairman FASCXLL for bringing this resolution to the floor before the close of business in this House. I think it is an important action that we take today. It has been 4 years since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and began their brutal occupation of the Afghan nation. In those 4 years neither the executive branch nor the legislative branch has Issued a statement of support for the Afghan resistance that goes beyond praise for Afghan efforts to free their country. Senate Concurrent Resolution 74 presents effective support for the Afghan liberation movement. The Afghan people are struggling against a brutal occupation by. the worlds most powerful land army. In 1983. Soviet troop strength in Afghanistan reached an all time high. and the firepower of hundreds of helicopter gunships has devastated one valley after another. The result has been tens of thousands of casualties and more than 3 million people leaving the country as refugees. Yet the freedom fighters. in an heroic lopsided struggle. have held on and even repulsed Soviet offensives in the province of Paktia and In the PanJshire Valley. It is time that the United States show the people of Afghanistan that the U.S. Congress has not forgotten their struggle. and that the pursuit of freedom is admired and supported by the United States. The Afghan resistance is a genuine expression of the independence and dignity of the Afghan people. and their struggle to liberate their country from 4 foreign invader deserves the attention and support of us all.

S. 2470. is designed to remedy a problem that arose when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued for consideration a new rule known as the \"Insider Safeguards Rule.\" Under the provisions of this rule. a new section 73.56 would be added to title 10 Code of Federal Regulations. This section would require licensees of nuclear powerplants to conduct background investigations on all personnel who require unescorted access to the protected and vital areas of nuclear powerplants. The goal of providing background for the employer to consider when hiring personnel at a nuclear powerplant is one I believe will enjoy wide. bipartisan support. The effectiveness of this regulation. however. is severely undermined because the criminal histories of said personnel are not available to the licensee. Consequently. Senator DENToN introduced S. 2470 to remedy that deficiency. I support his legislation because I believe that such information is vital to the protection of the public health and safety. This is a timely piece of legislation I would urge all of my colleagues to support.*",

Lodwick to be a Commissioner of the International Trade Commission. Mr. Lodwick is well qualified for the position to which he has been nominated. Seeley until recently served as Under Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. He also has held the positions of secretary of the Commodity Credit Corporation. and associate administrator of the U.S. Department of Agricultures Stabilization and Conservation Service. A former Iowa State senator. Mr. Lodwick also has farmed and managed livestock and grain farms. and farm supply and grain elevator businesses. Mr. Lodwick holds a degree in political science from Iowa State University. I am delighted that farmers will have Seeley to contribute his agricultural expertise to the Commissions work. The Commission serves important interests of the Congress. It investigates unfair trade practice complaints. makes determinations of whether dumped or subsidized imports are injuring U.S. firms. conducts investigations into whether imports are surging so as to injure seriously domestic industries. and performs other trade studies as requested by the Congress and the President. The workload of the ITC is at an alltime high. and as trade becomes an increasingly important part of the U.S. economy. the Commissions reports are more essential than ever to the work of the President and the Congress in the trade area. The Senate must approve Commissioners who will undertake their responsibilities with the utmost seriousness and dedication. To insure that such persons are appointed. the Congress wrote into law that the President shall nominate as Commissioners only persons whoIn his judgment ... are possessed of qualifications requisite for developing expert knowledge of international trade problems and efficiency in administering the duties and functions of the Commission. Seeley Lodwick. of course. already has extensive experience in the trade area. He will add a great deal to the Commissions work on agricultural and other trade matters. The Commission has been without its full complement of six Commissioners since last fall. It is vitally important that we restore the Commission to full strength as soon as possible so that the ITC can perform as efficiently and effectively as possible. I thus urge my colleagues to support and to approve Mr. Lodwicks nomination without delay.",

H.R. 3677. the Medicare Hospice Reimbursement Act. the companion measure to S. 1592. offered by Senator DOLE on June 29. 1983. of which I am a cosponsor. I was unavoidably delayed and was not here to lend my voice in support of H.R. 3677. I would like now. for the RECORD. to express my support for that bill which amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct provisions relating to the cap for hospice care. The maximum Federal payment to hospice care programs for terminally ill medicare recipients would be raised from $4.200 per patient to $6.500. This cap would be adjusted in the future according to annual changes in the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. This legislation is expected to save the medicare program $100 million over the next 5 years by partly replacing more expensive hospital care. The benefits of this legislation go beyond cost containment in the health field. It should encourage a more humane alternative to medicare for families across the country with members facing a terminal illness. namely. hospice services. The hospice approach operates on the principle that the dying have special needs and wants that busy hospital staffs. preoccupied with tending the curable. cannot provide. It offers the means for family members to care for such loved ones either at home or at hospice centers. Recently a good friend of mine. Mr. A. A. \"Bud\" Smyser. former editor of the Honolulu StarBulletin. shared with me his funeral remarks upon the death of his wife. Betty. He did so. knowing of this pending legislation. with the thought that his experience with the hospice program \"may offer one case study of how we can perhaps make terminal death less fearsome.\" So that the views. beautifully and poetically expressed by one who witnessed and experienced firsthand the hospice care of a dearly beloved life companion. may be shared by readers unanimous consent that \"Bud\" Smysers remarks at the funeral of his wife Betty be printed in the RECORD following my remarks.",

The Department was established pursuant to legislation introduced by Hiram Hawkins. a State senator from Barbour County. His measure. which created the Alabama Department of Agriculture. was given legislative sanction on February 23. 1883. and stipulated that the department would become operational on September 1 of that year. The department began as a twoperson operation. consisting of the commissioner and his clerk for regulating the sale and distribution of fertilizer. Today the department. which became the Department of Agriculture and Industries with the adoption of the 1901 constitution in Alabama. performs more than 100 services ranging from food and drug inspection activities to international market development. It is interesting to me that the first Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture was Edward C. Betts. Commissioner Betts was from Madison County. as is the current commissioner. Albert McDonald. Their backgrounds are very similar. Both were successful farmers and both served in the Alabama State Legislature. Through the years. Mr. President. there has been a high degree of cooperation between the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries and its agricultural and business constituency.

I appreciate his cooperation. and that of his able staff. in agreeing to this change. I trust that an appropriate provision will be reached subsequently by the conferees on S. Both of the Hawaii Senators. together with 25 other Members of this body. sponsored my impact aid amendment to the DOD authorization bill. No similar provision was included in the Housepassed version of the bill. Yesterday. conferees agreed to increase from $455 to $565 million the overall authorization ceiling for impact aid (Public Law 81874). increase authority for section 2 from $10 to $20 million. and continue authority for \"B\" category children through fiscal year 1984 at onethird of entitlement. I appreciate greatly the efforts of the conferees. particularly the efforts of the distinguished ranking member of the Education Subcommittee. Senator PELL. who cosponsored the amendment and upheld the Senates position in the conference. I hope that the federally impacted schools in this Nation will recognize the crucial role the Senator from Rhode Island played in obtaining this essential increase in spending authority. Mr. President. I have been advised that the Senator from Utah will ask also to delete the remaining impact aid language from S. 1008. on the grounds that it is superfluous in light of the action taken yesterday by the conferees. Again. I appreciate the Senator from Utahs statement explaining this deletion and I thank him for his assistance.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. S. 1008 has the primary purpose of making technical and clarifying amendments to the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. which Congress passed as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act in 1981. ECIA was passed to provide greater flexibility in the administration and delivery of compensatory education services to disadvantaged children. Additionally. ECIA created a new education block grant. During the legislative deliberations over ECIA. certain technical errors were made. some sections which provided flexibility in the old title 1 law were dropped. and various ambiguities were created because some sections of ECIA were less than clear. As a result of close collaboration with the House Education and Labor Committee. a technical amendments bill was passed late in the 97th Congress. Unfortunately. the President vetoed that legislation. and Congress did not have the opportunity to vote to override that veto. Thus. we are presented again with the responsibility to make these corrections in ECIA in response to the comments and suggestions offered by concerned educators. Additionally. S. 1008 makes changes in other laws. changes which this Senator believes are necessary. These revisions include freezing certain definitions of migrant children. and correcting a specific inequity affecting impact aid payments to Hawaii. This Senator wants to express his appreciation to the majority leader. the minority leader. the chairman of the full committee. Mr. HATCH. the ranking member. Mr. KENNEDY. and my good friend and colleague on the Subcommittee on Education. Mr. PELL. for their cooperation in bringing this legislation before the Senate at this time. It is my hope that S. 1008 will soon become law. Another school year will begin shortly. and it is time that these corrections in ECIA were put in place.",

Although I believe that the delayedeffectivedate approach to these benefits is essential. as I have noted. I continue to believe strongly in the value of educational incentives both to enhance recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces and as a sound investment in the future of our Nation. I also fully concur with the sentiment that one does not wait to fix the roof until it is raining. The time to address the issues involved in educational incentives and their relationship to the needs of the AllVolunteer Force is nownot when recruitment and retention problems again reach emergency proportions.

I must oppose the ArmstrongCranston amendment because it would not establish a GI bill as history defines it. but would open a Pandoras box of future uncontrolled spending. I cannot in good conscience support major spending legislation that has not been produced through and considered in the normal committee process within the Senate. I cannot agree to legislation that does not take effect until 1987. I cannot agree to legislation that has no controls and no termination date. I cannot agree to legislation that adds more uncontrolled and openended entitlements to an already bloated entitlement system. I cannot agree to legislate firm commitments for an unknown future. I do support educational benefits for the veterans of America who have done so much for our country. I support benefits for the men and women who serve now. and who will serve. in our AllVolunteer Forces. I recognize that they are ready to lay their lives on the line. indeed that they are doing it in places such as Lebanon and the Sinai. But. Mr. President. there already is a veterans education assistance program that is doing a good job and providing good education benefits today. I am interested in developing a new package of veterans benefits before the current GI bill expires in 1989. I will support the effort of the Veterans Affairs Committee to develop a bill that is fair to all veterans and fits within the budget requirements with which we all must live. There is plenty of time to do that correctly and with full consideration. We cannot jump into major spending programs with blinders on. Now is the time to put our foot down. stop unnecessary spending. and get on to high priority items.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me just summarize very swiftly in that 2 minutes. This particular GI bill has never been introduced or considered in this Congress in its present form. It is very different from every other recent proposal. including the proposals of Senator CommN. And his consistency has been admirable over the years. Under this proposal we would have an effective date 4 years hence. We have never had that before. We would repeal VEAP. We have never had that before. We would have a combination of a grant program and a contributory program for career members. We have never had that before. There are a lot of things about this measure that we have never had. I think it will prove to be a disincentive instead of an incentive because. in effect. what will happen with an effective date of 1987 is a resulting chill on recruitment efforts. Why do this now? Why not wait until this thing comes to pass in 1987? But finally. Senators should determine what will happen when the DOD gets this if it passes. The DOD has never handled a GI bill. They have never administered a GI bill. What will occur? I have a hunch. It will become an obligation and be placed in the budget of the Veterans Administration. It will increase competition for the 01 bill dollar. The generosity of this measure could be absolutely deleterious and destructive to the present G1 bill support systems. and that would be a result none of us could ascribe to.

But to zero a system entirely to fund these systems. in my view. is certainly not prudent. It is not consistent with the best judgment of our professional military people on the scene. I think we must act very carefully in the Senate when we secondguess professional military men who actually have the responsibility for fighting. I know civilians should make policy. we all agree with that. Civilians should determine when policy is to be implemented by military means. But once that decision is made.

S. 2844. I am convinced that congressional approval of S. 2844 will help coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to prevent arson by increasing cooperation and information distribution.

The end result will be a more focused strategy and a more efficient use of Federal resources. Mr. President. arson is a cowardly and thoughtless destroyer of life and property.

Clearly these figures demonstrate the need for a coherent and organized Federal approach to this problem. This bill. which is currently pending in the Committee on Governmental Affairs. of which I am a member. would create a task force to outline the most effective manner for the Federal Government to wage the fight against arson. This task force would specifically consider the best ways for the Federal Government to assist State and local governments. It would coordinate antiarson training. grant assistance. research and development. as well as compile relevant statistical information and report annually to Congress. This report will help Congress come to grips with the nature and the extent of arson as a national problem so that it can deal with it in an educated fashion.

PA. a group formed 10 years ago to provide transportation and assistance for persons aged 60 or over. During the past decade. this council has provided over 100.000 rides to 50.000 persons. enough people to fill Pennsylvania State Universitys Beaver Stadiu. While Dauphin County has provided the vans and insurance coverage. the senior citizens council has supplied and organized volunteers as drivers and dispatchers as well as October . 1984 paid for all the operating and maintenance costs. The councils vans have logged more than 250.000 miles. 10 times the distance around the Earth at the Equator. This service has been provided to citizens on a voluntary contribution basis. while donations of community service groups and generous individuals provide for deficits. Mr. President. on the 10th anniversity of the Derry Township Senior Citizens Council. which is to be celebrated on October 11. 1984. I commend the council members and extend my congratulations and sincere appreciation to them for the exemplary conduct in providing a model to all of the concept of local selfhelp and concern for community and individual wellbeing.*",

Mr. Clarence Reisen. age 62. collapsed and died suddenly on Tuesday. September 25. 1984. He leaves his wife. Mitzi. four children. and five grandchildren. They will miss him greatly since his role as husband. father. and grandfather was one that most would envy. He was deeply loved. a caring man. and an inspired leader. Clarence Reisen served as the president of the Jewish Community Federation known as Metro West which serves the largest Jewish community in the State of New Jersey. The services offered to the community include a home for the aged. the WMHA. hospital. family counseling. Job training. and many other vital programs. Clarence Reisen epitomized the concept of voluntary community service. In addition to his leadership in the Jewish community. he served on the board of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. the Newark Museum. and the United Community Fund of the Oranges and Maplewood. Under his tenure in offices. more funds were raised than at any time in the history of this 62yearold federation. At the same time. new programs were initiated and never have there been a more committed or larger core of volunteers. My heartfelt sympathy extends to his immediate family particularly his wife with whom my wife and I share a very close friendship. Our community and our world was made richer by his service and his influence in the community will endure far beyond his years.*",

During that hearing I questioned Commissioner of Customs von Raab about proposed changes in the Treasury Department longstanding rules regarding imports into the United States where the importers decline to sell through their domestic subsidiaries but sell directly to large merchandising outletscommonly called \"grey market\" goods or \"parallel imports.\" The longstanding regulations allow an exception to the general rule based on section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930. That general rule provides that articles bearing a recorded trademark may be denied entry into the United States. For over 30 yars Customs interpretation of this law. and its regulations providing the exception. permitted entry of goods into the United States where the U.S. trademark owner is affiliated with a foreign trademark owner. owns the corresponding foreign trademarks. or has authorized application of its trademark abroad. A change October . 1984 in this longstanding policy would in. crease substantially the prices of certain goods to the American consumer. At the time of the subcommittee hearing several court cases. challenging the Customss existing regulations. were pending. The Customs Service agreed to take no action until these five suits were concluded. The opinion in one such case. Vivitar Corp. against the United States. No. 84100067 U.S. Court of International Trade. filed January 19. 1984. was rendered at the end of August. and concluded that the Custom Services longstanding interpretation of the Tariff Act should not be disturbed because of commercial reliance on this policy and the fact that substantial business had been based on this interpretation. Further. after an exhaustive review and analysis of the legislative history of section 526. the Court decided that Customs construction of this section is fully consistent with congressional intent.

However. I would also like to share a few concerns about the legislation which I hope will be resolved when this bill is considered by the other body. It should be noted that the central thrust of this legislation allows the Governor of the State to propose an alternative State plan. Although the Governor plays an extremely important role in the government of a State. he or she is not the single source or repository of all State power. The State legislatures and the utility regulatory commissions are also integral factors in the area of utility conservation programs. I am concerned that this legislation would give the Governors of some States the right to propose programs they could not enact under State law. In Maryland. attempts by the Governor. through the State energy office. to provide weatherization kits costing approximately $100 to homeowners making $34.000 per year has been rejected by the State legislature 2 years in a row. I also believe that it is important to allow the States to grandfather in existing conservation programs which have a proven track record. Finally. there is no requirement under the alternative State plan that the body most familiar with utility practices and procedures. the State utility regulatory commissions. have a role in this process. The public utility commissions determine which costs are properly paid by the ratepayers and would be more likely to take cost consideration when determining which plan provisions would provide the most benefit to utility customers. The Governor. on the other hand. is required to do no such cost benefit analysis. Hopefully. these concerns will be addressed by the time the bill reaches the Presidents desk.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the major driving force behind the enactment of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 was the realization of our dependency on foreign sources of energy. It was a matter of national security that we reduce that dependency to a minimum: We were in danger of being rendered virtually defenseless had those foreign sources of energy become suddenly unavailable. For that reason. conservation became a national directive. As part of that directive. the Residential Conservation Service Program was enacted. Both national studies and the subcommittee hearings records show that the program is not cost effective. No demonstrable energy conservation can be directly attributed to RCS since its implementation in 1979. yet it has cost consumers billions of dollars. The bill which we are considering today. H.R. 5946. would not only extend the RCS program for another 5 years but would also expand the requirements of the program at still greater expense. I believe that energy conservation is a laudable goal. especially in terms of national security. But I seriously question whether this bill or the RCS program is effective in reaching that goal. I would strongly encourage my colleagues in the other body to carefully analyze the merits not only of this bill in particular. but of the program itself. Our national security is too important to waste our resources on ineffective programs. no matter how well intentioned..",

Under current law. the Federal Residential Conservation Service. administered by the utilities. must offer onsite energy audits to residential customers. H.R. 5946 permits the Governor of any State to substitute an alternative State plan for the Residential Conservation Service. While it does not specify the method for achieving conservation. the bill requires that the alternative State plan be designed to result in an annual participation rate of 5 percent per year. I am concerned that the possible consequences of substituting the alternative State plan for the current Federal program have not been fully explored. I can see no evidence in the history of H.R. 5946 that transferring this program from Federal to State jurisdiction will acutally improve conservation efficiency. Moreover. I question whether the participation rate goal of 5 percent per year is realistic in light of the participation rate experienced under the Residential Conservation Service Program. The national participation rate is estimated to be about 2 percent per year. Even the extensive promotion efforts conducted in my own State of Massachusetts by MassSay. the consortium organized by the utilities. resulted in a cumulative participation rate of only 8 percent over a 3year period. Finally. I am concerned about the potential for politicization should this program be transferred from the Department of Energy to the discretion of the Governors. In its present form. the Residential Conservation Service is working free of local political influences. it is unclear if that will continue under alternative State plans. Mr. Speaker. this legislation raised more questions than can be answered in the limited period of debate provided today.

Mr. Speaker. the jobs covered by this billGuards. elevator operators. messengers and custodianshave been specifically earmarked by law for veterans since the Preference Act was passed in 1944. Over the past few years. however. implementation of an office of management and budget circular has eroded congressional intent by contracting out many of these positions. H.R. 5799 would prevent such erosion in the future. It establishes Governmentwide standards as to these jobs. It protects veterans currently holding them and preserves the preference for future vacancies as long as qualified veterans are available. Mr. Speaker. as this bill was being drafted. concern was expressed that programs for handicapped individuals under a sheltered workshop contract arrangement would not be available. This is not the case inasmuch as the bill specifically provides for such arrangements but also provides that any veteran who is displaced under such a contract would be placed in a similar vacant job. This compromise is an excellent one and the members of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee are to be commended for their diligence in working it out. I would like to particularly thank my friend and colleague. the gentleman from Michigan and my friend and colleague. the gentleman from California . for their work on this particular bill.

Of particular concern to me. as the ranking minority member of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. is the provision concerning strict penalties for the possession of narcotics in Federal prisons. During the select committees hearing in New York City in June 1983. former Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Joseph Califano. testified about the gravity of the prison situation in New York State. At a time when twothirds of New Yorks inmates are drug addicts or drug abusers. drug use and abuse in our prisons is a fact of life. With the increasing number of drugrelated crimesand drugabusing criminalsour system needs some workable means of controlling the rampant drug use and trafficking which plague our prisons. Simple possession of contraband in Federal prisons will now become a criminal offense. In addition to broadening the scope of prison riot and mutiny laws. H.R. 5910 imposes a $250.000 fine and 5year imprisonment if narcotic drugs. PCP. or LSD are possessed in Federal prison.

The founding of Israel is a vital. living monument to the persistence and heroism of a people who have suffered many centuries of persecution and have known only too well the bitterness and despair of an existence without even the most basic freedoms. From the destruction of the Second Temple in A.D. 70 and their final courageous stand against the Romans at Massada in A.D. 73. until May 14. 1948. the Jewish people were without a homeland. and in the Diasporadispersed throughout the world but without loss of their identity. Throughout these centuries. in most of the countries of the world. the Jews were severely restricted in their civil and religious liberties. as well as the subjects of periodic physical harassment or outright persecution. This sad history of abuse culminated in the Holocaust. a conscious effort to completely erase the existence. the culture. and the history of a proud and compassionate people. Seen in this context of tears and tragedy. the establishment of the State of Israel is a momentous turning point in the history of the Jewish people to achieve selfdetermination. The nation was carved out of bedrock. desert. and malarial swamps. and was transformed into a modern agricultural and technological State. and this was all done in the presence of hostile neighbors. who have repeatedly tried to destroy this tiny nation. Nevertheless. the commitment of Israels people to peace in this region of the world has never been abandoned. nor has their willingness to make great sacrifices in order to achieve this goal. Mr. Speaker. I join with the citizens of Israel and their friends in the 11th Congressional District of Illinois which I am honored to represent. and their many friends throughout the world. in celebrating this 36th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. May Israel continue to be a source of encouragement and inspiration for all peoples of the world. who desire to determine the course of their own destinies. without fear of persecution.*",

Not only did the PIK program balloon far beyond its original cost estimate. but restrictions on how much any one farmer could receive were ignored by the Department of Agriculture. The General Accounting Office reported last November that USDA had illegally violated a 1949 law which sets a $50.000 per farmer limit on farm subsidy payments. USDA did not just slightly violate the $50.000 limitation. In California. six corporations received $6.5 million. and one of these received nearly $4 million. Nowhere were these outrageous overpayments more absurd than in the case of the \"Golden Pond\"-the Tulare Lake area of central California. At the \"Golden Pond.\" more than $2.5 million in PIK benefits were paid to farmers for not planting 10.100 acres of farmlandeven though the land was under 10 feet of water. The scandalous abuses at the \"Golden Pond.\" and in the PIK program in general. were exposed by our colleague. Congressman PETE STARK. through investigations of his Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures. Two stories in the Oakland Tribune recently documented Congressman STARKS good work in revealing these wasteful abuses. which will end the misuse of the commodity programs and save taxpayers billions of dollars.

I rise in strong support of the Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1984 which increases the rates of compensation for attorneys representing indigent defendants in Federal criminal cases. I believe the revision of these rates is of crucial importance to insure the adequate legal representation of insolvent defendants as predicated by the sixth amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Currently. in many instances. the courts are forced to compromise the most proper representation of indigent defendants. This is so because of the significant economic sacrifice the present legal fees pose which deters the more competent lawyers from being available for such services. This measure recognizes the impact of inflation on legal costs and adjusts the fees accordingly. The bill would allow the recruitment of competent attorneys on a consistent basis. This would translate in the proper unfolding of the sixth amendments mandate of legal representation for every defendant. even the less fortunate.

They are monitoring recent key developments affecting prices and reviewing the outlook for inflation. The May 1 Wall Street Journal contains an article titled \"Our Inflation Defenses Arent What They Used to Be.\" by Lindley H. Clark. Jr. Mr. Clark makes several important points about inflation: First. a recent survey of institutional investment decisionmakers indicates that they expect inflation of 6.5 percent in the 12 months ending in December 1984up from 5.08 percent in the same poll 2 months earlier. They also predict that inflation will average 6.75 percent over the next 10 years. which would be 92 percent for the decade as a whole. Second. we incurred budget deficits in the 1950s and 1960s. but they were miniscule in comparison with current projections for 1984 and future fiscal years. Last week the Treasury announced that the deficit. which had shown some improvement. \"lurched sickeningly upward.\" These deficits greatly complicate monetary policy for the Federal Reserve. Third. the civilian unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in March. which means that overall there is substantial slack in the labor force. But labor shortages exist in certain geographical areas and in certain skills. This may lead to upward pressures on wages in those areas. Fourth. the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing is currently about 82 percent. A study at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that at this level inflation is not likely to accelerate. but this is near the threshold area where further increases may contribute to inflation.

Mr. Bradley is a prime example of the spirit of contribution and community interest of which all Americans should be proud. As chief of the South Deerfield Volunteer Fire Department for 45 years. Mr. Bradleys record of service to his neighbors in the First District of Massachusetts is certainly impressive. Mr. Raymond L. Bradley joined the South Deerfield Volunteer Fire Department in 1939 at the age of 18. At that time. he began his volunteer duty with this organization which serves South Deerfield and the surroundkig towns of Conway. Whately. Sunderland. and Greenfield. This mutual aid system between the towns was developed during Mr. Bradleys tenure with the fire department. In 1965 there was a desperate need for a new chief of the fire department and Mr. Bradley stepped in to do the job. As one might expect. Mr. Bradley selflessly came forward to help out when he was needed. It is not easy to be a volunteer firefighter. Long and unpredictable hours of rigorous preparation and labor are standard and unavoidable. Few men have the strength of character to accept such a demanding assignment. Fewer will do it without the incentive of payment. Mr. Bradley. however. has exhibited to us his charitable nature and we. as residents of the first district. are indebted to Mr. Bradley to an extent beyond measure. In June of this year. Mr. Bradley will be retiring from his post as fire chief. but his communityminded efforts will not be forgotten.

We do so because that is one limiting factor in what measure can be put on the Suspension Calendar. and the rules of the House are very clear on that. Now. all of a sudden. we are going to come along and we are going to add another day. a special day. on this particular Wednesday. I certainly would agree with the majority leader that it would be very advantageous to move ahead with our legislative schedule. but I would say that we have not been overly diligent about that in the past. that we have allowed a number of days to go by without too much business being done. Why. all of a sudden. we have to have a special suspension day on this particular Wednesday bothers me. when it is in total violation of the rules of the House. It seems to me that if we want to schedule business. we could schedule general debate. or something of that nature. on a Wednesday. to move ahead with some of the things. without walking all over the rules by scheduling suspensions.

Members know that I have taken this responsibility seriously. The many significant and legitimate needs of our insular areas are essential to the national as well as the territorial interest.

Governor Paiewonskys careers as a public servant and as a merchant have bettered almost every facet of life in the Virgin Islands. His tenure as chief executive won dramatic improvements in the islands selfgovernment. tourism business. industrial development. housing. educational system. and public infrastructure and services. The achievements continue as a living legacy of his partnership for progress. The United States is indeed indebted to the father of the modern Virgin Islands. But our appreciation pales beside that of the people whose social. economic. and political growth Governor Paiewonsky so advanced.

Senator Ottley provided history with the best chronicle of the achievements of the PaiewonskyOttley years a few months ago.

St. Francis Home of Williamsville. N.Y.. Our Lady of Victory Homes of Charity. and the German Roman Catholic Orphan Home of Buffalo. These institutions received the remainder of Mr. John D. Herrmanns trust after the death of the original beneficiary. Mrs. Mildred E. Freund. Mr. Herrmann died in early 1973 and estate tax of $131.981 was paid on December 5. 1973. No charitable deduction was claimed because the interest from the trust did not qualify as an annuity under the Internal Revenue Code. On November 7. 1975. the Surrogate Court of Erie County issued a decree bringing the trust into compliance with the annuity provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This entitled the original beneficiary. Mrs. Freund. to a refund of $71.493. Mrs. Freund died in October 1980. At that time. the charities became aware that the claim for a refund was never filed. However. the deadline for filing expired in 1978. This bill. Mr. President. will extend the deadline for filing the $71.493 refund to such time as the institutions can collect. The charities have been penalized by the error of the trusts administrator. These institutions provide essential services to the city of Buffalo. Without their work. the quality of life in Buffalo would suffer. For no fault of their own. the charities have lost a substantial sum of money that could be used to assist in their mission of benefiting the Buffalo community. This relief is especially needed in this age of cutbacks in Federal funding. These fine institutions need our help so that they may better help the people of Buffalo.. By Mr. LEVIN:",

This legislation seeks to add a new title VII to the National Security Act of 1947 so that the major operational components of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will be relieved of the burden of searching and reviewing sensitive operational files in response to certain requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act. This will serve in turn to allow these components to more effectively devote their resources to the gathering of the vital intelligence our Government needs in order to make informed decisions in areas of foreign policy and national defense.

Additionally. access to files for individual U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens who seek information on themselves will not be affected by this bill. Mr President. it has been 8 years since the FOIA has been amended. and during those 8 years. the CIA has worked hard to comply with the act. However. experience has shown that it is impossible to respond to requests for information within the specified time limits. The search through numerous compartmented file systems is time consuming. For security reasons. all CIA files are compartmented and intelligence personnel have access only to that information which they need to know for their work.

Almost 200 years ago. in a region then called Valle de San Jose. Spanish missionaries discovered what the local Indians had known for generations: hot springs of sulfurous water arising from deep within the Earth. The Spaniards called this unusual natural phenomenon. agua caliente. or hot water. These waters were believed to possess curative qualities. and Indians came from miles around to receive their therapeutic powers. Many years later. thousands of people would travel much further distancesfrom all over the world- to visit the remarkable hot springs. In 1844. a transplanted easterner by the name of Jonathan Trumbell Warner gained title to the Spanish land grant of 48.000 acres. which contained the springs. The place became known as Warners Ranch. For many years the ranch served as the only inhabited stopping point for travelers between New Mexico and Los Angeles. Stagecoach travelers became the first visitors to enjoy bathing in the hot waters. paying $1 for the privilege. In the 1880s. the site was developed as a health spa. Over the years. many facilities were added. including guest houses. a chapel. dining rooms and dance hall. The resort flourished until the late 1970s when ownership changes left it dormant. This Friday. Mr. Speaker. the A. Cal Rossi Co. will bring it back to life. In a ceremony to celebrate a new beginning for the Warner Springs Ranch. a time capsule will be buried to symbolize the longrange commitment to preserving the natural beauty of this region and to maintaining its rich heritage. Its fame as a place of scenic wonder will continue undiminished.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would commend to my colleagues the following editorial which appeared in the Mankato Free Press on May 12. 1983. It. I believe. brings to light some important issues raised by the U.S. Catholic Bishops in their pastoral letter on war and peace. BisHoPs PASTORAL LETTER FLAWED The Catholic Bishops pastoral letter on nuclear war contains many noble and deeply felt sentiments about war and peace. But it fails because it assumes that the question of using nuclear weapons can be resolved by eliminating nuclear weapons instead of controlling them. The cat is out of the bag. We live in a world that will have nuclear weapons for generations to come. That is the reality. Mankind has harnessed the technology to create such weapons. The best that the world can hope for is to maintain a deterrent level that will keep any aggressor from being tempted to use such fearsome weapons. The Catholic bishops argue that it is wrong to aim such weapons. indeed any bombs. at population centers where the victims will be innocent. They argue that nuclear war is not winnable. and they are probably right. They argue that the initiation of nuclear war. no matter how limited. can never be justified. and. again. they are probably right. But in an imperfect world. even the elimination of all existing nuclear weapons would not decease the chances of nuclear war. The problem is that if someone then built as much as one weapon. it would tip the nuclear balance fearsomely. Limiting the targets of nuclear weapons would also undermine the deterrence that has worked for more than 30 years. As the New York Times concluded. \"There is no known way to get rid of The Bomb. no way to guard against all possible production or concealments of warheads. That is why. for a quartercentury. negotiations have focused on limiting and reducing delivery systems. \"Even reductions of Soviet and American nuclear weapons. while useful. are less important than achieving a stable nuclear balance. Too much reduction could add to instability.... \"None of this means mankind has to learn to love The Bomb. But it does have to learn",

I am pleased to announce to my colleagues that through the efforts of a great number of concerned and dedicated people. the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has recently announced that it will save from planned destruction the historically significant Launch Umbilical Tower located at Cape Kennedy in Florida. This 380foot steel tower stands vertically atop a mobil launch platform. The tower was used to assist the launch of many major space ventures. including Apollo 11 in 1969. which accomplished the first landing of man on the moon. as well as the ApoloSoyuz project in 1975. which accomplished the linkup of American and Soviet vehicles in space. The tower was involved in the fairly instant making of history of international significance on numerous occasions. Two other towers similar to this one have been modified earlier by NASA for use in other parts of the space program. This last remaining tower of the original three was slated for destruction by NASA. In January of this year we were alerted to the impending destruction of this historic tower by two Florida citizens who were concerned that the historic attributes of the tower were too great to permit relegation to the scrap heap. Those two people were Mr. John London of Merritt Island. Fla.. and Mr. Joe Fury of Cocoa. Fla. I can say with all certainty that had these two individuals not initiated the campalgn they did and when they did to save the tower. we would in all likelihood not be able to announce the saving of the tower today.

The Soil Conservation Service has classified 250 million acres of U.S. land as highly erodible and ill suited for intensive agricultural production without the application of proper conservation practices.

I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 663. the socalled sodbuster bill originally introduced by my good friend from Colorado. Senator ARMSTRONG. This bill as reported by the Agriculture Committee would prohibit Federal price and income supports. crop insurance. disaster payments. and Farmers Home Administration loans to producers who grow agricultural commodities on land that has not been farmed during the last 10 years and is classified as highly erodible by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The need for this legislation has become increasingly clear to me in my travels throughout the country this past year. Since March. I have held over 20 hearings. under the auspices of the Agriculture Committees Subcommittee on Conservation. and the Joint Economic Committee. both of which I Chair. From Maine to Colorado. I have repeatedly heard of severe soil erosion and water quality problems caused by runoff from fragile lands. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. this Nation stands to lose more than 32 million acreas of fragile grasslands within the next few years if Congress does not act quickly. The producers who are plowing up the erodible land claim that the committees version of this bill is telling them how and what they can plant on their land. They do not want the Government stepping in on their private land use decisions. Fine. I do not want that either. This bill does not tell farmers what to plant or how to plant.

S. 663 would exclude farmers cultivating highly erodible land. as defined by the bill. from participating in certain Department of Agriculture programs. The bill exempts some land from the prohibition. including land cultivated to produce any of the 1973 through 1983 crops of agricultural commodities. Also. crops produced using an approved or adequate conservation plan would be exempted from the prohibition. It would seem that the effect of this bill is potentially broad since virtually every State has some highly erodible land that has been fallow since 1973. However. during hearings on this bill. the administration assured the Agriculture Committee that the bill would primarily address a problem that exists in several Western States where fragile grasslands are being brought into production. Further. the administration has assured me that this bill is not a step toward mandatory cross compliance. I understand that the bill as originally introduced by Senator ARmSTRONG was intended to restrict access to Federal programs for only those commodities actually produced on erodible land not covered by the exemptions. The bill. as amended by the committee. would apply the restriction not only to commodities produced on the erodible land by a farmer not exempted. but also to any of the commodity produced by that farmer on his entire farm. Senator ARMSTRONG has informed me that he intends to offer an amendment that will conform the bill to his original intent. I believe Senator ARMSTRONGS amendment will resolve some of the issues that have surrounded this legislation. Mr. President. S. 663 will provide a new approach to dealing with some of our resource conservation problems.

International Operations and Environment. The report reviews the major events and the many significant activities and accomplishments of the subcommittee during the past year. This has been an extremely active year for the subcommittee. Under Senator PaESSLERs leadership the subcommittees work has rendered a major contribution to the Senates efforts in the arms control field. I remind Senators that Senator PRESsLER was a principal cosponsor of the committees compromise resolution on strategic arms reductions. In two areas particularly. the subcommittee has been the leading force in Congress. Senator PRESSLER chaired the first hearings on the issue of yellow rain and on the emerging race in space weaponry. The committee has moved forward on resolutions dealing with these two vital issues. I am a strong supporter of both Pressler initiatives and we will work together to get the Senates approval of Senate Joint Resolution 129 on outer space arms control negotiations and of Senate Resolution 201 on chemical warfare. The subcommittee has served the needs of the Senate in other ways. Senator PRESSLER has conducted an important series of hearings on international telecommunications policy. Based upon its findings. the committee will consider whether it should advise a change of U.S. policy in this area. International telecommunications are a growing element of international trade. Senator PaESSLER has chaired some 20 nomination hearings during the past year. Nominations require a great deal of work by Senators and I commend Senator PRESSLER for his efforts in this area. By moving forward on nominations we can assure that the Government can operate effectively both here and abroad. Mr. President. I would urge Senators to read this report covering an extremely active year by the Subcommittee on Arms Control. Oceans. International Operations and Environment. And. I extend my appreciation and congratulations to Senator LARRY PRESSLER for his work as subcommittee chairman. I ask unanimous consent that the report by Senator LARRY PRESSLER appear in the RECORD at this point.",

As we enter the 1984 election year. the injustice of the use of compulsory union dues for political purposes will be played out before us. Once again. American workers will be forced to contribute to political candidates chosen by their unions. Today there is much talk of campaign finance reform. The campaign contributions of special interest groups are widely publicized. and several bills to limit their spending have been introduced in this Congress. Most of these groups. however. obtain their money from voluntary contributions. This is not true in the case of labor unions. While the Federal Election Campaign Act appears to prohibit the use of compulsory union dues for support of political candidates. the act actually allows money from union dues to be spent on behalf of a candidate for public office. The dues finance partisan getoutthevote drives as well as the operation of union PACS. This loophole makes a mockery of FECA. Moreover. it violates the first amendment rights of American workers. In many industries. a worker must join a union and pay union dues to remain employed. An employee who wants to keep his job must. in effect. financially support political candidates the union chooses. All of uswhatever our politicsmust join together to stop this victimization of the American worker. How any American chooses to vote is his own business. If he chooses to vote Democrat. he should not be required to subsidize Republican campaignsor vice versa. If he supports one candidate in a primary. he should not be required to contribute to another. As elected representatives. we must defend the constitutional rights of our constituents.

Jr. Joe Frank. Jr. is. in my view. an outstanding choice for Department of Missouri commander. He was inducted into the U.S. Army on November 29. 1966 and served his country with honor and distinction as a combat engineer with the 39th Engineer Battalion. A land mine explosion on January 14. 1968 caused Mr. Frank to become a paraplegic. and he was honorably discharged on April 1. 1968. In no way has Mr. Franks disability reduced his desire and ability to serve his country and his fellow veterans. He became active in Lemay Memorial American Legion Post 162 in his home town of Lemay. Mo.. and served as the Posts first Vietnam veteran commander. Seeing the need for an American Legion Post in his neighboring community of Crestwood. Mr. Frank was a founder of Crestwood Memorial Post 777 in 1979 and has been a charter member since that time. Also in 1979. he began working with the Paralyzed Veterans of America. serving as a fulltime national service officer. In this capacity. Mr. Frank was responsible for developing. submitting. and pursuing claims for Veterans Administration benefits for veterans. their dependents. and survivors. among other duties. In 1981. he resigned from PVA in order to campaign for the office of eastern division vice commander of the American Legion for the Department of Missouri. He was elected to that position for the term of 198182. Mr. President. the list of Joe Frank. Jr.s accomplishments goes on and on. He was named an \"Outstanding Young Man of America\" in 1982. was named 1968 \"Veteran of the Year\" by the Combined Veterans Association. and has received two Presidential certificatesone in 1976 in appreciation for his service to the Nation and the Selective Service System and another in 1979 for \"Outstanding Community Achievement.\" These are just a few of the many awards and honors Mr. Frank has achieved. Joe Frank. Jr.s dedication to serving his fellow man is a inspiration not only to disabled veterans. but to all disabled and handicapped Americans.

Back upon this bleak. mysterious. and inscrutable World War front the lost graves of our martyred dead at last have been found by official groups of their own faithful and unforgetting buddies. Most of these brave boys who last saw their countrys flag upon strange and unsupported battle lines in this far north Russian country were from Michigan. From Michigan largely came the impulse which after 10 years has insisted that these honored dead once more should know the Stars and Stripes above their last. long home. The precious adventure has succeeded. Back to Michigan these sons are coming home. I am advised from Archangel. outpost on the rim of a fardistant world. that the mortal remains of nearly 100 of these martyrs have been redeemed from unmarked and unknown ground. It is a solemn. yet a thrilling achievement. There was little romance to soften the hard duty befalling these \"Polar Bears.\" as they subsequently have become known. upon the obscure and dubious errand which our World War strategy assigned to them far. far from the western front. The more the honor that is their due for fathful service rendered. It was desperate business amid the bitterest exposure. It was patriotism under acid test. If ever homage was deserved it is by such patriots as these. Under loving escort these dead are now bound for the United States. In another month they will arrive. I am assured by the War and Navy Departments that all honors will be paid the sacred pilgrimage when it arrives. Michigan similarly will do her full share in these sacrificial obsequies. In addition. I beg the Senates indulgence for this memorial contribution to our own records. I ask unanimous consent to print in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the names of these sons of Michigan who died for their country on this north Russian front in the World War.",

In a brave struggle against loss of their land and their basic rights. millions of Ukrainians perished from starvation. physical abuse. and internment. What was then known as a great famine or natural disaster. we now know was a broad and orchestrated campaign by the Soviet Government. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 70 today to pay tribute to the victims of this tragedy and to add to congressional expressions of resolve to see basic human rights respected everywhere. This resolution condemns the policies of the Soviet Union. then and now. that systematically disregard human rights and liberties. It calls upon the President to proclaim May 24. 1984. as a day to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first congressional condemnation of the Ukrainian famine. And it also urges a new diplomatic effort to press the Soviet Government to remove current restrictions on food parcels and other necessities sent to Soviet citizens by private individuals and charitable organizations. Earlier this week. Washington was the scene of a serious demonstration organized by the National Committee to Commemorate Genocide Victims in Ukraine 193233. Thousands. many from New Jersey. gathered as close as they could to the Embassy of the U.S.S.R. here to commemorate the victims of the famine. But the larger message relates to a continuing struggle. by Ukrainians and by others in the Soviet Union. for basic human rights. It is a struggle that the Congress of the United States will never ignore.*",

I would like to recognize the efforts of a number of private citizens who have demonstrated the best in American spirit. Through the use of private funds. these individuals have provided for the operation and expansion of an important wildlife sanctuary. In Green Bay. Wis.. we have a fine example of the dedication of the American people. An organization known as Friends of the Wildlife Sanctuary has built and operated the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary. The friends of the sanctuary have demonstrated that alternatives to Federal funding can work very well. These people have insulated the important programs of their sanctuary from the all too often shifting pattern in the availability of public funds. In fact. they have put together a very successful and expanding program. Beginning in the mid 1930s a group of spirited citizens began this undertaking by hand digging a small pond which has become a central feature of the sanctuary. The original 200acre tract has been expanded to over 700 acres through gifts and acquisitions. Most recently. the friends of the sanctuary have embarked on supporting the construction of a 22.000 square foot education center. They have already raised over $1 million of the $1.5 that it will take to complete the center. By pointing out this example of successsful cooperation between private individuals and their municipal government. I am not calling for reductions in Federal wildlife programs.

We propose to extend for 18 days the existing FSC law so that no one who may become eligible between now and the 18th. which is the Tuesday following when we return. will be adversely impacted. I repeat. it is an 18day extension. The House sent us a 30day extension with a number of amendments that had been agreed to in conference. We have stricken seven of those amendments. We are going to send back four because there is some urgency to these provisions. They include a 60day extension of disability benefits during appealthat expires September 30. There is clearly some urgency there. Second. we included a 1year extension of provisions relating to dependent children voluntarily placed in foster care. That provision otherwise expires on September 30. Third. we included a 2year delay of social security coverage of retired Federal judges on active duty. I am told by the Chief Justice that that is a matter of urgency needing immediate attention. The last is clarification with respect to repayment of State unemployment insurance loans. This provision is extremely important in the State of Vermont. and needs to be acted on now. This provision is retroactive to April 1. 1982. so that any State adversely affected under the incorrect interpretation of prior law will be reimbursed for interest already paid.

These will likely become law but. very honestly. until we have some more indication on the House side that they want to be be reasonable in conference. it did not seem that we should accept all those provisions at this time.

Last week. the House and Senate passed differing versions of an extension of the Federal supplemental compensation program. There were major differences in the two bills. The conferees have failed to reach an agreement between the House and Senate versions. so now we have an 18day extension of current law. I guess its better than leaving people who depend on these benefits with nothing. but how much more confusing can we make it? In my State of Illinois. approximately 5.500 people would exhaust FSC benefits. either because of the termination of the program. or because they have used all available weeks. by Other States have already begun to mail notices to recipients. informing them that the program has not been extended. A rough calculation. assuming approximately 700.000 recipients. multiplied by 5 minutes for notification. calculation. and mailing. plus 20cent postage means that every time we have to notify people of a change in this program. it costs taxpayers $1.162.196.

The compromises we struck with the House conferees left us $137 million below the Senate totals and $93.7 million above the House totals in discretionary programs. exclusive of impact aid. which was not considered by the House. This means that we were able to keep the most vital Senate addons but also cut our increases by more than half. In other words. we made a good faith and successful effort to protect the interest of both the program beneficiaries and the taxpayers who foot the bill. Finally. I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator WEICKER for the masterful way he handled this legislation. He was the right man in the right place. His impeccable credentials as a dedicated supporter of strong social programs in job training. health. and education made it possible for him to convince his colleagues that he had gone just as far as he possibly could without provoking a Presidential veto. I fully expect this bill to be signed and it should stand as a sterling example of how our system of checks and balancesthe delicate interplay between executive and legislative prerogativesshould operate.",

It is a good thing for society to celebrate the best of its traditions. to commemorate events that are notable in our history. For that reason. Mr. President. it is both foreseeable and. in fact. desirable. that in the future this Congress will continue to give national recognition either to men and women of outstanding leadership or to events that deserve commemoration. That is desirable. There is a limit. however. to what the cost to the taxpayers should be for that kind of recognition. We are advised by the Congressional Budget Office that $18 million per day is the cost to the taxpayers for each national holiday for which Federal employees receive a paid holiday. Mr. President. the effect of this legislation would be simply to limit the number of paid national holidays to 10. and if in the future it is the decision of the Congress to add to the number those persons or events we single out for deserved national tribute. the number would remain at 10. It would then be incumbent upon management and labor in the private sector or public employer and employee in the Federal and State governmental sectors to determine which of those 10 days will. in fact. be paid holidays. I point out that not only has this great cost implications for the Federal Government. amounting to $180 million in terms of the present cost. or almost $2 billion over a 10year period. but given the fact that the State governments follow the lead of the Federal Government in granting holidays and that the private sector also follows. the cost implications are obvious and they are enormous. Mr. President. I suggest that we continue observing the best in our traditions. both in events and people. but that we set a limit upon what the taxpayers must pay and set a limit of 10 upon the number of national holidays.

H.R. 5394. to extend the offset in pay increase for our retired military personnel who have subsequently become employed by the Federal Government is. in my Judgment. an affront to all members of our armed services. both active and retired. To take from current earnings an amount equal to any increase in earned retired pay. from military retirees only. is discriminatory to the utmost degree. When this was first implemented on August 18. 1982. supposedly for only 3 years. I strongly objected and my views have not changed. Many of these individuals have one or more children of college age. and everyone here is aware of the high cost of education. Members here know the importance we place on education for gainful employment. and we know that more and more. future Jobs will require more education. Do we want to place an additional hardship on our military retirees who are attempting to educate their children? While most Members will agree that. from an economic standpoint. Federal spending should be reduced. this should not be done in piecemeal fashion. that singles out any one segment of our society. Obviously. the House is not ready to take this on. as was evidenced last week when only 59 Members voted to reduce all costofliving allowances by 2 percent. Members of our armed services sacrifice by family separation over their careers. they are moved to new duty stations every few years. and their benefits. to include retirement benefits that have been promised. by law. before they signed up. are considered as due compensation for their service. To vote for this bill is a breach of contract. in my view. so in good conscious. I cannot support this language contained herein.",

I feel strongly that medicare costs must be brought under control. and that freezing physician fees for parts A and B of medicare is a step in the right direction. I would like to have the opportunity to vote for such a freeze which would help us meet our needed reconciliation goals. Under the current rule. however. our only choice to vote for a fee freeze is as part of a package including mandatory assignment. I am unalterably opposed to the mandatory assignment provisions at this time. These provisions. which were rejected by the Ways and Means Committee on October 19. have not been subject to congressional hearings and review. We have no idea what kind of impact they could have on the medicare program. Certainly such a major program change could substantially affect the care for elderly patients in many of our districts particularly rural districts. Until we can be more informed about these effects we should not approve the mandatory assignment provisions.

In fact. most of us know full well how it is even difficult to explain what that vote means. But I ask the other side of the aisle. that any of you who have claimed you want to cut deficits. I do not care if it was all by defense. all by taxes. or all by anything to oppose this rule. This rule and its amendment are a farce. First of all. in 1985 this reconciliation package increases spending by $1.5 billion. Those increases are just in there. We do not get a chance to vote on them. You cannot go home and make speeches about cutting the deficit and support this. We have the right as a House to vote on specific legislation and if it is good legislation. I believe the wisdom of the House will pass it. that is how we should get new spending programs. No matter how able Members are and in fact how clever to get programs into this particular bill. it is the wrong way to go. We deserve the right to debate and to discuss. We have to oppose this rule. For any 13.mocrat. whether he or she is from my State or another. who claims that this package is part of a deficit reduction is wrong. This vote will make the difference if you really wish to cut deficits. From the gentleman from Ohio and me. comes a very simple amendment that I think you should support. an amendment we are not allowed to offer under this rule. The amendment merely says that Members of the House have to vote on spending increases and they may not be included in a reconciliation package.

If we are looking for more than a signal today. as far as spending is concerned. the opportunity to convert that signal into reality is the vote on reconciliation today. We need favorable action today to complete this excellent week. a budget. a tax bill. and reconciliation. One of the means of achieving this saving is the medicare amendment. It does two things.

Last week during the budget debate we had many eloquent speeches about how much was going to be saved. As a matter of fact. the budget resolution proposed to save $1.8 billion in fiscal year 1985. Today. the reconciliation bill which is designed to implement the budget resolution will in fact spend an additional $750 million in real money in 1985 instead of saving the illusory $1.8 billion provided in the budget resolution. That is a net difference of $25 billion. The task force appointed by the Rules Committee to reform the budget process recognized the sham of this kind of action. One of the recommendations in the report is that new legislative spending proposals should not be made part of the reconciliation bill. And yet here we are today with a rule that would include language in the reconciliation bill that will increase spending. that will start new programs that have serious. longterm fiscal implications in terms of spendout in the years ahead that have not been debated in this body. This action would certainly wreck any opportunity that we have to achieve much in the way of savings.

What we have before us today is another important step in the continuous process of trying to enforce the budget resolution that this House adopted last weekwith a bipartisan vote. I might add. That budget resolution had three main enforcement parts. One part was a revenue bill. which this House passed yesterday. A second part was a limitation on the discretionary spending programs. and that limitation has been given to the Appropriations Committee. And next month and in the month of June. the appropriations bills will be coming to the floor of the House and we intend to enforce those spending limitations. [3 1410 The third part Is before us today. which is the reconciliation of entitlement programs to reduce the spending growth of these programs. The gentleman from Ohio last week said we are not cutting entitlement programs enough. and various substitutes were brought before the House to cut entitlement programs more. but they did not pass. The one that did pass by a wide margin was the committees resolution. and today we are carrying out the enforcement of that resolution with this bill before us. No matter how you slice it. whether you think it is too big or too little. the fact is clear. If this House acts responsibly and votes for this reconciliation today. this act. coupled with the other things we have already done and are doing. will cut the entitlement spending growth by over $12 billion over the next 3 years. So all of the smoke and side issues may be fun to talk about. but we ought to keep our eye on the target.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. more than 97 percent of our Nations enterprises may be classified as small businesses. Therefore. I believe it is only fitting that. as the President has proclaimed this week as \"National Small Business Week.\" we should recommit ourselves to assisting wherever prudently practicable those men and women who comprise Americas small business community. I am today especially fearful that. unless the Congress and the President take concerted measures to bring the budget deficit under control. those \"idea generators\" and \"risk takers\" of our Nation will become an endangered species. Of course in referring to \"idea generators\" and \"risk takers.\" I am referring to small businesses. Last year. 66.000 businesses filed for bankruptcy under chapters 7. 11. or 13 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. This marks a 38percent increase in bankruptcy filings over the previous year. And. although small businesses appear to be weathering the current recession with a bit more ballast than larger firms. a recent Presidential report. \"The State of Small Business.\" readily concedes that \" * * Nineteen eightytwo was not an easy year for the American economy\" and that \"small business earnings were down.\" Madam Speaker. it is the small business sector of our economy which we are looking toward to pull America out of the current recession. However. if we cannot put together a budget that reduces the deficitwhich surpassed $129 billion in just the first 6 months of this fiscal yearinterest rates will continue to prohibit any realization of our hopes for a strong and sustained economic recovery. It is my hope that. in recognition of the leading role which is expected of the small business community. we will take responsible measures to reduce both the budget deficit and interest rates..",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. President Ronald Reagan has proclaimed the week of May 8. 1983. as National Small Business Week as a tribute to the millions of Americans who are part of the small business community throughout our Nation. Small business. as is so often correctly pointed out. is the backbone of our free enterprise system. Ninetyfive percent of all businesses are. in fact. firms with fewer than 100 employees. accounting for almost 55 percent of all jobs. Recent studies have shown that small businesses are the growth and innovation centers of our economy: two out of every three new jobs created are in small firms which also produce two to three times as many innovations per employee as larger businesses. In the last 10 years. small businesses have created 69 percent of all new jobs. This record of performance. growth. and innovation is one of which the hardworking small businessmen and women of our Nation can be justifiably proud. We must continue our legislative efforts to make sure that small businesses are given a fair shake in the marketplace. that they receive an appropriate share of Federal contracts. that they are provided with permanent relief from excessive Government regulation. and that tax policy encourages small businesses to fulfill their vital role in our economic system. The Small Business Administration is sponsoring a number of activities this week to focus on small business concerns and to honor the 1983 State Small Business Persons of the Year and the 1983 Small Business Advocates of the Year. My congratulations go to all the honorees.o",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am honored to join my esteemed colleagues PARREN J. MITCHELL and JOSEPH McDADE in this special order commemorating small businesses across the United States. In my work in politics over the years. I have become acquainted with the problems that small businessmen face and the benefits that they enjoy. Certainly the problems for the proprietor are many: High interest rates. economic fluctuation. taxes. and overhead. Almost all small businesses are community oriented and all participate in charities and community drives. But local businesses have only a limited amount of money to donate to local causes. and there are always local concerns asking for help. And we cannot forget the issue of crime. Although our local police departments are doing their best to stem the tide of crime against property. every small business owner must go to sleep at night with the fear that criminals will make off with his business in the dark of night. Yet there are many advantages that small business owners enjoy. Perhaps the best thing about owning your own business is that it is yours. The freedom that comes from the responsibility and control that one has when he owns his own business make all of the problems pale by comparison. Every small businessman is a vital part of his community. and while the responsibility for his business downturns are solely his. so is the responsibility for his business success. Many of the economic experts say that Americas economy is in trouble because our multinational corporations cannot compete with those of other countries. They say that the United States will go under because Ford cannot compete with Honda. There may be some truth in that. but it certainly is not the whole truth.

Small businesses are the cornerstone of our Nations free enterprise system. Their growth and development is critical to our economic stability. Approximately 98 percent of all businesses in the United States can be considered small. They are responsible for the creation of more than half of the nongovernmental jobs. and according to the National Science Foundation and Commerce Department reports small businesses are 24 times more innovative per research and development dollar than large firms. Small business owners are among the most dynamic and innovative leaders of the business community. Their eagerness and desire for success. and their creativity and determination has made our Nation a place of opportunities and prosperity. One example of tenacity. hard work. and desire to succeed is Mr. Sergio Luna. chosen as Puerto Ricos small business person for 1983. Mr. Luna worked on his fathers farm during Puerto Ricos long depression years. Gradually. by going to night school. he was able to complete a bachelors degree in business administration. In 1957. Mr. Luna joined Superior Paints Corp. There he served as general manager in manufacturing. product development. marketing and accounting until 1976. The companys sales increased in that period to $10 million annually. making it Puerto Ricos largest paint manufacturer. In 1976. Sergio Luna went on his own. forming Luna Paints Corp. with four employees. Luna Paints has become the third most important marketer of paints in Puerto Rico. controlling about 10 percent of the market. Fiscal year 1982 sales surpassed $2.5 million. I want to congratulate Mr. Luna as well as all the 1983 State small business persons of the year and urge my colleagues to join in this tribute.*",

I am delighted to pause and recognize the tremendous contribution of small business and small business people to our Nation. Our country owes a great debt to the men and women of our small business community. Small businesses today produce close to 40 percent of our gross national product and employ 50 percent of the nongovernment labor force. In this country. two out of three new jobs are created by small business and small businesses produce twice as many innovations per employee as do larger firms. I would also like to recognize the key role that small business has played in providing economic opportunities for women. Today. firms owned by women account for 7.1 percent of all small businesses. This is a 30percent increase since 1977. The small business sector remains the most dynamic. competitive. and productive sector of todays economy. Their contributions to our society are far greater than their numbers or size would judicate. Small business is no small matter as far as America is concerned. During National Small Business Week we acknowledge that perhaps no other group has done so much to make our country prosper. The contributions of small business to the U.S. economy in terms of new jobs created. initiation of innovative new products and services. and opportunities provided for people with initiative. imagination. and grit is very impressive and at the heart of our promise as a nation.*",

Statistics from the Department of Labor for 1981 show for my State of Mississippi that about 31 percent of the work force was part of a business with less than 20 employees. Another 30 percent worked in a small business which employs between 20 and 99 persons. As you can see. the impact small businesses have on our State is very vital to the economy. I believe the economic recovery has begun and I hope that we in Congress will be careful to take action that will spur that recovery and aid the small business men and women hit so hard by the recession. Also. we should look closely for ways to ease the regulatory burdens which have hampered the full operations of many of these businesses in the past. A prosperous small business environment is important to the continued progress of our Nation and I hope we will work toward this goal here in Congress.*",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. Small Business Week. 1983. provides a fitting opportunity to pay tribute to the thousands upon thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs across the United States whose creative ambitions and individual enterprises make such an outstanding contribution to the vitality of our American economy. Since the earliest colonial times our Nation has relied on individuals. competing in a free and open marketplace. for the goods and services necessary to sustain a growing economy. The challenges created by this competition. and the innovative spirit it has fostered. have resulted in a degree of prosperity unmatched by any other nation and a record of accomplishment which is truly worthy of praise. It is the legacy of this innovative spirit which places American small businesses on the threshold of even greater accomplishment as we face the challenges of tomorrow. It is within this community that the most dynamic innovations and developments are being generated. creating new jobs for our citizens and new technologies to meet changing needs. Madam Speaker. this spirit of accomplishment is exemplified by the individuals receiving the Small Business Person of the Year Awards for 1983. These individuals have demonstrated outstanding ability as they have directed businesses toward greater sales and employment. developed innovative solutions to the needs of their customers. and contributed time and resources to communityoriented projects. I am particularly pleased. Madam Speaker. to recognize Char Les and Edwin F. Klouda of Swisher. Iowa. who have been nominated as Iowa Small Business Persons of the Year for 1983. Since 1971. Manufacturing Specialties had designed and produced plastic injection molds to meet a wide range of customer needs. In 1981 this husband and wife team formed Plastic Specialties. which manufacturers plastic and glass fiber components used to improve the insulating qualities of concrete walls. The firm is also involved in designating an earthquake resistant condominium project to be built in Dale City. Calif. These innovative developments have helped Plastic Specialities to achieve a 56percent annual growth in sales every year since 1977. These outstanding accomplishments represent the spirit and vitality of the small business community. in Iowa and across the country. I am pleased to join in recognizing these efforts and extend my congratulations to Char Les and Edwin F. Klouda and to all recipients of the Small Business Person of the Year Awards for 1983.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. my lawyer friends tell me that there is not a contract in the world that cannot be broken if one but works at it hard enough. It would now appear that the Supreme Court. in NLRB against Bildisco & Bildisco has made it so that the lawyers will not have to work quite so hard to break union contracts. When the Congress was considering the bankruptcy law in 1978. the principle enunciated in Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks v. REA Express. Inc. (523 F.2d 164. 167169 (CA2). cert. denied. 423 U.S. 1017 (1975)) were applied when a company in bankruptcy sought to reject a union contract. This strict standard was overruled by Bildisco on February 22. It is now possible to reject a union contract in bankruptcy when that contract is merely \"burdensome\" to the estate and the equities can be said to be balanced against the contract. This principle has been eagerly sought by the companies who have entered bankruptcy for the sole purpose of reopening their freely made contracts with unions. It is clear to any reasonable person that a companys wealth will be increased if it pays less to labor. This is even more the case in laborintensive industries. However. it has long been the policy in this country to encourage the development of contracts between labor and management that strike a balance that both can agree upon. After the struggle of negotiations. both sides can pause and set about the business of getting along together until the next contract. the next round of negotiations. Now. Bildisco ends this state of affairs by making it possible for management to open. or threaten to open. negotiations at any time by going into chapter 11 bankruptcy or threatening to go into chapter 11 bankruptcy. A deal is no longer a deal. There is the everpresent threat by management to welsh on its deal through legal maneuvers which have now been encouraged by the Supreme Court. Labor and management can work best together when there is a sense of stability and trust in the relationship. The ruling in Bildisco creates a climate of uncertainty and distrust which will ultimately ill serve both labor and management. It is our responsibility to end this forthwith through the passage of H.R. 4908 which has been introduced by Mr. RODINO.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on March 16. 1983. I introduced House Joint Resolution 202 proposing an amendment to the Constitution which provides that the United States shall guarantee to each person the right to employment opportunity. The following description of that bill and the reasons why it is needed appeared in Social Policy. Summer 1983. Token jobcreation programs have existed in a political vacuum since the Great Depression. We have seen bills from the \"Employment Act of 1946\" to the HumphreyHawkins \"Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978\" defanged in the legislative process. and then unenforced after their passage in watereddown versions. For example. the HumphreyHawkins bill mandates a 4 percent unemployment level for 1983. When President Reagan took office. he optimistically predicted a 6.6 percent rate for this year. which has proven minimal compared to the actual 10+ percent rate of mid1983. For too many elected decision makers. structural unemployment has become a fact of economic life in the United States. Caused basically by a failure to plan for full employment within the context of changing industrial and human needs. the level of \"acceptable\" unemployment rises with each succeeding economic cycle. We can all recall when 2 percent unemployment was considered \"full employment.\" The acceptable rate has now risen to 7 percent in some quarters and may well increase as it becomes clearer that the U.S. economy can expand. while the number of U.S. jobs actually decreases. The need for an employmentcentered economic policy is painfully obvious. Piecemeal programmatic solutions have fallen short of the mark because the mandate to create government jobs has been unclear and inconsistent. If the governments responsibility for employmentcentered planning and policy was set forth explicitly in our Constitution. however. Congress and the Executive branch would not be able to keep jobcreation efforts off their legislative agendas. In March. 1983. I introduced H.J. 202. the legislation that would add the right of employment opportunity to the Constitution. By giving the unemployed a means to address indifference and hostility to their basic need to work. H.J. 202 raises the central issue of the governments role in shaping the U.S. economy. In recent years the Congressional right wing has honed the constitutional amendment approach into an organizing tool enviable for its ingenuity and clarity.

The legislation was signed by President Roosevelt on June 27. 1944. as Public Law 78359. To commemorate this event. I am introducing legislation today to designate the month of June 1984 as \"Veterans Preference Month.\" Veterans preference in Federal employment has been a veterans benefit since 1865. In 1944. President Roosevelt recommended to Congress that the Federal Government put into one basic law all of the then existing laws. rules. regulations. and Executive orders relating to veterans preference. In doing this. President Roosevelt stated: \"I believe that the Federal Government. functioning in its capacity as an employer. should take the lead in assuring those who are in the Armed Forces that when they return. special consideration will be given to them in their efforts to obtain employment. The House approved the Veterans Preference Act by a vote of 375 to 1. and it was approved unanimously by the Senate. Today the provisions of the act have been codified as part of title 5. United States Code. Over the years. the Veterans Preference Act has helped millions of veterans and their dependents in Federal employment. For example. today. of the 2.7 million employees of the executive branch of the Government. 43 percent are veterans preference eligibles.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. few people in this world contribute both in thought and in action to the betterment of society. Such a person is Jack Kent: distinguished teacher. outstanding civic leader. and dedicated activitist in the struggle for civil rights. environmental protection. and just governance. Jack Kent established the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of California. Berkeley. and worked in his early years there on the loyalty oath controversy. His activism formed the basis for Jacks involvement in building the first liberal. Democratic majority on the Berkeley City Council. bringing together a coalition that reached across racial lines. and electing the first black member of the city council. The long work to introduce Berkeleys first master plan and realize its goals brought to the city a host of progressive changesmany new parks and recreational facilities. redesign of shopping areas. and curtailment of ruthless real estate speculation in the wake of downzoning Berkeley flatlands. A glance at neighboring cities socalled planning clearly demonstrates the critical difference that Jack has made to Berkeley. The struggle for racial equality found expression in Jacks work to create a fair housing ordinance and in his dedication to expanding the citys role in solving human problems. Success in these efforts is due in no small part to Jacks dedication to rational planning in his quest to enhance the quality of life in Berkeley. in the greater bay area. and beyond. Under Jacks leadership. Berkeley entered the campaign to \"Save the Bay\" and curtailed dramatically its plans for extensive additions to its marina. Concern for environmental problems throughout the region led to Jacks establishment of \"People for Open Space in 1958.\" a group dedicated to conservation and regional planning and to his work in organizing the Association of Bay Area Governments and its 197090 plan for a regional greenbelt. Jack Kent has throughout his career worked to think globally. act locally in the continuing quest for a sane and just world. I know I speak for people throughout our community in congratulating Jack Kent on his many accomplishments and in wishing him many more years of productive involvement.*",

A recent bipartisan delegation of our colleagues returned with the clear conviction that President Reagan was right to send U.S. forces to the tiny island. in response to the request of our eastern Caribbean allies. Perhaps the time has come for some of our other allies to rethink their initial lack of support for the Presidents decision. and focus instead on what might be done to prevent future Marxist takeovers in the Caribbean and elsewhere in the world. Sir Philip Goodhart is a British Member of Parliament and former Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defense under Mrs. Thatcher. A recent New York Times editorial. minimizing the threat Grenadas occupiers posed to other free. small States in the hemisphere. provoked Sir Philip to respond. He graciously provided me a copy of his letter to the editor. which I would like to share with my colleagues. He observes that. lacking adequate defense. small States are almost as vulnerable to hostile \"hijackings\" as airlines are. and that what was at stake in Grenada was not just an airfield or a Soviet/Cuban arms depot. but the very safety of the other miniStates of the region. I would like to second his hope \"that the British and American Governments can join with those Caribbean States that feel the need for protection in discussing together the ground rules for sensible defense insurance agreements to provide the smaller States with some protection against the threat of random assaults.\" Mr. Speaker.

Dues cost from $20 per month for chapters with 10 people or less. to $75 monthly for 35 members or more. although \"Those chapters who have already developed effective fundraising should pay a proportionally higher amount in relation to the number of active members.\" If. however. some groups \"are members of all three Central America networks\" (CISPES.

This may include sales of \"Solidarity bonds.\" an idea of Farid Handal himself. which raises funds \"as a counterpart to the credits given by the U.S. Government to the junta of El Salvador.\" according to Handals document.

It should not serve as a landmark. but rather. a setback to establishing an effective government. Time and time again we have heard from the Reagan administration how important. how vital it was. to balance the budget by 1983. Now we rarely hear a thing. Not from the President. Not from the media. This is truly a disgrace to our Nation as a whole. If nothing is done and we idly sit back and ignore the issue of deficit reduction we will soon find ourselves totally immersed into a recession. the likes of which we have never known. It is essential that action is taken immediately to combat the everincreasing apathy that is fast spreading throughout the Nation on this issue. To do this. we must commit ourselves to finding a solution and act accordingly through cooperation. \"Deficit Day.\" should signal our awareness of the problem and our strong desire to see this problem through. No longer can we tolerate a $1 trillion debt. No longer should we accept. without concern. deficits totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. This is indeed a threat not only to our Nations economy. but to the very future of our Nation as a whole. We must resolve to hold down Federal spending levels. We must remain firm in our stance to limit growth in defense spending to the congressionally mandated level of 5 percent. We should treat. with serious concern. the ramifications of complacency. This is not the time to ignore what desperately needs to be done. This is the time to cast partisanship aside and cast a vote for the American people. A people too strong and too proud to be disgraced by this reckless abandon. It is time to recognize failure for what it is. In a positive way. it can mean a form of education. nothing but the first step to something better. Let us not tell others what to do. and how to do it. but never do it ourselves.

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday. a stunning new exhibit opened at the Smithsonian Institution. The exhibit consists of precious Jewish worship and ornamental treasures from Czechoslovakia. dating from the 16th through the 20th centuries. These treasures were confiscated by the Nazis from Jewish families who were sent to concentration camps. Amazingly enough. the Nazis did not destroy these articles. but ordered curators from the Jewish Museum in Prague to assemble the most valuable and interesting objects into a single collection. Following World War II the collection reverted to the Czech Government. The exhibit. which is being displayed at the National Museum of Natural History through January 2. 1984. serves as a reminder of struggle. courage. and faithunvanquished by Nazi oppression. When viewing these priceless objects we are forced to remember the tragedy of Jewish persecution in war torn Czechoslovakia. And we are also forced to commend the spirit of these peoplemany of whom will only be remembered through the personal treasures they left behind. Many individuals have criticized the West for not doing enough to spare those imprisoned and murdered by Nazi war criminals. Sadly. we cannot go back and erase that black mark on world history. but we can contribute to the future security of the worlds people. Ratification of the Genocide Treaty would do just that. The treaty defines genocide and establishes a legal system of punishment against the perpetrators of genocide. Yet it also symbolizes both our disgust at past atrocities. and our commitment to the future safety and peaceful coexistence of mankind. Some may debate the depth of Western commitment to stopping the Holocaust of World War II. Since the United States has not ratified the Genocide Treaty. critics would certainly be correct in claiming that we are not currently doing enough to prevent future Holocausts. I urge the Senate to silence this appropriate criticism. Ratify the Genocide Treaty and let it be our symbol of struggle for human rights. courage against it foes. and faith in world peacejust as the exhibit of Judaic treasures symbolizes the struggle. courage. and faith of a brutally slaughtered people. We must never forget that dark tragedy. We must act to prevent its recurrence. We must ratify the Genocide Treaty. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I am today submitting a sense of the Senate resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and calling upon the President to designate the week of May 814. 1983. as National Product Safety Week. Each of us as consumers use a variety of household and other products during the course of a typical day with too little thought given to product safety. Yet. last year alone there were approximately 34 million accidental injuries and over 27.000 deaths associated with consumer products. Although these numbers have been declining in recent years. they are still at an unacceptable level. It is though the combined efforts of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. organized consumer groups. industry trade associations. and more careful product selection and use by consumers that the number of injuries and deaths has been and. hopefully will continue to be reduced. The celebration of the week of May 814. 1983. as National Product Safety Week will focus attention on an issue that affects every citizen. Mr. President. the continuing serious problem of productrelated injuries and deaths is one that can be substantially alleviated through improved product design. more effective warnings and instructions to consumer users. and enhanced public education efforts aimed at making consumers more informed and cautious in product use. Thus. it is fitting for the Senate to take note of National Product Safety Week as a means of directing the attention of the American people to the hazards associated with use of consumer products and to ways of lessening those hazards.

I have had my worst fears about the future of our children confirmed: Drug abuse is indeed undermining the future of America by poisoning our children. I also discoveredto my shock and dismaythat youth drug abuse cannot be legislated away. Over the past two decades. the use of illegal drugs in the United States has continued to grow and now pervades every community. More than 22 million Americansnearly onetenth of our populationare marihuana users. According to a recent survey. 1 out of 14 high school seniors are daily users of marihuana. Over 4 million people. twothirds of whom are between the ages of 18 and 25. use cocaine on a regular basis. Approximately onehalf million Americans are heroin addicts. The impact of youth drug abuse is devastating. During the past 20 years. the health of all Americans has been improving. with one notable exception: The death rate for young Americans is higher than it was 20 years ago. Drug abuse has been the major factor in this frightening trend. Our society also pays a heavy toll for drug abusesuffering economic loss and an increase in violent crime in their communitiesnot to mention the misery of seeing the young people of this country destroy themselves. Too many children have been left emotionally and functionally crippled by illegal drugs. Only through education can we effectively prevent youth drug abuse. It is vital that TV and radio public service announcements be produced and widely distributed to provide children with solid information on the health hazards of illegal drugs. I wish to share with my colleagues and submit for the RECORD an excellent editorial from the April 11. 1983 Newsweek by Pete Axthelm entitled \"Throwing It All Away\" which discusses the tragic loss of Billy Ylvisaker.

Now no less an authority than Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap. the North Vietnamese military commander. and his colleague. Gen. Vo Vo Bam. have demolished this hoary myth. According to General Bam. the Communist government in North Vietnam decided to unleash armed aggression against the Saigon government in 1959. a full year before the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam was formed. Work on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. which funneled Communist soldiers and military supplies from North Vietnam to the South also began that year. 2 years before President Kennedy sent the first 685 U.S. military advisers to South Vietnam.

I join in cosponsoring the amendment of the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana. because formula changes adopted in committee would create a terrible inequity with respect to the distribution of any increase in the revenuesharing program. I point out what would take place in New York State under the formula change. There may be a $225 million annual increase. and we have reason to believe there will be some increase because the House of Representatives has provided a $450 million increase. so if some compromise is reached between the Senate and the House of Representatives. let us use $225 million. The Treasury Department estimates that New York State would receive an additional $22 million of which $20 million. as a result of this new formula. would go to one city. New York City. Certainly. no one can accuse me of not having fought for this city. But that leaves only $2 million for the other municipalities and counties in the State. If I might just share with the Senate. there are 1.608 jurisdictions in the State of New York that are recipients of revenuesharing moneys. Fourteen hundred of these would receive absolutely no increase. Mr. President. on a national level. there are 22.000 jurisdictions that. by way of the formula change. would not result in an increase in revenue sharing under the formula change. 17.000 of the 39.000 would receive the whole increase. The distribution is so disproportionate. Pointing again to my State where New York City would get 90 percent of those funds and the remainder of the jurisdictions would receive not 1 pennys increase. I think these figures highlight why successful passage of this amendment is absolutely critical to our cities. villages. and counties throughout the Nation. The formula change reported out of committee is unfair to those jurisdictions that would not receive an increase. We need to establish more equity in our policymaking.

DavisBacon has been discussed extensively in the Chamber. It is not necessary to go into great length. and I shall be brief. further. because I know Members are anxious to go home. but just let me make these very brief points. Mr. President. the General Accounting Office has conducted a number of studies over the years on DavisBacon. and each and every one of those studies concluded that DavisBacon should be repealed because it adds an enormous additional cost to construction projects. In recent testimony before the House Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and Human Resources. it was revealed that some local governments actually avoid committing revenuesharing funds to construction projects because paying the artificial contrived prevailing wage makes the project too expensive. It was also found that workers on Federal projects under the DavisBacon requirements were being paid at twice as much as their counterparts on a nearby private project. According to the Associated Builders and Contractors. unemployment for individuals in the building trades is hovering around the 20percent mark. My point is. Mr. President. for those who are concerned. as all of us are. I think. about unemployment in the construction trades. we should free up revenuesharing money. and exempt the program from DavisBacon provisions so that more of the funds under revenue sharing will be committed to construction projects versus administrative costs. We have heard a lot of fine speeches today about concern for the pinch in which communities find themselves. Let us ease up on the communities and allow them to spend this money in a way they choose by exempting the revenuesharing program from the strictures of the DavisBacon Act.

Mr. President. the Senator from Pennsylvania makes the point that only a small part of the funds under revenue sharing are committed to construction projects. I reiterate that recent testimony before the House Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and Human Resources revealed that communities did not commit a very large share of revenue sharing funds to construction for the very reason that DavisBacon makes it so extraordinarily expensive. in some cases twice as expensive. to construct projects with revenuesharing funds than the costs of local projects that have been privately funded. That is why a great deal of revenuesharing funds are not committed to construction. because of this DavisBacon stricture that I am trying to remove. It seems to me this is the perfect opportunity. with respect to revenue sharing. to address DavisBacon. I am not trying to repeal or modify DavisBacon across the board. I am simply trying. for the sake of the communities. to give them the flexibility to spend this money in the way that best suits them without them being biased away from construction projects by the inflation that DavisBacon brings to the cost of such construction projects.

Initially. all funding for the study was to be authorized for 1984 and. at $1 million. would have amounted to nearly 15 percent of the $7 million expended annually to administer the entire general revenuesharing program. This provision. too. has been modified to restrict funding to the lesser of actual costs or 5 percent of the GRS administrative budget for 3 years.

I have agreed instead to support the amendment of Senator DuRE3NERGER calling for a major study of the revenuesharing program and the current operating formulas. with consideration to be given to the advantages of using the Representative Tax System.

After the First World War a great French statesman called Rumania a bulwark against the Bolshevik poison. and for more than 20 years thereafter Rumanias mission as a Christian outpost against the atheistic Communists won her widespread respect throughout the Western World. But 18 years ago last March 6 the people of Rumania were robbed of their national independence by the Russian imperialists. In March 1945. the Soviet representative. Andrei Vishinsky. forced the young Rumanian monarch to commission a cabinet led by a Communist sympathizer and dominated by Communists. and not long thereafter the Communists consolidated their power grab. Thus the Russians destroyed the free government of an old and honored nation and imposed upon the Rumanian people a form of government which is completely foreign to their ideas. culture. and traditions. Yet the Rumanian people have not lost their love of human freedom. their faith in the destiny of their nation. They remain dedicated to the cause of the free worldthe belief that justice will prevail among nations and that Rumania will once again resume her rightful place in the family of nations. free to return to the beauty of her ancient civilization. It is this unshakeable faith which holds the people of Rumania in an alliance of the heart with the people of the United Statesan alliance which someday will be strengthened by the passing of Soviet imperialism.

The people of Rumania will be prohibited from celebrating this anniversary by the alien government which has been imposed on them by the masters of the Communist imperialism.

This is certainly true in the case of Rumanian people. who had regained their independence 86 years ago with the aid of the fighting forces of czarist Russia. but today they are enslaved by the Soviet regime of Communist Russia. The last war brought national tragedy to these people. Rumanians were among the first peoples to be involved in that war. and they were also among the first to be caught in the claws of the Soviet Unions unrelenting Communist totalitarianism. Mr. Speaker. as we well know. Rumanias modern history has had its sad and tragic side. Centuries ago. when the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. helpless Rumanians were not in a position to resist effectively their conquerors. and so had to submit to their oppressive rule. But they were never reconciled with their lot. and they did not want to submit willingly to the Ottoman regime. Instead. they tried to maintain their spirit of freedom and love of independence. They fought their oppressors endlessly and with all the means at their disposal. Then in the course of the last century the Ottoman regime showed signs of weakening. while Rumanias cause of freedom gained friends .8157 and enlisted forces in and out of Rumania. Soon after the Crimean War in 1856 Rumanians gained autonomous status. and in 1877 they regained their freedom and independence. May 10 of that year. the date on which Rumanians proclaimed their independence and vowed to attain it. marked a veritable turning point In their national history. From that day on they became masters of their destiny. and took their fate into their own hands. It is of course true that since then there have been ups and downs in their forward march as a sovereign and independent nation. but through it all these sturdy and stouthearted Rumanians have clung to their right to freedom.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Rumanians make up one of the most numerous ethnic groups in the Balkan Peninsula. and their fertile land is perhaps the most bountiful in natural resources. Today more than 18 million Rumanians live in a territory of about 100.000 square miles. Nature has been generous in enriching the soil of the land in a way to make it the most productive in the whole region. while its subsoil is enormously rich in natural resources. including vast petroleum deposits. These rugged peasants in the vast range of eastern Balkans have lived in this land from time immemorial. When their peace was threatened by their numerous foes. they always gave a good account of themselves and succeeded in maintaining their freedom. Then early in modern times came the Ottoman Turks. who. carrying everything before them In their victory march. swept over the entire Balkan Peninsula. and overran Rumania. Thenceforth for some 400 years Rumanians lived under the oppressive rule of Ottoman sultans callous agents. They were never reconciled to their lot as subjects of their hated foes. so they rose and staged open revolt against the Turks. Until mid19th century they had no success. Instead. they were severely and Inhumanly punished by their oppressors for attempting to free themselves. Then in the middle of the last century an international event. the Crimean War. worked in their favor. At the end of that war the Turkish Government was persuaded by the great European powers to grant autonomy to the Rumanian people. Rumanians were grateful for what they received then. but were not quite satisfied and contented. what they wanted was full freedom and independence. This they attained in During the RussoTurkish War of 187778 Rumanians rose almost to a man. rebelled against the Turks. proclaimed their independence on May 10 of 1377. and fought on the side of the Russians to the victorious end of that war. In the peace treaty signed in 1878. Rumanias independence was guaranteed by the great powers. and thus they were assured of their national independence. Since 1877 May 10 has become a Rumanian national holiday and its anniversary is being observed in all Rumanian communities. in and out of Rumania. I am indeed happy to join RumanianAmericans in the celebration of the 86th anniversary of Rumanian Independence Day.",

But ironically Rumanias official national holiday commemorates. not some great event in the life of the Rumanian people. but the triumph of Soviet arms at the end of World War II. Thus is a conquered people forced to pay homage to its conquerors. But on Thursday Rumanians did not page homage in their hearts. It was on the following day. May 10. that Rumaniansquietly and without the hoisting of flagsrecalled the freedom and independence that once were theirs and looked forvard to the day when their country may again be delivered from foreign domination. For it was on May 10. 1866. that Prince Charles I was inaugurated sovereign of a united people. and on May 10. 1877. that Rumania finally threw off the Ottoman yoke. The peoples of Eastern Europe differ from one another in history. language. and customs. Mr. Speaker. but they are at one in their love of liberty and in their passionate desire for national independence. We in America share fully their hopes and ideals.

Egypt has stepped up its political efforts against Israel. With the assistance of the Soviet Union and West German scientists. Nasser has embarked upon a deadly arms race in the Middle East.

With this thought in mind. I have today introduced legislation. identical to bills which were offered in the last Congress and which have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in this session. to establish an International Home Loan Bank. This proposal. which has the backing of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the U.S. Savings and Loan League. among other groups. has as its purpose the development in other countries. especially the underdeveloped nations of the world. of a savings and loan system to promote thrift. encourage homeownership. and aid in the rise of middle class among these people. The mechanism of this bill. by which it would accomplish its goals. would be an International Home Loan Bank through which financial backing could be given to the developing savings and loan industry abroad. Clearly. the goals which are set for the International Home Loan Bank would be important in helping homeownership in the underdeveloped countries. This form of development is meaningful apart from any Communist threat. It is a real step forward In the entire social structure of the nation establishing these lending institutions. It meets problems which exist independent of the cold war. and It envisions the involvement of the people of the recipient nation. indeed their involvement as the primary force in this matter. in the effort to overcome these problems. Late last year. the New York Times published an article on housing needs in Latin America. This article. which appeared in the Sunday. October 21. edition of the Times. points up the importance of this problem and I ask unanimous consent that it be made a part of my remarks to help give a clearer understanding of the bill I have introduced and its goals.",

I say that to the Members of this body simply because this is not a balancedbudget issue. It is an issue that the chairman of the Budget Committee has put forth so his colleagues. as they have tried to do year after year. can find something that they can hide behind so that they can go home to their constitutents and suggest to them that they do support the concept of a balanced budget. and in so suggesting that. they can point to a given piece of legislation and say that \"herein lies my support.\" Let me reiterate a variety of things this bill does do. but. more importantly. what this piece of legislation does not do. because I think it is so important for the Members of this body to understand that as clearly as possible they can in voting this bill up or down. Now. this bill that we are debating today does indicate a need to reduce Federal deficits. and for that I praise the chairman of the Budget Committee for iterating in the first portion of the bill that there is a need. And I do not know of a Member of this body who would argue against that. But what the bill does not do. it does not say that we need to balance the Federal budget now or in the future. Nowhere in this legislation is there an affirmative statement that suggests that a balanced budget is a reasonably good item for this body to consider. Now. it does say to the President that he should submit a balancedbudget proposal for fiscal year 1986 and thereafter. Oh. but then again. if he does not like to. he can submit an alternative.

Mr. Speaker. this bill purports to be a balancedbudget measure. Nothing is further from the truth. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 6300 contains no requirement that the Congress adopt a balanced budget. that the Congress implement a balanced budget or even consider one. Mr. Speaker. a stronger version of the Jones proposal was public law in 1980. 1981. and 1982. And the Budget Committee. under the sponsors leadership. ignored it. The Congress ignored it. That law. Public Law 965. required Congress to balance the budget and Congress failed to do so. notwithstanding the fact the author was chairman of the committee that had the responsibility to bring such legislation to the floor of the House. Now. there is no question that the intent of this legislation is very clear and that is to absolve the Congress of any responsibility for failure to enact balanced budgets in the past. in the future. and to undermine any effort that we have going on to achieve a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. But the procedure for consideration in the context of the Jones bill represents an effort by the House majority leadership to get a vote on the socalled balancedbudget legislation before the election through a vehicle so meaningless that even staunch opponents of a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget can vote for it. This is not a vote for a balanced budget. This is a vote for congressional irresponsibility and unaccountability.

I rise first of all to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for bringing such a relatively clean supplemental appropriations bill to the floor. I think that is an appropriate process. But I do want to rise to discuss the provision that was included in the Transportation bill. which was signed by the President in August of this year. which precluded the Office of Personnel Management from implementing regulations which it had proposed which have a very substantial and in the opinion of many adverse effect on our Federal employees. That same preclusion is included in the TreasuryPostal bill which is pending in committee. which I understand. Mr. Chairman. the full Appropriations Committee will consider during the week of October 17 and will probably be reported to the floor at the end of that week. That provision continues to preclude the Officer of Personnel Management from implementing those regulations. The Transportation bill included a provision which precluded the Office of Personnel Management from implementing those regulations up to October 15 of this year. That was in expectation that the PostalTreasury bill would have become law on or before that date. It appears that that will not happen. Nevertheless. I and many. many Members of this House who are concerned about that particular question have not sought in the Rules Committee the opportunity to amend this supplemental appropriation bill. We have not done so. Mr. Chairman and Members of this body. because we have received assurances. not directly but assurances have been made. particularly to the other body. that the Office of Personnel Management. notwithstanding the fact that October 15 may come and go. will not seek to implement the regulations which were noted by the Office of Personnel Management in July. Because of that fact. and solely because of that fact. we have not sought to amend this bill. We appreciate those assurances. It is my understanding that those assurances will be noted in the other body as well. In closing. I thank the chairman for his consideration of this issue and his deep concern with this issue which I have discussed with him and the ranking member.",

I hope he hears your words and the words of Senator STEVENS because I think you are speaking for a very large number of Members on this floor and in the other body when you have urged upon him a very cautious course. If Mr. Devine is to move forward. I think he would be misjudging the temper of both bodies. He is already known in the Congress of the United States as a man who has acted very often without legislative support. But this would probably be the beginning of an effort to see him removed from his position. He is someone who is terribly unpopular with Federal workers and this act of congressional defiance would be the final straw were he to take any action on merit pay at this point. I think the Congress will speak very clearly on this issue when we are given the opportunity.

This sport fish restoration program is administered by the Department of the Interior. and the authorization of expenditures for the program is within the sole Jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public Works.

    "speech": "I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin. I am especially concerned with the cap on general revenue expenditures for inland navigation projects proposed by this amendment. This is nothing more than a backdoor approach to increase user fees since by capping expenditures from the General Treasury greater spending from the Inland Waterway Trust Fund will be forced. At present. there is a barge fuel tax at the rate of 8 cents per gallon. This tax will rise to 10 cents per gallon next year. The proceeds from this tax are deposited into the trust fund to pay for a portion of new construction costs. Additional user fees will wreak economic havoc upon whole regions of the Nation dependent upon waterborne commerce. But most importantly. user fees are nothing but a cruel joke on the American people. All Americans are the direct beneficiaries of projects which facilitate commercial navigation on the inland waterway system. All Americans are the users of this system. Commodities such as coal. grain. and steel which are transported over the rivers are used by all Americans in a number of ways. Electricity generated from coal. Bread made from grain. Automobiles manufactured from steel. If user fees are increased. this cost will be passed on to the consumer of these products. And the true irony of this situation is that Americans. through their tax dollars. expect their public works infrastructure to be maintained properly. To be frank. user fees are a dishonest form of taxation on the American people. We would tax them indirectly by increasing their cost for products made possible by waterborne commerce. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us today contains a balance between authorization. and cost recovery. This balance must not be tampered with. If the gentleman is concerned that projects which do not deserve to be constructed may go forward under this bill. I wuld suggest he is mistaken. While we may authorize them. funds must still be appropriated. There is no need for a cap on expendituresthe appropriations process will provide that check.

Development. and Infrastructure Improvement and Rehabilitation Act of 1983. It is well known that this bill represents the first major authorization for new water projects since 1976 with the last true construction authorization enacted in 1970. This bill. introduced after almost 2 years of exhaustive hearings in which 486 witnesses testified. represents a broad consensus of our Nations water resource needs. The costsharing reforms included in H.R. 3678 move the price of federally subsidized water programs much closer to their real economic value. representing a major achievement of this measure. The new authorizations included will repair the Nations inland waterway facilities. new and modern port channels. and provide for construction of flood control and other sorely needed water related projects. H.R. 3678 also contains several provisions that are particularly important to my own home State of Massachusetts. The first is the Town Brook flood control project which has been studied by the Army Corps of Engineers and will prevent an estimated $2.1 million worth of damage annually in Quincy and Braintree. MA. Title V contains an authorization for dredging the Neponset River from the Milton Town Landing to Port Norfolk. MA.

To be constructed adjacent to Lake Francis Case. it would be implemented in two stages. each stage with a capacity of 1.180 megawatts. According to the report of the Chief of Engineers. the cost of the Gregory County project. based on October 1981 price levels. would be $1.502.834.000 and the project would have a costbenefit ratio of 1.6. In a report issued earlier by the Omaha district engineer. it was noted there is a need for 10.000 to 11.000 megawatts of additional generating capacity in the 1990s to meet future power supply needs in the region. As further noted in this report. the Gregory County hydroelectric pumped storage facility with a potential capacity of nearly 2.400 megawatts would make a tremendous contribution to the energy supply needs of the region. After much evaluation. the Corps of Engineers has determined that the facility is not only economically feasible. but would provide greater savings than conventional hydropower in meeting the power needs of the region. and is the most significant opportunity for additional hydropower on the Missouri River main stem system. Legislation reported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works in the Senate already authorizes construction of the Gregory County hydroelectric pumped storage project by the Corps of Engineers.

I have had the opportunity to meet with and work with a group of concerned citizens who have joined together to form the Two Rivers Campsite Preservation Coalition.

They have worked with Members of Congress along both sides of the Mississippi River in seeking their goal. and their campaign has been marked by reason and commonsense. At issue here and addressed by this bill is a policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that calls for the termination of campsite leases along the Mississippi River. More than 2.000 families now hold campsite leases along the river. These are people who gained these leases back in the 1950s when the corps was encouraging this mild form of development on the public land that adjoins the river. Those who hold these campsite leases are individuals who love the outdoors. There are no expensive homes on these sites nor commercial ventures. These are simple vacation and weekend retreats for those who enjoy time spent along this beautiful river. Leaseholders. by their presence. have also provided a degree of security and aid for those who use the river. The provision in this bill that affects the leaseholders simply states that the Corps of Engineers cannot terminate these leases unless a higher priority use is shown for the land. such as a park development or use in a flood control or navigation project. This will provide the current leaseholders with assurance that they will not be tossed off the land. When the Government sought people to use the riverfront to provide a small degree of development. these individuals responded. I do not think this measure of clarification is too much for them to seek in return.*",

The Potomac River. which is one of this Nations recreational treasures. is about to be lost forever unless Congress takes firm. swift action. There is an insidious weed. called hydrilla. which is spreading so fast that our experts tell us if we do not begin controlling it this year. and then continue battling it in years to come. it will multiply and spread its green. odorous. noxious mats on each side of the river until it meets in the center. This may sound like a lowbudget science fiction movie. but I assure you that hydrilla is. indeed. a green monster that can and will eat the Potomac if we do not act. If you havent seen this green weed. let me give you a frame of reference. It is an aquatic version of kudzu. the vine that was planted some years ago along our interstates because it helped impede erosion and now covers thousands of acres throughout most of the South and Southeast. Hydrilla is out of control in Florida. where it has choked whole lakes and streams. and I am told. has actually caused the deaths of swimmers who have been entangled in it. I have asked the Secretary of the Army to redirect some contingency funds and research funds to finance a pilot program of control during this summers growing season. A preliminary plan has already been developed by the Army Corps of Engineers. But this is not the complete answer. That is why this amendment would instruct the Army Corps of Engineers to continue its studies. in concert with the Department of Agriculture and other cooperating Federal agencies. and devise a containment plan and estimate its cost by May 1985. just before the start of the next growing season. It would not cost any money. except for the study itself. I respectfully urge adoption of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am offering this amendment to correct an urgent and frustrating problem that has plagued motorists from the south shore area of Massachusetts for years. The problem involves the drawbridge locate6 in my district that has been repeatedly opened during normal commuting hours. Opening the drawbridge during rush hour stops all traffic dead in its tracks. However. unlike a traffic jam. there is no hope of autombiles creeping along at a slow pace. The resulting delays are understandbly infuriating as motorists sit helplessly for up to half an hour while the ship passes through. There is absolutely no reason for the bulk of these unnecessary delays. Although the magnitude of such unpredictable delays is obvious. negotiations with the Coast Guard have not produced an adequate solution. Current Federal regulations afford all water traffic the rightofway over land traffic. These regulations made sense in the early 1900s when they were enacted. but they are no longer applicable to the demands of modem transportation. While ship passings have decreased. traffic congestion has become a major problem in the Boston area. Random opening of the drawbridge is intolerable. There may be 1 or 2 days a month when tide conditions make it important for a ship to pass during commuter hours. however. there are many more days when rush hour passage is nothing more than a matter of convenience for the ship operators. The present 2year reconstruction effort on the Southeast Expressway has aggravated the problem further by increasing the traffic pressure on Route 3A. The problem was brought to its most absurd extreme earlier this spring when the bridge was raised in the middle of a 10kilometer road race taking place on Route 3A. Rather than jump the widening gap. half of the contenders in the race prudently waited for the bridge to close. Clearly. this demonstrates the need to reconcile current regulations governing the drawbridge with the needs of the surrounding communities. My amendment would turn the authority to regulate the bridge over to the State of Massachusetts. By granting this authority to the State. proper weight can be given to all factors involved in this unfortunate situation and a quick. effective solution can be reached.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I commend the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his leadership and initiative in offering this amendment. The amendment will reaffirm the important agricultural contract sanctity provision of the Futures Trading Act of 1982. and I urge my colleagues to support it. On October 1. 1982. the agricultural contract sanctity amendment was offered by Senator DURENBERGER to legislation reported from the Agriculture Committee. As I stated on that day: The intent of this amendment is to regain the image of a reliable supplier of agricultural commodities in foreign markets for the United States. but in a manner that does not impinge upon the Presidents authority to conduct foreign policy. The amendment was adopted by the full Senate with bipartisan support. When the Agriculture Committees met in conference on the Futures Trading Act. the House accepted the Senate version of contract sanctity. President Reagan signed the legislation into law on January 11. 1983. The Senate should reaffirm this provision by adopting the Boschwitz amendment today. Such action is a necessary step to rebuild our trade relationships after the damage done by the CarterMondale grain embargo of American farmers are still feeling the impact of that embargo. along with the other economic problems caused by global surpluses. weak economies. and increased foreign competition. We can help our farmers get back on track in world markets by adopting this amendment today. At this point I would like to discuss the role of agricultural exports in foreign policy. highlight two provisions of my legislation. and make clear President Reagans record on agricultural trade.",

The paper revealed that some Farmers Home Administration employees have purchased farmland. after first acting in their official capacity for the agency and turning downloan requests from farmers who intended to purchase the same land. Mr. President. Farmers Home Administration is the lender of last resort for many farmers. FmHAs decision oftentimes determines the financial future of farmersthat is. whether they continue productive lives or face bankruptcy. This kind of activity by agency employees destroys the American farmers confidence in an agency that has already been under increasing fire from the agricultural community for some of its other policies. The National Director of the Farmers Home Administration has indicated that he takes this issue seriously. and has called for an Inspector Generals investigation. I support this request. Mr. President. I will be offering legislation in the near future to make certain that this type of activity does not occur in the future. My legiclation will not ban FmHA employees from owning farms or engaging in farming. but it will prevent abuses of this type from taking place.

    "speech": "Mr. President. our Nations farmers face a multitude of problems. We have an overabundance of some farm products that. coupled with weak demand in international markets. has led to unstable or depressed prices for commodities. Net cash farm income will. most likely. decline substantially in 1984. Farmers also have to cope with interest rates that remain at persistently high levels. increased production costs. and Federal commodity programs that offer little incentive for participation. Of course. these difficulties are not insurmountable. I am convinced that. with the help of a sound farm policy. our farmers can meet the challenge presented by the current situation. Mr. President. I believe that the rejuvenation of farm policy should be one of the highest priorities for the Senate in 1984. Complicating our Job will be the policy restraints caused by the current and projected budget deficits. In fact. much of the discussion over the past year concerning farm policy has focused on the current costs of the farm programs. We must continue to be mindful of the costcertainly no one will argue that the high cost of the farm programs In 1983 was acceptable. However. I believe that much of the rising cost of farm programs is due to poor management by bureaucrats in the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Agriculture. Steps must be taken to make USDA operations more efficient so that the Nation does not lose faith in historic programs that are of such great value to farmers and consumers alike.",

I rise in support of this bill. and in particular the gentleman in the well should be congratulated for his interest and dedication to minority employment with the FCC. While I will support this FCC authorization bill. I want to add my voice to those who have raised serious concern about the minority hiring practices of the Commission. The lack of minority employment in the communications field generally. is equally pronounced within the Federal Communications Commission. Minorities are virtually excluded from policymaking decisions. and minority employment in senior level positions at the Commission has steadily declined over the past 3 years. Currently. there is only 1 minority employee out of 35 in a senior executive service position at the Commission. and only 1 minority employed in a professional capacity in any of the four Commissioners offices. I am not suggesting that there is some magical number that indicates an Agencys commitment to equal opportunity or affirmative action. but the FCCs record strongly suggests that they have not made a good faith effort in recruiting and hiring minority personnel. For this reason. I support the provision in this authorization bill which provides funding for additional positions at the FCC. It has been stipulated by members of the Telecommunications Subcommittee that these funds must be used to increase minority employment at the Commission. The situation at the FCC warrants this forceful action. since their hiring practices have excluded minority perspectives in the formulation of communications policy. It is my hope that this authorization will mark the first step in resolving this serious problem.",

I introduced H.R. 3105 to establish an Office of Ethnic Affairs within the Federal Communications Commission. I introduced this bill for several reasons. First and foremost it was based on concerns prompted by the fact that in the first 3 months of 1983. more than 22.000 complaints were lodged with the FCC regarding TV and radio programing. This compares to 38.000 for all of 1982. There is no breakdown by either ethnic or racial groups therefore it is difficult to assess how many of these complaints were based on programing which depicted these groups in a disparaging fashion. However. it is safe to assume that a number of these complaints were filed by ethnic and racial groups. My second reason for sponsoring H.R. 3105 was to build into the FCC a more specific mechanism to handle complaints from ethnic and racial groups. Presently. there is an office of Public Affairs in the FCC which seems to double as the complaint bureau. I believe it is critical to establish a specific office to monitor these specific complaints. I would like to ask the chairman of the subcommittee how I can work with him to assure this issue is addressed in hearings and by monitoring the FCCs handling of complaints from ethnic and racial minorities?",

The gentleman from New York has been instrumental in bringing the issue of the negative portrayal of ethnic groups on television to the attention of both this subcommittee and the entire House. The Subcommittee on Telecommunications has devoted an enormous amount of time to the problem of making sure broadcasters are responsive and sensitive to the needs of the local community in which we are located. To date. the subcommittee has held three hearings that have focused on the portrayal of racial and ethnic minorities by the broadcast media. Television and radio have the unique ability to bring America together through the presentation of diverse ideas and thoughts. But and I think the gentleman would agree that with this unique ability comes responsibility to meet the needs of groups within a community. and that responsibility is abdicated when television is replete with negative portrayals of ethnic and racial minorities. that. through stereotypes. may often be demeaning. These issues are being focused on by the Telecommunications Subcommittee. particularly in our efforts to devise consensus broadcast reform legislation. I would welcome the gentleman assisting our efforts in this regard. Additionally. when the House reconvenes early next year my subcommittee plans to hold another FCC oversight hearing which can specifically include a discussion of the issues in your bill H.R. 3105. I would like to invite the gentleman to join the subcommittee at this hearing so that he may ask the FCC directly how complaints regarding the depiction of racial and ethnic groups are being handled. and to clarify the responsibilities of broadcasters in meeting the needs of these various groups.

These areas are presently underserved by existing fullpower television stations. and I have been assured that this service presents competition for neither existing commercial nor proposed cable stations. The Federal Communications Commission. with a backlog of more than 10.000 applications for a lowpower television service. has made some progress in issuing licenses for these small stations to operate. However. at the present time the FCC is processing approximately 20 applications per month in a threetiered system. using mileage from major markets as its guide. It will be years before certain applications are considered because of applicants proximity to a large city like. in our case. New York or Philadelphia. The Telecommunications Subcommittee has made it clear that it wants expeditious approval of new technology by the FCC. This bill authorizes additional positions within the FCC for this purpose.

In order to avoid the delay that would occur if the several lowpower televison applications were processed in the usual comparative proceeding. Congress last year gave the FCC the authority to use a lottery system to select lowpower television stations which along with money for new computer capability. will help speed the delivery of this service. I know from earlier correspondence with the FCC that the gentlewoman has shared with us in the subcommittee that this backlog works to delay the availability of this new broadcast service in New Jersey as well as all areas of the country. The subcommittee has and will continue to express our strong concern that the Commission is not processing these applications at the rate that has been anticipated. The committee has continually reminded the Commission and clearly stated in the committee report that should additional resources be needed for processing lowpower television applications. the Commission should ask us for it. and otherwise Congress will expect that the processing of lowpower television applications go forward at a much. much faster rate. This issue has been continually raised by the subcommittee each time the FCC appears before us in oversight hearings. The next oversight hearing will take place early in the year 1984. and I would invite the gentlewoman from New Jersey to please come and join us to express her concern and to again push or. I might say. kick the Commission. if that is a better verb to use. I would appreciate the gentlewomans help. We have had a very difficult time cajoling. pushing. kicking. and getting them to move on an issue that we all agree on they piously agree but have not done anything.",

Many of our colleagues do not realize that this is a brand new station in New Jersey. The fact of the matter is. it is the only VHF station in my home State of New Jersey.

I strongly support H.R. 2755. and congratulate my good friend from Colorado for the outstanding job that he and the subcommittee have done in presenting us with this legislation. and urge my colleagues to support it. Madam Chairman. the bill authorizes $91.2 million for the FCC for fiscal years 1984 and 1985. This represents a $5 million increase. requested by the Commission. above the figure recommended in the Presidents 1984 budget. The additional funds would enable the Mass Media and Common Carrier Bureaus to reduce large backlogs of applications for new and existing services and also help the Common Carrier Bureau address postdivestiture policy issues. The bill also increases existing authorizations for public broadcasting for 1984. 1985 and 1986 from $130 million for each of those years to $145 million. $153 million and $162 million. These figures would preserve the current 1983 appropriations level of $137 million in real terms over the next 3 years by applying an inflation factor of 5.6 percent. the projection in the administrations budget request to Congress. The case for these modest increases is clear and is spelled out in my letter of March 7 to Congressman NATCHER. chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over public broadcasting. advising him of the Energy and Commerce Committees recommendation to the Budget Committee in this regard.

Mr. Chairman. this provision would prevent the U.S. Customs Service from the enforcement of any provision permitting agricultural products to enter the United States from Caribbean Basin countries duty free. The recently enacted Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act provides for the dutyfree entry of certain products from countries designated by the President as Caribbean Basin countries. Section 511 of this bill overrides this provision by preventing Customs from establishing this new category of dutyfree products in the Tariff Schedules. Paragraph (b). clause 5 of House rule XXI makes bills and resolutions containing tax and tariff measures which are reported by any committee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures and amendments to such bills or resolutions in the House or proposed by the Senate subject to a point of order at any time during House consideration of the legislation. Just as tax measures include all provisions having the substantive effect of amending the Internal Revenue Code. tariff measures include all provisions having the substantive effect of amending the Tariff Schedules. Section 511 is clearly a tariff measure. z..nce the inability of the Customs Service to enforce the provision of present law generally requiring the dutyfree entry of agricultural products from designated Caribbean Basin countries will result in those products which would be subject to duty in the absence of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act continuing to be subject to duty. Thus. section 511 clearly is a substantive amendment to the Tariff Schedules and a tariff measure within the score of rule XXI. Mr. Chairman. I urge the Chair to sustain this point of order against section 511 of H.R. 4139 on the grounds that it violates paragraph (b). clause 5 of rule XXI of the House of Representatives.",

Paragraph (b) was added in the 98th Congress in House Resolution 5. and voted upon on January 3. 1983. Mr. Chairman. I maintain that this provision is not a tax or tariff measure which is prohibited by the new rule. It is a limitation which prohibits the Customs Service from enforcing a certain provision of law which allows agricultural products from Caribbean Basin countries from entering the United States duty free. The provision does not actually change the existing statute and it does not modify any tax or tariff measure. I think it is important that we note that the exact words of the new rule are \"No bill * * * carrying a tax or tariff measure shall be reported by a committee not having jurisdiction * * *.\" The rule says nothing about limitations. or restrictions on enforcement provisions.

The gentleman from Illinois has raised a point of order against section 511 on the ground that the section constitutes a tariff measure falling within clause 5(b) of rule XXI. The Chair has listened to the arguments on both sides of the issue. On the one hand. the section in question results in the imposition of a higher tariff on certain imported products and changes the application of the Caribbean Basin Recovery Act. on the other hand. there is the argument that the section is nothing more than a familiar limitation on an appropriation bill of the type held in order for many years. This is the first case in which the Chair has been called upon to apply the new clause 5(b) of rule XXI. and the Chair has weighed the implications of his ruling in this particular case. It seems to the Chair that the existing law is clear. The Caribbean Basin Act would permit the dutyfree entry of certain agricultural products providing that certain Presidential determinations have been made in accordance with that act. The effect of the enactment of section 511 would be to deny dutyfree status to those agricultural products and the Chair notes that the Committee on Appropriations in its report on page 77 states that the committee intends for the Customs Service to continue to collect the applicable duty rates in effect on July 26. 1983. The Chair. therefore. thinks it is clear the effect of this provision in this appropriation bill is to cause duties and certain imports to be imposed where none are required. and to require executive branch officials to actually collect revenue contrary to existing tariff law and thus finds that the provision is a tariff measure in violation of clause 5(b) of rule XXI.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I make a point of order against section 507 of H.R. 4139 as constituting legislation on an appropriation bill and. therefore. in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule XXI states that: No appropriation shall be reported in any general appropriation bill or be in order as an amendment thereto for any expenditures not previously authorized by law. No provision changing existing law shall be reported in any general appropriation bill except germane provisions which retrench expenditures. Rule XXI. clause 2. has been interpreted to mean that the language in an appropriation bill may not impose on Federal officials additional duties not required by law or make the appropriation contingent upon the performance of such duties. Section 507 prohibits appropriated funds from being used in the procurement of any stainless steel flatware not produced in the United States or its possessions unless the Administrator of General Services makes a determination that a satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of stainless steel flatware produced in the United States cannot be procured as and when needed from domestic sources. Section 507 places a limitation upon the use of appropriated funds and establishes a new procurement requirement not existing under current law. It specifically imposes an additional duty on a Federal official to make a determination not presently required by law. For these reasons. I urge. on a point of order that section 507 violates rule XXI. clause 2. be sustained. This point of order was sustained previously against identical language in H.R. 3191 when it was considered by the House on June 8 of this year.",

It has such a nice. attractive. efficient sound. that we do not see any harm in connection with the use of this phrase. Now. last year we saw pictures of millions of oranges in the State of California which were allowed to disintegrate to spoil. not be allowed to go to the market or even be given to the programs for the poor. to supplement the use of cheese or butter or some of the other enormous quantities of agricultural products that are feeding people of lower incomes. Those products were destroyed under the socalled marketing agreements and most of the Nations fruits. vegetables. and milk. are brought to market today under socalled marketing orders under which the consumer gets no break at all. I asked a friend of mine on the Agriculture Committee how the orderly marketing under marketing orders differs from what Sheik Yamani calls orderly marketing under OPEC.

That was the purpose of the 1937 act. It enabled this to be done. The Office of Management and Budget has decided that it must intervene into the affairs of the private sector and the farming industry. None of these people over there are farmers or have any knowledge of this. but they want to make sure that the Government is going to impose regulations that are unnecessary. because the industry can regulate itself.

The MX is necessary for a number of reasons including the following: First. it is the key to an adequate bargaining position in our quest for arms control. and Second. it is a necessary signal to our allies that we do not expect them to shoulder the burden alone of maintaining the level of deterrence that has successfully prevented an armed conflict in Europe for 38 years.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have voted today for the expenditure of funds appropriated in December 1983 for MX missile procurement and full scale engineering development of a basing mode for the MX missile. The MX has been funded by Congress for 10 years. with over $6.7 billion appropriated for the development of the new missile. The MX has been supported by four successive Presidents: Nixon. Ford. Carter. and Reagan. It is my belief that the step we have taken today is a firm move in shoring up our strategic triad and keeping our deterrence strong. The strategic triad has proved effective in inhibiting the Soviet adventurism and maintaining the peace. The strongest leg of the triad has been the landbased ICBM force. I fear if we fail to modernize the present ICBM force it would significantly effect the survivability of the remaining two parts of the triad. I believe the Soviets will be willing to seriously negotiate on mutual reductions only with our modernization program going forward. History proves that the ABM Treaty was negotiated only after the congressional approval of a limited deployment of an ABM system. I am encouraged that the President has pledged to alter the U.S. negotiating position in the strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva. The President has said he will work closely with Congress in pursuit of a reduction and a builddown of strategic nuclear weapons. It will be my purpose to work with the President in obtaining a verifiable nuclear freeze for both at overall equivalent levels.",

That is that the concern on the part of some of us is if. in fact. the debt limit is extended permanently to the $1.38 trillion that we are talking about. that that will mean that the President is able to selectively impound. To put it very bluntly. this Senator is one. and I suppose others are concerned. who feels that that would mean that the President could selectively pick programs that he does not like very much to begin with and impound the funds. My question is this: Even if we passed a permanent debt limit with the number requested. will the President have to come back to us? Will the President have to come back to us in September or October anyway to increase the permanent debt limit beyond what we will be passing here today? The reason why I ask that question and the reason why I think it is relevant is if he is going to have to come back. as I think he is. to ask for another $200 billion. then in fact the concern the Senator from Delaware originally had is not a very worthy concern because. in fact. he will not be able to selectively impound. But if. in fact. he is only going to have to come back to us for a couple billion dollars. then that puts us in a box. My question is.

The program has succeeded in its goal of giving midcareer professionals a deeper understanding of the legislative process. More than 1.000 scholars. journalists. Federal executives. and professionals from other nations have spent a year as congressional fellows and have carried away a keener appreciation of how Congress actually functions. At the same time. these fellows. who must undergo a highly competitive selection process. have served with distinction in the many offices. both Democratic and Republican. where they have worked. The prestige and diversity of the program is reflected in its Advisory Committee. Among those who are members of that body are journalists David Broder of the Washington Post. Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker. Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal. Wayne Kelley of the Congressional Quarterly. and Peter Clark of the Detroit News. The academic community is represented by Nelson Polsby of the University of California. David Mayhew of Yale University. and Philip Meyer of the University of North Carolina. The politicians are Representatives RICHARD CHENEY of Wyoming and THoMAs FOLEY of Washington. Senators PETE DOmENici of New Mexico and CHRISTOPHER DODD of Connecticut. and Eugene Eidenberg of the Democratic National Committee. Other prominent Americans include Mark Siegel of Siegel and Associates. Charls Walker of Charls Walker Associates. Inc.. David Gergen from the White House. and the distinguished former Congressman from North Carolina. Richardson Preyer. Alumni of the program have gone on to excel in a variety of fields. Some are university presidents. others newspaper and magazine editors. still others have achieved supergrade and assistant secretarylevel positions in the Federal bureaucracy. A fair share have chosen to stay in Capitol Hill as Members of Congress or in staff positions. In just about every case former congressional fellows have described their sojourns in Congress as immensely broadening personal experiences that have offered enduring insights into the realities of Washington politics. In short. I am convinced that the American Political Science Association program. and others like it. perform an important function in the American political process. A number of congressional fellows have served on my staff over the years and have made valuable contributions. I salute the program on its 30th anniversary and hope it continues to prosper.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today joining Senator HATCH in introducing a bill to reform and reauthorize the Legal Services Corporation for the next 3 fiscal years. Hearings held by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources in July produced evidence that substantial amounts of money appropriated for legal services to poor people were not used for that purpose. Rather. this money was illegally diverted for use in various lobbying and socalled training activities designed to influence legislation at the local. State. and National level. Some of the activities advocated were unethical and in some cases illegal in themselves. The instances were not isolated. they were pervasive and deliberate. Many of the grantees that were involved in these activities are still receiving legal services funds. It has been clear to many in this body that the Legal Services Corporation has become a highly politicized organization. Much of this political activity has come at the expense of providing the routine legal services that thousands of poor clients require. The bill Senator HATCH and I are introducing today will go far to depoliticize the Corporation and redirect its activities back toward providing routine legal services to indigent clients. At a July 15 hearing that I chaired. the current leadership of the Corporation pledged to abide by the restrictions placed on their activities by the Congress. This was not always the case in the past. I am confident that this bill provides the necessary tools to clean up the LSC and insure that the taxpayers money is being used for the intended purposelegal services for the poor.9 By Mr. GRASSLEY:",

I want to express my full support for the legislation the Senator from Tennessee introduced today which provides an extension of the provision of Public Law 97455 which allows the receipt of social security disability benefits through the ALT level for individuals appealing benefit terminations. For more than 2 years we have known that there are some serious problems associated with the manner in which the continuing disability investigations are being handled in the States and at the Federal level. There is not a single Member of Congress who has not been deluged with case after appalling case of wrongful terminations. Unfortunately. it has taken pain and suffering on the part of thousands of individuals to create an awareness that something is terribly wrong with the disability program. In the closing days of the last Congress we were finally successful in legislating a temporary. stopgap measure which gave disability beneficiaries a faint glimmer of hope in the form of secured benefits through an appeal at the administrative law judge level. This legislation. though. will expire on October 1 of this year. In one respect I feel that it is most unfortunate that the legislation which is being introduced today is necessary. It is my firm belief that it is the responsibility of the Congress to work toward comprehensive reform of the disability system. I do not believe that we can afford to let another session pass without addressing this most important and pressing problem. But to do so we must have the flexibility to embark on a fullscale investigation into exactly what the problems are and to decide upon the best possible solutions. The present October 1 deadline makes the achievement of that goal extremely difficult. I would very much like to see the Congress and the President turn their attention in the coming weeks to fullfledged disability reform.

He writes of his findings in an article in the July 1983 issue of the Atlantic. The essence of his article is captured in the following quotation: Yet. for the billion who live there. as distinct from the foreign tourist. businessman or journalist. China is first and foremost a repressive regime. The unchanging key to all Pekings policies is that the nation is ruled by a Leninist dictatorship that intends to remain such. Mr. Terrill puts his conclusion into a historical context when comparing the great democratic and economic progress in Taiwan with the continued outlook for a repression of all liberties by the Communist dictatorship on the mainland. He writes: Even more important. Taiwans economic success has been a capitalist economic success. the decline of repression has taken place within the environment of free enterprise. So it was. too. in European history. The institutions of a free societyParliament. press. political parties. constitutionscame with capitalism. By contrast. these institutions have never sprouted and flourished under a Leninist dictatorship. I do not see China as an exception. Mr. Terrills observation is echoed by Paul Johnson. the British writer. who states in Modem Times. a history of the world from the twenties to the eighties. that: Economic and political liberty were inseparably linked. Freedom of the market inevitably led to erosion of political restraints: that was the lesson of Thailand. Taiwan and South Korea. Now. I do not endorse every last word written by Mr. Terrill. in particular. I disagree with his implied assumption that there is virtually no severe conflict of interest between Communist China and the United States. except Taiwan. I believe that Pekings support of the Palestine Liberation Front and opposition to American policy in Central America. to mention just two strategically important matters. present areas of serious divergence of interest between us. Moreover. I am not confident that the Communist regime on the mainland will follow peaceful policies once it acquires a modern industrial and technological base. On balance. however. I am impressed at Mr. Terrills recognition of the inherent and unchanging failings of any government which founds itself on the Leninist system and I commend his article to the attention of my colleagues.

The press almost daily is covering stories of innovative classroom activities involving computers. The motivation and interest generated in the schools is most impressive and the potential for major changes in the way children are taught through the use of computers is truly exciting. But in the midst of all the activity. it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the benefits of computer education are not being evenly distributed among all children. Schools in less affluent areas are much less likely than schools in affluent areas to have computers. A study of computer learning in schools conducted by the University of Minnesota for the National Science Foundation has found what it calls ominous inequities among schools based on such factors as social status. gender and geographic location. This disparity between the rich and poor schools has concerned me. I will be introducing a bill this week which would establish a pilot program of Federal assistance to schools for computer equipment. software. and teacher training. To address the special needs of less affluent students. this bill would target half the funding on areas with povertylevel children. While a program to help reduce the disparities in computer education offered to children from different socioeconomic backgrounds can help poor children. it cannot substitute for a strong commitment to teaching basic skills. But it can help keep poor children from falling further behind. An article in Mondays Washington Post describes some of the recent research on the equity in computers issue.

Furthermore. the article correctly states that Congress problem in dealing with the budget is not that we are not raising enough taxes but that we are spending too much. If Congress tax and spend record were examined historically. it is plainly obvious that Congress historical problem has been that it has spent too much. not that it has not raised enough taxes. It seems obvious to me that despite the fact that we are spending too much. Congress is not likely to make any serious attempt to control the upward spiral in Government spending in this Congress. So. if Congress does not have the fortitude or the will to be fiscally responsible. I suggest that we might let the President take a stab at it by allowing the President to veto budgetbusting items on a lineitem basis. Just because Congress has shirked its responsibilities by default does not mean that we should force the President to do so as well. The general impotence that seems to pervade this town is stifling the creative. entrepreneurial. and productive capabilities of everyone that lives outside of the Washington metropolitan area.

The many articles reporting his death spoke about his numerous achievements in the field of civil rights. As I recall the days of the civil rights votes. I can think of no finer black lobbyist in Washington. He was on the doorsteps of Congress day in and day out and he knew how to keep track of the votes. He was involved in Federal legislation to prohibit discrimination in education. housing. employment. voting. and politics. Certainly. one of his finest efforts involved the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. the last of the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s. Clarence Mitchell is a man I want to remind my children and my grandchildren about for years to come. He was a man of integrity and vision. I am glad I had the privilege of working with Clarence on education issues and I am glad I have the opportunity of working with PARREN MITCHELL. Clarences brother.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to call the attention of my distinguished colleagues to the everworsening plight of Soviet Jewry. Under the administration of Yuri Andropov. officially sanctioned antiSemitism reached a new peak of oppressiveness. The number of Soviet Jews granted emigration visas has continued to plummet. despite the Soviet Governments obligation. as a signer of the 1975 Helsinki accords. to regard all requests for family reunification with leniency and fairness. The U.S. Government regards this matter of restricted freedom of movement with deep concern and has frequently represented it to Soviet authorities as a key element in Soviet/ American relations. The freedom to choose ones country of residence is one of the most basic human rights we possess because it also implies the freedom to practice ones chosen religion and to preserve ones cultural heritage. Hundreds of thousands of Jews may never be allowed to freely enjoy selfdetermination under the present repressive regime in the Soviet Union. As I speak. I think specifically of Grigory Vasserman. a former engineer. who has been repeatedly denied permission to emigrate with his wife and young daughter since 1976. He and his family live in daily fear of imprisonment by the KGB which has seized Mr. Vasserman on several occasions. subjecting him to fines. interrogations. and beatings. He has been threatened with Siberian exile. and deprived of his livelihood. Only earlier this month. Mr. Vasserman was fired from the nonprofessional job he held. with no explanation. These persecutions all contribute to the most painful burden of allthe loss of human dignity through vulnerability to the cruelty of tyrannical authorities bent on forcing Mr. Vasserman and his family to live in poverty and degradation for their activist \"crimes.\" In reality. these crimes only consist of the desire to seek freedom in the land of their forefathers. and to promote Jewish culture and prideful identity through activities such as classes and discussions. Grigory Vasserman serves as an example of the boldness and resiliency of spirit characterizing the Soviet \"Refuseniks.\" Their steadfastly repeated pleas for Justice deserve our deepest admiration and respect.

Seventyfour of my colleagues are joining me as original cosponsors in this important effort. Mr. Speaker. the legislation calls for the United States to maintain its commitment to the ABM Treaty and to refrain from activities or programs which could threaten or undermine the treaty. The full text of the legislation is reprinted below. Mr. Speaker. a little over 1 year ago. the President appealed to scientists to develop strategic defense weapons to render nuclear weapons \"obsolete.\" The speech he gave became known as the \"Star Wars\" speech because it included plans for a spacebased ballistic missile defense. The proposal. embodied in a 5year. $25 billion research program including laser and particlebeam weapons. has actually prompted skepticism among members of the scientific community. Estimates of the total cost of the Presidents strategic defense initiative range from a minimum of $500 billion. to at least $1 trillion. or more. Most disturbing. however. is the certainty that testing and deployment of ballistic missile defense technologies would violate the ABM Treaty. It is incredible that such a proposal should come from the only administration in recent memory without a single arms control agreement to its name. Negotiated and ratified under the Nixon administration. the ABM Treaty provides the framework for control of nuclear weapons. The most recent warning to the President about the importance of the ABM Treaty came from the Presidents own commission on strategic forces. the Scowcroft Commission. The Commission warned that a breach of the ABM Treaty could destroy chances of future arms control. Mr. Speaker. I call on my colleagues to support one of our most important arms control treaties. the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty of 1972. and urge their cosponsorship of my legislation calling for the United States to maintain its commitment to the treaty.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for more than 2.000 years. the Greeks have been leading the world toward democracy and independence. The very concept of democracy on which our Founding Fathers based our Constitution was originally developed by the ancient Greek philosophers. The ancient Greek tradition of political independence was followed by Americans in separating themselves from the British Empire. Americans have always recognized the enormous influence of Greek philosophies and ideals on our own system of government. and America gave enthusiastic support to the modern Greek war of independence from the Turkish Empire. which began on March 25. 1821. This year marks the 163d anniversary of that revolution. which was so much like our own. Like the American colonists. the Greeks were mostly small farmers and fishermen. loosely organized in opposition to one of the major world powers of their day. As young Poles and Frenchmen had come to America to fight for our independence. young Americans went to Greece to help in the struggle for Greek independence. Our history is closely tied not only to the traditions of the ancient Greek citystates. but also to the modern Greek nation which was established at the close of 8 years of bloody warfare. The many Greeks who emigrated to the United States following independence helped to form the ethnic richness and diversity of our country. Greek Americans have made enormous contributions in every area of our national lifein the arts and sciences. business and industry. and political leadership. The strength of America has largely come from the Greeks and other immigrant groups who came to the United States determined to build a new life. The Greek spirit of independence has also been demonstrated in more recent times by the Greeks heroic resistance to Fascist and Nazi invasions during World War II. The Greeks refusal to surrender to the Axis dictatorships ultimately helped to defeat Hit. lers attempt to dominate Europe. In the postwar period. the Greeks continued to fight against outside domination by the Soviet Union. Today. Greece is one of our strongest allies and is of enormous strategic importance to the United States. It is. therefore. most appropriate that we here in Congress should take this opportunity to commemorate March 25 as Greek Independence Day. This holiday not only marks a political",

He was always a PanAfrican nationalist who actively sought the best means for achieving his ideal of African unity. During his controversial and sometimes stormy 26year reign. Mr. Tourts brand of nationalism was expressed successively in terms of anticolonialism. African socialism. and finally in a program of Western private investment. Citing the \"fabulous economic potential\" of private investment. President Toure accepted the fact that African nationalism and free enterprise are not necessarily incompatible. I was very pleased. Mr. Speaker. to learn of his interest in promoting free trade via the Third World Trade Center project in Harlem. His interest in the trade center reflected how his nationalist politics had matured. President Toures politics began with fiery denunciations of France and membership in the French community. which he called \"riches in slavery.\" He next flirted with Marxism. and many of the same abuses of civil liberties that we see in other Marxist nations occurred in Guinea. Finally. he put aside the more radical manifestations of nationalism. and sought to reconcile it with free trade ventures. This. Mr. Speaker. is the path he chose when he died on Monday. I extend my deepest respects to President Tourds family. and hope that the course he set at the end will guide Guinea in the future.*",

This is a war where hostility surrounds our troops but there are no clear front lines. It is time to bring the marines home. It is time to stop the pointless loss of life. It is time to remember the lessons of history before we feel that we must justify unacceptable losses by sending more of our young men to die. It is time to stop the carnage before the honor quotient becomes too high. Vietnam started slowly and somehow we became more and more involved. Sundays tragedy in Beruit serves to warn us of the danger and costs of remaining. We do not honor the marines who have given lives by adding to the casualty lists.

The article alleges terroristlike killings on both sides. resulting from a struggle for political power and freedom from religious suppression. Cases such as this are not uncommon in our world. Oftentimes they are merely a source of continuous tension within a nation that can be adequately handled by the particular government. But at other times the tension escalates causing political unrest on an international scale. Of course there is no way of predicting which internal battles will become international problems. and. therefore. any such turmoil is always a looming threat to peace and world security. In India. as in any other part of the world. violence begets more violence. As Ghandis government tries to suppress the Sikhs aggression. so will the Sikhs continue to riot and rebel. resulting in further suppression by the central government and greater violence by the Sikhs. We have already witnessed and felt the disruptive effects of another religiouspolitical conflict in the last decade during Khomeinis overthrow of the Shah of Iran. What was once an internal conflict mushroomed into an international crisis. resulting in the kidnapping of innocent Americans. the loss of Iranian oil exports. and a deadly disregard for human rights in that country. Mr. President. the Genocide Convention cannot prevent such internal battles. nor can it resolve them. but it does address the issue of the preservation of human rights as it affects particular cultural. religious. and ethnic groups. It states that not merely the act of destroying or attempting to destroy a specific group. but even the intent to do so is genocide. And once a conflict has been defined as genocide it can be acted upon through legal and justifiable means in accordance with the terms of the treaty. But in order to make the treaty a viable and effective instrument of peace. it needs the influential backing of United States ratification and support. Mr. President. I find struggles such as Indias distressing because they threaten not only human rights. but potentially. world peace. Yet. I find even more distressing our Governments lack of initiative in preventing an even greater threat to human rights and world peacegenocide.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join as a consponsor to Senator DURENBERGERS bill. S. 1167. This legislation would increase the allowable charitable deduction for volunteers who use their automobiles to perform charitable services. The need to increase this charitable deduction becomes obvious when we look at the current tax law. Presently. a volunteer is allowed to deduct 9 cents per mile for expenses incurred while performing charitable work. As we all know. the cost of operating a standard American automobile is much higher than 9 cents a mile. In fact. the American Automobile Association estimates the cost to be 23.8 cents per mile. As you can see. the 9 cents per mile deduction does not even begin to cover the costs of operating a vehicle. However. the bill that I am cosponsoring would change this situation. This bill would permit volunteers to deduct the same amount for the use of their car as those on Government business. Government workers presently receive 20 cents per mile. While this increase in the deduction may not represent the total cost of operating an automobile. it does go a long way in bringing about fairness. It is only fair that volunteers receive the same amount of deduction for the use of their cars as Government employees. especially when both of them are performing a public service. The services that volunteers provide are valuable. Volunteers drive many miles to visit nursing homes. take the elderly and the handicapped to the doctor. hospital. or the store. bring food to the shutin. and perform hundreds of other tasks. Without these dedicated men and women. many of our elderly and handicapped would not have companionship and assistance. The present charitable deduction does not acknowledge the value of a volunteers contribution. In fact. the 9 cents per mile provides volunteers with a disincentive rather than an incentive. This. however. runs counter to our goals of encouraging individuals to give up more of their time for volunteer work. We need to let volunteers know that we appreciate their work. Increasing the charitable deduction for mileage would be one way to recognize their services. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It would certainly send a signal to those who volunteer that their work is important.",

I would like to express my deep sorrow to the loved ones and friends of Americas sons and those of France. Civilized nations view this act with horror and disgust. The intent of the perpetrators is clear: Intimidate the nations involved in the peacekeepng force through such murderous attacks. and public opinion at home will force them to withdraw. The United States. however. must not be so intimidated. The goal of peace and stability in Lebanon is a just goal and we must pursue it with renewed vigor. What sort of world would we have if the United States bowed to the whims of armed lunatics and terrorists? America has lost forever some of the most noble and courageous young men that our Nation can produce. They were all volunteers. men who believed that what this Nation has to offer is worth protecting. even if it means forfeiting their lives so that others may live in peace and freedom. Mr. President. it is left to us as leaders of this Nation to insure that their sacrifice is not in vain. If the United States withdraws. then we have accomplished nothing. and their sacrifice and devotion to this country and what it stands for. will have been futile. Mr. President. I would also like to note that our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire. Senator GORDON HUMPHREY. was in Beirut when these attacks took place. Senator HUMPHREY aided in the treatment and evacuation of the injured. He even flew to Germany with the most seriously injured giving first aid enroute. Senator HUMPHREY is to be highly commended for his actions in helping our wounded. We must redouble our efforts to bring peace to this troubled area. There have been few times in history when the preservation of peace was without cost. We have paid once again in lives and blood. Now let us persevere to obtain the peace so many have paid for so dearly.",

More than 20 million Americans. or 11 percent of the adult population. have used cocaine. Admissions to drug treatment centers for cocaine abuse have risen 500 percent in the past several years. Deaths from cocaine use have risen 200 percent. Unlike heroin. amphetamines. and barbituates. cocaine has no reputation for being either physically or psychologically addictive. Many cocaine abusers are convinced that they suffer no adverse health effects from the drug. Mr. President. if we learn anything from Freud. we have learned that cocaine is both physically and psychologically addictive. And. if we learn anything from following professional football and baseball. we have learned that cocaine abuse seriously affects health and hinders performance. The fact of the matter is that habitual cocaine abusers suffer many physical symptons. such as exhaustion. sleep problems. nosebleeds. headaches. and trembling. A significant number also experience psychological problems. such as paranoia and panic attacks. A great number use cocaine in conjunction with other drugs. especially heroin. to moderate cocaines stimulative effects. Many abusers are surprised at how quickly their recreational cocaine use brings them to financial ruin and physical and emotional exhaustion. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator BENTSEN in introducing the Life Insurance Tax Act of 1983. This bill is identical to the proposal which was recently considered and approved by the House Committee on Ways and Means. I am introducing this measure today to bring this important piece of legislation to the attention of my colleagues. so that a hearing can be held and the taxation of the life insurance decided by the end of this year. The life insurance industry has been operating under a socalled stop gap system of taxation during this past year while a substantial revision of the taxation of the industry was being considered and debated. This stopgap measure expires on December 31. 1983. and thus action on the proposed revisions is necessary to prevent the disruption that further uncertainty as to the taxation of the industry could cause. The bill contains a complete revision of the very complex laws governing the taxation of life insurance companies and represents the first such substantial revision since 1959. The main goals of this proposal are: First. to provide for a more accurate. and hopefully less complex. measure of the true economic income of a life insurance company. second. to strike a proper balance between the tax burdens on the two major segments of the industry and assure an appropriate level of taxation for the industry as a whole. third. to establish appropriate tax treatment for some of the new consumeroriented products being offered by insurance companies. In introducing this legislation today I want to make it clear that I am not endorsing every single provision in this very complicated proposal. Rather. I am giving my support to the basic system of taxation established by the legislation and the major principles that are at the heart of this compromise proposal. I expect that this bill will be subject to careful examination during the hearing process. and it may be that changes are necessary to accomplish the goals I have outlined above. especially with regard to the appropriate level of tax that should be paid by the life insurance industry as a whole. I urge my colleagues to consider this matter seriously before the close of the year.*",

The members of the House Committee on Ways and Means are to be commended for their hard work in crafting this compromise proposal. As those of us on the Committee on Finance have learned. life insurance is an extremely technical area of tax law. Congressmen STARK and MOORE have created legislation which is acceptable to the industry. which is a task even the industry itself could not accomplish. During consideration of stopgap in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. I supported the life insurance compromise proposal on the condition that it raised the revenue it was projected to raise. Unfortunately. stopgap fell short of that goal. I am aware that Senator DOLE. our chairman. is dissatisfied with the revenue level in the StarkMoore proposal. In my view. the committee should focus on what is an appropriate revenue level. I do not want my cosponsorship of this proposal to be construed as a blanket sanction of the revenue it is estimated to generate. Furthermore. the committee may need to make additional technical changes in the bill to address problems which have emerged since the House took action on the bill. Nevertheless. this legislation represents an important compromise in a very difficult issue area. It deserves our serious consideration and support. In my view. it is an excellent platform from which to begin discussion on an appropriate tax system for the life insurance industry.9 By Mr. HELMS:",

I call on my colleagues to support this mission not just on behalf of the thousands of Americans who have asked their Representatives to support the amendment. but also on behalf of the future generations of Americans. I would like to remind our colleagues of some of the effects which our deficit spending will have on the Nation. First. there is the issue of interest rates. Our Federal Government is cornering the market. 75 percent of all available credit is taken up by Uncle Sam. This leaves all private borrowers scrambling to compete for the remaining 25 percent. This policy has bid up interest rates over recent years. and. as most small businessmen and farmers can attest. when Uncle Sam elbows you out of the credit market there is not much you can do to fight back. The second major effect of the big spending policy is soaring costs of servicing the debt. This cost has climbed from near $6 billion in 1960 to an estimated $91 billion over the next year. and by the close of the decade. this decade. interest payments are expected to account for 16 percent. over 16 percent of the total Federal budget. Mr. Speaker. the Congress. this 98th Congress has a choice. it can leave future generations of Americans a wellordered financial condition. one primed for the engines of growth. to generate improved standards of living.

This weeks issue of Business Week carries a cover story about what one Treasury Department economist terms \"the only free lunch in economics.\" an increase in productivity.

After over a decade of low or no growth in productivity we are. for the first time in years. facing the prospect of substantial and sustained economic growth. During the first three quarters of 1983 the hourly output of the average worker increased by a remarkable 13.6 percent. While no one projects continued growth rates of this magnitude. some experts predict that annual growth rates in output per work hour in the nonfarm sector could run as high as 3 percent a year for the rest of this decade. Many of the factors responsible for the decline in productivity experienced during the 1970s have begun to reverse themselves. Shortly. I will be reserving time for a special order to discuss these reversals and the potential social and economic benefits. I invite my colleagues to join me in a dialog on this vital issue.",

I wish to correct errors in the Post editorial. errors which were repeated by Members on the other side of the aisle. First. was the confusion of the Senatepassed bill with the Criminal Code revision. on which both Houses of Congress have labored for more than a decade. They are two entirely different matters. covering. for the most part. different matters. and no one reasonably well informed on Federal crime legislation should be suggesting that the recent bill represents Federal Criminal Code revision. Second. the prediction that the omnibus bill approach to anticrime legislation would not be successful in the House should not have been. but was. interpreted as opposition to the individual measures contained in the Senate package. The bill passed by the Senate falls under the jurisdiction of perhaps as many as half a dozen House committees. no one knows yet just how many subcommittees. Unless all act favorably on the measure. which is highly unlikly. such a bill is unlikely to come to a vote in the House. This fact. as all Members of this body know. is not partisanship. or obstructionism. but merely reality. The Senate leadership knows this.

The MX is a poor weapon system under any of these justifications. We have modernized and are continuing to modernize our bomber force.

It is up to Members of the House tonight to determine whether we here in this House. in the Democratic majority. are really serious about getting an arms control agreement moving. What has happened over the course of the last few weeks since the vote we took in May. may not have fully satisfied my good friends TOM DOWNEY or DAN GLICKMAN. but I think most other reasonable Members of the House realize that actual progress has been made. Remember the old proverb that the best is the enemy of the good. We are on the threshold tonight of progress toward what the overwhelming majority of the Congress wants: Arms control and a better chance for peace. Let us act tonight not as Democrats or Republicans. but let us act together as Americans capable of bipartisan support when the chips are down. in support of our national security. Make no mistake about it. if the BennettMavroules amendment succeeds here tonight it will be a long time before we get a better opportunity to achieve any real agreement with the Soviets. And make no mistake about which party is going to be blamed for that result.",

    "speech": "First of all. Mr. Chairman. importantly. I think several of the proponents of the amendment have suggested that somehow the United States has kept pace with the Soviets in their ICBM development. and that is not true. The Soviets. during the decade of the 1970s. have produced and emplaced over 750 SS17s. SS18s. and SS19 ICBMs and the United States has built and emplaced zero ICBM missiles. It is true that we have revamped. done some work on the guidance systems and some other parts of the Minuteman missile. but we have not emplaced any new missiles. Second. several Members who are proponents of the amendment have suggested that the MX does not have any military value. That is not true. It is a fact that any landbased system complements our bomber system. It is a fact that both systems cannot be taken out simultaneously. A strike against our bombers by Soviet submarines will allow the MX to launch. That fact is not controverted by the other side. It is a fact that the added capability of the MX backs up the bomber leg and deters the attack against our bomber bases. I think if we had called the MX the Minuteman IV. it would have been accepted as a very logical followon to the Minuteman missile. It is more accurate. it is more powerful. it has greater reliability. it has 10 MIRVs instead of the 3 we have now. I would like to move to one last area. Mr. Sakharov has been quoted extensively today. but I think. in fact. that one statement he makes in his letter really wraps up the problem we face. I would like to repeat the quote that was made by the gentleman from Ohio because I think when we talk about who understands the Soviet Union we all have to agree that Mr. Sakharov understands the Soviets and. more importantly. he understands the Soviets who make the decisions. He states: So long as the Soviets enjoy a lead in landbased missiles. there is very little chance of them easily relinquishing that lead. If it is necessary to spend a few billion dollars on MX missiles to alter this situation. then perhaps this is what the West must do.",

Let us stop here a movement and cut through the fog of technical argumentation offered in this debate and get down to some commonsense talk about the MX and nuclear weapons control.

That policy has been repeatedly and convincingly reaffirmed by this administration. Further. it has been demonstrated in this debate and previously. in the nuclear freeze debate. that the MX. in its proposed deployment. cannot be defended against Soviet attack.

That quote comes from General Scowcroft. No one countered that at all. We have heard that we need the 100 MX missiles. at a cost of between $16 and $20 billion. as a bargaining chip. Yet. it has been pointed out by Mr. Perle. the Under Secretary. Mr. Weinberger. and others have said that they are not going to use the MX missile as a bargaining chip. That has been stated clearly over and over. We have heard most of the Members that are in the middle and are going to be the deciders of this question. this amendment. which is the most important question regarding this tremendous defense budget authorization. We have heard so many Members say they were going to vote against the amendment because they hope they will have an arms agreement out of it. Let me quote to you what General Scowcroft said on May 11. in reply to a question from Representative MCCLOSKEY of Indiana. that Reagan \"is staffing the White House with people who have visceral reactions against arms control. and to just say somehow that he subjectively has his heart in it is a real problem for a lot of people.\" General Scowcroft. the head of the Commission. who I respect as a very frank and honest man. said: \"I think you point out a real problem. I regard that as the exact problem.\" General Scowcroft. talking about whether the negotiators are serious and have their hearts in negotiations.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the plans to place such a powerful. threatening missile as the MX in vulnerable silos raises the question of how the missile would be used. Each MX would carry as many as 12 warheads which could be aimed with high accuracy at targets on the other side of the world and which would have the capability of destroying hardened installations. whether enemy missile silos. communication centers. or other military targets. This is a warfighting weapon. But it would be a very attractive target based in vulnerable silos. How do our defense planners expect to preserve these missiles if they are subjected to attack? How could they be used to strike at enemy missile silos. enemy communication centers. or other military targets? The logic of the defense planners could lead to only two possibilities: either we use the MX to strike at the enemy first. which we say we never will do. or we put the MX on a launchonwarning status. Indeed. there are a number of indications that the Pentagon is planning to launch the MX missiles as soon as they have evidence that the missiles are under attack. General Vessey testified recently that the MX would be vulnerable only \"if we ride out the attack.\" He went on to say that the Soviets have no assurance that we will ride out an attack. Mr. Chairman. we have all read and heard accounts of mistakes and false alarms in our early warning systems. Surely we do not want to approve a weapon system that can be launched by a faulty computer chip to rain doom on the Earth. Let us stop and think what we are doing. For our consideration I submit an article prepared by the Center for Defense Information entitled \"The Dangers of Adopting a Launch on Warning Policy To Protect the MX\":",

The debate thus far has centered on the technical problems of a rational basing mode. on the window of vulnerability. and on this administrations allergic reaction to any meaningful arms control. This issue. however. cuts far deeper than technical problems. The problems and the MX missile must be viewed in context with the rest of the needs of our Nation. To put the issue in an honest perspective we must measure the actual costs of this system. The costs are in social programs which have borne 60 July . 198.? Co percent of the budgetary cuts since this administration took office. The true cost of the MX is what it denies this Nations citizens. It is in roads unrepaired. bridges unbuilt. domestic programs which are being gutted. Even the most charitable analysis indicates that the benefits of this $22 billion system are speculative. What is not speculative is the fact that this Nation desperately needs immediate reinvestment in housing. education. and Jobs. In the \"Alice in Wonderland\" world of defense appropriations. the MX may make some sense. But in the real world of soaring deficits and underfunded domestic programs. it does not make any sense whatsoever. In our rush to out spend the Soviet Union. we cannot lose sight of our needs at home. I would ask every Member to reconsider this issue in light of the substantial costs and very uncertain benefits of the MX.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I have consistently voted against the MX. I believe it is a bad idea. a poor allocation of resources. and an inadequate. stopgap measure for maintaining our countrys defenses. We have given the President the opportunity to prove to us the benefits of the MX. Last December we were skeptical of the survivability of basing the MX in the dense pack mode and voted to freeze procurement funds. giving the administration a second chance to find a more acceptable basing mode. Now. there proposal calls for placing 100 MX missiles in exsisting vulnerable Minuteman III missile silos. Clearly. the Reagan administrations solution has not addressed the problem it was supposed to have solved. protecting American ICBMs from a Soviet firststrike. More importantly. it is doubtful that a vote for the MX will be a vote for arms control. Survivability of U.S. missiles would be best sought by investing in our increasingly accurate. invulnerable submarine forces. We must consider which components of defense planning will help us continue to maintain and develop a strong. stable system of defense. We should not simply go for image. and that is primarily what the MX has become. a temporary. image creating effort. It is. instead. our responsibility to pursue real and aggressive arms control efforts. Our attempts to buy security with new types of weapon systems will only spur a new round in the arms race. and divert funds from more socially necessary and productive investments. further delaying the revitalization of U.S. industry. This also makes it impossible to control the Federal deficit. threatening our Nations path to economic recovery. As a supporter of the nuclear freeze. I feel the MX will move us away from arms control and arms reduction. I. therefore. urge colleagues to vote for a deletion of MX procurement funds.e",

Airbags have proven lifesaving potential. each year. airbags could save 9.000 lives on our Nations highways. During a hearing on September 19. the Surface Transportation Subcommittee heard testimony from the Breed Corp.. a company which is ready to move ahead with largescale demon. stratlon of its innovative new technology for a selfcontained. allmechanical alrbag system for motor vehicles. The Breed compact airbag Is currently being tested under a limited demonstration contract with NHTSA. This system has the potential to make airbag technology available on a wide. spread basis at a low cost to consumers.",

    "speech": "I share the. views of my colleague from Missouri as to the promise of the Breed system. I visited the Breed Corp. facilities in Lincoln Park. NJ. this past summer. I was very impressed with the work being done there and the advances Breed has made in airbag technology. The Breed compact airbag is a radical departure from conventional airbag technology in terms of both its simplicity and very low price. Tradi. tional electrical airbag systems typical. ly contain frontal electrical sensors. electrical wiring. connectors. electric squibs. an electronic diagnostic module. a malfunction indicator light. and electronic capacitors for auxiliary power. DOT estimates that electronic systems produced in quantities of 1 million will cost $220 for a driverside only airbag. By contrast. the Breed compact alrbag is a totally selfcontained. allmechanical design. with the crash sen. sors located entirely within the steering wheel and dash board in front of the passengers. Breeds technology thus eliminates all crush zone and underthedashmounted sensors. all wiring. the electric squibs. the auxilia. ry capacitor power supply. the mal. function light and the diagnostic module. As a result. Breed has testi. fied that installation of its allmechan. ical arbag is vastly simplified. with October . 1984 typically only four screws required to install either the driver or passenger module. Such simplified Installation can be expected to promote and expand airbag availability through retrofit capability. More important. Breed estimates a retail cost of about $50 for a driverside Breed compact airbag. based upon production at a rate of 1 million units per year. Given the fact that \"unacceptable high cost\" is the reason most often cited for the limited public acceptance of airbags to date. Breeds allmechanical compact airbag appears to offer enormous cost advantages. which would spur long overdue public interest in airbags. A second important reason for expanding and accelerating demonstration of this promising new arbag technology relates to Secretary Doles decision of July 11 with respect to the phasing in of airbags or automatic seat belts on all new passenger automobiles. Given the relatively tight time deadlines Imposed by the Secretary. accelerated demonstration of the inexpensive. allmechanical alrbag system would provide a timely opportunity to allow this new technology to prove itself a viable alternative for consumera and automakers.",

This amendment is necessary because of unique circumstances which have delayed work on U.S. 10 over a period of years.

While construction of the permanent U.S. 10 has been delayed because of environmental .and engineering problems. changes in circumstances along temporary U.S. 10 have made the present condition of the highway dangerous to the public. The reality of events has overtaken previous plans to turn temporary U.S. 10 over to the 1ocality. As a result. a special appropriation is needed to make these longoverdue safety improvements. During the first 5 months of 1984. there were 132 property accidents. 59 injuries. and 5 fatalities on U.S. 10. Residents of Waterford Township and Pontiac. MI. have long urged their State. local and Federal officials to widen the highway. Recently. 2.000 local residents signed a pellition imploring public officials to take swift action which could avoid further accidents on U.S. 10.

Currently. the Minnesota Department of Transportation is embroiled in a bureaucratic dispute with the Federal Highway Administration over the type of replacement bridge. Normally. I would side with the Federal Highway Administration. but the circumstances surrounding the High Bridge are far from normal. To begin with. the bridge was closed 3 years ahead of schedule in July. after an inspection revealed significant structural problems. The bridge. which is over 95 years old. is past the point where repair or reconstruction would render it safe again.

I have great respect and admiration for LARRY and the job he has done in Congress. His reputation as a capable and popular Member of Congress is the result of dedication to his constituents. and the ability to get results without loud speeches or a deluge of press releases to make his point. LARRY WINN has not been a phony grandstander. He has spoken through his actions. He is the first to tell you that his approach to the job of Congressman is low key. His manner may be reserved. but LARRY is effective in making his views known. One doesnt have to be a longtime friend of LARRYS to recognize he possesses a refreshing candor. He talks straight and pulls no punches. He leaves little doubt about his stand on the issues. One of LARRYS greatest strengthsa quality that every other Member of Congress should remember and seek to emulateis a record of constituent service that is second to none. His assistance to the residents of the Third District of Kansas is prompt. effective. compassionate. and attentive. In 18 years. LARRY never lost sight of the fact that Members of Congress are sent to Washington to help their constituents in any way possible. LARRY deserves special recognition for putting together a dedicated and hardworking staff led by Dick Bond. Together. their work has been an example of how a congressional office should serve constituents. . His direct knowledge of foreign policy. and his deep understanding of complex matters of state. will be difficult to replace on the Foreign Affairs Committee. The great strides in Americas space program. including the spectacular deep space missions and the space shuttle. are a legacy to LARRY WINNs foresight on the Science and Technology Committee. In closing Mr. Speaker. I want to say that Congress shall miss LARRY WINN. He has been a steady and straightforward participant. His candor. his attention to those he represents. and his reasoned approach to his work will serve as an inspiration to all of us. I wish LARRY. Joan. and their family the very best in the future.

LARRY WINN has had a significant impact on legislation in many fields of importance to our country through his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee. and the Science and Technology Committee. on which he is ranking minority member.

As LARRY WINN represents the agricultural and suburban communities of northeastern Kansas. he has been equally supportive of advancements in the space program. As ranking minority member of the House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Space Science. LARRY WINN has been directly involved in the formation of space policy for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. And sometimes. he combines the two otherwise divergent interests. He was a cosponsor of the wind energy research bill which establishes a program. in conjunction with NASA. to search for alternate energy sources. One such suggestion is the harnessing of the wind that forever blows across the wheat fields of Kansas. LARRY WINN is also an ardent supporter of national security interests. He is particularly concerned with the role that intelligence plays in our foreign policy decisions and has expressed that interest on several occaslons in his capacity as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

We are working in the Committee on Foreign Affairs to change that policy. The amount of money is not the only issue at stake in the question of El Salvador. it is the policy. Voting military aid to El Salvador at this time will completely preempt our attempts in the Committee on Foreign Affairs to support a settlement. not a widening. of the civil war in El Salvador.

Relations between the two countries are at a critical juncture. The crisis in Central America. the fall of the oil markets. the peso devaluation. increased immigration. and an evergrowing number of protectionist laws have. in a short time. changed the nature of the economic and political relationship between us. Talks are needed to update the Congress and the administration on current problems in United StatesMexico relations so that it will be possible to legislate in a manner sensitive to the concerns of both countries.

The need is immediate. given the size of Mexicos debt. our own trade deficit. and the strength of our currency. Mexican products covered under the Generalized System of Preferences will graduate next year and will no longer receive the benefit of reduced tariffs. At the same time. because of our strong currency. our trade deficit has increased significantly and we need help strengthening our own export potential. Because of the seriousness of the economic problems affecting both countries. it is important that we address them on a bilateral basis as soon as possible.

The State Department claims that they are opposing the bill because they fear an outbreak of terrorism if this legislation passes. I find this a hard line to swallow from the same people that have no qualms about mining Nicaraguan ports. This has nothing to do with terrorism.

The areas include Milford Point in my own Third Congressional District. Milford Point is a 10acre barrier beach which separates Nells Island marshes from Long Island Sound. This area is especially significant as a breeding habitat for several threatened species of aquatic birds. The point serves as one of the few remaining nesting sites in Connecticut for the Piping Plover. a candidate for the Federal threatened species list. The Piping Plover has been on a longterm decline throughout its range due primarily to destruction of habitat resulting from coastal development. Milford Point also supports the largest population of the Least Tern. 215 nesting pairs in 1982. This bird is listed as endangered in New Jersey and California. and is considered to be on a longterm decline throughout its North American range. In addition. research shows that Milford Point is one of the five primary feeding areas for the Chimon Island herons. The area protects the Nells Island marsh system. which is a popular area for duck hunting and fishing. and an excellent duck breeding habitat. The Wheeler Wildlife Refuge is located within Nells marsh system. This land is endangered by development. and may not be preserved if the Federal Government does not acquire the tract. Milford is a very environmentally conscious community. I know that there is a longstanding concern among Milford residents that Milford Point may be spoiled by development. This bill will stabilize the area once and for all. and maintain its beautiful. wild state. I hope this legislation will receive prompt and favorable action from this House so that this environmentally important land will be preserved.",

And President Reagan has marched us deeper and deeper into a quagmire. He sent U.S. advisers to El Salvador. He started a notsosecret war against Nicaragua. He sent thousands of U.S. troops to Honduras. and is turning it into a virtual U.S. military base. Now he has crossed the line. He has sent the CIA to mine Nicaraguan ports. Mining ports is an act of war. Ronald Reagan seems to think he can recruit a personal army. and use it to fight a personal war without consent of Congress. This episode is alarming. It is only the latest step in a policy that relies almost entirely on violence rather than reason. Now. finally. Congress is starting to stand up for its convictions. But a nonbinding resolution is not enough. We in Congress should have stopped the covert war against Nicaragua long ago. And we should stop the Reagan administrations military approach in Central America before we go off the brink.",

The details of each case are different. but the incidence of fear and pain and grief for the children and their families is always tragic. The horror of the unknown can only be fully appreciated by those who directly experience it. Parents are overwhelmed by the disappearance of their child as the wait begins. Sometimes parents wait years. only to learn what they had feared most. It is not a problem that is confined to any particular city or region or State. it is of national proportions and can affect anyone at any moment. Although the personal costs are enormous and the problem of missing children is widespread. we have not yet established a system to address this national tragedy. Yes. there are wellorganized groups of people who care enough to make a difference. but too often one must directly experience the pain of a missing child before becoming involved. Parents whose children are missing reach out to us for help. but the resources are inadequate and the prospects for the successful return of their child dim each day. Government must do for the people what they cannot do for themselves. The parents of missing children need our help desperately and we must work to see that our resources on the national. State. and local levels are enhanced. I invite my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 4740. the establishment of the Commission on Missing Children. as we begin to address this national problem.",

The itinerary is very intense and I highly recommend it to any Member of Congress as a very valuable educational experience. Incidentally. the flight is on a regular scheduled transport in case the people back home or your November opponent asks. It is no Junket. I can assure you. The last time I visited Germany was in 1979 and I am pleased to say that both our readiness and our morale appears to be better. The M1 tank is proving to be an effective weapon. we have better qualified and trained personnel manning our defenses. and relations between the German people and our troops are improved. The general state of readiness. I believe. is high and presents an effective deterrent to Soviet goals ii Western Europe. There are a couple of areas. however. that we need to address. There is strong consensus among our commanding officers in Germany that we need to improve our defenses against binary weapons. The bulky clothing our forces would have to wear if the Soviets used binary weapons cuts a soldiers fighting effectiveness by 50 percent. Clearly. that is unacceptable. We also need to reexamine our air defense network. which. I believe. is in need of improvement. It is my hope the Congress. in debating the bigticket items such as the BI bomber and MX missile. will not lose sight of the big picture. which must include a credible conventional defense in Western Europe.",

I am reluctant because I oppose legislative attempts. however sugarcoated. to establish import quotas. Over the past two decades we have developed. in cooperation with our trading partners. an elaborate and comprehensive administrative system of providing import relief to U.S. Industries. While this system is not perfect and needs reform. it must continue to serve as the basis of import restrictions. If Congress begins enacting quotas by legislative fiat. whether its for steel. autos. textiles. or footware. the legal and administrative system we have nourished will collapse. Every industry seeking protection will circumvent our trade remedy laws by coming directly to Congress. where political considerations will more often than not outweigh the best interests of the U.S. economy. The sections of this bill that direct the President to limit steel imports to 17 percent of the U.S. market and threaten legislated quotas if he does not. are objectionable and I oppose them. Fortunately. however. these provisions have no immediate or mandatory effect. Moreover. the President has already established his intention to reduce steel imports to approximately 18.5 percent of the U.S. market. so these sections do not materially alter the existing policy of this Government. As I stated at the outset. I do support this bill. even with the reservations just noted. I support Chairman RosTmNKowsKis bill because it rectifies what I believe to be significant defects in the Presidents steel import program. The President has promised substantial protection for the U.S. steel industry. but has asked for nothing in return. This bill would make import protection conditional on annual determinations by the President that the steel Industry is investing all of its profits in the modernization of Its steelmaking capabilities. Furthermore. H.R. 6023 ensures the continuation of Trade Adjustment Assistance and expands worker assistance and retraining programs for displaced steelworkers. The Presidents proposal offers no such assistance. I urge my colleagues to vote for the committee bill.*",

I supported the reciprocal trade approach set out in the first version of this bill. I understand the concern of those export interests that do not wish to give a legal excuse to our trading partners to retaliate against U.S. exports. This version. as reported out of the Ways and Means Committee. responds to those concerns and is now GATT compatible. It is intended to identify those barriers that are unfair and burden U.S. commerce. report them to the Congress. and direct the President to seek the elimination of the unfair barriers through existing legal means. Mr. Chairman. I am troubled by some of the arguments that I continue to hear leveled against this bill. During consideration of this bill In the Senate. Sir Roy Denman of the Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities. sent a letter on September 14. opposing the legislation to a number of Senators stating: Consultation with Congress is in reality bound to produce considerable support for U.S. action of a retaliatory kind under Section 201 if foreign barriers were not reduced or removed. Imagine that. If we find that the EC is unfairly treating our exports we will want to take action to seek redress. In Denmans view this is unacceptable. Such arrogance. It is OK for them to maintain unfair barriers and if we seek to take action. they threaten to retaliate against our products. Where Is the fairness in that? The Wine Equity Act is long overdue. We need to play under the same rules in international trade. This legislation will give Congress additional information about the rules in wine trade. It will assist the President and the Congress in future trade consultations and negotiations. We are operating at a disadvantage that needs to be changed. I urge the support of the Members in passage of H.R. 3795.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman. I want to take this opportunity to speak in support of the Wine Equity Act. The Wine Equity Act is an important step in making wine competition more equitable between wine trading countries. Unfair barriers to the American wine trade will be clearly Identified. and the President will be required to discuss these problems with the designated country. Until this bill was introduced. problems with wine trade was always at the bottom of any executive branch trade talks. For years domestic winemakers have suffered financially due to unfair trade barriers imposed on American wine exports. and a domestic wine market that is more profitable for subsidized foreignmade wines. European wine overproduction. particularly in France and Italy. has resulted in a steady influx of foreign wines into the American market. Over the past 10 years. this influx has resulted in a 156percent increase in the volume of wine shipped into the United States. American winemakers have unduly suffered because of unfair trade policies that restrict competition abroad. and a generous American trade policy that has allowed European wines to control 25 percent of the domestic market. Unlike other industries seeking import relief. the American winemakers are only seeking to expand export opportunities. They seek to do this by harmonizing trade relations between the wine trading countries. No import quotas or violation of international trade obligations are sought. In fact. the provisions of this bill are compatible with the general agreement on tariffs and trade [GATT]. The Wine Equity Act is the result of extensive consultations with the U.S. wine~vul grape industry to deal with the serious inequities in international wine trade. It represents the best legislation that could be produced within the guidelines of GATT. Historically. there has been a substantial imbalance in U.S. wine trade. The deficit in 1983 was $822 million. We owe it to American wine producers to create a climate that is conducive to fair and competitive trade. I urge my colleagues to Join me in voting for this bill.",

The American wine industry has for years been seeking a reduction in those tariff and nontariff barriers maintained by foreign countries with significant potential markets for U.S. wine. Because of the U.S. Government policy in the form of prohibition that eliminated the U.S. wine industry while foreign competitors were developing improved products and production capability. and because of the indifference by our own Government toward the development of export markets for U.S. wine following prohibition. there has been a historical imbalance in international wine trade that in recent years has grown to a deficit of almost three quarters of a billion dollars per year. Today and through the end of this session we are considering trade legislation that will deal with some of the many trade problems of a myriad of sectors in our economy. We are to consider steel. shoes. copper and many others who are looking for import relief. This industry is not looking for such relief but instead. wants to export. Rather than have the interests of the wine and grape industry again be relegated to the \"back of the line\" in the consideration of our trade problems. this Congress should direct through the passage of the Wine Equity Act. that the President use every legal means available to him to seek the expansion of export markets for American wines.

The Federal funds rate was kept at about 15 percent on average for 3 years. What happened is that it killed the housing industry. the auto industry. the steel industry. it caused the collapse in farm prices. it caused the collapse in our agricultural trade policy. and unemployment went from about 6 to 11 percent. According to the CBO. five points of unemployment is at least $150 billion of deficit. The gentleman from Illinois is right: Get unemployment down. and you will get the deficit down. Yes. we need to cut spending. yes we should be concerned about those out of work. yes we should be concerned about training. and I will join any person on this floor. left. right. or center. in coming up with the right kind of job training.

What are we going to say to the American people that we have accomplished because of what we do in our budget work? Are we going to put more Americans back to work? Are we going to reduce interest rates? Are we going to reduce inflation? Are we going to raise to a higher level our economic growth? Are we going to sustain that for a longer period of time? Do you know what happened? There was almost total silence. When I asked Paul Volcker the question about what level of economic growth could he support for a long period of time. his response basically was somewhere around the numbers that either OMB or the CBO suggested. which are 3.3 percent to 4 percent. So I asked him the question: What do we have to do in order to raise the level of real economic growth? What do we have to do in order to go to 4 or 5 or 5 percent that would satisfy you so that you would not come in and drop the money supply? He responded and said two things: One thing you have to impact is productivity. The other thing that he talked about doing was that we have to increase the capacity of the country to produce goods and services. Do my colleagues realize how much time we have spent in the year and a half I have been here talking about how we improve productivity? Exactly zero. No time at all. And yet when we had 4 hours set aside so we could talk about it today. what did we end up with? We ended up with an hour and a half. of which we get 45 minutes to talk about the two most significant 7788 co things that impact the future of this t country. t I want to thank the gentleman for leading this discussion. and I want to J add one more thing and then I will allow someone else to talk.",

The difference in the discussion that is taking place here is that we are focusing on growth and prosperity and what that does for the U.S. budget. In other words. we are driven by the fact that we believe that the economy drives the budget. rather than the budget driving the economy. We realize that for every 1 percent reduction in the unemployment rate. we get a $30 billion reduction in the deficit numbers. The problem with every other discussion that will take place on the floor here is that the Members are trapped by their own economic assumptions that are faulty. have proven faulty. They are relying on data and opinions given them by people who have missed the target repeatedly in the last 3 years. Therefore. they are trapped and frozen into a way of thinking that precludes any discussion of growth and prosperity and the American enterprise system. economic freedom. So the other discussions that are going to take place here are going to sound like a class in bookkeeping. It is going to be an exercise in bookkeeping.

They predicted a very small recovery. and expected a deficit for 1984. and now their revenues have risen so high from sales taxes and income taxes that New York States fiscal condition is far better than it has ever been. It is in surplus by several hundred million dollars. In California they used to have a billiondollar deficit. Now. as I recently saw in a story in the Los Angeles Times. they have a surplus of $1V2 billion because of the recovery and the impact upon sales taxes. franchise taxes. revenue taxes. and income taxes. Incidentally. there is a total $50 billion surplus at the State and local level. The Federal deficit is running at about $150 billionfar below official predictions. according to private forecastersand if you take the recovery in the first quarter of this year and extrapolate it out over or extend it out over the rest of this year. our combined Government deficit by the end of 1985 will be 2 to 2Y2 percent of GNP. which is bad. but it is not so bad that we ought to panic and raise taxes and tell Paul Volcker to continue the interest rate policy he is following at the Federal Reserve.",

    "speech": "I appreciate the tack that the debate is taking just now. When we do something correctly. we should look at the REcoRD to remember what took place when we were considering it. Just within the last day or so I happened to look at one of my original newsletters that we sent out in the summer of 1981. In that letter we talked at that time about this topic today. I would like to just run through some quick figures. Savings in 1980 were less than 3 percent of disposable income. productivity was in a 2V percent decline. inflation was at 18 percent for the first quarter of 1981. interest rates were at 22 2 percent. We made some changes in 1981. One of those changes that we made. as I predicted in my newsletter of July 1981. was that these new changes would double savings because of the IRAs and inheritance tax improvements and the rest. In all actuality. it has increased nearly 300 percent to 8 percent of disposable income. Productivity has gone from a 2 percent decline in 1980 to 7.2 percent for the first quarter of this year. Inflation has dropped. as we know. to a 17year low. Interest rates are less than half. But the most important thing. as I said in bold print in this newsletter in the summer of 1981. was that the changes would. not only increase employment but would decrease unemployment by creating over 3 million new jobs. Do the Members know what the London Financial Times editorial said last month? And as a result we said that we hoped we could create 3 million new Jobs. but now we understand we have created 5 million new jobs. The same people who stood on the sidelines and said. \"Increase taxes. increase regulations. have more government programs and higher tax rates. and these things are going to be the solution for America.\" These people have been wrong consistently. I think it is appropriate now. 38 months later. to look at the record and see where we are headed and see whether or not we should go back to the old policies of tax increases and stagflation or whether we pursue growth. prosperity. investment. savings for the future of America.",

This has been especially noticeable in southern California. where probably a majority of our place names. including those of our streets. our rivers. and our cities reflect the Spanish heritage in their names. the city of San Bernardino and the Santa Ana River. in my own district. among them. It is hard to imagine California without the Spanish missions and the Mexican restaurants that make southern California so distinctive. The way we dress. act. and perceive things would change drastically were it not for this influence. From the bravery of the MexicanAmericans during the American Revolutionary War. to their participation in defending the Alamo. their heritage has been linked to this country. As our Founding Fathers represented American independence. so did Miguel Hidalgo. parish priest of Dolores. personify Mexican independence by leading the revolt against Spanish oppression. National Hispanic Week marks a time for us to reflect not only on this noble heritage. but on continued Hispanic participation and leadership in our Government. Looking to the future. we can only perceive. and welcome. the growing strength of the Hispanic influence in our society. and the enrichment of our pluralistic culture which this represents.*",

Some say the struggle continues to this very day for all Hispanic people in this hemisphere. a struggle for full participation in political and social systems. to obtain a fair share of the wealth and responsibilities which are the trademarks of a free society. This struggle also continues for the 16.5 million Hispanic citizens of this country who seek to establish as a practical reality the full participation of Hispanic citizens in the economic and social arenas of our great Nation.

I am encouraged by the gains made by Hispanics in achieving political and social parity in our society. The awakening of the sleeping giant is evidenced by the election of an Hispanic Governor in New Mexico. of Hispanic mayors in San Antonio. Sante Fe. and Denver. and in increasing Hispanic representation in local and State governments. Yes. gains have been made. and yet many still remain to be realized.

They have been left out of the political and cultural mainstream of American society. and we see very few government initiatives that focus on issues that most affect Hispanics. For example. little has been done to encourage bilingual education or to curb instances of languagebased employment discrimination. This is despite the fact that the language barrier is probably the most significant hindrance to equal access for Hispanics. Much attention has been given to the recent heightening of political awareness among black voters. and rightly so. However. only 60 percent of eligible Hispanic voters are registered to vote. This figure is below the national average. and indicates that the political clout of Hispanics has yet to be tapped. I would not like to see this trend continue. because it has been the recent experience of black Ameri-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for yielding and extending to us the opportunity to speak on National Hispanic Heritage Week. The history of Hispanics in this country is one of proud achievement and courageous struggle against injustice. Like the earlier waves of newcomers to Americas shores. Hispanics have often fled poverty and oppression in their native lands. With them. they brought a rich cultural heritages of art. music. cuisine. and craft as well as a strong devotion to family life. a pride in community and church. and a respect for their older community members. In the 1960s and 1970s. the burgeoning Hispanic population made great strides of progress through successful direct actions and boycotts. through hard work and determination to succeed in many fields. Hispanic leaders were at the forefront of the ongoing quest for economic justice for farmworkers. They also waged a proud struggle for quality bilingual education. In the 1980s. we are seeing the emergence of strong voter turnout in the Hispanic community as the best way to express their collective will and aspirations in America. Several major American cities are presently being headed by Hispanic mayors. including San Antonio. Denver and Miami. Organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Mexican America Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) are playing important roles during our deliberations on important issues of the day such as immigration reform and policies in Central America. They are also fighting to reaffirm the civil rights of all our citizens and the responsibilities of our government to its citizens. The United States is a land of great cultural diversitya diversity that has made this country stronger and enriched our way of life. Hispanic culture has greatly contributed to this diversity. This is in the great tradition of the assimilation of so many groups into American life. while consciously maintaining their distinct cultural identity. This is a great source of pride to us all. National Hispanic Heritage Week is a recognition of these contributions. Mr. Speaker. again I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman USE 23919 from New Mexico for this opportunity to speak.*",

Congressman BILL RicHARDsoN. for providing the opportunity to participate in this special order reflecting on the important contributions of the Hispanic and Latino communities to our Nation on the occasion of National Hispanic Heritage Week which will be officially celebrated next week. In the District of Columbia. we are especially fortunate to benefit from the contributions of a pluralistic Hispanic and Latino community. one which reflects the full diversity of the peoples of the Caribbean. and Central and South America. While many of the 50.000plus Hispanic and Latino residents of the District are relative newcomers to our Nations Capital. they have already contributed richly to the economic. social. and political life of the District of Columbia and our Nation. The Office of Latino Affairs. under the able direction of its Director Mr. William Vazquez. is presently involved in easing the transition of our newer community residents to life in the District of Columbia and our Nation. The contributions of Latino and Hispanic entrepreneurs and organizations. such as the Iberian Chamber of Commerce. are especially noteworthy. These businessmen provide a full range of business services and unique opportunities for our citys residents and visitors to enjoy diverse cultures and experiences. At the same time. they produce jobs and revenue for our city and our Nation. I am especially grateful for the contributions of the Hispanic and Latino communities to the 20th anniversary Mobilization of the March on Washington 1983 and look forward to the contributions they will be making to the New Coalition of Conscience as we seek to advance the specific legislation agenda on which we are united in pursuit of jobs. peace. and freedom..",

I want to commend my colleague Congressman BIu.L RICHARDSON from New Mexico for thinking of and sponsoring this special order saluting the contributions of the Hispanic population in our respective districts. In reality there have been few Hispanics involved with American Samoa unless you consider one of the first discoverers of the islands. the Spanish navigator Quiros. to have been instrumental in bringing the existence of our islands to the outside or Western World. We must firmly state that we did in fact exist. for more than 2.000 years. some historians say. before the palagi (Caucasian) discoverers came our way. In any case. these Hispanic sailors and seamen were instrumental in opening up our world to the new ideas and cultural exposure of the West which has culminated in my presence before this House now in the everunfolding saga of our political evolution. In this regard the Hispanic influence has been most considerable. But in a larger measure. we Samoans. hope to emulate the paths of our Hispanic brothers in our involvement in and participation within the United States fabric of government. We know that we. at this time. perhaps are considered next to come along after the Hispanics in the melting pot that is the United States of America but their achievements and successes are really ours yet to be realized and we can only salute their successes and accomplishments and give them a hearty Malo (well done). I wish to thank BILL RICHARDSON for allowing me to submit these remarks and fully support his efforts in this special order honoring the Hispanic population of all our districts. Thank you.

A majority of the jobs of 5. 10. or 15 years ago are obsolete today. and on the flip side of that coin a majority of todays jobs did not exist 5. 10. or 15 years ago. If we fail to upgrade the vocational training processes in this country. then we simply are wasting our resources by training people for jobs which do not exist. and when we fail to train them for jobs that do exist. we simply pass this responsibility on to industry and business. The object of this bill is not to give lip service to vocational education. and it is certainly not to give the impression that we have a commitment with only a token effort. I think we are all. on both sides of the aisle. sincerely interested in providing a bill that will prepare tomorrows generation for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Modern technology demands that we modernize our training. and one of the tragic commentaries on these studies recently on excellence in education coming from the private sector is that we have not adequately prepared our students for the jobs of today with modern technology. and when we fail to do that then they have to pick it up. We find the military and industry and business have constantly had to retrain those that we have put out into the marketplace. I do not believe that we are getting our moneys worth when we put $1 billion or more into a vocational education program and do not encompass with that a remodernizatlon of our equipment. methods. and processes as we continue in providing them the funds.

This measure is the result of bipartisan cooperation and the commitment of every member of the Committee on Education and Labor. H.R. 4164 strikes a critical balance between the needs of the business community and the needs of the student population. On the one hand. the act creates the necessary mechanisms for technological innovation in vocational education. on the other hand. it increases the access to such programs for specialneeds populations. It is a monumental leap in the right direction to earmark 5 percent of the Stategrant authorization to sexequity programs. since sex stereotyping is rampant in vocational education programs throughout this country. Until the time when we can add an equal rights amendment to our Constitution. we must take special care to insure that these funds are used with the equity that Congress has envisioned. In addition. the setasides for the disabled and disadvantaged will enable countless students to get the education that has historically been denied to them. These provisions are the result of negotiations between many groups that have a marked desire to improve the quality and access to vocational training. I commend Chairman PERKINS for his efforts to draw up and move this package which affirmatively impacts on vocational education. In addition. I strongly believe that paragraph 29 of section 202(a) should not be eliminated. This provision permits State use of Federal funds to support programs which more adequately serve the longrange needs of vocational students. In England. a recent international forum on job training concluded that \"schools should serve their Nations economy through broad rather than specialized education. Stress would be on communicationreading. writing. computing. listening. analyzing and thinking.\" The participants went on to say that it was desirable to change the direction of vocational education and avoid the dismal experience of earlier examples. which merely taught young people skills that were already. or soon to be. obsolete. It is the intention of paragraph 29 to do what 40 experts from academia. government. industry. and labor in the United States. Britain. Canada. Australia. and Sweden suggested. This provision would simply permit the States to assist localities to develop programs which integrate traditional vocational education with the training in basic skills necessary to compete in a continually changing job market.*",

This will help strengthen and expand the economic base of our Nation.

The bill before us today is important because it continues to expand the opportunities that Americans now enjoy through vocational programs. Since the Vocational Act originally became law in 1963. Federal support for vocational education has contributed to the significant increase in the number of institutions teaching vocational ed and therefore the number of students able to study it. Of particular importance. the existence of this legislation has helped enable groups with special needs to participate in vocational and technical education programs. This bill maintains the current law which requires States to expend 10 percent of its basic grant money for vocational programs for handicapped persons. I feel that these programs have made a positive difference in the lives of many and they should be continued. Today. individuals with special needs are vitally involved in all walks of lifein the work force. at home. and in public affairs. The contributions which those with handicaps make to our country are great. and it is important that the Federal Government maintain our commitment to this group. Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend the Committee on Education and Labor for their fine work in crafting this bill. As I have already stated. the section reauthorizing programs for handicapped persons is of particular concern to me. However. other sections are also significant. For instance.

In 1917. the Congress acknowledged the importance and crucial need for Americans to have an opportunity to obtain training and skills applicable to the labor market by approving the SmithHughes Act establishing a Federal program of vocational education. During the past 67 years. vocational and technical education programs in this country have continually improved. These programs have trained workers and citizens. which America can be proud. The Federal role has served as the catalyst in the exciting growth and sophistication of vocational and technical programs in States all across our country. An example of the effectiveness of Federal involvement can be cited by the increase in the enrollment of these programs in the years since Congress passed the Vocational Education Act of 1963. Today there are 16 million people Who are participating in vocational and technical programs. The VocationalTechnical Education Amendments of 1984 would update and improve the program currently in existence. My colleague from Kentucky. Mr. PERKINS. the Members who serve on the Education and Labor Committee. and its fine staff are to be thanked for their untiring efforts in producing such a comprehensive piece of legislation as the one before us today. With the increase in service and information jobs. along with the necessary retraining that will be needed in the coming decades for our countrys work force. the VocationalTechnical Education Amendments of 1984 will help America to meet those challenges. There are some innovative and timely ideas in the VocationalTechnical Education Amendments of 1984 which include addressing the need for training in the hightechnology field utilizing privatepublic partnerships. adult retraining and employment development. and a setaside designed to prevent sexual bias and overcome sexual stereotyping in vocational education. By supporting this bill. Congress will restate its commitment to the concept of vocational and technical education programs. Also. we will be declaring our interest in allowing States and localities the necessary flexibility in designing programs specific to their area. Mr. Chairman. I am hoping that my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 4164. the VocationalTechnical Education Amendments of 1984. and that this legislation will act as the impetus for local.

Vocational education is education for employability. which is vital in our economy as we respond to the continually changing workplace. Our vocational education graduates offer society specialized skills that are necessary to meet the needs of todays job market. National studies have shown that the unemployment rate of vocational education graduates is considerably below the national average. In addition. studies indicate that graduates from vocational programs are more apt to receive and be satisfied with their first jobs. Our national economy depends on a qualified and welltrained work force for continued economic growth. It is in our national interest to support a growing vocational educational program to meet any shortages in trained workers. An employability gap of sorts exists when the job openings listed in the want ads fail to match the skills of those persons looking for employment. The labor market is continuing to shift. and this gap could continue to grow if our Nations educational programs do not provide the specific training needed to fill these occupations. The Federal Governments role in supporting vocational education has always responded to the changing needs of our country. first. as our Nation moved from an agricultural to an industrial economy. and today. as we respond to a new age of specialized technology. Today. our vocational education programs reach out to many populations such as secondary students entering the labor force upon graduation as well as displaced workers who are returning to the labor force.

Mrs. Heckler and I served for 16 years together in the Congress. Although I have disagreed with her on a number of issues. I have always respected her ability. She will bring important strengths to her assignment as chief executive officer of the largest agency of the Federal Government. She may have lost a congressional district last fall. but with her new responsibility she has gained a larger constituencyone that is now being asked to bear a heavy sacrifice in these hard economic times. Millions of Americans who depend so much on HHS will place their trust and hope in Mrs. Hecklerthe elderly. the sick. the poor. the young. the handicapped. the disadvantaged. and all those who need our help the most. More than any other Cabinet officer. Mrs. Heckler will be the guardian of the social safety net. I am confident that she will serve her new constituency with wisdom and understanding and meet her new responsibility with fairness and compassionas her public trust. and ours. requires. In sum. I believe that President Reagan has chosen a worthy successor to our colleague. Dick Schweiker. Margaret Heckler has been a credit to Massachusetts and to the Congress. I take pleasure in commending her to the Senate. and I urge her confirmation.",

S. 1287. the Public Buildings Authorization Act of 1983. and its companion amendment (No. 1434) together consititute the fourth annual authorization of GSAs public buildings program reported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. In contrast to the piecemeal process for approving prospectuses on building projects by committee resolution. as established by the Public Buildings Act of 1959. this legislation assembles an annual program subject to the scrutiny of the entire Senate. In so doing it follows the authorization procedures set out in S. 452. the Public Buildings Act of 1983. and its predecessors S. 533 and S. 2080 which passed the Senate during the 97th and 96th Congress respectively. The reform efforts of the committee have been designed to improve congressional control over the entire public buildings program and not just the prospectus level projects which constitute less than onefifth of the total budget of the Public Buildings Service. An annual authorization provides an opportunity to evaluate GSAs progress in meeting its own goals for this program and to insure that congressional action complements and strengthens the agencys effectiveness. In those areas where the committee believes GSA to have ineffectively pursued its objectives. report language has advanced constructive criticism. Report 98114 to S. 1287 (May 16. 1983) conveys the committees assessment of the nature and adequacy of GSAs efforts. For reasons given in my statement appearing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on June 28. 1983 (S93489352) this years authorization by the committee has been accomplished in two stages. S. 1287 as reported on May 16 establishes an aggregate monetary authorization for the public buildings program. Amendment No. 1434. which I introduced June 23 on behalf of the committee. specifies those new construction and repair and alteration projects costing in excess of $1 million that have been approved by the committee. These projects can be regarded as fully authorized candidates for further action by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Descriptions of each project are included in my June 28 statement in the RECORD.0",

That pursuant to section 402(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. the provisions of section 402(a) of such Act are waived with respect to the consideration of H.R. 1746. Such waiver is necessary because H.R. 1746 authorizes the enactment of new budget authority which would become available in fiscal year 1983 and such bill was not reported on or before May 15. 1982. as required by section 402(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. for such authorizations.

The waiver of section 402(a) is necessary to permit the Navajo and Hopi Relocation Commission to fulfill its statutory mission of implementing Public Law 93531 (88 Stat. 1712).

The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior has included funds in its fiscal year 1984 markup for implementation of these program activities. The sums provided in the subcommittee markup are included in the Presidents fiscal year 1984 budget request.

This includes 180 tons of milk powder. 160 tons of vegetable oils. and 1.100 tons of blended foods. In addition. we have funded a Catholic Relief Services program supplying 8.200 tons of food. We should also be fully aware of the fact that the problem in Ethiopia is not simply a matter of food shortages brought on by drought. Internal military conflicts. a limited number of working transport vehicles. and the lack of good roads have hampered the distribution of whatever food supplies are already on hand. Moreover. there have been allegations. as there often are in international relief efforts. of diversion of food supplies. If. as some observers predict. the hunger problem continues to worsen. the appeals for assistance will also continue. Whatever the international response is. it must be combined with a determined effort on the part of the Ethiopian Government itself to facilitate equitable distribution of the relief supplies. Unfortunately. some of the reported public statements of administration officials have contributed to a perception that the United States may be limiting its aid for political reasons. Indeed. United StatesEthiopian relations are not very good. Just earlier this month. we heard another antiAmerican harangue by the countrys leader. Colonel Mengistu.

This bill would authorize study of the California Trail and Pony Express Trail for possible inclusion in the National Trails System as national historic trails. This bill is particularly important to the Sacramento area since both of the trails included in the study extend to Sacramento. The Pony Express Trail runs from St. Louis to Sacramento. The California Trail was one of a number of trails used by settlers and prospectors in their emigration west during the mid1800s. The trail breaks off the Oregon Trail at the Raft River and heads southwest to Sacramento. As a Sacramentan. I am particularly proud of these important elements of Sacramento history and believe it is essential to preserve the recreational and historic value of the trails. These trails are a vital part of our national heritage and represent a chapter in U.S. history that greatly deserves our tribute today. It is a memory of the contributions made by a group of bold men and women who braved the dangers of the western frontier to bring progress to our country. In remembering this important period in American history. we remember the dedication and labor upon which this Nation was founded. In this time of technology and modern convenience. it is particularly important that we preserve the memory of. the hard work and dedication of our ancestors. This legislation is an important first step for giving these historic areas the protection they deserve.*",

That law was amended by Public Law 9784. signed on November 20. 1981. which added five new members to the 60member Council. The act establishing the Council provided authority for the Council to accept any real property from any agency of the Federal Government for the purpose of establishing a Holocaust Memorial Museum.

The committee felt a 2year authorization of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council was appropriate.

Congress demonstrated its intent to establish a permanent reminder. both as a way to remember and to learn the lessons of the past so that these tragedies are not repeated.

The Holocaust not only diminished the people who were its victims. it diminished all civilized people. We need to remind ourselves that this happened in one of the leading. most civilized countries of the world. or so we then thought. so it was not an aberration necessarily that was limited to one people.

As we consider this bill. it is vital to understand the valuable work of the Holocaust Memorial Council in the formal observance of the days of remembrance and in the construction of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Through the horror of the Holocaust. Hitler sought not only to destroy the Jewish people. but to eliminate even the memory of their existence. In remembering those who died. we deny Nazism another victory. We should remember. too. those heroic individuals. the righteous gentiles. such as Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. and the old woman who sheltered my father in Poland. who stood up to the evil and risked their lives to save Jews and other potential victims. It is also important to preserve the memory of the Holocaust. because it is a source of many lessons for the entire human race. It has taught us how short the distance can be between a threat and its realization. It has taught us the magnitude that evil can reach when it is served by the apparatus of a modern state. Finally. and most importantly. because it was the indifference of the rest of the world that allowed the Holocaust to occur. we have learned that we all share a responsibility to speak out against intolerance. no matter whom it is directed against. Only if we learn this lesson well can we prevent humanity from ever again turning on itself. The role of the Holocaust Memorial Council in preserving the memory and lessons of the Holocaust is clear.

The Holocaust remains the most terrible occurrence of the 20th century. The destruction of 6 million Jews in Europe and the attempt to eliminate a people solely because of their Jewish heritage is a valid and terrifying memory for modern people. For most of us. the term \"holocaust\" needs further explanation. It evokes the tragic disregard for even the basic of rights of morality and human decency. the terror of the concentration camps. the tragedy of families torn apart and destroyed. and the scars both physical and mental that the survivors still endure. While the meaning is fresh and clear for us. the tragedy would be even worse if we allowed ourselves to forget the event and the profound impact it has had on individual lives and the world as a whole. It is important to remember that much time passed before the Holocaust elicited the cries of moral indignation that were deserved. Future generations must be reminder of the lengths to which tyranny may go if it is not opposed and halted. H.R. 5100 will authorize the necessary funds for the operation of the Holocaust Memorial Council. It is a small price to ask to preserve the truth so that our children for generations to come may understand the Holocaust and its somber lessons.*",

On behalf of the many individuals and organizations who have cooperated to help bring more historic recognition to this famous island. I am pleased that the House is acting to pass this legislation. In recognition of the importance of this site to the heritage of Canada and the United States. Congress authorized the St. Croix Island National Monument in 1949. First settled in 1604 by Samuel de Champlain. St. Croix Island holds the distinction of being the first European settlement in the northern half of North America. By the end of that first year. nearly half of the islands first 79 settlers perished from the harsh winter and lack of food. The island itself is located at the boundary of Maine and New Brunswick. Canada. By redesignating this island as an international historic site. we recognize both the cultural and historic importance of St. Croix Island. In recent times. citizens of the United States and Canada have recognized the need to better portray the great international heritage of St. Croix. In 1981. the United States and Canada dedicated an interpretive shelter on St. Croix Island at Red Beach. Maine. A similar shelter will be constructed on the Canadian shore to explain the islands first settlement. In addition. Canadian and United States officials have signed a memorandum of understanding. citing the historic significance of this island to both nations. I believe this redesignation will enhance the publics appreciation and awareness of St. Croix Island. and will help to better pronounce the importance of this site to Canadian and American history. As the chairman knows. no part of this resolution would affect the status of St. Croix Island. which is already established as a national monument and as a unit of the national park system.

Mr. President. this amendment will allow Hawaii to be treated on equal terms as all other States with respect to impact aid funding. Hawaii is the only State in the Nation with a single statewide school system. We in Hawaii feel that this system provides many benefits to the students in our State. However. because of this centralized State system. Hawaii is often at a distinct disadvantage with respect to impact aid allocations. In particular. the State is hurt when \"Super A\" districts receive favorable funding treatment. \"Super A\" districts are those districts with 20 percent or more category \"A\" students in daily attendance. While the Central Oahu District has 36.4 percent category \"A\" students in daily attendancewell above the figure necessary to qualify as a \"Super A\" districtthis high concentration of \"A\" students is completely disregarded when the allocation formula is based on statewide statistics. Since the State as a whole has only 10.26 percent category \"A\" students in daily attendance. Hawaii does not receive any impact aid funds at the \"Super A\" reimbursement rate. and thus. is severely penalized for having a centralized statewide school system. This amendment will allow States with a single statewide school system to treat the several administrative units within that system as school districts. only for the purposes of the impact aid formula. This does not mean that Hawaii will be granted any special treatment. It will merely allow Hawaii to receive exactly the same consideration as all other school districts in the country.

Accordingly. the committee believes it would be prudent to await the report in order to study the full magnitude of this problem before considering possible funding of a major new asbestos removal program. I might suggest to my good friend from Kentucky that with the report in hand. once we have an assessment of the extent of the problem. we should review its connection with the supplemental. since that is what supplementals are meant to encompass. if indeed the occasion so demands. So I rise to oppose the amendment. But very frankly. I point out that in a short period of time. we may all be together on this issue. I hope that the Senator from Kentucky would see his way clear to having the report in hand and then consider exactly what financial requirements are required by that report and I suggest that we can move together on the problem at such time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I reluctantly oppose the amendment. It is true it is a loan but it is a nointerest loan. and with interest rates at the level they are now. that means that the cost could be very. very substantial over the life of the loanperhaps more than the principal amount of $50 million. The fact is that the funds are provided in the House bill. so that there is negotiating room with the House. Unfortunately. Mr. President. the Senate is already $400 million over the House. and the negotiating room for the manager of the bill will be very. very seriously eroded if this amendment should be adopted. In fact. one calculation is that over its total life. the program could cost as much as $1.4 billion with the Federal share being $700 million. So. Mr. President. as I say. I am very reluctant to oppose the amendment because I have great respect for the Senator from Kentucky. but I think that under the circumstances. the subcommittee and committee would be in a very difficult position if this amendment is adopted. I am sure that the manager of the bill. and certainly I. will look with considerable favor on the House position if we are given this discretionary room by denying the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr President. in response to the comments that have been made by the distinguished floor managers of the bill. let me say that we are dealing with a problem here that very well could be of very substantial proportions. If we do not move quickly to provide some assistance for the local school districts who. after all. will be trying to comply with a Federal mandate placed upon them. we are going to see a massive transfer. in my judgment. of funds originally intended and needed for educational purposes. instructional purposes. program enhancement purposes. and many other things that our school districts are confronted with. to try to meet this particular problem. Recent reports about the state of our educational system and the effectiveness of it should give us some pause as to whether or not we should be willing at this point to see these funds transferred away from instructional purposes to deal with the asbestos hazards purposes. I do not think delaying action is going to improve the situation by one whit. Even though we do not yet have the report in hand from the Department of Education. I think it is pretty obvious by looking at those areas where the inspections have been made. that there is going to be a high incidence of asbestos contamination throughout the country. I know of school districts that already have had to delay the opening of their schools for the current semester because of the asbestos problem and because they were not able to deal with it very rapidly. I point out again that we are talking about loan money. While the Government would bear the cost of borrowing the money. that is a small amount to pay compared to the potential hazard that we are trying to address. I hope that we would go ahead and put this issue to rest as far as the conference is concerned. There will be many others that we can negotiate over in order to get the figures somewhere closer to where we would like to have them. and I think this is one that is so critical that it would be prudent to move ahead now and to eliminate it from the conference.

I support the amendment of the Senator from Ohio to increase the appropriation for research into Alzheimers disease through specialized research centers established for that purpose. In a hearing I held as chairman of the Subcommittee on Aging of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on May 16. 1983. I learned that this illness is ranked as the Nations fourth leading killer. responsible for an estimated 100.000 to 120.000 deaths a year in the United States. Furthermore. this disease is enormously costly both to families and to the public. Family members care for the majority of demented and frail individuals in the home. Victims usually need a constant caretaker. Constant means 24 hours a day. since one of the characteristics of the disease is a restlessness that leaves the victim unable to sleep and causes him or her to wander aimlessly. In 1979 the annual cost of nursing home care for persons with Alzheimers disease was approximately $6 billion or onehalf of the cost of all nursing home care for the elderly in that year. It is estimated that these costs will rise to $30 billion by the end of the 1990s. In the past decade. scientists around the world have made great progress in the understanding of Alzheimers disease. This increase in funding for specialized centers of research on Alzheimers disease could ultimately result in major progress in the treatment and cure of this debilitating disease. thus reducing both the human anguish of victims and their families. and the great public costs associated with it.",

Mayor Fulton is the presidentelect of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. His terms of office will begin in July. This year is a crossroads in the future of our Nations local governments. Record Federal deficits have forced cutbacks in spending for domestic programs administered largely by local and State governments. In fact. these programs have taken a disproportionate share of the budget reductions made during the 97th Congress. One thing is clear: Good leadership is needed if local governments are to work effectively with State and Federal officials to overcome budgetary restraints. Mayor Richard Fulton certainly provides that leadership. He is the second chief executive for the consolidated county government of NashvilleDavidson County and he has served in this capacity for 8 years. Previously. Dick Fulton represented the Fifth District of Tennessee in the U.S. Congress for 13 years. While in the Congress. he was a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee and served as Democratic regional whip. He is one of Tennessees most dedicated and effective public servants. He is eminently qualified to take on the important task before him of insuring the wellbeing and vitality of the Nations cities in the fact of a growing national deficit and wholesale changes in the Federal aid system that are now taking place. In my role as ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and as a member of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR]. I will work with Mayor Fulton to preserve the vital public services that our Nations cities provide. I look forward to working with Mayor Fulton as he assumes the reins of the U.S. Conference of Mayors a few months from now. I value his advice and counsel on matters of interest to local government. I wish him every success in his new role as he assumes the presidency of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.9",

Father Schall. a widely published author and essayist. has taught political science at the Gregorian University in Rome. At present. he divides his time between lecturing at the University of San Francisco and Georgetown University. His articles address related subjects of current concern. The first two \"Surgical Death\" and \"Who Judges?\". appeared in San Francisco on June 10 and July 22. respectively. in The Monitor. the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. They deal with the topics of abortion and euthanasia and defend the principle to the sanctity of all human life. The third article \"Peace. War. Poverty: Some Myths People Swear By.\" analyzes the position of some of the adherents of the nuclear freeze movement. None of us wants to see the deaths of millions or the destruction of this planet. We should strive to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons by entering into enforceable agreements with our allies. As Father Schall points out. however. death is not the worst of all evils. Worse by far is the total denial of human worth and dignity that has characterized totalitarian regimes in this century. Once this Nation rallied to the cry. \"Give me liberty or give me death.\" I would hope that we would still place such a high value on liberty and human dignity. that we would still resist aggression on the part of these powers. and that we would never fall into the trap of advocating unilateral disarmament. Mr. President.

It also disallows a residents disqualification of service on a Federal petit or grand jury in the District of Puerto Rico when proceedings are conducted in Spanish. solely because such person lacks proficiency in the English language. The unique situation faced by the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico calls for the changes embodied in the bill. The judges. prosecutors. defense counsel. and the overwhelming majority of court personnel are. primarily. Spanishspeaking. and secondarily. Englishspeaking. In addition. the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico sits in a jurisdiction where Spanish is the primary language of the overwhelming majority of the population as well as of defendants. litigants. and witnesses. to some. Spanish is still the sole language. The concept of a language option for the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico was originally approved by the Senate during the 93d Congress. Subsequently. it was approved by the Senate in the 95th Congress and the same bill I introduced today passed the House in the 96th Congress. Notwithstanding the bipartisan and overwhelming support of this legislation by the people of Puerto Rico and the recognized need of the same by the House and the Senate. efforts to secure its passage by both Chambers during the same Congress have been fruitless. It is unfortunate that the better administration of justice in the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico has been put on hold by unreasonable delays in the consideration of this bill by Congress. Time is long overdue for the improvements in our justice system called for in the bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in securing the passage of this legislation which is of utmost importance to the people of Puerto Rico and to the ends of justice.*",

H.R. 80. which requires that at least 10 percent of all contracts granted by the U.S. Postal Service shall be awarded to minority business enterprises. H.R. 80 is intended to insure equal economic opportunity within the Postal Service by the limited use of criteria which will accomplish remedial objectives in an area where voluntary compliance has been inadequate. H.R. 80 is an outgrowth of several years investigation by my Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services. For example. several years ago I found that minority business firms in 12 selected cities received only 3 percent of over $50 million of Postal Service procurement dollars. In six citiesBaltimore. Md.. Cleveland. Ohio. Detroit. Mich. New York. N.Y.. St. Louis. Mo.. and Washington. D.C.-less than 1 percent of Postal Service contractual dollars were directed to minority businesses. I was saddened by the dismal record of the Postal Service in support of minority business and learned that minority firms were almost entirely excluded from providing supplies. services. and equipment because ongoing programs within the Postal Service are ineffective in making equal economic opportunity a reality with the Postal Service. While the Postal Service has admittedly made significant strides in improving this record. H.R. 80 would address the remnants of these problems by providing that: First. at least 10 percent of the expenditures made by the Postal Service shall be for minority business firms. Second. a casebycase exemption is provided. subject to at least 30 days advance notice to the authorizing committees in the House and the Senate. including the reasons for the exemption. Third. the requirements of the bill shall not apply to collective bargaining agreements. Fourth. minority business enterprise is defined to mean a firm which is owned by at least 50percent designated minority ownership.*",

Our criticism of the HBC effort is that it gives us the worst of all possible worlds: A drastic increase in the tax burden at a time of economic fragility. a dubious compromise of national defense commitments at a time of world peril. a sharp increase in domestic spending across the board when spending discipline and investment selectivity are imperative. and a marginal reduction in the projected deficit when the threat of rising real interest rates demands deficit reduction. The Presidents budget is obviously unacceptable to us. The deficits are too high. the tax policy is imprecise. the outyear trends are wrong. and the national defense commitment is exaggerated and unmanageable. In contrast to the HBC and administration budgets. our proposal yields a lower deficit. It also controls national defense spending at a realistic 7percent real growth per year. raise taxes at half the HBC recommendation-$10 billion in fiscal year 1984and uses the proceeds to reduce the deficit and freezes many domestic programs at the fiscal year 1983 level. Yet this budget allows a 10percent nominal growth in education and job training. a health budget growth of twice the inflation rate and income security growth of $54.3 billion above the freeze level over the next 3 years. Unlike the other two budget proposals. our plan sends a strong. positive message that says we believe in lower interest rates. increased economic opportunity. a credible national defense. and a commitment to those in our land who need a helping hand.",

Once again I remind those who may wonder about this procedure on Tuesdays that party caucuses are frequently the place at which issues are formulated. positions are established. and much of the unofficial work of the Senate is conducted. Therefore. it seems wise and prudent to provide a time for these weekly caucuses by recessing the Senate. Mr. President. when the Senate resumes its session at 2 p.m. the pending business will be H.R. 1900. which is the social security package socalled. and the pending question will be the Dole amendment (No. 532) to the Melcher amendment (No. 531). as modified.

Our best chance to prevent a nuclear war relies on public knowledge. public understanding. and public action to stop it. This University of Wisconsin course showed one remarkably effective way to do that. The course was so popular that the audience had to Jam into the hall on a standingroomonly basis. In addition to the lectures. the reading assignments and the examinations. each student was required to develop a paper or a courserelated subject. And here is where the course really bore fruit. Many students carried the course into nearby communities: A film and lecture at a nearby high school followed by a discussion. Some went to elementary schools or Scout troops. Mr. President. the course has had a remarkable influence throughout the country as well as throughout Wisconsin. The University of Augusta in Maine asked for a syllabus. And talk about a geographical spreadthe University of Hawaii did too. The 39 lectures in the series included: Nuclear science and nuclear weapons. consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. visions and nightmares. paths toward war and paths toward peace.

The gap is even wider for college graduates. I wish to submit for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article from USA Today concerning the U.S. Census Bureaus findings. I believe the facts released by the Census add evidence to the need for an equal rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Despite current laws against pay inequities. unfair treatment prevails. In addition. I wish to include an article from the National Journal which states that cuts in student financial aid programs adversely affect the number of women attending college. more than such cuts affect men. These facts cause me considerable regret. The gap between opportunities for men and women was beginning to shrink. But with fewer women attending college we may see a resulting decline in the status of women. and in their ability to compete for a fair shake in the marketplace. One result of decreased educational opportunities is that on average a woman will realize a loss of $1.6 million in earnings in her lifetime. Mr. President.

I am honored to join my colleague. Senator METZENBAUM. and others. in condemning the severe injustices to which more than 100.000 Americans were subjected during that period. The 96th Congress mandated the formation of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilans. which recently released its report. The Commission found that some 120.000 Japanese Americans were forcefully abducted. not to protect national security. but rather to satisfy deep prejudices. In the process. the FBI was virtually ignored. even though it had the most relevant intelligence data. and it recommended only a careful surveillance of certain suspected individuals. These actions literally stripped tens of thousands of Americans of their property as well as their dignity. The entire process was a tragic error. and it is a stain on American values and constitutional liberties. It is important that we recognize this grave injustice. first as a renewed commitment to our fellow citizens of Japanese descent. and second as a reminder that these events should never happen again. If we cover up past tragedies. we will never learn from them. This dark event must continue to remain in our minds to guide future generations away from repeating past mistakes.",

    "speech": "Madam President. the suffering and tragedy inflicted on people during World War II remains unprecedented. Indeed. no other conflict more dramatically demonstrates the horrors of war or the strengths and weaknesses of mankind. Although America emerged victorious from the war. our people suffered a great deal of anguish. both mental and physical. For some. the scars remain intact after nearly 40 years. Some of our people. unfortunately. became victims of the war in a manner unique in American history. I speak of the American citizens of Japanese descent who were detained in \"relocation camps\" during the war. These Americans became the unwitting victims of a policy born out of wartime fears and ignorance. The detention of these citizens. executed without consideration of their loyalty to the United States. was unbefitting the overwhelming majority of these devoted citizens. It is truly witness to the gravity of the world situation in the early 1940s that the most cherished values held by all Americans were compromised at the expense of a segment of our citizenry. I am sure that this experience has caused many Americans to ask themselves some very difficult questions: Why did this happen? Were our fears justified? Were Americans of Japanese descent unfairly singled out? How can we prevent this from happening again? In seeking answers to these questions. we can gain a greater understanding of what America should stand for. Indeed. this experience poignantly serves as a lesson to all Americans that the principles upon which this country was foundedliberty. justice. and individual freedommust be staunchly defended. The point has been made and holds true now that if we forget the errors of the past. we are likely to repeat them in the future. No matter how distressing our national and international problems may be. we must never lose sight of our ideals. but rather stand together as one Nation. It is gratifying to see that American history and remain an unquestioned and free part of American society. Their inspiring example instills in each of us the recognition that regardless of adversities. we must remain. first and foremost. Americans.",

    "speech": "Madam President. on February 19. 1942. President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. which led to the evacuation and detainment of over 120.000 Japanese American and Aleut citizens and resident aliens in relocation camps situated within the United States. In 1944. the Supreme Court upheld the detention and internment aspects of the order on three separate occasions. Forty years have passed since those events. and the process of understanding what happened and of redressing this injustice has begun. However. it is crucial for the Nation to realize the lesson to be learned from this event. namely. that popular passions erode civil liberties. For years there have been questions concerning the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Now we know the whole story. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Citizens has recently issued a report stating that the broad historical causes that shaped the decision were racial prejudice. war hysteria. and failure of political leadership. The exclusion. removal. and detention of these people inflicted tremendous human cost. not only in terms of professional and property loss. but in the loss of personal liberty for thousands of people who knew themselves to be devoted to American causes and ideals. The injustice of excluding. removing. and detaining loyal American citizens is obvious. I do not believe. however. that this can be considered a totally isolated occurrence in American history. Here. as in other events throughout history. there was a supposed rationale for curbing civil liberties. namely. wartime military necessity. In the 1790s. there was a rationale for Congress passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. as there was in the 1830s. when President Andrew Jackson violated first amendment rights by trying to prohibit abolitionist tracts into the South. In the 1950s. it was the threat of communism that permitted Senator Joseph McCarthy to usurp civil liberties in the name of national security. The basic injustice of the wartime relocation of Japanese American and Aleut citizens should serve as an invaluable lesson both as we look back over our Nations history and as we consider constitutional issues today. Intolerance. in the form of zealous attempts to purge America from perceived moral. social. or political menace. can wreck havoc upon fundamental American civil liberties.",

The reports conclusions give rise to concern and warning to all Americans who cherish civil liberties. The freedom of all Americans is threatened whenever the rights of a minority are violated without due process. The Commission concluded that removal of Japanese Americans and legal residents from their homes and their detention under armed guard was not justified for military reasons. Wartime hysteria ignited long smoldering embers of racial prejudice. The report found that political leaders responsible for protecting the rights of all American citizens neglected to defend ethnic Japanese during the period of internment.

The internment of over 100.000 people of Japanese ancestry in relocation centers at the start of World War II was a tragic event unique in our history and one from which we must learn. The publication of the findings of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians gives us an opportunity to reflect on a past mistake. This is not an easy or comfortable thing to do. but one which we Americans are bound in honor to do. In looking back at this incident. I find it especially disturbing that the internment lasted so long in view of the lack of evidence substantiating such an action and considering the lack of screening criteria for the individuals to justify the military or security need of such actions. Our Constitution was simply suspended for one group of American citizens. a group whose sons meanwhile were fighting to defend this country. This is an action which should haunt us all. I hope that an action such as the denial of personal and constitutional rights to these Japanese American citizens and resident aliens will never be repeated. But only by more fully understanding the historical causes and the political atmosphere which led us to such actions can we make sure that a repetition of such an event does not occur. I want to emphasize the importance of this matter. I realize that nothing we can do or say here today can undo this history. However.

    "speech": "Madam President. I am pleased to join Senators METzENBAUM and MATSUNAGA. my other colleagues in addressing the painful issue of the internment of Japanese Amercians in U.S. camps during World War II. This regrettable incident is the focus of a recently released report of the U.S. Commission on the Wartime Internment and Relocation of Civilians. That report. the result of an extensive 2year investigation. describes in detail the tragic effects of Executive Order 9066 on over 100.000 Japanese Americans. That order. asserting that the evacuation of Japanese Americans was a \"military necessity\" and vital to our national security interests. resulted in the forcible relocation of thousands of innocent Japanese Americans. 70 percent of whom were American citizens. from the west coast to internment camps in desolate areas of the central United States. Forty years later. with not a single incident of a Japanese American attempting to aid the enemy having been documented. it is clear that the \"military necessity\" claims of our Government were unfounded. What this incident also makes clear is the ease with which the civil liberties and individual freedoms we enjoy can be usurped. For Japanese Americans. the rampant rumors of a Japanese invasion and war hysteria were enough to establish the guilt of American citizens simply because of their Japanese ancestry. In his testimony before the Commission in 1981. the late Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas said of the event: It is a sad and nationally humiliating story. I believe the mass evacuation of those of Japanese ancestry and their prolonged detention was a tragic error. and I cannot escape the conclusion that racial prejudice was a basic ingredient. As we await specific Commission recommendations on appropriate reparations to the internment victims. we must focus on the larger issue of usurped freedoms and how to prevent the recurrence of this dark moment in our history. We must insure that. in our haste to protect ourselves from our perceived enemies. we not do ourselves an even greater injustice by trampling those very principles which make this Nation great.",

This is not a novel appearance for this bill on the floor of the House. Similar legislation was adopted last year by a vote of 260 to 134. and for good reason. Development of offshore oil and gas resources is critical to this countrys wellbeing. but such development has its costs. This country has embarked on a headlong rush to stimulate the production of these nonrenewable energy resources without adequate consideration of the impact their development might have on the coastal zone activities of coastal States and on the sound management of renewable ocean resources. This policy has met with great opposition. Several States have been forced to seek protection in court. because of the insensitivity of this administration to their concerns. Accelerated development of offshore oil and gas resources in the national interest cannot take place without consideration for and the cooperation of coastal States. This bill would provide the funding. through the sharing of Federal OCS lease sale revenues. for States to assume a meaningful role in the rational management of all our ocean and coastal resources. This bill also recognizes the value of the coastal zone management and the sea grant college programs in paving the way to a better understanding of our coastal resources and how best to use them. Furthermore. this legislation would provide this critical assistance to States without increasing an already overwhelming Federal budget deficit. By basin block grants on an increase in future OCS revenues rather than on the present level of such revenues. unacceptable growth in the deficit can be avoided. The time has come for us to put our bickering behind us. and to attack our energy problems together.

I welcome this initiative because I believe to be particularly fitting that OCS revenues be used to rescue our Nations marine resources protection and development activities from inadequate funding. The OCS development poses a threat to our environment. especially to our Nations coastal and marine resources and therefore is only fair play that money raised from these activities be used to offset the impacts ancillary to the offshore development. Now more than ever we need to intensify our national effort to preserve marine resources. Our ecosystems as well as the economy would suffer a severe blow if our ocean and coastal resources are ever found depleted. The continued funding of ocean and coastal development activities is of great concern to the people and the Government of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico as well as other coastal States has taken a very active role in a broad range of ocean. fishery. and coastal programs. including the national sea grant program. These activities are particularly important because of Puerto Ricos condition as a tropical island. Almost 72 percent of the islands 3.2million people live in coastal municipalities.

Coastal States are facing tremendous financial pressures due to the acceleration of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing. exploration. and development. It is vital that we realize and plan for the relationship between the expansion of OCS leasing activities and the capability of coastal States to bear the costs associated with such development. While speeding up OCS development under the 5year plan. it is unfortunate that at the same time the administration has reduced Federal support for State programs in ocean and coastal management. These contradictory policies serve to place unnecessary limits on environmentally sound OCS development. H.R. 5 offers a rational alternative to present policies by allocating a portion of Federal revenues from offshore oil and gas leasing for block grant funding for State programs in renewable ocean and coastal resource management. This measure has the support of the Coastal States Organization as well as oil exploration companies. Furthermore. while noncoastal States do not directly benefit from H.R. 5. the National Governors Association. with the support of a substantial majority of inland States. has also endorsed this vital bill. In California. we anticipate 8.36 percent of the total funding under the ocean and coastal resources development block grant. The method used to determine funding is based on a fair and balanced formula which includes shoreline mileage. coastal county population. coastal energy estimates. and OCS activity. This last item includes three factors: Activity resulting from Interiors 5year plan. an estimate of acres leased. and a retroactive estimate of productionto give a boost to States such as Alaska and Texas with long running programs. Using this formula and the assumption of $300 million in total annual receipts. then taking $35 million off the top of that for sea grant. the subcommittee estimated that Californias share would be $25 million. Given the increasingly stringent State fiscal picture. this amount could go a long way toward preserving an active and effective State coastal program in California. Our Governor has unwisely. in my opinion. eliminated all Federal funding for our coastal commission. but I cannot believe that legislative efforts. led by State Senator Bob Presley. to redress this error will not prevail.o",

I wish to place on record my support for H.R. 5. the Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Block Grant Act. which I cosponsored. I would like to commend Congressman WALTa B. JoNzs. chairman of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. Congressman En FORSYTHE. ranking minority member of the committee. and Congressman NoRM DAMouas. chairman of the Oceanography Subcommittee. for their efforts on behalf of this bill. H.R. 5 is indeed a culmination of many years of labor. Hearings were held in the 97th Congress on similar measures. and much work has gone into working out this compromise measure that would secure bipartisan support. It is only fair that coastal States receive at least a portion of the revenues contributed to the U.S. Treasury as a result of development of oil and gas on our Outer Continental Shelf. Many inland States receive as much as 50 percent or more of the Federal revenues generated by onshore mineral development. Out of the estimated $10 billion in Federal revenues received from OCS leases in fiscal year 1983. H.R. 5 would allocate approximately $300 million to the fund established in its provisions. I realize that certain reservations have been raised concerning the method of calculating the disbursement of grants to the States. For example. some questions have been asked about the fact that some States having no OCS activity off their shores. because they are not adjacent to an ocean. would receive more money than States that have a great deal of OCS activity. Yet despite these reservations. H.R. 5 is a bill whose time has come. and I am hopeful that the reservations made to this bill can be surmounted. This measure already represents a compromise. and I believe that H.R. 5 is the best possible choice that we have at this time for OCS revenue sharing..",

From the purview of my membership on the House Appropriations Committee. my staff has completed the arduous task of analyzing the Reagan administrations fiscal year 1984 budget requests in the areas of education. social services. housing. and the environment. Mr. Speaker. in accordance with this study. these budget proposals. if passed by Congress. will have a severe impact on the services provided for the residents of Ohio. Mr. Speaker. simply phrased. the Reagan budget is bad news for the country and dreadful news in Ohio. It is even worse when we stop to consider the progressively larger and destructive budget reductions the President has proposed since taking office in 1981. Moreover. when we take a hard look at the devastating effects of the high unemployment level in Ohio. now at 13.6 percent. it is evident that the proposed Federal budget reductions will only push Ohio deeper into the throes of economic chaos. It then is appropriate and indeed mandatory that we study this analyses of the Reagan budget of Ohio as a working reference for not only the State. but also the Midwest and the Nation. I can think of no better time than the present to review this disturbing yet enlightening analyses before we begin the floor debate in the House on the fiscal year 1984 budget resolution.",

Gracious southern hospitality by the McLendons could not and has not been surpassed. One would expect Charlie to be especially active in the textile industry. which he has been for years. but he also has spearheaded Burlington Industries solid involvement and concern in our Nations free enterprise system through. among other activities. the political process. Burlington Industries has asserted a strong and positive political activity in recent years and Charlie McLendon has provided that interest and spark.

I am very pleased to learn that. since 1982. 4.163 girls have completed an extensive water conservation education and action program which included learning how we use water for daily personal needs. for recreation. and for industrial use. measuring home water consumption. identifying where water is being wasted and measuring how much is being wasted. determining where local water comes from and why it costs what it does. learning about waste water and the costs associated with waste water in our communities. and repairing leaking faucets and learning about home plumbing.

The Migrant Labor Contractors Act. which this House passed last year has for some time. the old Farm Labor Contractors Act. has for some time had a prohibition against employing illegal aliens. Section 106 says. no farm labor contractor shall recruit. hire. employ. or use. with knowledge. the services of any individual who is an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or who has not been authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment. For those who are concerned about the penalties. whether civil penalties will work or criminal penalties will not work. if a farm labor contractor commits a violation of section 106. is liable for fines of not more than $10.000 or sentenced to prison to a term not to exceed 3 years. Let me tell you that the very farm labor contractors who have these sanctions against them are among the largest suppliers of illegal aliens into this country. Now there have been a number of convictions under this act but. the reason we are here now is because the tide of illegal aliens to this country has not been stemmed and yet the largest purveyors of illegal aliens are violating the law today. a law that has been on the books for many. many years. with very tough criminal sanctions and penalties against them. Now. I think you have to ask yourself whether or not you really believe this is going to work because this is the most dramatic law that we have on the books with the largest segment of our economy that uses illegals and in fact. as would be tested in the agricultural community in my State and others. there is no problem getting help from farm labor contractors. many of whom would supply illegal aliens for that purpose. So we have a law that has been on the books for years which is very direct and has very harsh penalties. including civil and criminal penalties. yet we find out that the tide of illegal aliens to the agricultural communities of the United States of America is greater now than it ever has been.",

I thought since everybody referred to California law that they might be interested in what the author of that law had to say when he presented his testimony before our committee. I hope I will not confuse folks with the facts here. Mr. Arnett. the former member of the California State Assembly. in his testimony said that: Those who have suggested that the experience in individual states. that is with respect to employer sanctions argues against including employer sanctions in congressional bills under consideration. Such conclusions are a distortion of the facts. at least in California. and have no substantial evidence whatsoever to support them. I will not take the time of my Members to go through his entire testimony. He pointed out they were not effective because they were never put into effect precisely because there was court challenge. Let us be very clear what this amendment does. it throws out employer sanctions. at the same time supposedly improving enforcement of labor condition laws. That is not what the AFILCIO asked for in their testimony before our subcommittee when Tom Donohue. testifying on behalf of the AFLCIO said: A legislative prohibition on the employment of undocumented workers backed by substantial and workable sanctions to deter employers from violating that prohibition is the single most important deterrent to illegal immigration. Althea Simmons. testifying before our committee for the NAACP. expressed support for employer sanctions and noted \"The continued influx of undocumented workers has a disparate impact on blacks.\" So if you want to remove that sanction which the AFLCIO testified continually before our subcommittee and the subcommittee on the Senate side. is the most important thing in terms of stemming the tide of illegal immigration as it impacts on jobs of Americans. then vote for this amendment. Regrettably because of the way this amendment is drawn you cannot get to the point that the gentleman from California makes. which is improvement of labor condition enforcement without knocking out employer sanctions at the same time. I did not write the amendment. But we had full opportunity to present amendments as we wished. but that is the way the amendment is drawn. it is a either/or proposition.",

    "speech": "bill makes the declaration that targeting constitutes \"an unreasonable practice which burdens United States commerce\" and is. therefore. actionable under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. Such an approach would at least relieve an administration of the obligation to argue that the actions it took against targeting were consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Unlike countervailing duty law. Section 301 is explicitly more than the domestic implementation of an international agreement. Even as it stands now. Section 301 authorizes the president to act either \"to enforce the rights of the United States under any trade agreement\" or \"to respond to any act. policy. or practice of a foreign country or instrumentality that ... is unjustifiable. unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens U.S. commerce.\" Arguably. the president could act against targeting on the basis of the present 301. Indeed. there was considerable speculation last year that he would do so as a result of the Houdaille petitions demonstration of the effect of Japanese industrial policies on a segment of the U.S. machine tool industry. In a sense. then. making targeting clearly actionable under section 301. the TRAC bills most radical proposal in this area. A better candidate for that description is the removal of the president from the decisionmaking process in these kinds of cases. Under current law. action under 301 is at the discretion of the president. The TRAC bill turns 301 decisions over to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and circumscribes them with tight deadlines. USTR must announce its preliminary decision within five months of the receipt of a petition and a final decision in 11 months. If the decision is affirmative. the administra. tion is required to take whatever action it is going to take within 30 days. If the drafters of the TRAC bill put more faith in an administrative process wholly controlled by USTR. it is partially because they have ensured that in carrying out his duties the trade representative will be considering more than the representations made to him by petitioners and foreign respondents. The TRAC bill makes 301 decisions reviewable by the U.S. Court of International Trade. The bill instructs the court to \"hold unlawful any determination. finding or conclusion found to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.\"",

    "speech": "seems to have a point well taken. The initial proposal to allow winter navigation surfaced recently in an amendment to a water projects authorization bill being considered by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. The amendment came as somewhat of a surprise to all concerned since the plan had been discarded by the Army Corps of Engineers several years ago. Thomas L. Washington. MUCC executive director. called winter navigation \"the most disastrous project ever proposed for the Great Lakes.\" A strong statement to say the least. The MUCC was in the forefront of opposition to yearround shipping when it was being pushed by the Corps in the late 1970s. The conservation organization feels strongly that winter navagation would bring severe disruptions to the lives of citizens along the connecting waters of the Great Lakes. serious damage to shorelines and private property. destruction of natural resources. impairment of the tourism economy. the threat of oil and chemical spills under ice. unfavorable impacts on the states railroad lines. and an unacceptable economic subsidy to a narrow industrial base. Washington has urged all members of the Michigan congressional delegation to work for the defeat of winter navigation. and we support that urge. \"Opposition to winter navigation in Michigan.\" says Washington. \"includes counties. townships. planning commissions. cities. local politicians. unions. railroads. ferry companies. newspapers. civic and conservation groups. countless citizens directly and indirectly affected by this proposal. and the state of Michigan.\" He added that. with the exception of U.S. Steel. even shippers and Industries have been opposed. or at best \"lukewarm.\" to 12month shipping in the Great Lakes. \"I dont know how this proposal got into legislation with no advance notice to the millions of citizens concerned about the future of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.\" stated Washington. Congress should do nothing about the amendment before the views of the public have been heard and considered. It is not a matter that should be dealt with before considerable time and energy have been spent analyzing all of the possible consequences. The Michigan Upper Peninsula relies on its natural beauty and resources to survive in todays depressed economic market. and any legislation that would possibly damage or hinder the continued growth and development of the beautiful UP area should be soundly defeated.

The particular group which I recognize with my comments here today is the Reserve Marine Unit of Bessemer. Ala. The unprecedented honor of which I spoke a few moments earlier was their receiving. for the second consecutive year. the prestigious Harry Schmidt Trophy. This award is given annually to the outstanding Reserve Fleet Marine Force and Mobile Expedition Force by the National Reserve Officers Association. Prior to this repeat honor for Bessemers Marines. no unit had ever been awarded this honor twice in succession. Although many persons may not even realize that such things as Reserve Marines exist. they form an important part of our armed services. These Marines always operate under the assumption that they could be called out at any moment. The Bessemer battalion remains prepared to be airlifted to any remote corner of the world within 24 hours. should such a need arise. In case of such situations. the Bessemer battalion. and all Reserve Marines. are constantly training and learning and working. in their continuing effort to reach maximum readiness. They learn about firearms all the way from M16 rifles to tank guns. They take classes in advanced warfare tactics. and train extensively in conventional warfare. Mr. President. during World War II. It was an honor and privilege for me to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. Today. I continue to feel a close personal kinship to those who are now marines. For that reason. my pride in the Bessemer Reserve Marines is doubly strong. They have worked hard to stay prepared. and the honor they recently received certainly indicates their success. They are a group of whom all Alabamians should be proud. and I congratulate them.",

That merely puts the focus where it belongs. on people. rather than bankers. I would hope if we could dispose of the Melcher amendment either with adoption of the seconddegree amendment or with some other parliamentary procedure. that we could finish the social security bill today. That may be somewhat optimistic. The Senator from Kansas has no idea how we are going to dispose of the Melcher amendment. As I looked over the amendments on social security. there are only about four or five that would require rollcall votes and there is a strong desire by the President of the United States. by the House leadership which already passed the social security bill. and by the Senate leadership. at least on this side. to try to pass the social security bill and go to conference and pass the conference report by Thursday evening.

He has indicated many times what I consider to be accurate statements concerning whether you like withholding or not. He has fairly said many times that it is a collection procedure. not a tax. and that debate. or course. is helpful. Before the Senator from New Mexico speaks. I just want to say that the unemployment implications in this bill are significant. Without going through all the States. if we do not take action this week. it is going to affect about 28.000 people in Alabama. 6.000 in Alaska. 209.000 in California. 14.000 in Colorado. 46.000 in Florida. 48.000 in Massachusetts. 92.000 in Michigan. 89.000 in Illinois. 57.000 in Indiana. 131.000 in New York. 78.000 in Ohio. 99.000 in Pennsylvania. 58.000 in Texas. 38.000 in Wisconsin. and 31.000 in Washington. So I think it is fair to say that this social security bill does contain an urgently needed extension of the Federal supplemental compensation program that is due to expire at the end of this month. The problem is that we are not scheduled at this time to be in session next week and will not be here at the end of the month. The FSC program provides extra benefits to the longterm unemployed who have exhausted their right to benefits under the regular State unemployment program (normally 26 weeks) and the FederalState extended benefit program (13 weeks). Although there are slight differences between the House and Senate bills. both of them would provide $2 billion or more in unemployment relief to the jobless over the next 6 months. As the Senator from Louisiana said. if you lose. it is a filibuster. If you win. it is informed debate. So I hope we are in a period of informed debate. that eventually right will prevail. that we will not deny unemployment benefits to the jobless while we try to take care of a special interest group. particularly since we have already set a debate.",

Certainly the budget process has its faults. but it is illogical for us to have a balanced budget as a goal and then let one of the mechanisms which is already law and available to us. and which is designed to monitor revenues and outlays. fall into disuse. I recognize the importance of the fiscal year 1985 agricultural appropriation bill to the farmers of our country. and I would like to see the Senate turn soon to its consideration. However. by voting to continue debating the question of waiving the Budget Act. I am joining with others to impress upon the leadership of the Senate the need to arrive at an agreement on the first budget resolution for fiscal year 1985. The Congress should have passed this resolution by May 15. Continued failure to act upon the final version of this resolution will make budget discipline harder to achieve and higher deficits and higher interest rates more likely. The farmers of this country know all too well the disastrous effects of high deficits and high interest rates on the commodities they try to sell abroad and on the money they try to borrow here at home. By standing firm now and opposing the attempt to invoke cloture. it is my hope that it may soon be possible to have both a conference report on the first budget resolution for fiscal year 1985 and an agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 1985. both of which would be to the benefit of the American farmer..",

It has completed 8 townhouses with another 25 under way on a a 7acre site in the Govans neighborhood of Baltimore. The ultimate development of the site will include 100 housing units. The project is completely owned by the association with the residents having a life tenancy in their units. This mixed income project has a privately subscribed subsidy which pays about half the debt service on the project thereby keeping rents within the ability of neighborhood residents to pay. Tenants pay a onetime membership fee in the association of $2.100 to $2.500 and monthly fees ranging from $300 to $350 depending on the size of the unit and their income. The association will retain appreciation profits to finance future production of units. Thus. the BMHA is assisting neighborhood residents to remain in their neighborhood at modest rent levels while gradually generating seed money from equity in the project to finance additional moderate income housing. This mutual housing project grew out of the highly successful Neighborhood Housing Services Program. which brings together area lenders and residents to reinvest in their own housing in stable neighborhoods overlooked by financial institutions. The result has been rehabilitated and newly constructed housing. increased home ownership by neighborhood residents. and stable communities. In the case of Baltimore mutual housing. a broad array of local public and private resources have been brought to bear on the Govans neighborhood. A consortium of local lenders has places permanent financing on the project. The city of Baltimore issued bonds to finance the project. The State of Maryland has granted $50.000 to the project along with making the lowinterest construction loan. And local private contributions are mounting up for the debt service subsidy. $200.000 has been raised toward the $500.000 goal for this fund. Tenant membership fees and cityfunded roads and utilities construction on the site represent an equity investment. So the project is a microcosm of public and private contributions and cooperation toward a common goodthe continued stability of a city neighborhood. The amendment before us today will ensure Federal participation in the project through the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. the parent organization of Neighborhood Housing Services. With this amendment. the Federal partnership in this project will be joined. I urge my colleagues adoption of this amendment.",

Second. broaden support of research efforts requiring advanced undersea facilities and capabilities. Third. enhance ability of researchers to successfully complete selected undersea tasks and to extend classical land based laboratory scientific methods and capabilities to the seafloor. Fourth. ensure continuity of effort and longrange funding for otherwise infeasible insitu research efforts. Fifth. provide training and facilities to develop a body of scientific personnel who are skilled in the use of underwater laboratory facilities and advanced undersea research techniques.

Ind.. observed on July 18. It is appropriate that we honor Red Skelton today and I am pleased to join him in a special visit to the White House to commemorate his birthday with the President. Red Skelton has brought happiness and laughter to generations of Americans throughout a career that has spanned five decades. His comic talent was first enjoyed by audiences in vaudeville. carnivals. circuses. riverboats. and burlesque houses in the early years. Later. Red starred in radio and in over 40 motion pictures. From the 1950s through the 1970s. Red Skelton delighted new generations of TV audiences with his unique brand of humor. mime. and unforgettable characters. In addition. Red Skelton is a talented composer. short story writer. and a recognized painter. One of his favorite subjects: clown portraits. with shocking red hair. Red Skelton has ably proved the adage that laughter is the best medicine. During World War II and the Korean war. he entertained U.S. troops overseas. He has been honored numerous times for his selfless contributions to the needy and disabled. Red Skeltons success in show business is equaled only by his universal appeal to all ages. I believe it fitting that we pay tribute today to Red Skelton and I know my Senate colleagues join me in wishing him continued health. humor. and his special grace which brings us cheer.*",

This is an issue which concerns me greatly. While great strides are being made in the development of educational programs using computers. and the number of schools which are equipped with computers is growing at a fast clip. these benefits are not evenly distributed across all schools. Evidence is already available to show that schools in poor areas are not keeping up with more affluent schools. This is a problem to which the Congress must be sensitive. The Senate will soon be considering a bill to improve science and mathematics instruction. the Education for Economic Security Act. The bill will provide assistance to strengthen teachers skills in computer education. It will be very important that teachers in disadvantaged areas make use of this assistance to prepare themselves to provide computer education programs in their schools. I believe that children in all socioeconomic groups can benefit greatly from computer education. to learn basic skills and prepare for their future.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to focus the Senates attention today on the issue of tuition tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools. I believe such credits would be bad policy for several reasons. First. tuition tax credits will lead to the destruction of fundamental principles of equality in which Americans have always believed. The Equal Opportunity Act of 1983 is ironically named: Instead of contributing to an educational system that will serve as an \"open door\" through which all children regardless of race. creed. or economic background can pass. the educational system will become \"twotiered.\" If this legislation is adopted. the most promising and brightest students will be skimmed from our public schools and placed in private schools. Such skimming will defeat one of the primary purposes of the public school systemthe goal of providing all children an equal chance to enter the mainstream of American life and to achieve success. I am also opposed to tuition tax credits because of their excessive cost. At a time of record budget deficits and diminished Federal support for public education. it would be irresponsible to enact tuition tax credits and drain additional billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury. Recently. I received a letter from former Senator Sam Ervin. Jr.. of North Carolina. in which he outlined his reasons for being opposed to tuition tax credits. While in the Senate. Sam Ervin was a strong supporter of public education. In an open letter to the President last year. Senator Ervin discussed in some detail why he believes tuition tax credits are a bad idea. In the same letter. he makes a forceful argument challenging their constitutionality. He also discussed this latter point in remarks delivered to the National Press Club on March 16. 1983. I believe the issues raised in these papers by Senator Ervin are important ones for the Senate to consider. I therefore ask that the letter and the remarks of Senator Ervin be printed in the RECORD.",

Over 80 percent of the firefighters in the United States are volunteers.

Title I of the act sets forth the State and local service delivery system and planning requirements. Title II authorizes adult and youth training programs for the disadvantaged. and title III provides for a Stateadministered training and placement assistance program for dislocated workers.

Final regulations governing these titles are to be published by March 15. 1983. so that States and service delivery areas can begin planning and preparing for implementation of the new act by October 1. 1983. The Department of Labor is to be commended for meeting the tight timeframe established in the JTPA on the promulgation of these regulations and for its efforts to maintain communication with the Congress throughout the drafting process. Moreover. these proposed regulations reflect changes that were suggested by the sponsors of the legislation and. consequently. we believe that they represent a vast improvement over earlier proposals. However. there remain several major areas of concern in the proposed regulations which we. on the authorizing committee. feel deserve comment and require. at a minimum. further consideration by the Department of Labor.

More than 70 of my colleagues are joining me in the introduction of this legislation. which is identical to H.R. 7173 in the 97th Congress and which was approved by the House on December 16. 1982. The ACIR was established in 1959 to bring together representatives of the Federal. State. and local governments to consider common problems. Among other things. Congress mandated the ACIR to: provide a forum for discussing the administration and coordination of Federal grants and other programs which require intergovernmental cooperation. to make technical assistance available to the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government to determine the impact of legislation on the Federal system. to recommend the most desirable allocation of Government functions. responsibilities and revenues among units of Government. and recommend methods of coordinating and simplifying tax laws and administrative practices to achieve a more orderly and less competitive fiscal relationship among the several levels of government. Over the years. ACIR has done its job well. It has issued more than 50 major reports. and its recommendations have led to the enactment of more than 700 different State laws. At the Federal Government level. the ACIR developed the general revenue sharing law. Today the membership structure of the ACIR is the same as it was in 1959: three private citizens. three executive branch officials. four Governors. three State legislators. four mayors. three elected county officials. three Senators and three Members of the House of Representatives. The legislation I am introducing would add four new members to the ACIR bringing its total membership to 30. My bill would add representatives of governmental bodies who are statutorily excluded from ACIR membership but whose importance in the Federal system is nonetheless undeniable. First. the legislation would add an elected local school board member to the Commission. One of the most noticeable trends to emerge in government in the past two decades has been the growth in importance and influence of local school district government.

I sold my interests in the bank. but I like to think I still know something about the banking business. One thing I do know for certain is that many of my former colleagues are badly misrepresenting the law passed last summer concerning withholding on dividends and interest. I know as a former banker that it is not nearly as hard to do as they are claiming. And I know as a legislator that the new law provides exceptions for most elderly. those with small accounts. and those with little tax liability. I would guess that onethird of the many letters and postcards I am receiving on this issue would not have been sent If the bankers had bothered to explain the exemptions. For example. in this mornings mail I received three letters from constituents which read in part: I am 77 years old and cannot live on my Social Security totally. I depend on my interest earnings to supplement SS. The second read: I will be 18 in May 1983. my deceased mothers Social Security will be terminated and I want to go to collegecannot without full interest savings. And a third which read that the new lawWill withhold interest and dividends from those who can least afford it: the senior citizens and the low income people. I would bet that all three of these letter writers qualify for an exemption. They should demand 20 cents in postage back from their banker. The following article from the February 21 Washington Post helps explain why some bankers may be lobbying against this provision.

Racial hostility and social injustice were to the point of irreparably tearing our country apart. and we were a nation divided. Lives were lost in this battle for principles that are founded in our Constitution. Yet. even more would have been lost had the man leading the movement for social justice and equal opportunity not been a man of nonviolence. A man who understood. like Ghandi. that longlasting change could best be accomplished through peaceful means. This man was Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Historically since his untimely death. his birthday has been a day to reflect on and rededicate the Nation to the purposes that he devoted and gave his life forachieving the American dream of freedom. equality. reconciliation. and justice at home. as well as peace in the world. Usually. as time goes by. the memory of our national leaders fades or tarnishes. Yet this is not the case with Dr. King. He stands among the small number of great leaders who gave their lives and for whom respect. honor. and admiration have grown with each passing year. But most importantly. a national holiday in Dr. Kings name would not be just a celebration of one mans life. It would be a time to memorialize the ideals he stood for and fought forideals that many in our Nation now take for granted. We are fortunate to have lived in the same generation as this man. We remember his struggle. It is only fitting to make his birthday a national holiday for future generations to learn from as well.e",

For the second time within a year bitter prejudice has resulted in a horrible and senseless massacre of stunning proportions. Once again. the world is forced to view the devastating result of a massacre perpetrated by a cold. deep hatred of one faction of citizens toward another. India strives to be a democratic country and these immigrants were massacred because they were allowed to vote in the recent elections held in India. The United States as a whole must stand up and condemn these ruthless acts of violence which stain the conscience of mankind. We must strive to set an example for the rest of the world to follow. guaranteeing the rights of people to live in a democracy.

Small Business Week affords the opportunity to acknowledge the contributions and achievements of small businesses throughout the country. We pause to reflect on this vital sector which constitutes the backbone of our Nations economy. we recognize the strength of those small business owners who persevere in the face of economic adversity. and we honor those selected by the Small Business Administration as State Small Business Persons of the Year. Michael \"Mickey\" Pierce. the 34yearold president of Gravis Concrete. Inc.. a construction and concrete firm in Stuttgart. AR. is my States Small Business Person of the Year. Mickey Pierce is known as a modest. softspoken. sports enthusiast who purchased Gravis Concrete in his midtwenties. He has served as president of the Stuttgart Kiwanis Club. as well as director of the Stuttgart Industrial Development Commission. and remains active in a variety of civic affairs. Gravis Concrete employs 17 people. which is more than a 60percent increase since 1973. the year Mickey Pierce purchased the company. The firm specializes in the design and construction of commercial. industrial. and institutional buildings. and has developed a method of slippouring concrete which achieves a highquality finish and requires a 24hour pouring. The city of Stuttgart saved $10.000 through the use of another Gravis innovation. a concrete machine that poured the street and curbing simultaneously. In 1976. the Arkansas ReadyMixed Concrete Association presented Gravis Concrete with the Concrete Excellency Award for the construction of a rice mill storage complex. The association cited the quality of construction. as well as the innovative use of concrete. in presenting the award. Mr. President.

I think. raises a question which goes to the very heart of this system and a system which the gentleman from Texas very eloquently described. Let me make my position very. very clear to the distinguished gentleman from Texas. Whetherwe are talking about two different issues here for those Members who have not been engaged. One issue is the letter to Commandante Ortega which I have raised very serious questions about. which appeared as late as yesterdays Washington Post. which I addressed an American Bar Association standing committee on last week and which I think legitimately. as a matter of constitutional law and process deserves to be debated in its own right. The second is a document written by Frank Gregorsky. which is a Republican study committee study that looks back at the record of 14 years of some Members of this body. projecting what would happen in foreign policy and then what happened in reality. Now let me be just as blunt and straightforward as I can. because I think this is where the Speaker was totally unfair yesterday and what we are seeing comes all too close to resembling a McCarthyism of the left.

While there are certain provisions contained in the House version I find more acceptable. I believe this document represents a good example of what a true compromise should be. Specifically. however. I would like to praise the conferees for adopting report language that is identical in intent to legislation I introduced earlier this year. The report reads as follows: In view of the broad interpretation which was clearly intended by the framers of this provision. the conferees believe that there is no merit in the argument that has been raised in at least one State that an individual is immune to wage withholding for the enforcement of child support obligations on the grounds that the private company for which he is working is operating on Federal land. By way of background. voters in Texas overwhelmingly expressed their support for a change in State law which would permit the garnishment of wages for delinquent child support payments. One large company in Fort Worth. TX. General Dynamics. refused to comply with the State law on the grounds that the company was located in a Federal enclave. According to official company statements. General Dynamics was not necessary opposed to the State law. but was instead concerned that an employee might sue if they did indeed withhold wages. A lower court held that General Dynamics was not exempt from State law. but General Dynamics indicated it would appeal the decision. The conference report language makes clear congressional intent that the findings of the decision are correct. The language will negate the necessity for the taxpayers of my home county to shoulder the expense of defending the decision in a court of appeals. Then. too. General Dynamics will also be spared the cost of an appeal and its fears of an employee suit will be removed. Again. I thank all the conferees for their cooperation with my office and their responsiveness to our concerns. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of the conference agreement. and I hope the President will quickly sign this measure into law. Thank you.e",

The ADA for 125 years has dedicated its resources and talents to the scientific advancement of oral health care through ongoing research. The Nations dental schools are all accredited by the American Dental Association. and no other country in the world enjoys a level of excellence in dental education as does the United States.

Mr. Speaker. the current President of the American Dental Association. Dr. Donald E. Bentley of Hawley. MI. is from my district.

I experienced a wholesome quality of life and can remember the residents great sense of pride in their town and its interesting history. The little village. once called Salzburg. was given its present name of Emmaus by Bishop Spangenberg of the Moravian Church during celebration of the Love Feast on April 3. 1761. The American Revolution brought new tribulations and a great deal of hardship to the residents of Emmaus. The Moravians who refused to fight in the American Revolution were harassed. fined. and even imprisoned. During this time of persecution. the Moravian community survived these adversities by standing together. The congregational village grew very slowly because the young people decided to leave rather than endure its austere religious life. In 1829. Moravian Church roles numbered only 131. but as the decade passed. the city of Emmaus opened its once closed village as the church council began to sell land to nonMoravians. This sale of land to nonMoravians signaled religious moderation by the Moravian settlers. One of the largest churches to organize in the town was the United Evangelical Church. which was the forerunner of a great number of churches found in the borough today. During the last half of the 19th century. railroad builders reached Enmaus. and the first train passed through the village in the spring of 1859. This same year. Emmaus organized into a borough. and the first local officials were elected on October",

In 1978. he immigrated to the United States with the understanding that under the Helsinki agreement which the Soviet Union signed and the United States signed. his family would be able to join him. Unfortunately. that has not been the case. He has never seen his young son. The unnecessary pain that this has caused this one family should be resolved by the Soviet Union and the United States as quickly as possible. I urge the Soviet officials who want to see some humanitarian gestures of friendship between our countries to do what they can to see that this family is reunited. and I urge American officials who meet with the Soviet Union to bring up the case of Simon Levin and his family.9",

One of these refuseniks is Josef Begun. a Soviet Jewish activist charged and sentenced earlier this year to a forcedlabor camp for attempting to teach Hebrew. When Mr. Beguns case was first brought to my attention by children attending the school at Congregation Mshkan Israel in Hamden. CT. I pledged to work in any way possible on Mr. Beguns behalf. I adopted Mr. Begun as part of the 98th class for Soviet Jewrys adoption program and have since written numerous letters to the Soviet Government protesting his treatment and asking that he be granted an exit visa. On August 1. 1984. I learned that Mr. Begun had been placed in the camps hospital at the Perm Camp Complex in the Ural Mountains. where winter temperatures sink to 45\" below zero. Camp authorities have provided no explanation why this latest action was taken and his family has been refused permission to see him. Josef Begun is only one of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who are in similarly desperate situations and who need our help.

The vast majority of polarizing material used by U.S. liquid crystal display manufacturers is imported from the Par East. As a consequence. it is difficult for U.S. producers of liquid crystal displays to compete with foreign manufacturers. who benefit from the low tariff on the finished product in comparison to the high tariff on the polarizing material.

Its value stems principally from its design and specifically from its hydrodynamic shape. Though it has been mothballed for several years in Philadelphia. it continues to benefit our Nation because many of our nuclear submarines now in service feature aspects of the Albacores design. It was an important prototype. On September 22. the Secretary of the Navy informed the appropriate congressional committees of the Navys intention to transfer the U.S.S. Albacore to the Albacore Memorial Association. and subsequently to the Port of Portsmouth Maritime Museum. However. as Congressman NORMAN DAmouxs noted on September 22. existing law mandates that after such notification 60 days must elapse before the Navy can effect the transfer. This period is meant to provide Congress with an opportunity to determine if the transfer of defense property is in the national interest. The bill introduced by Congressman DAMouRs on September 22 and the corresponding Senate bill introduced by Senators HUMPHREY and RUDMAN on October 7 will eliminate the 60day period for congressional review. In this instance. an extended period for review is unnecessary. The committees have already examined the transfer proposal and have deemed it to be acceptable.

Mr. Joseph A. Califano. Jr.. Mr. Dean Sloane and others to discuss with you and Dr. Donald Young. the Health Care Financing Administrations Medicare coverage and reimbursement policy for cardiac rehabilitation services. We also discussed the need for continuous telemetric monitoring of patients during cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions. I understood at the conclusion of the meeting that Dr. Young and his staff would review this matter in order to recommend to you whether changes should be made in the level of Medicare reimbursement for these services. I am writing to inquire about the progress of this review. It has been three months since our meeting. and I have now been informed that reimbursement levels in parts of the Nation have been set so low that cardiac rehabilitation services may not continue to be offered to any Medicare patientslet alone the higher risk patients we discussed at our July meeting. In fact. I have been told that in parts of some states. such as Florida. Medicare Part B reimbursement ceilings have been set that would permit only between twenty and thirty dollars per routine patient visit in freestanding cardiac rehabilitation clinics. This is simply too low for programs that offer quality services to survive. It would be a tragedy if Medicares reimbursement levels had the result of making cardiac rehabilitation unavailable to Medicare beneficiaries. I urge you to accelerate Medicares national review so that reimbursement levels can be set nationally at a more reasonable level. If the national review cannot be concluded immediately. I urge you to take immediate interim action to review and correct any unreasonably low reimbursement levels that occur in individual states such as Florida. pending completion of the national review. As you know. I personally enjoyed seeing you on July 1. and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Sincerely.",

This shipment alone is appalling. but what is even more astounding is that it is the second shipment in 1 month from the Soviet Unionthe first occurring on September 2. 1 day after the destruction of the Korean airliner by the U.S.S.R. On September 22. I wrote President Reagan asking him to halt the importation of these Soviet goods and that he act on a 2yearold petition filed by the domestic ferroalloys industry asking for a determination on whether ferroalloy imports threaten our national security under section 232 of the Trade Act. This action is imperative. in my view. to send more than signals to the Soviets that they will suffer a real penalty for their disregard of human life. At the same time. prompt action on the petition is necessary to help revive our domestic industry.

The U.S. ferroalloys industry is currently operating at only 34 percent capacity. down from 79 percent in 1979. The industry employs 2.200 workers. down from 8.000 in 1979. Import competition has captured over 50 percent of the domestic market in recent years. Imports are now at 58 percent of the domestic market. It seems clearly wrong for the administration to continue to tolerate this high level of imports of such a critical national security commodity and let our U.S. industries further sink into decline. I would like to share with my colleagues the following letter to the President urging that he ban these imports and that he act on the petition filed by the U.S. ferroalloys industry.",

    "speech": "The White House. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I was appalled to learn from news reports on September 2. one day after the horrendous destruction of the Korean civilian airliner. that the Soviet Union has shipped 5.365 tons of ferrosilicon for sale in the United States and that this sale may be the beginning of a planned market penetration of 50.000 tons over the next two and onehalf years. I am writing to strongly urge that you ban these imports from the Soviet Union immediately and that you take prompt action on the petition filed by the U.S. ferroalloys industry two years ago. I believe that these actions would be a strong and appropriate response to the unforgiveable downing of the Korean airliner. As you know. ferroalloys are critical to our national defense and industrial strength as essential ingredients of steel and aluminum. Two years ago the domestic ferroalloy industry asked the government to determine whether imports of ferroalloys at over 60 percent pose a threat to our national security and to take appropriate actions as authorized under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It is incredible to me that the United States condones this sale after the destruction of the airliner and at a time when our domestic ferroalloy industry is operating at 34 percent of capacity. To let the Soviets capture part of our market not only gives them an unjustified share of U.S. sales and dollars. it further saps the strength of our own industry whose furnaces should be maintained so that we can meet our national security needs. We cannot depend on foreign sources for such a vital material. I urge you to act promptly and decisively to preserve our domestic capability and to indicate Americans strong disapproval of the Soviets inhumane actions in killing of 269 people. Sincerely.",

Watkins. Chief of Naval Operations in his formal remarks placed the need for such an organization in a very succinct manner when he said: We have a growing dependence on space systems. Our Navy is the largest tactical user of spacebased systems today. Over 85 percent of all direct satellite signal intelligence output. provided to our Armed Forces. is solely for use by the Navy. and the transit navigation satellite provides the primary means of navigation for all combatant ships. and this will soon be followed by the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System Satellite. Providing other invaluable services. fleet satellite communication system satellites are the umbilical for our farflung naval forces. Only a few days ago. as Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I communcated from my quarters. in the middle of the night. with our marine peace keepers on the ground in their foxholes near the Beirut airport. This proved to me the incredible value of our capabilities in space for immediate command and control linkages so vital to the decisionmaking process. Defense meteorological support program satellites are vital to the safe routing of our ships. and weather information. crucial to successfully conducting our various warfare missions. is also provided by satellites. No matter if it is communications. navigation. meteorology. oceanographics. or surveillance. the satellite support we receive ensures we can fight. win. and return home safely. If we think space. continue to learn how to use space. we in the Navy can help build for our nation that winning Navy this great island nation will always require. The event we mark today. establishment of our Naval Space Command. will provide that necessary focus. This is not a revolutionary event. but an evolutionary one. This is not a start. but a continuation. We seek to consolidate our Navys disparate space efforts into a cohesive program. which supports our maritime strategy and mission of sea power. Putting our Navy spacerelated functions under a single commander will not only strengthen operational control. and provide necessary focus for our Navys oper-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as you know. I have long been concerned with the Office of Personnel Managements (OPM) interpretation of the early retirement6(c)-provislon in regard to customs and immigration inspectors. Two years ago. OPM delegated a special task force to study this situation. Among the duty stations visited by this task force was the port of entry at Blaine. Wash.. in my district. I was present for this conference. and the testimony of the customs and immigration personnel and their wives convinced me more than ever that in order to perform their duties. inspectors must act as. and must undergo the same stresses as. other Federal law enforcement officers. Also. the American public is entitled to a young and vigorous work force to protect the integrity of our borders and to insure the vigilant and energetic enforcement of our Nations laws. Including inspectors under the early retirement provision of civil service retirement will allow this needed recruitment of young and able customs and immigration inspectors. In a letter to me. OPM Director Donald J. Devine acknowledged the dangers existence of this problem: The points you have made on the difficulties and dangers faced by our customs inspectors are very well taken. This aspect of their work is. I believe. well documented in our report of last years onsite tour of several portsofentry. Unfortunately. the inspectors do not fit into the rather narrow definition of a law enforcement officer found in the statute. I believe the facts speak for themselves in this matter: First. customs inspectors make on the order of 3.000 arrests a year. more than half of them on information from the FBIs National Crime Information Center (NCIC). The FBI states that customs inspectors make more NCIC arrests than all other Federal agencies combined. And all of them are felony arrests. Second. immigration inspectors have lead responsibility for screening individuals entering the country. Last year. 533.063 inadmissable aliens were intercepted at ports of entry. Many aliens used fraudulent or counterfeit documents. This is an increasingly volatile situation. and violence and arrest resistance is a constant threat to inspectors. Today. I am joining with 15 of my colleagues in introducing an amendment to title 5. USC. to Include customs and immigration inspectors within the early retirement provisions of the civil service retirement system. I recommend this legislation to the Members of the House.o",

Entomology has become a major area of study. with research being conducted in every State at colleges. universities. and research centers across the country.

And then they did live ABM firings. So that test clearly confirms what we believe the Soviet doctrine isto try to take to the extent possible pos-. session of the high ground. which is in this case space. and start out any first strike against the United States by blinding us. silencing us. and making it impossible for us to communicate. to listen. and to transmit. Of course. I think the implications in that are ominous. indeed. and what the gentleman is suggesting. I think. without the development of this type of capability is that the Soviets would be free to launch that kind of first strike against us. and in addition to that also keep all their satellite capabilities intact. which to me indicates an intolerable situation in which our capabilities of responding are going to be severely constrained. if not totally eliminated. If. indeed. that is the case. and my conclusions about that are correct. what we are doing is moving away from deterrence. because we are making it much more attractive for the Soviet Union to contemplate a first strike and it seems to me it is incumbent upon this body to do all that it is possible to do to deter that kind of a temptation from ever coming to pass.

I think. the lines of the gentlemans thinking in that it does transfer those shuttles that it has committed to the Department of Defense to indeed the Department of Defense in terms of a space command. on the assumption that NASA is spending 60 percent of its R&D money today on the shuttle. and that it needs to be doing other things. and that the way to cure that problem is. of course. not to take $19 million out of this authorization bill but. in fact. take a tremendous operational expense associated with the shuttle and transfer it to another place and leave that money remaining to NASA to pursue other things such as the space station that the gentleman eloquently pointed out needs to be done on an expedited basis.",

I think he is one of those who is most concerned and has done the most to see this country develop a really significant space program for the benefit of all of the people of this country. Here I am quoting from the original NASA Act. the program was intended to be for the benefit of all of the people of this country. The gentleman has correctly recognized that a space station in near Earth orbit. inhabitable. manned with all of the things that could be done there. is our next major opportunity in space. I commend him also for pointing out what the drain is on NASAs budget from the shuttle. which he proposes to alleviate and the DOD has already initiated steps to take over a portion of that funding into their own budget. I think that is commendable and I welcome that. I hope the gentleman was not saying that this little. old. tiny $19 million is going to make the difference on the space station. I pointed out to the gentleman that this is $19 million this year and that next year the Air Force says they want $200 million. and the year after. several hundred million more. shooting for that $3.6 billion that they say will give them the system by 1987. but which will not. We will end up pouring enough to build three space stations into this program if we are not extremely careful. That is the thing that I want to avoid. because when we do spend the money for three space stations. and when we have the system deployed in 1995. do you know what? It is obsolete. It is obsolete. because the Russians are already working on their laser capability in maneuverable space vehicles and targeting capability which can knock them out. So you want to put $10 billion into a system that will be obsolete before it is completed. and when it is completed can accomplish 25 percent of the mission. I do not think you want to be that.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment to delete fiscal year 1984 funding for the advance procurement of miniature. airlaunched antisatellite weapons. or ASAT. An American ASAT is needed to counter similar efforts by the Soviet Union to develop and deploy antisatellite weapons. In fact. the Soviets already have an operational system which has the capability to engage loworbiting U.S. space systems. And future improvements of the Soviet ASAT could eventually threaten American spacebased systems which play a crucial role in the defense of our country. Our failure to respond to this threat by not deploying our own ASAT system could. in my view. pose a serious threat to our national security. I realize that this amendment seeks only to strike procurement funding from the bill. and would leave money in place to continue research and development of the ASAT program. Still. no part of the ASAT program can be discontinued while the Soviets continue to pursue their efforts so vigorously. The continued deployment. testing. and procurement in our ASAT program does not mean that we should not try to limit. if not end altogether. the deployment of these space systems. The Soviet Union and the United States should resume negotiations on the entire question of limiting outer space weapons. Accordingly. I have joined a number of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation urging the President to resume bilateral talks with the Soviets for the purpose of negotiating a comprehensive treaty on this matter. However. these negotiations may take a long time and may not immediately be successful. In the interim. delaying any part of the ASAT program while the Soviets continue to refine and improve their antisatellite capability would leave our spacebased systems in a vulnerable position. The entire ASAT program is vital to our deterrent and we should proceed along with it on schedule. until an actual agreement with the Soviet Union has been signed. Therefore. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.",

Far from ending the threat of nuclear war. it introduces new threats. Weapons that have not yet been developed are the very ones that ought to be outlawed by treaty. It is far easier to negotiate agreements before a new kind of arms race has started. than after each side fears that the other is ahead and begins a massive deployment. The Soviet Union. in 1981. proposed a treaty to ban \"weapons of any kind in outer space.\" Should we not seize this opportunity rather than push for a new arms race? We must keep ourselves from spending billions of dollars a year for something which we can easily halt now. I urge my collegues to support the Brown. Moakley.

Even though S. 1660 came out of committee by a vote of 15 to 2. I fear that very few Members of this body understand the full impact of the bill. All of us can. of course. support the concept of universal telephone service. We are blessed with what is obviously the best phone system anywhere in the world. How we achieve the goal of universal service in the face of the breakup of AT&T is a critical question. Hurried acceptance of the solution offered S. 1660 means. it seems to me. accepting a very dangerous course of action. especially since higher telephone bills are going to be the net result. It is a mistake to be moving so swiftly. To move precipitously on a bill which has received only cursory attention over a period of only a few weeks will compound the problem. The Federal Communications Commission has been working on this problem for several years. Against this background. no piece of legislation created in a matter of weeks can properly address the complex issues involved in guaranteeing universal service. Mr. President.

An understanding of Mr. Watts background. ideology. and intolerance can lead the thoughtful reader only to a determination that his attacks on those with whom he disagrees. and his contempt for those who differ from him. are not an aberration. but are consistent with his character and personality. The primary reason that the Secretary should be removed from his position is neither his policy nor his language. but is his intolerance and unwillingness to consider as rational or patriotic Americans with whom he disagrees. In my opinion. a substantial number of changes in the policies of the Department of the Interior were in order in 1981. It was. and is. necessary to reach an appropriate balance among pressures for development. for energy independence. for more and better jobs in a growing economy. and the urgent necessity to preserve and protect our national lands and heritage.

The U.S. Constitution wisely provides that Congress alone can declare war. That makes it difficult to go to war and it should be difficult. If the President feels that we should go to war he can recommend that course but I have not heard that he wishes to do so. It is neither illegal nor improper for the United States to assist a friendly nation with arms and finance but what is prohibited by this resolution is an act of war without a declaration of war. and that is contrary to the U.S. Constitution. as well as violation of our treaties and our statutory law.

There have been a number of references to votes in other places as evidence of bipartisan support of this resolution. Let me disabuse you of this idea. The fact that Members of both parties voted for this language in some other place is not proof of bipartisanship. It is only proof that if you come up with something that has no meaning. creates no policy. changes no facts. alters no programs. and offers no direction. you can either vote for it or not vote for it. Who cares? So what if some people voted for this resolution. I could make the case that they did so not because they thought the resolution had substance but precisely because they knew it had no substance. In short. Mr. Speaker. we only have yet another example of this old truth: If you offer people something that neither changes reality or offers new directions. they treat it with amused contempt. Here. in the House. we take these things more seriously.

An effort has been made throughout the day and I believe that it will be a fruitful one. to arrive at the arrangement whereby the legislative needs of the government in El Salvador and of the administration in providing assistance to that Government for emergency and humanitarian aid as well as for the needed ammunition and stores of supplies that are required on an emergency basis. may be satisfied during the period of our absence on the Easter home district work period. The administration in discussions and negotiations which have included Chairman LONG and Under Secretary Schneider and others. has agreed that it is technically feasible and possible to submit a reprograming request for funds in the approximate amount of some $32 million for El Salvador. providing that various suggestions be agreed to. And so we are in a situation where the administration wishes. and we believe that it will. it -an submit a reprograming request so that the needed emergency funds for El Salvador can and will be provided through established committee procedures and then upon resuming the sessions of Congress. after the Easter period. other issues involved in the conference committee may be considered in the resumption of conference committee situations.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I think the gentleman makes a very strong point here and I want to go back to it. because it is crucial. If in fact it matters to the United States that El Salvador be free. then we have to face the fact that there is no case since World War II in which the Western free world has successfully defeated communism. as long as there is a neighboring country which is able to harbor the guerrillas. When we were able to defeat the Communists in Greece. it was because Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and Albania cut off their supplies. When we were able to defeat the Communists ultimately in Malaya. it was because they could not get any supplies. When you look at the case. for example. of South Vietnam. it is impossible when there is a sanctuary to defeat guerrillas. We are now faced with a situation in which there is now. for all practical purposes. a Communist force on the Central American land: Nicaragua. That Communist force is determined to export revolution. If we try simply to defend freedom in El Salvador we will fail. It is impossible to defeat a Communist guerrilla movement as long as it can receive weapons and training and directions from a neighboring sanctuary. One of the lessons in Vietnam was that when we finally mined Haiphong Harbor in 1972 it had a tremendous impact on the North Vietnamese Government and led directly to the peace negotiations. because we were strangling them at the source of their supplies. I would point out that the mines we are talking about here tonight are nonlethal. They do not kill people. They are small. They are the puniest. the weakest weapon that you could use to scare people. Our liberal friends who talk about compassion and who talk about avoiding any kind of harm to human beings are saying. seemingly with a straight face. that while it was all right to provide millions of dollars in aid to the freedom fighters who would use it on land to kill people. that putting mines in the water that would scare peoplethey were too small to kill anyone. they were too small to sink ships. but they were very effectively choking off the flow of Communist supplies into Nicaragua by scaring them.",

If you want to kill a soldier. if you want to take a weapon from a soldier on a jungle trail. you have to kill him. It is kind of a messy business. There is no easy alternative. In fact. the much more humane alternative is to stop those arms from coming in to deter those nations who would bring arms to Nicaragua. You know. I am reminded of a time when we conducted the war in Vietnam. when we had a number of nations in this world who were receiving American aid. They were receiving foreign aid from this country and yet they persisted in selling arms to the people. to the North Vietnamese who were using those arms to kill Americans. I always thought that policy did not make sense. Perhaps for some of our Democratic friends they have explained why that is a perfectly rational policy. When I was in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971 it just did not make any sense that we would allow nations who were supposedly friends of the United States to sell equipment to our adversaries that would be used to kill our young men and we would continue to give foreign aid to those nations. Some of my colleagues have made it very clear why that is apparently a rational thing to do.

I am in gratitude to our two helpful leaders. for all the courtesies extended to me and for the companionship with which we work on historic Capitol Hill. I say to the majority leader. I hope not too deep into the session we will come to grips with this problem. At the proper time I will reintroduce a Senate rules change to require Senators to vote from their desks. Our desks are intended to be used as we transact our duties in this Chamber. If television comes to this body. as the able majority leader has advocated. the Members. I am sure. .will be speaking from their desks as they discuss issues. not in the aisles or in the well. I call attention to this subject at the beginning because I look on this as not just another day. I look on it as a new day. as we convene this important legislative body for the 98th time during the history of our Republic. For that reason. I hope that. in the proper way. under the rules of the Senate. of course. this will not be relegated to the back burner. It is hoped that we may reverse the fivevote loss in the past Congress and be successful. not for myself but for the Senate. in the 98th Congress.",

The risks posed by these individuals are simply incalculable. We know about the failures of our computer equipment. Over an 18month period. the North American Defense Command had 151 computer false alarms with one that actually put U.S. forces on alert for 6 minutes. But the risk flowing simply from human nature and that relatively widespread contact thousands of individuals have in the United States and U.S.S.R. with nuclear weapons may be the most significant element of all in the nuclear equation. We so often overlook the obvious when it comes to discussing nuclear strategy or nuclear proliferation. While it is true that proliferation is the most important issue facing the world. it may be equally true that human fallibility represents an equal threat to survival. Terrorists and madmen capture our imagination. We can clearly envison the use of nuclear weapons in the Middle East or North Africa. We know the potential for warfare that exists between nations in conflict in Latin America or South Asia. But how about the everyday reality of some individual in a rearranged state either here or abroad being the catalyst for a nuclear incident. With some 3.000 individuals in the United States alone presenting a security risk while working around nuclear weapons. the number worldwide must be over 10.000 annually. And this represents the success ratethose removed from contact from nuclear weapons. How about those who are not discovered? Mr. President. with our concentration on exotic weaponry. it is critically important that we not overlook the importance of tightening up the screening and reviewing process for those with access to nuclear weaponry. It would be the supreme irony if the United States and U.S.S.R. reached some arms control agreement only to have a nuclear war started for some reason totally unrelated to national interests.

The Soviets could misinterpret NATO intentions and fire nuclear weapons of their own. And while NATO battlefield commanders are not supposed to have authority to use nuclear weapons. who knows what might happen in the turmoil of battle? The spread of nuclear weapons to nations beyond the five that already have them poses other obvious threats of accidental war. since that would mean more such weapons in more hands. perhaps with less sophisticated human and technological controls. The Reagan Administration. unfortunately. has shown a distinct lack of interest in the problems of proliferation to other nations. And while Mr. Reagan has recognized the necessity to improve American command and control facilities. and his Administration has been studying some sort of joint operations with the Soviets to guard against mishap and misunderstanding. his planned nuclear buildup. including the huge new MX missile. actually increases the risk of accidental war. The best immediate safeguards against such a disaster would be the ratification of SALT II. which Mr. Reagan says hes observing anyway. completion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty thats been largely worked out with the Soviet Union. and. if obtainable. a verifiable SovietAmerican freeze on the production and deployment of more nuclear weapons on either side.

These men were victims of Stalins systematic campaign to eliminate Jews in the Soviet Union. The murdered intellectuals were deemed \"Enemies of the State\" by the Soviet authorities simply because they were Jewish. The Soviet Jewish cultural community experienced a profound sense of grief and sadness because of the senseless and barbaric deaths of many gifted Jewish thinkers and writers. This purge resulted in a smothering of Jewish culture for years to come. Before these despicable murders occurred. other Jewish intellectuals were arrested by the Soviet secret police. They were exiled. deemed social misfits or sent to labor camps where most died. These people were attacked by the government because they were Jewish. The 32d anniversary of the \"The Night of the Murdered Poets\" reminds one of the terrible crime of genocide and the importance of preventing further atrocities by reaffirming our enduring commitment to human rights. Oddly. though. the United States does not consider genocide a crime. In our refusal to ratify the Genocide Convention of 1948. we also refuse to join all the developed nations of the world in declaring genocide a despicable. barbaric. and illegal crime against humanity. The United States must denounce the crime of genocide by ratifying the Genocide Convention. The U.S. Senate is the only body with the jurisdiction to ratify the treaty.

    "speech": "Mr. President. prior to the August recess. it was brought to my attention that certain provisions of S. 979. the Export Administration Act Amendments of 1983. could be interpreted to lift the foreign policy controls over export of U.S. origin crimecontrol equipment to countries whose human rights practices do not accord with standards acceptable to our Government. Section 6 (g)(3) would provide that the issuance of export licenses for items controlled for foreign policy purposes would be permitted if we had failed to negotiate successfully for elimination of foreign availability of those items. This could appear to include crime control and detection equipment. as dealt with in section 6(j) of the act. Human rights criteria for crime control licensing have always been understood. in the executive branch. the Congress. and the human rights organizations. as an important part of Americas commitment to human rights. Foreign availability is not relevant to the foreign policy purpose for which section 6(j) is intended. The controls on crime control and detection equipment are designed to dissociate the U.S. Government from abhorrent practices of other governments and to reinforce the commitment of the U.S. Government to internationally recognized human rights. Availability from other countries should not affect the principled stand of the United States. Because these objectives of foreign policy controls have been central to our efforts to improve human rights. it is important that our intent be made unmistakably clear in this bill. This clarification could be accomplished by my amendment to exempt license applications for such equhment from a finding of foreign availability. However. I am willing to accede to my Banking Committee colleagues in return for their strong and unequivocal assurance on this floor that this section is not intended to permit or authorize approval of licenses for export of crime control and detection equipment if that same or equivalent equipment can be obtained from foreign sources. Simply put. foreign availability shall not be a consideration. Rather. the continuing basis for reviewing and licensing of crime control equipment shall bethe human rights record of the country to which such equipment may be exported. If you will assure me on these points I consent not to offer my amendment. I also respectfully request. if there is a conference committee report on this bill. that you agree to include this clarification in the record of the conference committee. Thank you. Mr. President.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senator has correctly interpreted the provisions of S. 979 on the foreign availability criteria for foreign policy controls. I am pleased he has raised this highly important issue at this time. He has our strong and unequivocal assurance that the new language of this section is not intended to diminish the effectiveness of current controls on crime control and detection equipment. Export controls on this equipment will continue to be based on a countrys human rights record as provided for in the law. foreign availability would not be a consideration with regard to applications to license such equipment when the purpose of the controls is to separate the United States from unacceptable human rights policies pursued by other nations. which I understand to be the purpose of the crime control provision of section 6. Accordingly. I agree with the Senator that his intention not to offer the amendment will not jeopardize the interpretation of this provision as he has described it. I further pledge our intention to have this understanding reflected in the statement of the managers. should a conference with the other body be required on this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to close a tax loophole which is forcing American taxpayers to subsidize the costs of political lobbying activities. Congress decided long ago that contributions to political action committees (PACs) should not be tax deductible. In addition. it has decided that corporations cannot deduct their grassroots lobbying expenses. and that nonprofit organizations cannot engage in substantial lobbying activities. This is how it should be. The American taxpayer should not be asked to subsidize political lobbying efforts. But unfortunately. enterprising tax lawyers have discovered a method to force the American taxpayer to foot the bill for local ballot referendum fights How does this tax scheme work? In Florida. backers of a referendum to legalize casino gambling have formed a corporation. The corporation will pay for the referendum battle. so instead of individuals making nondeductible contributions to the campaign. they purchase shares of stock in the new corporation. When the campaign is over. the stock will be worthless. so the investors will take a tax loss deduction. To make the scheme sporting the backers of the referendum have even added a reward. In the event the referendum passes. the potential new casino operators will pay the company a fee which in turn will be paid out to shareholders as dividends. Unless we put an end to this scheme now every political action committee will take advantage of this loophole. Corporation after corporation will be formed to finance political lobbying activities. And the American taxpayer will pay the bill. The Tax Code is not an appropriate mechanism through which to subsidize political lobbying activities. And it certainly should not subsidize the proliferation of gambling. My bill would eliminate this abuse by denying the loss deduction for stock in corporations which are established to act like PACs. It will be effective for stock issued. and for losses that occur after today. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill. and an article from the Washington Post. be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am happy to join Senator METZENBAUM in introducing legislation to close a tax loop hole that has the potential of becoming a tax loopchsm. This bill. S. 2349. will deny the ability of corporations functioning as political action committees to pervert the Tax Code to their benefit and to make the American taxpayer subsidize their lobbying efforts. It will refuse their investors the tax breaks they seek through the back door. Under present law it appears that whether these PACs disguised in corporate clothing win or lose their referendum or election. their contributor stockholders suffer no consequences. They just take a deduction for the loss or receive a dividend for the win. This is not a hypothetical loophole. It has already been discovered in Florida as a method to let the taxpayers across the country foot the bill for a local referendum on gambling. Backers of a proposition to establish casino gambling in Florida have formed a corporation to pay the lobbying bills for their referendum fight. Generally. individuals make nondeductible contributions for such campaigns. and usually. the names of the contributors and the amount of the contributions are required by State laws to be disclosed in one way or another. This newly employed tax loophole lets individuals circumvent both disclosure and tax laws and it allows them to purchase shares of stock in ad hoc campaign corporations instead. In the Florida case. when the campaign is over. the stock will be worthless. so the investors will take a tax loss deduction. In the event. however. the referendum passes. the investors will be shareholders and will be entitled to dividends. Mr. President. we must stop this kind of tax abuse at the beginning. Every political action committee will try to take advantage of it. Political action corporations will proliferate. All at the expense of the American taxpayer. And at a time when any loss of revenue is a dangerous drain on the Treasury and an injurious blow to the economy. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2349.e By Mr. QUAYLE:",

I am introducing a resolution that designates March 25. 1984. as \"Greek Independence Day\" and calls upon the President to issue a proclamation asking the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. The anniversary of Greeces War of Independence serves as an important reminder of the high ideals of democracy and freedom upon which both the United States and Greece were founded. It is also an appropriate time to honor the close bonds and ties between the two nations and their peoples. As a Nation that successfully struggled for independence and freedom 45 years earlier. the United States feels a special kinship with the people of Greece. This relationship has further benefited and grown by the priceless contributions that have been made to American culture over the past century by Greek immigrants. For these reasons. I believe that it is both fitting and proper to designate March 25 as \"Greek Independence Day.\" I hope that my colleagues will join with me and support this resolution. Mr. President.

Sadly. the nation of Estonia is illegally occupied by the Soviet Union. As a nation which supports selfdetermination for all people. America should focus international attention on this tragic denial of Estonian sovereignty. In 1920. the young independent Republic of Estonia thwarted an attempted Soviet invasion and enjoyed freedom for 20 years. During that period. democratic institutions thrived. The Republic was stolen from the Estonian people in 1940. Soviet troops occupied Estonia in flagrant violation of its territorial integrity. A Sovietstyled government followed. Domestic political opposition Vas quickly and effectively repressed. and Estonia was incorporated into the growing Soviet empire. The strongest indicator of continuing Estonian opposition to Soviet domination is the refusal of the Estonian people to give up their national. cultural. and religious heritage. Soviet attempts to erode the Estonian national character have not been successful. The Estonian effort to maintain a national identity despite the Soviet takeover should not be underestimated. Today. we recall these events of Estonian history. with the hope that the future will bring brighter days to the brave Estonlans.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on February 24. Estonians throughout the world celebrated the 66th anniversary of their independence. On that day in 1918. the people of Estonia declared their independence from the Russian Empire. In so doing. they initiated a 22year era of selffulfillment. From 1918 until 1940. they attained an exceptionally high educational standard. as well as progress in agriculture and industrial production. During that period. Estonia was an excellent model of what a small country can achieve when it enjoys selfdetermination. In 1940. the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia. and suppressed all cultural. political. and economic freedoms. Most recently. the Soviets have turned Estonia into a military fortress on the Baltic coast. constructing enormous military bases for every kind of warfare. At the end of 1983. there were 122.000 Soviet troops occupying the Estonian homeland. a nation of 1.46 million. This is comparable to having 16.5 million foreign troops stationed on U.S. soil. It is obvious to me that the Estonian spirit lives on and will not be crushed. A new generation of Estonians have grown up: they have not forgotten the suffering of their fathers. nor have they forgotten their fathers dreams. In 1981. a group of Estonian activists circulated a petition calling for a nuclearfree zone for their homeland. In their struggle for peace. they were answered with KGB interrogations. sentencing to labor prison camps. and internal exile. As a people. the Estonians have suffered devastating human and material losses. but they have struggled bravely to retain their culture. their traditions. and most importantly their spirit. This heritage has not been forgotten by Americans of Estonian descent either. for they as well as native Estonians patiently await the day when Estonia will once again be free.e",

It is my understanding that he is putting before the Senate an amendment by which he will cut $2 billion from the 1984 budget for the defense program handled by the Department of Energy. Mr. President. I regret that we did not have an opportunity to discuss this heretofore. but I should like to indicate briefly the following points in opposition: First. our inventory of nuclear weapons today. the socalled nuclear stockpile. is substantially less in total numbers than it was in 1970. Despite the rhetoric that we so often hear about building thousands of nuclear warheads and simply adding them to our stockpile. the facts are that for the past 10 years. for every new weapon that we have built. we have dismantled nearly two older weapons that had previously been in the stockpile. Even today. every time we build a new warhead. an old warhead is destroyed. Second. I am not certain where Senator PRYOR got his figures on the stockpile yield. but I respectfully submit that his figures are inaccurate. According to the information provided to me by the Department of Energy and corroborated by the Department of Defense. the total yield of our stockpile today is only onethird of the yield that existed in the late 1960s. Increases in accuracy and other targeting data have permitted us to refine the newer systems so that we do not need the weapons of large yield that were in our stockpile in the 1960s.",

Our amendment consciously sets ratios between budget authority reductions and outlay reductions over the resolution period which would protect the continued emphasis on maintaining the readiness of our forces. permit a sustained but more moderate pace of force modernization and guard against inevitable raids in future years on readiness because investment programs are locked in by prior year budget authority. In other words. we are establishing a better balance between authority and outlays. also going from 5 percent to 6.5 percent for fiscal year 1984. from 5 percent to 5.5 percent in fiscal year 1985. and to 5 percent in fiscal year 1986. compared to the Budget Committee authority that is now pending.",

The States of Pennsylvania. New York. Delaware. and New Jersey. which are members of the compact. have already enacted legislation approving the removal of the 6percent limit on interest and allowing the Commission to determine the appropriate interest rate for bonds which it issues. The Delaware River Basin Commission is presently considering the construction of several small hydroelectric powerplants for which it hopes to issue bonds in the near future. Due to the energyproducing potential of small hydroelectric units. the Commission has received strong support for these projects. Indeed. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already approved one of the Commissions projects for licensing. Mr. Speaker. I am not aware of any opposition to this measure.

Frank and Rosina Staniszewski. came to this country in 1963. and Scotty joined them here in 1964. They settled in Brockton. MA. with the intention of becoming naturalized American citizens. In 1966 Scotty enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. As he told his mother at the time: \"A country worth living in is a country worth fighting for..\" At that point Scotty was not yet a U.S. citizen. Normally a resident alien who serves in the Armed Forces would receive his citizenship upon being honorably discharged. Scotty served honorably. and achieved the rank of corporal. but he never received the citizenship of the country he loved and fought for. Cpl. Wladyslaw Staniszewski was killed in action on July 7. 1967. in Quang Nam Province.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I strongly support H.R. 960. which would confer citizenship posthumously on U.S. Marine Cpl. Wladyslaw \"Scotty\" Staniszewski. and urge its adoption by the House. For most of us. U.S. citizenship is a gift conferred by birth. It is not something we have to earn and in spite of the tremendous benefits which it conveys. we are rarely called upon to make a direct effort in its maintenance. For some. it becomes something taken for granted and we tend to forget how highly it is prized by millions of people in countries all over the world. Scotty Staniszewski was not born an American citizen. A native of Poland and a national of Great Britain. Corporal Staniszewski came to the United States with his family in 1963. He desperately wanted to become a U.S. citizen and volunteered to serve with the Marine Corps. fully aware of the fact that Marines were at that time fighting and dying in Vietnam. He could have easily avoided those risks. but he chose to demonstrate his fidelity to our country in a most concrete wayby bearing arms in its service. In 1967. less than 3 years after coming to our shores. Corporal Staniszewski was killed in action in Quang Nam. Vietnam. He died a U.S. Marine but not a U.S. citizen. the only U.S. serviceman to die in Vietnam in that status. Today this House can begin the process through which posthumous citizenship can be legislatively conferred on Scotty Staniszewski. In so doing we recognize not only his sacrifice but the love of country which prompted it. By his deeds Corporal Staniszewski won the right to be called an American and it is appropriate that this country. on whose behalf he died. acknowledge that fact. H.R. 960 will accomplish that result. I want to compliment my colleague from Massachusetts Congressman DONNELLY for introducing the bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it. and I commend it to the House. Mr. Speaker. the Springfield Daily News. on August 15 carried an excellent editorial on Corporal Staniszewski. I would like to insert that editorial at this point in the RECORD. [From the Springfield Daily News. Aug. 15. 1984]",

Its been 17 years since a piece of shrapnel killed Corporal Staniszewski while he was serving with the U.S. Marines in South Vietnams Quang Nam Province. \"Scotty.\" as everyone called him. had moved with his parents to Brockton. MA. from Scotland when he was 17. Even though he was a British national. he enlisted in the U.S. Marines just after he turned 19 and was shipped to Vietnam where he was killed in action. He died without his greatest wish being fulfilledAmerican citizenship. It will take a special act of Congress through passage of H.R. 960 to grant Scotty his wish. His parents. who have since become citizens. have carried on a long fight to see this day and they are to be admired for their perseverance. In my view. there is something terribly inconsistent and wrong with a policy which says resident aliens who survive wartime service in the U.S. military are entitled to citizenship upon discharge but those who die forever remain noncitizens. On Memorial Day. we make so much of our appreciation for those who die serving the cause of freedom. Isnt it a bit hypocritical. then. to refute citizenship to those who died for a country they longed to call home? Scotty Staniszewski is an example of a cold bureaucratic policy that fails to consider the love a man had for this Nationa love so strong that he was willing to risk his life for it. Scottys citizenship is what were voting on today. The sad thing is. there have been others that have deserved our vote. too. Im supporting this individual humanitarian action but. beyond that. I hope the Congress will consider legislation which would automatically confer posthumous citizenship on any noncitizen who honorably fought and died for this country.*",

Normally. resident aliens who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces during wartime are granted citizenship upon honorable discharge. Regrettably. Scotty never had this. opportunity.

The Senator said that some of his family had been destroyed. that terrible heartbreaking tragedy that none of us can really understand unless we have had the kind of searing. traumatic. personal experience that the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has gone through. when you think that they were killed not because of any crime they committed or was even alleged against them. They were killed why? Because they were Jewish. because they were Jews. not because they had done anything that would violate the law. They were killed not by a terrorist group or by some mindless drug addict. They were killed by the deliberate. planned program of a government of Adolf Hitler. I wish to commend the distinguished Senator. and I think it is very fitting that he should be managing this bill because it is time that we realize that we are not talking about some vague theory or some treaty that will be put on the shelves and forgotten. This is a protest of the most tangible and real and genuine protest. the most effective protest that we can make against what Hitler did in Germany and against the genocides that have occurred since then. So I thank my good friend from Minnesota for a statement which I hope Senators will consider and dwell on and understand because I say this goes far beyond any technical defense we can make of the treaty or any exposition that we could make of its details. As the Senator said. it has been examined by many. many experts and many administrations and found to be sound. and I thank the Senator.",

It has been 36 years since the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide was transmitted to the U.S. Senate by President Harry Truman. Regrettably. it has taken this Nation over 36 years to ratify this treaty and thereby codify what we know to be this Nations exemplary demonstrated commitment against genocide. Mr. President. it is now time that this Nation deny to the Soviet Unionthe nation with the most abusive record with regard to human rights the world has ever knownthe ability to question the sincerity of our efforts on behalf of the oppressed peoples of the world simply by citing our failure to ratify the Genocide Convention. Although the tragedy of Adolf Hitlers heinous acts against Jews in World War II gave impetus to the formulation of this convention. it is clear that genocide cannot be isolate to any one particular time period ethnic or religious group. Mr. President. genocide occurs today. it is occurring even as we stand here debating the ratification of this treaty. There is nothing theoretical about this ratification exercise. The oppressed people of the world deserve to know that the United States of America stands with them. By ratifying this convention. this body. this country. and its President rise to cry out. \"never again\" against the horror inflicted on Jews in World War II. against the suffering of Mesquito Indians. Ukranians. Poles. and Estoniansindeed on behalf of all peoples who have been persecuted by brutal totalitarian ideologies.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am gratified that the Senate has at long last agreed to turn to consideration of the Genocide Convention. After 35 years. our action is long overdue. and I urge my colleagues to act promptly to ratify the convention. On December 11. 1946. the U.N. General Assembly voted unanimously to declare genocide a crime under international law. Two years later. the General Assembly unanimously approved the text of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. These actions reflected the worlds universal horror and revulsion at the Nazis deliberate and systematic efforts to exterminate the Jewish people. Over the years. the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reviewed the convention on several occasions. On two previous occasions the committee has voted to report the convention favorably. This year the committee voted unanimously to report the convention with the recommendation that the Senate give its advice and consent. At long last. the administration has voiced its support for having the United States join the 95 nations which have already agreed to the convention. There is simply no excuse for the Senate to delay even 1 day longer in joining with the rest of the world to condem this most horrible of crimes. The arguments against ratification or for proposed additional reservations are entirely without merit and can only be viewed as an unconscionable attempt to prevent the Senates action on this critical measure. Nothing in the convention can conceivably override any of the basic protections of the Constitution. for it is well settled that a treaty does not supersede constitutional provisions. The understandings and declarations recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee further underscore this point. The convention makes clear that it is up to the ratifying States to adopt their own implementing legislation. and the Congress will have full opportunity to debate and discuss any further legislation pursuant to this treaty. Mr. President. we owe it to all the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. and all the peoples of the world. to join in condemning the crime of genocide. Thirtyfive years is already too long to wait. We should not delay another day.",

Even if it is a fraction of that. it seems to me that the lives of young Americans are worth this effort. During the debate my distinguished colleague from Idaho. Senator SYMMs. remarked on the 55mileanhour limit and suggested that because it is not adhered to by large numbers of persons in our society we ought to change the law to conform to behavior. I would just say to the Senator that if we start down that course we are embarked on a dangerous path. because none of the criminal laws work to perfection. We have laws against murder and yet murder occurs every day and increases every day. Yet we are not about to repeal the laws against murder. The fact of the matter is. though. that the 55mileanhour limit. although it is imperfect. thousands of people do not honor it precisely. nonetheless. it has had the effect of reducing highway fatalities significantly. and just a few American lives are worth the effort. in my judgment. I repeat my commendation of the two Senators who fought to bring it here. and let us hope that before many more young Americans lose their lives. this Congress and the administration will have the will to act favorably. In conclusion. Mr. President. I wish to commend the President. I have criticized the President on occasion when I have disagreed with him. I commend him for this decision. It is not easy for anyone in public life to reserve his position. especially on such a highly publicized matter. The President has done so.

I strongly support this concept because I believe we have to provide stronger incentives to raise the national drinking age and to make our highways safer. I support this proposal over the Lautenberg amendment because it more accurately represents a real incentive. rather than what I consider to be the more coercive approach of the Lautenberg amendment. It is my belief that the Lautenberg amendment raises serious constitutional questions about States rights in our federal system. To tell the States that they must comply with a Federal mandate or lose their highway funds is nothing short of sheer coercion. On the other hand. I think we can still reach our goal to save lives by providing a real incentive for those who do raise their age limitsproviding them with additional highway funds. Further. I support the HumphreySimpsonSymms proposal because it is tied more closely to the States actual performance in reducing alcoholrelated accidents. rather than simply establishing some arbitrary age standard. That is. it provides the States with real incentives to reduce the number of accidents through tougher enforcement laws. advertising campaigns. and other creative ideas. rather then simply an arbitrary age law that has not proven to guarantee a reduction in traffic accidents. This is a very important and emotionally charged issue. But we must be careful to stay within the limits of the Constitution and allow the States to govern as they see fit. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of this issue. and it is an extremely controversial subject. But I do not believe that it is in the best interests of the public to coerce the States into complying with a Federal mandate in an area that should be left to them to regulate. We can reach our goalmore effectively and constitutionally. I believeby following the HumphreySimpsonSymms proposal to encourage States to raise the drinking age to 21 and to lower the number of alcoholrelated accidents in the manner they deem to be the most effective.",

I think the amendment that we have offered does have the significant incentives. and does provide maximum flexibility through the 1 percent match to address individual States needs. This is really the best method. West Virginia has a lower drinking age than some of the surrounding States. But they solved the problem of young people crossing the State borderrequiring nonresidents to be 21 years old and possess an ID card to drink in the State of West Virginia. We have that same situation in my State. I pointed this out. Idaho could address their problem in the same way. However. if we adopt the Lautenberg approach we are pushing new standards with the big club of big brother and the coercive use of the highway trust fund moneys to withhold fundssome States will lose millions of dollars. Washington State has a 21yearold drinking age. Idaho has a 19yearold drinking age. There are two State universities located 9 miles apartWashington State University and the University of Idaho. It has been quite common knowledge that sometimes students from Washington State come over to Idaho. With peer pressure and added education. there has been a tremendous increase in the number of people in a carpool who will designate one person who has not been drinking to drive back to Washington State University. But the point I am getting at is Washington State has a 2 a.m. bar closing time. Idaho has a 1 a.m. bar closing time. If we are going to mandate 21. why do we stop here? We ought to mandate the time closing for bars so that persons will not decide to cross that State line to finish off the evening. whatever their intentions may be.",

I commend those groups who have helped to raise the awareness of our citizens about what is certainly a major problem facing our society. In response to this problem. the majority of our States have enacted various programs and approaches tailored to their specific needs and designed to reduce the incidence of drunk driving. Harsh penalties. public education. mandatory sentences. and revocation of licenses are some of the approaches that States have chosen in reaction to the problem of drunk driving. The Lautenberg approach of 1984 fails to recognize these efforts. and seeks to override the established balance of federalism that exists between the local. State and Federal governments by threatening those States who would take another approach. Congress is moving to allow \"Big Brother\" in Washington to intrude again with the big stick of Federal dictums to mandate how the States should spend money which is technically the States in the first place. Many concerned Americans have expressed opposition to this approach and have expressed other solutions to drunk driving in newspapers throughout the country. Mr. President.

It is giving us deficits that are three and four times higher than any previous administration. Let us see some action from this administration. This administration had it their way for the last 3 years. Their budgets have passed the House. The Senate is controlled by the Presidents party.

The rosy scenario is that we will have a very. very healthy. robust. rapidly growing economy at a real rate of 4 percent per year. unemployment will drop to 4 percent. and interest rates will plummet to 7 percent and finally down to 5 percent. At the same time. there is a continuous deficit of $180 billion. That is an impossible combination of facts. We cannot have a deficit of $180 billion continuously. forever. and have interest rates dropping to 5 percent.

    "speech": "Mr. President. many of my colleagues were returning to Washington this weekend and may have missed an article in Sundays Washington Post by writer John M. Berry. However. the information contained in the Berry article is of such extraordinary importance that I wanted to bring it to the attention of the Senate quickly. Many of us voted for the deficit reduction package with the reservation that it was too little to even qualify as a downpayment. But it was obvious that it was all that the Congress was willing to do at this time and so we accepted it. even though we supported and voted for more significant measures. The points contained in the Post article are these: The deficit reduction package will not in fact lower the deficit because Its savings will be eaten up by rising interest costs. The increase in interest costs alone. I add emphasis of my own that we are talking not about the total cost of interest. but only about the increase in these costs. will be as large as the total combined costs of Federal welfare payments to the elderly. aid to families with dependent children. and all housing assistance programs. The fundamental problem is not the level of interest rates. but the size of the deficit itself. Each year the Government has to borrow still more to pay the interest due on the money borrowed the year before. This is the Government equivalent of compound interest and is a highly unstable situationa situation in which there is no limit on future interest payments.

The offset of returns of revenue by the Federal Reserve is of diminishing importance because those repayments are rising far more slowly than the total debt. Finally. there was a CBO warning issued in February that \"without change in budget policies. the cost of financing the deficit could become a severe burden. to the point that huge spending cuts or tax increases might be necessary just to prevent an explosive increase in outlays for interest payments.\" There is more to contemplate in this article.

An agreement on a realistic defense spending level must yet be reached and if that is not done the damage. real and perceived. will be great. Many among us seem to be willing to wait until next year to pursue real deficit reduction. At the same time. Mr. President. there is certainly no consensus today on either what a real reduction is or on how it can be achieved in pragmatic terms. If we are unprecedented in our actions and pass a significant reduction package by midsession in 1985. its effects will not be fully felt until 1986 or beyond. Mr. President.

It is almost amazing that we have taken so long to get to this point in our Nations history. where the Government is owed billions of dollars$25 billion in actual loans and $40 billion if you include other obligationsand it is not collected. and we have never authorized the Government to go forward with private counsel in order to collect those funds. One wonddrs how this could be. when everybody is talking about balancing the budget and operating more efficiently and doing business as business does business. How could we get to this point with respect to doctors who are making good incomes. lawyers who are making good incomes. farmers who are in a position to repay. and business people who have made SBA loans to keep themselves afloat. and many otherseven in HUDwithout collections being made? No collections are made because no lawyers are there to bring the suits. and the debtors know that the suits are not going to be brought. As the Senator from New York has pointed out. you cannot expect the U.S. attorney. who is involved in prosecuting criminal cases or major antitrust cases or matters of that nature. to become involved in collecting $400. or $4.000. or even $40.000. or $400.000. So this measure goes in the right direction. It is one of the very positive steps in conducting Government as business might conduct it. more efficiently and more effectively. So I commend the authors of the bill for having introduced it and sponsored it and for bringing it to the floor today. I will shortly offer three amendments and ask for their immediate consideration.

Americans are dying. but who are we at war with? The Druze? The Palestinians? The Lebanese? The Syrians?

The issue is not whether the act itself has been violated. but whether the act should be repealed since it has not worked.

In addition to their outstanding work in the field of veterans affairs. the JWV is also an active member of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. works for the elimination of all types of antiSemitism. bigotry. and discrimination in America. are one of the earliest and most active participants in the struggle for freedom for Soviet Jews. and are strong promoters of closer ties and greater understanding between the United States and Israel.

I think those who serve in our countrys defense. using equipment older than they are. would disagree. Deficits thrive because social spending is uncontrolled and taxes cannot keep pace. We can raise revenues all we want but we will not lower the deficit 1 cent unless we control social spending. From 1976 to 1981. revenues increased by $300 billion or 100 percent. but the Federal debt actually grew $361 billion. It is easy to see how this can happen. when we recall the vote on the 1984 concurrent budget resolution.

However. the first concurrent budget resolution appears to be the first item of importance. and therefore I urge Senators to consider that there may be votes early today. as early perhaps as 9 a.m. Mr. President. at 9 oclock. it is the intention of the leadership on this side to ask the Senate to turn to the consideration of one of two matters. either House Concurrent Resolution 304. which is a resolution of the Senate in respect to Dr. Sakharov on which the yeas and nays have been ordered. or to return to the first concurrent resolution. It is still the hope of the leadership on this side that we can obtain a unanimousconsent agreement on a limitation of time of perhaps 2 hours for the consideration of the first concurrent budget resolution. Mr. President. what I am about to say is in no way meant to be a challenge and certainly not as a threat but simply a statement of fact. Given the facts and circumstances. if we cannot obtain unanimous consent. it would be the intention of the leadership on this side to attempt by motion. as provided under the statute. to set a lesser time than that contemplated as the maximum time for the resolution. I will confer further with the minority leader on this point and. of course. the two managers. But I say this so Members will be aware of the fact that we must face this issue. that there will be votes today. and there may be several votes today.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take a moment to bring my colleagues up to date on events in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan. About April 20. the Soviets began a major offensive north of the capital of Kabul in their seventh attempt to defeat the resistance forces under the command of Ahman Shah Massoud. As I reported to the Senate on May 3. that offensive involved the use of Soviet heavy bombers in brutal attacks on civilian targets. Despite initial reports that the Soviets had destroyed the Massoud forces. we now understand that the Soviets have been unable to engage the Afghan freedom fighters in a major battle. In fact. Afghan resistance forces were able to warn civilians in the area. and have managed to retreat to safety. The Afghan resistance forces themselves have melted into the inner valleys and mountains surrounding the Soviet troops. They wait and watch. picking the moment of attack. Perhaps the best unclassified account of events in Afghanistan comes to us in a recent report from the Far Eastern Economic Review. That report includes mention of statements issued by every political leader of the various factions of the Afghan resistance in the wake of the Soviet offensive in the Panjshir. In response to the Soviet assault. these diverse groups have committed to fighting together to take a heavy toll on the Soviets elsewhere in the country while the main thrust of Soviet military power is concentrated in the area north of Kabul. As the article says. \"The Soviet action in the Panjshir may well be doing more to unify the resistance in Afghanistan than any one Afghan could ever do.\" Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article from the May 10 issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review entitled \"Panjshir Movement\" be printed in the RECORD at this point. along with an article from the Christian Science Monitor of May 10. which reflects the desperation of Soviet leadership over the Afghan question.",

I have often called upon the press to do what can be done to shed light on the war in Afghanistan. but I appreciate that Soviet censorship and the refusal to allow reporters into the country represent formidable barriers to accurate news reporting. Mr. Branigin traveled into occupied Afghanistanright into the war zonesto bring us firsthand news that enriched our knowledge of events in that country. Had he been captured. he might have been taken for a spy and shot by the Soviets. He could have been killed at any time as he traveled with the courageous Afghan freedom fighters. Fortunately. he emerged safely with some excellent insights into the situation which he shared with all of us through his articles. Mr. Branigin has received this years award for distinguished service in foreign correspondence of the Society of Professional Journalists.

I think the answer is this: The fiscal year 1984 total for budget authority in function 150. international affairs. is $21.0 billion. as the Senator stated earlier. That figure included $8.5 billion for the IMF. and there is no request for more IMF funding in fiscal year 1985. The remaining $12.5 billion includes funds for the State Department. the Eximbank. and. as you mentioned. foreign aid. To assume that because in fiscal year 1984 the total without the IMF $8.5 billion is less than the $15.2 billion for fiscal year 1985. and. therefore. there is an increase in foreign aid. is to assume that everything is static in that account. But it is not. There are large areas not controlled by annual appropriations action. The repayment from old loans by the ExportImport Bank and the Departments of Agriculture and Defense are also estimated in this. The actual level of new loans made within the caps established in annual appropriations bills for Eximbank and military trust fund loans may vary. The foreign military sales trust account is not static. It reflects advance payments by foreign nations and actual payment to U.S. contractors. It is in a state of flux and change. and increases by $0.8 billion between fiscal year 1984 and fiscal year 1985. Eximbank goes up by $1.7 billion. even though the appropriations cap is assumed to remain at $3.8 billion. That is the main reason why we have $15.2 billion in fiscal year 1985 budget authority. not the $12.5 billion in the adjusted fiscal year 1984 figure.",

However. we no longer use that in terms of interpreting the law. And the gentleman asked what the reason for my presentation of this might be.

And I believe an amendment to a substitute is in order whether it takes away or adds on to the language of a substitute.",

I would be remiss in my task as manager of House Joint Resolution 13 if I did not try to keep it as near as possible to our original intent and as the resolution has been reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Now my amendment to the substitute merely restores the language of my amendment to the amendment of the gentleman from California as I stated. I must say that it is unfortunate we have become entangled and have spent over an hour and a half on this parliamentary conflict. But the Courter amendment simply combines. as I said. the amendment of the gentleman from California and the amendment to the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin. and. therefore. I am constrained to offer this amendment to the substitute to bring it back to the original amendment. I really do not think any further discussion is required. We know just exactly what is being attempted on both sides. We have debated this issue for an hour and a half. I believe this is long enough. I think we should not utilize any more time on this particular issue. There are some 39 amendments left. Mr. Chairman. I sincerely hope that all of the Members who have proposed amendments will have an opportunity to call them up. So I hope we do not preclude them from having that opportunity by having so much time being utilizedI almost said wastedon a particular amendment of such inconsequential measure as that now being debated.

But insteadI want my colleagues to listen to thiswhat the chairman has offered is an amendment only to strike the reference to nonbinding.

    "speech": "Absolutely. You know. when the students came back and said yes. they were in danger. I had the opportunity to interview one of the students. and I remembered the President being severely criticized for his actions. and I remember that statement. You ask the students. at least the ones that I talked to. and they said you are darn right we were in danger. Let me just relate what was related to me when they were up in the dormitories and they heard the machinegunning in the village. Pretty soon the maintenance people who lived in the village came up to the dormitories and talked to them and said they are killing a lot of people down there. Then the Marxist guards came up and told them that they would be killed if they left the dormitories. Now. I do not think that the person who uttered that statement that you referred to that this was the moral equivalent of invading Duluth. MN. would agree that that was a situation of safety for those students. When the Marxist guards came up armed with AK47s and said. \"You walk out the door. you are dead.\" I think that is pretty serious. Perhaps the most telling statement that they made to me was when they huddled back in the dormitories knowing they would be shot on sight if they left them. if they made an attempt to escape. They started talking about how this could possibly be a recurrence of Iran. Thankfully. because they had a President who was decisive and who acted in the interests of saving American lives. even though he did not know at the time that this would be a politically good thing. This could have been ruinous politically. for the President. But he has to be. besides being a politician. he has to be the President of the United States. He took those actions. he saved those lives. To get back to Mr. Mondale. I know Mr. Mondale made statements initially that were in disfavor of the Presidents action in Grenada. I understood that later on. after he consulted with one fairly knowledgeable Member of the House on the Democrat side that he said. well. really I think perhaps the action was in order. or words to that effect.

Then. it seems to me. I am not certain. but it was at least 10 or 11 months until they finally decided they were going to attempt a rescue mission. So it is about in the same timeframe as Walter Mondale finally deciding that what was done in Grenada was the right thing.

Let me say also that another statement that was made when Maurice Bishop was speaking informally to niembers of the Armed Services Committee. at least to me. was in response to our concern about the airportthe 10.000foot runway that was being constructed by the Cubans on Grenada. Mr. Bishop said. essentially. as I recall. \"No. that airport is simply for importing and exporting our spices. and for our commerce. and it is not intended to be a military airport. Yet. according to the recording of a Central Committee meeting by Leon James. who was the deputy to General Austin. there is a statement in the meeting that is recorded and I quote: \"Airport will be used for Cuban and Soviet military.\" This is what the Grenadians were saying in their private meetings while they were telling American Congressman that it was no sweat. that President Reagan was way off base when he made his assertion on April 27. 1983. that in fact that 10.000foot runway posed a threat to the United States.

Mr. Speaker. they were made at a time when Members of this body. and I think it has been said several times. that sometimes we think that we are 435 Secretaries of State. but Members of this body on October 24. 25. and 26 could not possibly have all the facts at our disposal. So for us to come out and severely criticize our President who is our leader in foreign policy. who has information that others do not have and who acts for all Americans to save and protect American lives and liberty in foreign countries. When he takes this decisive action. important and necessary action to have Members of this Congress to get up and blast the President for that action before they could get all the facts. I think is to do our foreign policy a disservice because you know. although we were able to carry this operation off and it was successful. the time could come. for example. we could have been in a situation where we would have needed the help of Great Britain. for example. or other allies. If we would have needed the help of these allies and they could look over on American television and see Members of Congress blasting the President. and questioning the Presidents judgment. that type of opposition in the early stages when there is no way that they could tell whether or not the President had the proper information. that type of opposition could have curtailed our getting help from our allies. It could have put them off. It could have made them decide not to help us.",

I think a number of these people did come to the floor and did not know the facts. had no idea what was really going on. Had only a passing familiarity with the situation there and made the statements. But you know it is interesting that when they lacked the facts of what was going on they did. as Ambassador Kirkpatrick talked about at the Republican convention. they blame America first. That their first instinct in this instance was to blame not the Grenadians. who were in the process of slaughtering the present government. not the Cubans that were on the island with armed troops. but to blame America first. Their immediate speeches out here blamed this country. blamed the President before they even had the facts at their command. And I think that that is one of the problems with foreign policy analysis that sometimes then we find out later just had no basis in reality at all. What we now find out is there was no reason to blame America for what we were doing. We were doing the right thing not only in terms of protecting the lives of American citizens but in terms of helping to liberate the people of Grenada. As the gentleman points out. that the runway there was designed to turn Grenada into an armed camp and the people of the country were going to suffer as a result. and what we did was absolutely right but the initial reaction of too many Members. I am afraid. of this House. was to blame America first.",

I think he has made some excellent points. and I hope that these documents and the remembrance of the liberation of Grenada on the 24th and 25th of October will give us some lessons. give some lessons to the American news media. for example. when they have leaders from other nations coming up and telling them that they intend to be democratic. that we want to be friendly. that they simply want to be left alone. that they are not in the Soviet camp and Soviet sphere. I think that perhaps this type of revelation. a case history of deception of the American news media as well as the American Congress should lead our news media to be a little more careful. be a little bit sharper in crossexamination. Do not let Mr. DEscoto. the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua. get away with all of his statements. I remember following that gentleman when the President was being chastized for the decision to mine American harbors. I remember following Mr. DEscoto from media place to media place. from studio to studio as he put out his message about how the residents of the United States had done a terrible thing in allowing the mining of the Nicaraguan harbors. Mr. Speaker. within a couple of days of making this tremendous media drive. and every place I went. Mr. DEscotos large black limousine was parked there and he was in telling Americans how they had a bad President. Within a couple of days of his visit we had up here a resolution on the House floor and it whipped through by a fairly large margin. I think even a larger margin in the other body. and I was thinking to myself: My gosh. I wish I could drive legislation through that fast. I would be the most effective legislator in this House. We allowed this person to do this. without questioning him. without crossexamining him. Without looking at some of the actions that have been taken by that country that belie the assertions that they are very peaceloving and do not want to bother the United States and are not a threat to our security.

Mr. Kissinger is a distinguished diplomat who. besides serving as Secretary of State. has served several other administrations in a key advisory capacity and. thus. his perspective on the strategic defense initiative [SDI] is a valuable one. The article indicates that although Mr. Kissinger was initially less than enthusiastic about President Reagans Star Wars speech. he now believes that the \"arms control theory is now at a dead end\" and that \"[a] breakthrough requires reductions of the number of warheads on a scale inconceivable so long as the strategic balance depends entirely on offensive weapons.\" He goes on to discuss the possibility of reducing the level of strategic warheads to a few hundred on both sides and outlines the questions which must be answered to set the stage for such reductions. I recommend the article to my colleagues as a valuable contribution to the debate on strategic nuclear policy which. as Mr. Kissinger notes. has unfortunately characterized \"by sloganeering.\"",
