I dont know whether Senators realize this or not. but he has been getting Senators together on an invitation basis at his office to discuss the problems in agriculture. bringing to the attention of all of us who are interested in that subject some very serious challenges that we face now in terms of trade policy and the other related issues that he has already talked about this afternoon. His comments to the Senate are very helpful as we put in perspective what our challenge is and what our options are for responding to these very real problems in agriculture. Mr. President. I am also happy to be able to advise the Senate that we have reached an agreement with the Democratic leader on the subject of the senseoftheSenate resolution which was offered earlier today and which has been the subject of a good deal of discussion. There has been an agreement to modify the amendment. and I am ready to propound a unanimous consent request with the clearance of both leaders. and it is as follows: I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 p.m. this evening. the Senate proceed to a vote on amendment No. 3127. as modified. offered by the minority leader. I further ask unanimous consent that no seconddegree amendments be in order prior to the vote.",

The amendment. as modified. is as follows: At the appropriate place. insert: Findings: In contrast to our nations generally strong economy. in a number of States. agricultural producers and rural communities are experiencing serious economic hardship. Increased supplies of agricultural commodities in combination with weakened demand have caused prices of numerous farm commodities to decline dramatically. Demand for imported agricultural commodities has fallen in some regions of the world. due in part to world economic conditions. and United States agricultural exports have declined from their record level of $60 billion in 1996. Prolonged periods of weather disasters and crop disease have devastated agricultural producers in a number of States. Certain States experienced declines in personal farm income between 1996 and 1997. June estimates by the Department of Agriculture indicate that net farm income for 1998 will fall to $45.5 billion. down 13 percent from the $52.2 billion for 1996. Total farm debt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion. the highest level since Thousands of farm families are in danger of losing their livelihood and life savings. Now. therefore. it is the sense of the Senate that immediate action by the President and Congress is necessary to respond to the economic hardships facing agricultural producers and their communities.",

We invariably get these budgets. The President invariably sends a budget over. and our subcommittee looks it over. and there is always a bunch of user fees in there. This is about the eighth or ninth straight year that user fees have been included. and the subcommittee never agrees to them. The reason we dont is that the full committee and the Senate would never agree to them either. This amendment is designed to say in the future. dont send those user fees over here unless you are prepared to tell us. in case we dont adopt the user fees. where you are going to find the spending cuts for it or where you are going to find revenue increases.

Senator DODD. to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 1999 agriculture spending bill to correct an oversight which threatens the ability of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to continue its important research activities. The Station has a long and proud history. It happens to be the first state agricultural experiment station in the country. dating from 1875. and also happens to be the only state agricultural experiment station not affiliated with a university. Consequently. it is not eligible to apply for competitive grant funds from the Fund for Rural America or from the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The amendment we offer today makes a minor technical correction to allow the Station to compete for these grants just like every other experiment station across the country. Were not asking for any special consideration here. All we are asking for is an opportunity to compete. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station conducts research on plant pathology. horticulture. biochemistry. genetics. as well as many other sciencebased research projects. It also researches important public health issues. as well. such as Lyme Disease. which is a particular problem in our region. and now. nationwide. This important research should continue. and that is why we have brought this issue to the attention of the Senate today. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

As the Senate began debating the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for FY1999. it came to our attention that the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was not eligible for certain federal grants under the 1996 Farm Bill and the Agricultural Research. Extension and Education Reform Act of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1875 as the first agricultural experiment station in the country. The stations mission is to put science to work for farmers and society. The work of this agriculture experiment station includes research projects on such issues as plant diseases. plant breeding. soil problems. and insects. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is the only state based station not affiliated with a land grant university in the nation. Unfortunately. the way the legislative language is written. this station would be excluded from grants available to every other agricultural experiment station in the country. Therefore. I joined with Senator LIEBERMAN today to offer a technical correction amendment that would remedy this situation. This amendment will allow the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to be eligible for these competitive federal grants. Allowing this station to apply for grants will help our farmers. our citizens and our students who have questions or concerns about such topics as plants. insects. soil and water. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the Appropriations Committee. Senator COCHRAN and the ranking member Senator BUMPERS for their help with this amendment. I hope that this amendment will be approved by the Senate.",

I think we are recognizing today one of the finest people in public service in America in our time. I have known VIc for 30 years. I came to Sacramento as a young. exPeace Corps volunteer looking for work and one of the first staff members I met was a consultant to the committee. VIc FAZIO. Vic was a leader at that time. This is the activism of the 1960s. VIc was always concerned about how we can portray government in the best light. how can we get people to be participatory in this democracy. At the time he had come out of the Coro Foundation. very involved in this idea of internship and the ability to volunteer in learning how government works and how business works. He was instrumental in founding a magazine that could report about government. the California Journal. It is wonderful when you are a founder of a magazine that writes nice things about you. It describes Vic as one of the California delegations most respected members. I think he is one of Californias most respected politicians. because he is the role model for the youth that are around here today. of bright young kids that come into politics. He is the role model for elected officials. whether it is at the State level where he rose to leadership positions very rapidly. served in the legislature. and then came to Congress where he rose to leadership positions in this House. VIC is a naturalborn leader. Of that I think in an era when people are questioning government. when there is a lot of cynicism about whether you ought to participate. we ought to turn in this Nation to Vic FAZIO and say. \"This is the kind of people we want in government and life.\" If you meet him. you will be engaged. So I speak today as a person who has known him a long time and watched him in his early years. He was just as effective in his early years in youth as he is in his senior years here as a Member of Congress.

In 1995. juveniles accounted for 32 percent of robbery arrests. 23 percent of weapons arrests. 15 percent of rape arrests. 13 percent of aggravated assault arrests and 9 percent of arrests for murder. Those are pretty serious statistics. We also realized that we could not begin to build enough jails to try to deal with that issue. and it also would not be very wise to do only that. So today we have before us the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act. It is an important bill which not only supports making juveniles accountable for their actions but which provides funds to States and local communities to design prevention programs to help youths turn their lives around. Again. we allow the flexibility that we need to allow if local entities are going to do the things that have to be done to bring about the prevention as well as handling of the juveniles who we have difficulty turning around. So in this bill we have combined many individual programs. many that were so small that they were totally ineffective. many that were duplicative and. above all. as I indicated. we give an opportunity for the local area to design the programs that they believe will work best for that area.

Originally the bill provided an exception to that mandate for rural areas that I believe did not have enough safeguards. but because of the extreme dangers juveniles face in adult facilities and the bar placed on this practice for kids in metropolitan areas. I have worked with the subcommittee chairman to ensure that the rural exception is used only after great consideration and caution. and only under limited circumstances. In that respect. Mr. Speaker.

Other kids come before the courts who. because of their immaturity. because of lack of proper parental guidance. have done some stupid things. got in trouble with the law. and these kids need to be treated firmly. but they need to be treated fairly and we need to see that they are steered away from a life of crime. Some of the group of kids come before the courts because they have committed status offenses. something that would not be a crime if they were adults. but they are chronic truants. they run away from home. And they do that for a lot of reasons. and the courts need to decide whether this is a child who is simply incorrigible and needs some firmness. or whether this is a kid who is running away from abuse at home and needs to be protected from his or her own parents.

Mr. Speaker. this Congress missed an opportunity to pass a bill that would have controlled and prevented juvenile crime. and voted instead for a misguided. punitive one which ignored input from experts and communities and which sought to employ measures that have been proven not to work in preventing juvenile crime and delinquency. In H.R. 1818 we are given something rare today. another chance to do the right thing. The bill I rise to support today. H.R. 1818. incorporates key programs which we have been implored to implement by a broad crosssection of America. prosecutors. corrections officers. police. community organizations. public health officials. family oriented groups. young people and. most poignantly and convincingly. parents of murdered children. H.R. 1818 contains funding for States and communities to support prevention programs. It provides for research and technical assistance to those communities. It understands and treats children as children and protects them from incarceration with adults. It recognizes that minorities are disproportionately incarcerated and in part funds States based on their initiatives to address this inequity. During debate on H.R. 3. our Republican colleagues said time and time again that they would support this prevention bill when it came to the floor. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 1818. and I urge all of my colleagues. including those on the other side of the aisle who said they would. to vote yes for this bill.

The bill will provide $5 million per year for the next 4 years for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The National Center has done many things that I discovered after the loss of a child to a murder in my district. The National Center uses pictures of missing children and family members to create age progression likenesses to help locate growing children who have been missing for years. It has an international office to work with law enforcement overseas to locate children taken to other nations. Their Internet site has a comprehensive data base of missing children including pictures. That site is hit over a halfmillion times a day. Since its inception in 1984. the National Center has helped recover over 35.000 missing children and reunited them with their families. The stories of these recoveries are absolutely overwhelming. As chairman of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Childrens Caucus. I can assure my colleagues that funding for the National Center is money well spent. I thank the committee for its support and I ask my colleagues to please support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize Mrs. Rosemarie Pecillo Knowlton. For almost 50 years. Rosemarie has dedicated her life to education. She will be sincerely missed after her retirement from Sacred Heart Parish School. At the age of four. Rosemarie asked to attend school with some of her older friends. The principal allowed her to begin. believing it was probably just a \"phase.\" This phase turned into a teaching career. Such was her desire to teach. that immediately after graduating high school. Rosemarie took a teaching position which required her to travel on four modes of public transportation just to commute back and forth. When Rosemarie transferred to a position closer to home. she decided to continue her own formal education by taking night classes at Villanova University. There. she met her future husband. Arthur L. Knowlton. They were married in 1956. As her son. Arthur. Jr.. graduated from high school in 1975. Rosemarie also received her degree from Villanova. Rosemarie never saw teaching as a job that began and ended with morning and afternoon bells. She enriched her students .through forensics. the annual Science Fair. and CCD classes. She also directed the schools music shows. the Parish Living Stations of the Cross. and the Living Rosary. Mr. President. the lives Rosemarie has touched are too numerous to count. She is leaving a legacy of dedication and accomplishment. and her son. Richard. carries on the familys teaching tradition. I ask my colleagues to join me both in congratulating Rosemarie for 46 years of dedication to the children of southeastern Pennsylvania and in extending the Senates best wishes to the Knowltons as Rosemarie retires to devote all of her time to her husband. children. and seven grandchildren.e",

The Democrats again are saying we need to support public education. This is really ironic when we think of the fact that 90 percent of American students attend public school.

They are advocating socalled savings accounts for education that would allow taxfree contributions into private schools. That is not the way we can help American education. The Democrats have a very simple and straightforward approach. We suggest that what we need to do is improve public schools. We need to reduce class size by providing Federal assistance so that we can hire more teachers.

Mr. Chairman. this amendment makes several changes that significantly improve the bill as it was reported out of committee. The changes in the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants are especially important. The overall authorization of such sums and the provision that the program will become a State grant when appropriations reach $250 million mean that the authorizers intend that this be a major teacher initiative. The provision that partnerships involving institutions of higher education and local education agencies receive onethird of the funds means that we will have a \"ground up\" reform not only of teaching but also in the recruitment of teachers. The emphasis on serving school districts with a high level of poverty. low teacher retention rates or a high percentage of teachers teaching outside their specialization means we will be focusing funds on those areas most in need. The new grant program to combat violent crimes against women in college campuses is a very important provision. I commend the gentlewoman from California for her deep commitment to this issue and for her persistence in seeing it through to a most successful conclusion. The loan consolidation provision will give students the ability to consolidate their outstanding loans at a weighted interest rate not to exceed 8.25 percent. While these provisions could be improved. they undoubtedly represent a considerable improvement over current law. We have also significantly improved the faculty retirement provisions. They now enjoy the support of both the college community and organizations representing retired persons.

This is a bipartisan bill and we worked together on a lot of these areas. but It was one amendment that we were not able to accept. Mr. Chairman. we just cannot do everything with a Federal program. According to the Department of Education. more than 550.000 students were enrolled in computer science programs in the 199596 academic year. The current student aid program provides millions of individuals with the opportunity to pursue any field they choose as workforce demands change for different occupations. Students can choose programs as short as 6 months or as long as a Ph.D. States that have shortages in finding employees to fill technical jobs can use funds they match under the State Student Incentive Program which Is currently authorized and appropriated for providing student financial aid programs targeted to those fields. Or. as a last resort. we can do it without the Federal Government. We can do a program like is being done in my district. We have a community college that joined with a city that joined with several industries and put together a program on their own to train employees. I agree wholeheartedly with the gentleman from New York that we should not be importing employees. We should be doing a better job of training them.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this bill wisely brings together State and local officials in a commitment to improving the quality of training for our Nations teachers. I strongly support that effort. My amendment would expand the focus of job development grants to include management training for school superintendents and principals. I believe it is critical for the future of our children that we provide better management training to our school principals and superintendents. because they play a very significant role in the lives of our students. they play a vital role in our public school system in America. Mr. Chairman it is interesting if we look at dozens and dozens of cases of school turnarounds around the country where a school district had essentially the same amount of funds. the same students. the same teachers. and yet from one year to the next over a period of 2 years there was a significant turnaround and improvement of morale and student achievement. The one common bond we find in all of those cases is that there was a strong leader as a principal or as a superintendent that came into that school or district and used all of the many management skills necessary to lead an educational institution. It is no coincidence that corporations provide millions of dollars for management training for their midlevel and upperlevel management personnel. And yet historically our Nation has provided but a pittance for management training of those principals and superintendents who oversee products. our children. far more important than a product of any corporation in this country. Providing professional development opportunities and management training will allow school administrators to improve their skills. Improved management at both the school and district level will have a positive effect on students. teachers and parents. Students will learn more effectively in a positive environment and teachers. like all employees anywhere. are happier and more effective under good leadership and strong management. Better trained administrators will improve the overall quality of our Nations education system. I believe it makes sense to focus on management training in business. and I believe in this bill it will make sense to focus a small amount of resources on management training of our Nations school superintendents and principals. For that reason. I urge the passage of this amendment.",

It takes into account the need for us to complete our work on appropriations bills. and it takes into account the high priority that both parties have put on dealing with this issue. But I must say. for Democrats. that there cannot be a more important issue than the complete and successful conclusion of the debate on managed care and the Patients Bill of Rights. We now have over 170 different organizations that have said they join us in supporting this legislation and recognize the importance of passing it before we leave. All we have left is 6 weeks.

This may be one of the most comprehensive and most complicated medical issues that the Senate will address for a long period of time. It is impossible for us to address it in the way that has been suggested by some on the other side. that we have an upordown vote on two simple bills. There is nothing simple about them. These are very serious questions about holding health insurance companies accountable. about making sure that when a woman has a mastectomy she can be protected. about making absolutely certain that when you go into a pharmacy you have a drug that the doctor prescribed and not something that the health care company prescribed.

I know the doctors who know how to do this and I am going to go and have this operation done.\" The HMO said. \"No. you are not. We have a general surgeon. and the general surgeon can do this operation.\" \"Well. has the general surgeon ever done such an operation before?\" \"No..

Mr. Chairman. my amendment would simply serve as a clarification of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. of which I was a primary sponsor in the 104th Congress. This amendment is necessary due to the Congressional Budget Offices interpretation of an important provision of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in a way that is inconsistent with the intent of Congress. The CBO interpretation has a significant impact on the States. The definition of \"Federal Intergovernmental Mandate\" as drafted under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was specifically intended to include Medicaid and other large entitlement programs and efforts to impose new Medicaid mandates without new flexibility. However. when asked to review the Presidents proposal for a cap on the Federal share of Medicaid spending per beneficiary. CBO determined that the proposal did not contain a mandate as defined by UMRA. the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. According to CBO. this was because States currently have the flexibility to amend their own financial and programmatic responsibilities by reducing some optional services or by choosing not to serve some local optional beneficiaries. This interpretation is at odds with congressional intent. In passing UMRA. Congress intended that the flexibility required under clause (ii) be new flexibility. concomitant with the mandateimposing legislation. for States to amend their responsibilities to provide \"required services\". not optional services. However. because the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. as passed. does not say new flexibility specifically. CBO believes its interpretation is consistent with the law as written. My amendment is supported by Ohio Governor George Voinovich. the National Governors Association. the Council of State Governments. the National Conference of State Legislatures. the National Association of Counties. and the National League of Cities. As a former chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. I recognize the incredible burdens placed on States and localities by unfunded mandates. of which I just spoke during the general debate. and I would urge my colleagues to support this common sense amendment.",

This is also an opportunity to correct a technical problem that we have encountered with the Congressional Budget Offices scoring of State and local mandates. That is why I urge everyone to support the DavisMoran amendment.",

The brief statement that I would like to provide here. Mr. Chairman. states that under section 421(5)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act. Federal entitlement programs such as Medicaid. child nutrition. and foster care are considered unfunded intergovernmental mandates if Congress imposes new conditions. places caps on funding. or cuts funding without giving the States the authority to adjust those changes. Although this was the clear intent of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. the Congressional Budget Office has used a different interpretation which undermines the act. Specifically. CBO contends that UNRAs language does not specify new authority and that States already have sufficient authority or options to adjust to any cut or cap to an entitlement program except for the food stamp program. The DavisMoran amendment clarifies that any funding cut or cap is considered a new mandate unless the States are given new or additional flexibility to adjust their programmatic or financial responsibilities in order to offset the additional mandate costs. I believe it is a very important amendment. and I will clearly support it and urge my colleagues to join in doing the same.",

The committee declined to immunize four witnesses and haul them before his committee. As a past chairman of that committee. I can tell you that what the committee did today was the only course of action they could take. E 2245 My Democratic colleagues were not asking for much. They simply wanted procedures for subpoenas that would give them a chance to object and force a committee vote before such subpoenas could be issued. They were willing to negotiate. but Chairman BURTON was not. I am sorry to say this. but Chairman BURTONS recent actions have discredited the Committee on House Oversight of the Congress. which is supposed to set the example for fair investigative procedure. Never in my tenure as chairman of that committee. not once. did the minority complain that a major investigation was unfair or conducted without their full involvement. Consider the causes for our embarrassment. More than 600 subpoenas have been unilaterally issued. without one of them ever having a committee vote or the involvement of members of the committee. a stubborn and continuing refusal to subpoena any witnesses requested by the Democratic members of the committee. a tasteless decision to release the private conversations between Mr. Hubbell and his wife. that had no connection to the subject matter that the committee was investigating. the misleading editing of the tape transcripts. which should have never been released in the first place. forcing a public rebuke by the Speaker himself for the embarrassment caused to the House of Representatives. and. finally. growing evidence that the committee may be improperly and perhaps illegally coordinating its investigation with that of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. which. by Federal law. is supposed to remain secret. So the failure of the committees investigation carries an important lesson for all of us in Congress: The concerns of every member of a committee. especially an investigative committee. cannot be ignored or shunted aside by procedural maneuvers. I am hopeful that my colleagues will keep these lessons in mind as we move forward from the ashes of the BURTON investigation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in three weeks the gentleman from Oklahoma will try to amend the U.S. Bill of Rights. the sacred document that has served America for well over 200 years. Perhaps the greatest contribution of the American experiment in democracy is our Nations religious freedom. Because of our Bill of Rights. America is not torn by religious wars. In contrast to the religious strife in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. Americans are at peace. In contrast to Islamic fundamentalist states that use government to force religion upon its citizens. Americas Founding Fathers had the wisdom to write a Bill of Rights that separated the power of government from the freedom of religion. These and others are powerful reasons why the Bill of Rights has never been amended in our Nations 207 years. never. never has been amended since the Bill of Rights was adopted 207 years ago. Yet Mr. ISTOOK not only wants to tamper with the Bill of Rights. he wants to rewrite the first 16 words of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. those words that say \"Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Now. Mr. ISTOOK calls his bill the religious freedom amendment. I would suggest that James Madison and our Founding Fathers beat Mr. ISTOOK to the punch by just over 200 years. The real religious freedom amendment is called the First Amendment of our Constitution. I believe Mr. ISTOOKS bill should frankly be called the religious freedom destruction act. It is amazing that some of the same people who do not entrust the Federal Government to deliver our mail want government involved in something as sacred as our childrens and grandchildrens prayers. To change the Bill of Rights for any reason is a grave undertaking. To change it for reasons that simply do not exist is wrong.",

In 1939. Joseph Stalins army captured 15.000 Polish military officers and proceeded to perpetrate what some have called one of the most heinous war crimes in history. These 15.000 people were Polands elite and presented a serious threat to Stalins future control of Poland. Fearing their resistance. Stalin ordered his army to execute the Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. There was no trial. There was no justice for the victims of Stalins excesses. Stalin did this under the cover of a forest and the shield of his authority while hiding it from the international community. The investigation conducted by this Congress found that the victims were unarmed and innocent. It concluded that the crime was concealed by the Soviet government and that its perpetrators were never brought to justice. As the years passed. the Soviet government was content to let the Nazi regime be blamed for Katyn. It avoided issuing a formal apology or attempting to even make reparations. On February 19. 1989. the Soviets finally released documents confirming the Soviet role in the Katyn Massacre. After fifty years of lies and manipulation. an admission of complicity does not ease the pain of a nation whose entire population was affected by this horrible event. I am hopeful that as time goes by and more people learn about this massacre. we will all be able to come to terms with the memory of Katyn and the pain that it has caused.

I rise today to remember these 15.000 victims with the hope that their memory will prevent future atrocities from occurring and will crudely remind the world of Its responsibility to protect the innocent at all times.

Since then. the impact of this pioneering institution has reached far beyond the Appalachian foothills. across the nation and around the globe. Today.

Effective June 30. 1998. after more than three decades of service to Ohio University and the academic community. he will retire. Mr. President. I recognize that journalism training occurs throughout our nation. however. those who rate postsecondary journalism education consistently rank Ohio University among the nations best. Whether its education. or politics or sports. its tough to repeat as champlons. Yet. that is the legacy of Dr. Izard at Ohio University. Year after year. the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism. under his direction. has produced premier writers. editors and public relations practitioners. Like all success stories. there are multiple reasons why the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism excels. Among them: a strong faculty and widespread private support from alumni and industry. E. W. Scripps is a legend in the publishing world. The Scripps partnership with higher education through Ohio University is a national model for private support for public education. This success story includes another key Ingredient. the leadership and professionalism of Dr. Ralph Izard. Involved in academia for 32 years. Dr. Izard never lost his focus on individual students. and he never lost his love of teaching. Thats because he never stopped learning. As technology changed. Dr. Izard kept pace. He insisted journalism education adapt to change. Thus. college training remained relevant to students and the job market. So today. nearly two centuries after those early pioneers founded a university in Athens. Dr. Izard personifies their ideals of higher education by preparing thousands of their sons and daughters for the challenges of a new century.

I rise today to recognize the men and women of the Air National Guards 185th Fighter Wing based out of Sioux City. Iowa. Last week. members of the 185th began a monthlong deployment to Kuwait to assist in the enforcement of the nofly zone over Iraq. Each member of the 185th that is participating in this mission has volunteered for this duty. This nationally recognized group of men and women are among the finest of Americas defenders and Siouxlanders are very proud to be recognized as their home base. The 185th exemplifies the importance of Guard and Reserve units throughout this country in ensuring the readiness of our Nations national defense. They are men and women who unselfishly take time away from their families and their civilian roles in defense of freedom. In addition to the members of the 185th. I would also like to recognize the family members of the men and women who serve in Guard and Reserve units. Many times. the difficulty of their sacrifices of time away from their loved ones is not properly acknowledged. I want those families to know that we are praying for a successful mission for the 185th and for the safe return home of their loved ones. Again. I want to say we are praying for their safe return from Kuwait.",

Committees cook up schemes. if the Speaker approves. the Committee on House Oversight rubber stamps. and money flows. There is no floor debate. no vote. and no accountability. Millions have been disbursed this way. and Republicans are now scheming how to spend the $4 million left in the fund. I have introduced legislation.

HUD considered it to be a \"troubled\" agency. and had given it failing grades since its creation in the 1970s. Within two years of taking over. Mr. Lucas turned things around. Last year. the agency received a 94 percent ratingan A in anyones bookand is now considered one of the top performing housing agencies in both New Jersey and the nation. During his tenure. Mr. Lucas tore down many dilapidated highrise buildings and replaced them with more attractive townhousestyle housing that provides a better quality of life for tenants and improves the neighborhoods that surround it. Mr. Lucas dedication to helping public housing residents achieve selfsufficiency. and his strong commitment to ensuring the safety and viability of our public housing stock. are testament to his qualifications for this position.

Every Senator who is on the floor now joined with us were active participants last Thursday when the Senate of the United States voted 980 to drop the sanctions against Pakistan and India. The Presiding Officer at this moment. the Senator from Kansas. led that dramatic effort to show that this country would stand united and not use food as a tool of foreign policy. Just moments ago the Senator from Kansas and I had calls from the Ambassador of Pakistan. They have tendered an offer now of over a 100millionton purchase from the United States. It is my understanding that they will make an effort at a nearly 300.000tons purchase within the next several months. That is significant. and those tonnages will be purchased from the United States. Our actions here have consequences. If we want to be players in the world market. with and for our producers. we cannot throw up the artificial barrier of politics. We tore that down last Thursday In this instance. and the nations involved are responding. I thank my colleagues.",

Senator ROBERTS of Kansas. All of us agree that it doesnt make any sense at all to use food as a tool of foreign policy and to tell farmers to pay the costs of sanctions. and so on. So I am very pleased that we were able. on a bipartisan basis. to work together to resolve that issue. I think we have done that in an effective way. I am also pleased that the amendment which we have just offered and was accepted and cosponsored by the Senator from Idaho. We have worked with the Senator from Idaho and others. including the Senator from Kansas. Senator ROBERTS. in discussions on a wide range of income issues dealing with family farmers. The reason I sought recognition is just to make one final point. that is. this amendment now becomes part of the agricultural appropriations bill. It then goes from the Senate to a conference with House of Representatives. That is likely. between now and sometime in September. as this agricultural crisis continues to emerge. to occur in a way that may require some changes and some adjustments. We all understand that. But I think this is an enormously important and a helpful first step to say to family farmers who are struggling that we recognize that this is. indeed. a crisis and we want to respond to that crisis. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership. and the Senator from Arkansas for his leadership as well. and I thank my colleague. Senator CONRAD. who is as determined and effective and tough a legislator as there is to work with. I am pleased to have joined him in working on this amendment as well.

The combination of a prolonged lack of rainfall and persistent high temperatures have resulted in a natural disaster of historic proportions. For those affected. damages have been hardhitting. As we debate the 1999 agricultural appropriations bill and amendments to it which respond to severe agricultural distress throughout the nation this year. caused by weatherrelated damages and low commodity prices. I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the situation in Louisiana. On June 18 of this year. Governor M.J. \"Mike\" Foster and Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Bob Odom wrote to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman about the drought in Louisiana. Though adequate production records were not yet available at the time of their letter. Governor Foster and Commissioner Odom told Secretary Glickman substantial losses were expected in the state and that they expected to be requesting a disaster declaration as soon as adequate production information could be obtained. Various row crops and pine and hardwood seedlings have been affected in Louisiana by the drought. they said. Cattle have been affected because of severe hay and pasture shortages. Poultry losses also have occurred due to the high temperatures. Illustrative of the droughts historic character. they pointed out that records have been set for the least amount of rainfall received in the month of May. with rainfall records going back more than 100 years. Though Congressionallyauthorized programs are in place at USDA to respond to disasters. I urge the Senate to be prepared to respond further and promptly as conditions and impacts would worsen. Mr. President. we know that production disruptions brought about by the drought will cause economic disruptions for producers. In addition. the communities in which our producers live also will be affected. It is for these reasons that I urge close attention to crop disasters and low prices and a readiness to act as warranted.",

Mr. VanElslander is wellknown throughout Michigan as the Chairman and CEO of Art Van Furniture. Michigans largest furniture retailer and the sixth largest furniture retailer in the United States. Business success has enabled Mr. VanElslander to pursue his commitment to community service and philanthropy and benefit thousands of people. His involvement with the St. Vincent DePaul Capital Campaign is a prime example of his dedication and commitment. In 1995. just before Christmas. a fire destroyed the St. Vincent DePaul warehouse which served needy residents of the metropolitan Detroit area. The fire led to an outpouring of donations of clothing. bedding and toys from thousands of people in Metro Detroit. With those immediate needs met. thanks to the generosity of the community. the Society of St. Vincent DePaul began a fundraising campaign to meet their longterm needs--replacing the warehouse and building the St. Vincent DePaul Service Center. which would provide job training and employment placement. transitional child care for those enrolled in programs at the Center. a nonacute health care clinic. a resale thrift shop and an emergency food depot. To raise the $3.75 million needed to fund these projects. the Society of St. Vincent DePaul asked Mr. VanElslander to chair the campaign. Mr. VanElslander not only provided the leadership and spirit needed to successfully raise the money. but he pledged to match up to $500.000 in donations. His commitment to this campaign is a natural expression of his desire to help the less fortunate members of his community. Mr. President. we all benefit from the attention and energy of leaders like Mr. VanElslander. By helping those in need. they improve the strengthen the entire community. I hope my colleagues will join me in commending Mr. Art VanElslander for his generosity and for his leadership of the Society of St. Vincent DePaul Capital Campaign.0",

Superintendent Pinto has said. \"[Ill] tell the School Committee that Im not interested in a lot of 3to2 votes. Ill give up something for a 5to0 vote.\" It is that qualitydoing what it takes to reach a consensus--that has made him a successful leader.

The skills they have learned while camping. doing service work. and within their individual groups. are the skills they will need to help the world become a better place. In order to attain the Eagle Scout award. Boy Scouts must earn 21 merit badges. complete a service project in their community. hold a number of leadership positions in their troop. and finally. pass an oraladministered exam which can last for several hours.

He has been a teacher. a principal. a business manager for the school district. an assistant superintendent. and. most recently. the superintendent. Over the yearseven when I represented Rhode Islands neighboring Congressional district in the House of Representatives. I was privileged to have the advice of Superintendent Pinto on a variety of issues related to education. from school choice to educational standards. Indeed. I could always count on hearing from Superintendent Pinto about Impact Aid. He is the programs number one advocate. His commitment to Impact Aid underscores his overall dedication to Middletowns schools and students and the cause of education. A measure of his commitment was shown in a recent news article which reported that in the last fifteen years he has had no more than seven consecutive days off. As superintendent. Mr. Pinto has presided over a number of successful initiatives including the fundamental repair of two schools. a new system of measuring student learning. and an optional allday kindergarten. Superintendent Pinto has consistently sought to share the professional accolades he has received with his colleagues in Middletown. His emphasis on team work has earned him the admiration and respect of those who have worked with him.

The history of the church is actually longer when we remember that it was in 1892 that its meetings began in the Garden Avenue School. The church became fully organized in 1896 with the Rev. F.B. Kellogg named pastor of the new church. By the following year the congregation had grown so large that it moved to a barn on Bedford Avenue and. on July 4th of that year. the new church was dedicated. By 1910 the church has become selfsupporting and in 1916 construction on the current building was started. The church. a New England colonial design reflecting a post Civil War spirit of unity and self determination. was completed by 1922. Subsequently a sanctuary was added as well as tower chime. The Mount Vernon Heights Congregational Church has always practiced community activism as well as charitable works and community projects. such as itsyouth seminars and elderly centers. The Church also is part of the annual pulpit exchanges in which ministers from 19 churches deliver sermons at sister churches. The Church is justly proud of its fellowship of many denominations and its ministers of many differing ethnic and social backgrounds. The Rev. Maximilian Bernard Surjadinata. pastor since 1988. was born in Indonesia. I warmly congratulate the Mount Vernon Heights Congregational Church on its centenary and for its wonderful accomplishments in those hundred years.",

Mr. Leone a speech and drama instructor at Illinois Valley Community College has staged over 70 productions in his 21 years at IVCC. and has been active in the Illinois Theater Association serving as both President and Treasurer. Giacomo Leones commitment to the arts in Illinois and my district can be witnessed through the countless hours Giacomo spends working on committees. and through his work as a director. playwright and composer at IVCC. In 1987 and 1988. Giacomo Leone took his act on the road to Northeastern University of Technology in Shenyang in the Peoples Republic of China. There Giacomo taught English. Business Communication. and social amenities to Chinese graduate students who were going to work in the United States. Mr. Leone also acted as an advisor in foreign languages to the university faculty. During his time in China. Giacomo used his bilingual skills serving as a liaison between the Hong KongIllinois office. and the Illinois office in Shenyang. Through hard work and devotion. Giacomo has shared his love of the stage with audiences and students from Illinois and around the world. From La Salle to Shenyang. Giacomo Leones impact on the lives of all who know him is not only worthy of recognition by this body. but. his commitment to the arts and our children should act as a model for all. Mr. Speaker. I applaud Mr. Leones commitment to the arts. his students at IVCC and the local community.

It was estimated that 64 percent of these attacks were successful in gaining access to the Department of Defense systems. I think Federal agencies have to employ appropriate countermeasures. and today we are not set to do that. With the growth in the Internet. individual users across the country are relying more and more and on communications and business commerce through the Internet. but the testimony before the committee shows that there continue to be problems. and the technologies to better protect users does not exist. Security problems in individual computers that connect to the Internet are very much at risk. One interesting note. and I think this starts to address it with a system that authorizes the National Institute of Standards to reserve $750.000 for new computer science fellowship programs for students to study security. Of 5.500 Ph.D.s granted in computer science and engineering last year. a scant 16 pertained to computer security. It is not even a required course to get a doctorate in computer science and engineering. Only 50 percent of the 16 were given to U.S. nationals. Mr. Speaker.

This bill enables the program to continue its good work through continued research. hazard assessment. and public education. As my colleagues know. Mr. Speaker. the Robert T.

The relationship between the Stafford Act and NEHRP has always been complementary. and I just want to clarify how this bill fits in with the Stafford Act.

It was an honor to meet someone who has done so much to advance the cause of Christ and to \"love even the least of these.\" Patriarch Bartholomew is similarly a person who is outspoken in his views. He believes in protection of religious freedoms. combating human rights abuses and protecting the vulnerable. born and unborn. As the 270th successor to the Apostle Andrew. His All Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew has been very active in seeking spiritual renewal within the Orthodox Church as well as opening lines of communication between all Christian denominations and other religions.

The marktomarket approach. which is a fairly subtle thing in terms of the public perspective. is simply an extension of an ongoing program. Now. the question then becomes. what are we doing with the larger issue for which there are certain differences with the other body? The gentleman from New York has very thoughtfully introduced a very comprehensive bill. It is in the public record. We have modest differences with the other body on two large issues. both of which. however. are in the context of which there is 95 percent agreement on approach. It is the Intent of the House side to be very forthcoming In negotiations with the Senate on these issues. What we are attempting to pass today is by no means intended to be delaying. It is intended to take care of extenders that must occur this month. and also to take care of a very compassionate issue. So I would only say to the gentleman from Massachusetts that we have some very minor concerns about a given Senate approach in the mark to market. We will negotiate with them very straightforwardly. very reasonably. with the intent of protecting the U.S. taxpayer and the public interest. and no other intent or any other motivation whatsoever. In so doing. we hope to come out with a better protective taxpayer approach than has simply been endorsed by the other side today. But there is nothing in this proposal that is designed to do anything except advance what must be done this month under law and to take care of an approach. if there is no agreement that can be reached with the Senate. But we have total desire to reach agreement with the Senate.

Paul Cronin passed away on April 5. 1997. at just 59 years old. after a lengthy battle with cancer. It was an especially sad day because just 4 months earlier another great man from the fifth district was taken from us. Paul Tsongas. Like Tsongas. politics did not consume Cronins life.

Porter was recently designated by the Federal Government as a distinguished school. This elementary school is 1 of 100 schools nationally and five statewide to be commended for the high performance of the. students and the innovation of instruction. Porter is the only school in the Syracuse area to receive the commendation. Many of the programs at Porter are innovative. They involve parents in creative ways. such as communication through audio and visual tapes in instances where literacy at home is a question. The faculty. led by Principal Octavia Wilcox. has worked hard to produce a learning environment which challenges the students. Using tax dollars wisely in pursuit of high standards in education is a top priority. Every student at Porter takes music. and any student can take piano lessons during school time. They have a pottery wheel in the art class. They have sophisticated computers and their own news team which videotaped a recent visit I made. But more importantly than the hardware. Porter prides itself in a philosophy. Every child can learn. Parents must be involved. Excellence is worth pursuing. Principal Wilcox says the faculty tries to compete with other forces. negative forces. for students time. The curriculum stresses the future and the students are taught to think about what comes nextthe next level of education and then careers. I am very proud to congratulate the Syracuse School District in general for its support of programs like the one at Porter School.",

Representative THOMAS FOGLIETrA of Pennsylvania. for his upcoming appointment by the President as the next U.S. Ambassador to Italy. This is an extraordinary and welldeserved honor for a true gentleman who has given four decades of his life to public service. Since his election to the House of Representatives in 1980. TOM FOGLIETTA has been a tireless fighter for his constituents in Philadelphia and Delaware County. As a member of the Appropriations Committee and a leader of the Urban Caucus. he has protected city jobs. helped restore Independence Hall. and put more police on the streets. Perhaps just as important to his new duties. TOM FOGLIETTA has also been on the forefront of global affairs. He has worked to provide famine relief to starving people overseas and has never hesitated to speak up against tyrants around the world. Only in America could the grandson of immigrants who came from Italy over 100 years ago live the dream of representing the birthplace of this Nations freedom in the Halls of Congress and go on to serve his country as its representative in the land of his familys heritage. TOM FOGLIETrA is an outstanding example of what is possible for those who serve the United States with honor and distinction. Mr. Speaker. Washingtons loss is Italys gain. Congress will undoubtedly be a lesser place when TOM FOGLIETTA takes his intelligence. dedication. integrity. and charm to Italy. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending best wishes and a fond arrivederci to TOM FOGLIETTA as he stands ready to embark on another exciting chapter of his career. and insert the following editorial from the Philadelphia Inquirer to be included for the RECORD.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one out of every seven American children is growing up without health insurance. These 10 million childrenincluding 70.000 in my home State of Minnesotaare less likely to get preventive care to keep them healthy. or see a doctor when they get sick. These obstacles to health care can lead to harmful and lasting effects. For example. children whose ear infections go undiagnosed and untreated can suffer from permanent hearing loss. Sadly. there are signs that the prognosis for the health of Americans children is getting worse. The number of families receiving insurance sponsored by their employer has declined from 67 percent in 1987 to 59 percent in 1995. Additionally. premium costs for family coverage are on the rise. placing health insurance beyond the reach of an increasing number of working families. Enough is enough. It is time for all of us to commit to solving this problem. Today. I am introducing legislation that takes one step toward a comprehensive solution. The Childrens Health Coverage Improvement Act of 1997 would make childrensonly policies widely available to families at more affordable group rates. Federally regulated selfinsured health plans would be required to offer these policies as one of the options available to their employees. Many lowincome working families simply cannot find room in the family budget to pay the increasingly large premiums for family policies. Moreover. many financially strapped single parents cannot afford to pay family premiums designed to cover two adults plus children. Kidsonly policies could provide an answer for these hardworking and hardpressed families. According to a recent survey of 600 employers. the majority of respondents indicated a strong sense of responsibility toward their workers and expressed sympathy for those who are uninsured. My legislation builds upon this sense of community. and creates a new way for employers to make coverage available to children.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to address a subject of utmost importance: teen pregnancy prevention. Mr. Speaker. today the United States retains the unfortunate distinction of having the highest rate of teen pregnancy among industrialized western nations. Over the past decade we have made some progress in bringing down the number of pregnancies among teens. But too many kids are still having kids. and suffering social and economic repercussions throughout their lives because of it. We can and must do better. We must do better because unintended teen pregnancies mean more difficult lives. and fewer opportunities. for teen parents and their children. We know that teen mothers are less likely to graduate from high school. and more likely to depend on welfare. And their children start life at a distinct disadvantageon average smaller at birth. they are more likely to be hospitalized. more likely to perform poorly in school. and more likely to suffer abuse and neglect. And the cycle is likely to be repeated. Over 20 percent of children of teen mothers will in turn have children at a young age. Mr. Speaker. our society suffers when our children start life with such odds against them. We must also do better because an ounce of prevention is indeed worth a pound of cureprevention works. Studies show that the federal government spends more than $39 billion in assistance to families begun by teen parents and only $131 million to prevent teen pregnancy. When we work with our kids to prepare them to avoid pregnancy. through good parental communication and involvement in their lives. education. and family planning programs. the numbers are clear: unintended births decline. What a better way. Mr. Speaker. to reduce abortion in this country than to prevent unintended pregnancies? I hope today we can all renew our efforts to support and fund teen pregnancy prevention programs.",

Inc. as they celebrate a very special occasionthe 32nd Anniversary of the Independence of the Republic of Guyana. In honor of this event. a commemorative flagraising ceremony will take place on Tuesday. May 26. 1998 in the Council Chambers at Jersey City Hall. In 1621 the Dutch started to colonize Guyana and in 1640 the first slaves arrived from Africa. In 1763 about 100 years before the American Emancipation. the slaves in Guyana revolted in the ill fated effort known as the Berbice Slave Rebellion. In 1781 the British captured the colony but were ousted within the year. From 1782 until the return of the British in 1812 the colony was administered by French and Dutch Administrations. In 1835 laborers were brought in from Portugal and 1838 marked the beginning of indentured servitude with the arrival of laborers from India. The Chinese came in 1853. In 1953 elections were held for the first time under the system of universal adult suffrage. The Peoples Progressive (PPP) won this election but was removed after 133 days from office by the British. The PPP was reelected in 1957 and again in 1961. During these two terms under the system of internal self rule. the colony of the then British Guiana experienced significant social and economic growth in spite of political disturbances especially in the early 60s. In 1964. an unpopular government was brought to power through external influences. It remained in power until 1992 through constant rigging of national elections. In 1966. Guyana became an independent nation and in 1970 it obtained republican status. On October 5th. 1992 the first free and fair elections were held since 1964. This election supervised by a team of international observers led by former U.S. President Carter brought the PPPCivic government under the Presidency of Dr. Cheddi Jagan to office. Over 50 percent of Guyanas population consist of East Indians. whose ancestors came to Guyana from India. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I would also like to applaud the New Jersey Arya Samaj Mandir.

Hargett. who is retiring after 42 years in the ministry. the last 10 years as Pastor of the Christian Fellowship Congregational United Church of Christ. Dr. Hargett. as he is known by his parishioners. friends and colleagues alike. always makes it a point to blend AfricanAmerican history with theology. In his sermons or during his numerous public speaking engagements. Dr. Hargett will always discuss the present conditions of AfricanAmericans in the context of the history of almost 250 years of slavery. \"A son of the South\". Dr. Hargett was born in Greensboro. North Carolina 67 years ago. He grew up to march with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. and participated in numerous civil rights demonstrations and causes. \"It was at this time.\" noted Dr. Hargett. \"that I got the chance to witness the system of separate but equal from a close up point of view.\" He recognized that a system based on segregation and bigotry would weaken our society. From that moment on. Dr. Hargett dedicated his life to fighting prejudice and injustice wherever it exists. Dr. Hargett married Louilyn Funderburke Hargett. Together. they have three adult children and five grandchildren. Since graduating from North Carolina A&T and the Yale Divinity School in the Mid1950s. Dr. Hargett had ministries in Hawaii. North Carolina. Los Angeles. New York. and New Jersey before moving to San Diego a decade ago. He was active in the effort against Proposition 209. the antiaffirmative action initiative that was approved by California voters in 1996. He still believes that through strong leadership and organization. equal opportunity will continue to be the cornerstone of this democracy. Dr. Hargett has been a man of vision and dedication. He has been a minister and a leachera conscience for us all. Mr. Speaker. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to Dr. James H. Hargett on this special occasion.",

The following represents the third installment of a special report conducted by the Congressional Research Service and deals with changes at Lewis during the 1990s. NASA Lewis faces an optimistic tuture. The center has weathered some challenging times recently. and has emerged even stronger. Faced with limited budget allocations. Lewis has managed to achieve more with less and through careful budgeting have prospered in many areas. They have been designated as the No. 1 center for aeropropulsion and as center of excellence in turbomachinary. Lewis other missions include aeronautics research. onboard space applications. and commercial communications. In addition to this. Lewis is also a contributor to many NASAwide programs. In the past they have conducted microgravity research for the U.S. space shuttle. Currently. they are developing further microgravity technology for the international space station. They have contributed to the Mission to Planet Earth Program whose focus includes such things as analyzing ozone depletion and detecting and understanding the consequences and causes of destructive natural phenomena. Lewis also had a hand in the Mars Pathfinder mission which landed on Mars on July 4. 1997. in order to conduct mobile geological studies. Although Lewis has been affected by past NASA budget limitations. they are currently contributing to the most exciting and dynamic of NASAs missions. They have and are conlinuing to provide for the future. useful. accessible. and informative research material on a wide array of sciencebased activities. Their importance to NASA and to the Nation is evident from the fact that their tunding for 1998 has been recommended as $671 million. $50 million higher than that received in 1997. The third installment of a report by the Congressional Research Center outlines the challenges that NASA Lewis has met and conquered",

Hungary. and the Czech Republic to become fullfledged members of the alliance. The Congress now faces important decisions regarding NATO enlargement. Probably next year. the Senate will consider under the Constitutions provision on the ratification of treaties. the admission of these three counIdes. and the House and Senate will consider legislation that will be necessary io implement this expansion. including matters relating to the cost of enlargement. In the wake of the Madrid Summit. the debate has been engaged on the merits and wisdom of expanding NATO. My position on this issue. Mr. Speaker. has been clear and unequivocal. As soon as the Communist regimes in Central Europe began to collapse in 1989. I urged the expansion of NATO in order to bring strategic stability. democratic reform and the cultivation of a civil society. development of free marketoriented economies. fostering of respect for human rights. and the institution of civilian control of the military forces in these emerging democracies. I continue to support strongly the enlargement of NATO. When the current expansion was being considered. I urged the inclusion of the three countries which were invited to join. as well as the inclusion of Romania and Slovenla. I continue to support expansion to include Romania and Slovenia as well as other countries which are prepared to contribute to NATO in the future. As the debate on NATO enlargement has been engaged. one of the best expositions of the rationale for expansion was presented by my good friend. Bill Odom. who has had a distinguished military career. The Washington Post published his view in a recent Sunday \"Outlook\" section. Mr. Speaker. I call the attention of my colleagues to this excellent analysis. and I ask that it be placed in the RECORD. [From the Washington Post. July 6. 1997]",

The amendment merely delays $29 million in mandatory Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] spending for USDA computers and related items until 1999 to offset increased spending in 1998. The 1996 farm bill included $275 million for computer and related expenses over the 1997 through 2002 fiscal years. Based upon the language in the farm bill CBO had to estimate the flow of funds over the 6year period. The CBO estimated that approximately $66 million will be spent on computers and related expenses in 1998. The Harkin amendment merely delays the expenditure of $29 million into 1999 thus increasing spending in 1999. Under our scoring rules if the appropriations bill changes a mandatory program the Appropriations Committee will get scored with the change. If this amendment becomes law. the discretionary spending caps will be adjusted downward in 1999. This amendment will therefore make it more difficult for Congress to fund agriculture research and extension. education. and environment programs in next years appropriation bills as less money is available to spend.",

In addition. if $47 million In Commodity Credit Corporation funds is really needed for the Department of Agriculture to operate and maintain its computer systems in fiscal year 1998. as the Department indicates. those funds will have to be reprogrammed from other accounts. putting pressure on possibly the Farm Service Agency or other USDA agencies.

LI 1800 Mr. Speaker. included in the Political Freedom in China Act is a provision from several of us in the House.

China wanted to achieve a new image in the West as a result of this summit. but Americans had a different plan in mind. Through their protests. they sent a different message to the Chinese leadership. It reminds me of the message that President Reagan delivered to Mikhael Gorbachev in Geneva in 1958. Natan Sharansky tells the story in his wonderful book \"Fear No Evil.\" He says Reagan told Gorbachev that the Soviet Union would not change its image in the world.until he let Sharansky go. So it Is with China. The photos at the White House or at Harvard will not give China the respect and the superpower status that they seek. Rather. freeing Chinese political prisoners. freeing Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan. freeing other Chinese who are in prison merely for voicing their opinions or worshiping their God. in sum. only by ending the laogai can the Chinese leadership achieve world respect. status. and. one day. admiration.

The organ harvesting program in China has meant millions of dollars to the Chinese military. The Chinese Government says organ harvesting involves criminals who voluntarily consent. The facts show otherwise. Chinas assertion that these are the facts makes a mockery of the international principles adopted after Nazi medical experiments were uncovered and outlawed. No other country in the world at this time is known to use the organs of prisoners except for China and to take them in an involuntary fashion. They appear to have turned a chilling execution of thousands of people who did not even commit capital crimes into a multimillion dollar black market of a kind the world has never seen. Accordingly. others have joined me in Congress to write to President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright noting that 4.000 people a year who are reportedly executed in China for committing minor crimes and they go from arrest to execution in order to harvest their organs for sale on the black market.

Chinas past record of abiding by Its international commitments not to aid the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not a good one. Congressional skepticism about Chinese promises is clearly warranted. There is time to consider the agreement. and the extension of that time and the expedited procedure which would allow a decision to be implemented without the threat of filibuster or delay in the other body is very critical in reducing the skepticism and reinforcing congressional support for the agreement should the record of implementation bring us to that conclusion. So for that reason. I think both the Chinese and the administration should welcome this. This gives us a greater time to determine if. in fact. it is true that the representations made have been kept. the commitments made with respect to export controls and the implementation of a meaningful export control regime are being followed through. By reducing our concern. it leads people to come to a factbased conclusion by adding to the time we have to look at it. My fear is that if the existing law remains in place. we will be rushed into a decision. we will be forced to make decisions based on the past record rather than the present record. and so I think the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Massachusetts have an excellent amendment here. and I urge the body to adopt it.",

I was in Cambodia not too long ago with a United States team of military personnel trying to clear out mines in Cambodia. and they told me that there was a new mine that they were having trouble teaching the Cambodians how to get rid of. how to defuse. because it was a smart mine. and eventually that mine exploded in the hands of someone trying to defuse it. It was designed to kill Americans or anyone else trying to defuse mines. When they opened it up. what did they find? They found a chip from Motorola. a Motorola chip that was designed specifically to make It impossible to defuse these mines without the loss of American military personnel. We need control of our technology when it is going into the hands of vicious dictatorships like we find in the mainland in China. If we do not impose these restrictions on technology or just handle this issue with care. it is going to come back and haunt us. It is going to hurt our national security. and Americans will be dead if we do not take the proper care. That is what the GilmanMarkey amendment is all about. That is why I support the GilmanMarkey amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the GilmanMarkey amendment. Mr. Speaker. last month I called on the administration not to certify that China has stopped its exportation of nuclear technology to unregulated countries. and I wrote to President Clinton urging that the administration halt preparations to recertify China and spoke out against it here In the House. Mr. Speaker. granting certification to China now is the wrong thing to do. given Chinas record of exporting nuclear technology. The recent action by the Chinese premier to sign regulations limiting nuclear exports pales in comparison to Chinese actions of the past 12 years which argue for continued prudence and vigilance. I am particularly concerned about Beijings pattern of transferring ring magnets. an important component for building nuclear weapons for a Pakistani nuclear facility. I am concerned that the administration appears to be giving insufficient consideration to Chinas recent transfer of nuclear technology to unregulated nuclear facilities in Pakistan. The administration will be granting certification despite CIA findings that the Chinese have sold 5.000 ring magnets to Pakistan for its uranium enrichment facilities. and ring magnets can be used in the building of nuclear weapons. The administration is apparently willing to ignore Chinas continued support of Pakistans commitment to build a plutonium production reactor and a plutonium reprocessing plant. These facilities are essential for a nuclear weapons program. and despite the protests of United States lawmakers. China continues to assist Pakistan in building a sophisticated nuclear arsenal. Unfortunately. this arsenal is not subject to international inspection. Furthermore. the administration continues to look the other way as China continues to export technology and ballistic missile components to Pakistan. a country that is not a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and bans investigators from several of its nuclear facilities. Mr. Speaker. clearly. there is a lot of skepticism and many unanswered questions about granting the certification. Let us pass this common sense. the GilmanMarkey neutral resolution. so that our decision is based on the complete review of the terms of the agreement and not just rush into rubberstamping an agreement that we may later come to regret.",

The bottom line here is that the President. under pressure from a failing U.S. nuclear industry. because there has not been a new nuclear plant constructed in the United States in more than a dozen year. and none are proposed. is being pressured to transfer critical nuclear technology to China. a country that has a longterm documented record of transferring technology for weapons of mass destruction to rogue states. China has broken all of its past promises in this area. But now. now. things are different. things are very different. They have signed a new agreement. Here it is. Oh. we cannot see it. Well. neither can I. It is a secret agreement. Now. they broke the written agreements. they broke the verbal agreements. all done publicly. but now they have signed this. this secret agreement here. my colleagues can see. it is quite lengthy. saying that they will not do it again. under certain conditions unspecified to certain nations. which are specified. Now. I do not think that Congress can review this lengthy document in only 30 days and determine whether or not China has complied with all of the conditions of the secret document which we cannot see. I think it will take us a little bit longer. So I am suggesting that our colleagues should support this amendment. Mr. Speaker. 120 days is not too long to certify whether or not China is really complying with conditions that we would like to see for a country to whom we are going to transfer critical nuclear technology. because I tell my colleagues. if we transfer that technology and it is misused. it will seem like a lifetime to people who voted to allow the Chinese to have that technology to transfer to Americas enemies around the world. So support this amendment. It is reasonable that Congress should have 120 days before the United States takes this unprecedented step.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me say. first of all. that I was delighted to watch the impassioned pleas of my liberal friends for higher taxes. There was an intensity. a passion. an emotional commitment to higher taxes that I believe is sincere. These are friends who voted for the 1993 tax increase. passed only with Democratic votes. These are friends for whom higher taxes is a legitimate moral cause. because the American people. in their judgment. are not smart enough to solve their own problems. and only bigger bureaucracy. more power in Washington. less takehome pay. will lead to the liberal utopia they believe in. But I have to say to my good friends. I just checked two of the last three speakers on the gentlemans side. They voted against the welfare reform bill. It is not fair to get up here and protect the welfare reform bill we wrote. that we passed. working with our Governors. my good friend. John Engler of Michigan. who was in on Tuesday. when we chatted about what we can get done. my good friend. George Pataki. Governor of New York. with whom I have been talking about what we can get done. my dear friend. Tommy Thompson. Governor of Wisconsin. who was the original leader in the welfare reform movement. talking about what we can get done. We have found that we on our side are the people who actually worked with Governors to write the welfare reform bill. So to have liberals who always vote for tax increases jump up in defense of a welfare reform plan they opposed. and cite Republican Governors to the Republican majority. is a wonderful piece of oratory. but it is not historically very accurate. Let us talk about why we brought this vote up today. This is. frankly. a very important point. I would urge every Democrat. every Democrat who wants higher spending-",

This budget is the only one that we will debate that puts taxpayers first and stops wasting their money in Washington. Each year the average American works until May of each year just to pay their taxes. If we add State. local and Federal taxes together. and the average family of four pays almost 40 percent of their income in taxes. that is more than we pay for food. clothing and housing combined. The American people deserve to have that corrected. and this budget does that. This conservative action team budget will return to the American people more than $150 billion in their tax money providing acrosstheboard tax relief. eliminating the marriage penalty. eliminating the estate or death tax and restoring a 12month holding period on capital gains. The American people need real reform from the crushing burden of taxes. and this budget provides it. Now we have been talking about defense. This is the only budget that increases our Nations defense spending by $56 billion in order to just keep up with inflation. No other budget does it. Recent events in India and Pakistan remind us what history has taught us. Americans cannot ensure economic security for our families unless we have real security in our defense of the Nation. In order to provide security we have got to invest in our Nations defense. A strong defense is the only way America can remain the No. 1 leader in the world. and this budget is the only one that just barely maintains the defense at just inflation level. It is our duty. in fact it is our primary function. I believe. in this Congress to ensure the security of these United States. Let us do it. It is imperative to our survival. This budget plan returns the most money to hardworking American families. helps preserve the Social Security and shores up our national defense. As my colleagues know.

They also then went on to tell us that in addition. \"Americas Schools Are Not Designed or Equipped for the 21st Century.\" So they went on to tell us what these charts say and pictures say and all of us know: That you cannot use computers in a classroom with a broken window. with falling ceilings. with peeling paint with lead in it. with no electrical system.

I ask the Senator this question. and she touched on it so eloquently earlier: What is the message that we send to school children if we do not pass this amendment? We have been talking about the collapsing roofs. inadequate boilers. windows that have fallen out and havent been replaced. schools in Boston whose heating systems frequently fail. But what does this say to the schoolchildren of this country about our commitment to them when we are trying to. either as parents or as community leaders. say that continued education. the quality of schoolteachers. and homework is important. that we want young people to apply themselves and develop their own skills to enhance their educational opportunities so that they will have good jobs in the future? What do we say when we impress on them that what the learn is what they are going to earn in the future? What message does it say to them every single day when they go to school to learn in dilapidated classrooms?",

We have an \"education everything.\" You can find probably an education dogcatcher somewhere in America that ran on a platform: Im going to fix the schools. But we never seem to be able to get there. And so after a while the children become cynical and begin to believe that we do not believe education is important. that we do not really put our money where our mouth is. that we are prepared to send them into classrooms that suggest a diminished support or diminished importance of what they do. We send our children to classrooms every day in conditions that we would allow no worker to work in. We send our children to classrooms every day that we would not for a moment tolerate in our homes. And so if that is the case. then we say. well. we want you to go to learn somewhere that looks like this. that looks like the charts I have had. And we expect you to learn in that environment. What that says is learning is not really important. As we stand up and make our pious speeches about the globalization of our economy and the information age and the brave new worldagain. that is why I thought this cartoon was so funny. \"A computer in class opens a whole new world for us!\" \"Look!

This should not come down to being: Republicans do not care about their States having to meet 112 billion dollars worth of need that the General Accounting Office has documented State by State. And I suggest to my colleagues. I know your staffs all have them. but we have sent around copies of a StatebyState analysis. Take a look at what your State has in terms of the cost of bringing the schools just up to code. We are not talking about bells and whistles here. We are not talking about putting computers in the classrooms here. We are not talking about curtains. We are not even talking about new paint jobs. We are talking about taking care of the foundation. the electrical wiring. the plumbing. the roof. the windows. the basics. the floors. There was a school in the southern part of our country where the roof caved in altogether. a few minutes after the children had left the classroom. a school in my State where the track team had to use the prison because the gymnasium was so rotted away.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to support the amendment offered by my colleague. Senator CAROL MOSELEYBRAUN. to help rebuild our Nations schools. This amendment would ensure that any budget agreement that we reach will include funding for school construction. I believe that we must ensure that we meet the needs of our local communities to help them upgrade the Nations schools. I am an original cosponsor of S. 456. the Partnership to Rebuild Americas Schools Act. This bill would provide $5 billion over 4 years to subsidize up to 50 percent of the interest or other financing costs for school construction. These funds would help States and localities leverage scarce resources to help upgrade. repair. and build new schools. In my State of Maryland. school enrollment is at an all time high. Many of the counties in Maryland like Prince Georges and Montgomery are rapidly expanding and the school districts are struggling to keep pace. I hear from parents. students. and teachers about the need to upgrade the schools. Our children must be in environments which are conducive to learning. Over onethird of the schools in Maryland are in desperate need of repair. Under S. 456. Maryland would receive approximately $57.9 million in Federal funds to support $231.6 million for school construction. Baltimore public schools would receive $31.4 million. I believe that funding school construction has to be a priority for our Nation. Children cannot learn in schools with leaky roofs. poor ventilation. crumbling walls. and other problems. This problem is especially acute in rural areas and inner cities. Many of these schools fail to meet even minimum local health and safety codes. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Our Nations school children deserve no less.",

I want to thank her for her tireless efforts to educate the Senate and the American people about the tremendous problems in our nations school facilities. People talk about the role of the Federal Government in local school policy. By championing this issue. Senator MOSELEYBRAUN has pointed out quite accurately that the Federal Government does have a role in K12 education in this country. That role is not in passing down curriculum or trying to tell teachers how to teach. The role is guaranteeing certain minimum standards for health. safety. and qualityand that is what this proposal is all about. There are schools in our Nation that are rundown. have falling plaster or open holes in floors or ceilings. schools with water leaks or no airconditioning in hot climates. There are schools. like Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane. WA. an 85yearold urban high school. that are badly in need of improvements. There are school districts in places like the small town of Raymond. WA. which the General Accounting Office has previously identified as needing help with school construction fundingwhich cannot renovate all their schools due to local economic factors. This amendment could have as much as a $40 million cumulative impact on my State. This amendment is absolutely critical to the students. parents. and families in our country who think education is of primary national priority. How can we say that we truly care about public education. when our school rooms smell of mildew. or are far too cold or hot or crowded? How can we say that we care about students learning that all Americans are equal under law. if their track meet across town is at a much nicer school? Senator MOSELEYBRAUN showed a cartoon on the Senate floor. in which students were using computers to look at other students much nicer school buildings. This problem is symbolic.

Republicans and Democrats. and foreign governments with American interests. This was most evident in the strong support that the private sector had shown for the Department.

H.R. 1849 focuses on the terrorist bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. OK. on April 19. 1995. The purposes and findings refer to the death of 168 men. women. and children. the heroic rescue efforts that followed in the aftermath. and the national and international impact of this event.

H.R. 1849 designates a wholly owned governmental corporation. the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust. to design. construct. interpret. operate. and maintain the memorial under a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service.

The gentleman from California and myself and the gentleman from Michigan and other people were involved. We conducted seven hearings and three markups on ways to improve our National Wildlife Refuge System. It is the culmination of successful negotiations between members of the committee. the administration. hunting and conservation and environmental groups.

The three differences in the legislation include an expanded definition of the term \"compatible use\" to mean \"a wildlifedependent recreational use or any other use of a refuge\". a requirement that the Secretary monitor the status and trends of fish. wildlife. and plants in each refuge. and a clarification requiring existing rightsofway within refuges. I have carefully reviewed these changes and find them acceptable. By approving this measure today. we will conclude the legislative process and send the bill to the President of the United States. By so doing. I am convinced we have enacted an organic act for our 509 wildlife refuge units that will serve our Nation well in the 21st century.

Equally important. the measure establishes hunting. fishing. and environmental education. as legitimate and appropriate priority general public uses of the 92 millionplus acres of land and water that make up our refuge system. It also affirms the refuge system not only as a home to all wildlife. but also as a haven to endangered wildlife and fish. Indeed. each of the six National Wildlife Refuges in Tennessee are either entirely or in part in my congressional district and you can fish and hunt on each of them. Through the PittmanRobertson Wildlife Restoration Program. the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund. the DingellJohnsonWallopBreaux Sportfish Restoration Program. the purchase of Federal duck stamps. and many other conservation and restoration programs. hunters and anglers are the unquestioned leaders when it comes to wildlife and fisheries restoration and conservation. Americas hunters and anglers have contributed well over $6 billion to wildlife and fisheries restoration over the past 60 years. And last year alone. they spent nearly $60 billion pursuing the twin traditions of hunting and fishing. And with this legislation. hunters and anglers are again leading the conservation movement. In the best tradition of President Theodore Roosevelt. an avid hunter. this bill recognizes that fact. So I want to applaud Chairman YOUNG. Representative DINGELL. Chairman SAXTON.

This is an excellent vote for conservation. hunting. and fishing. as we approach the 100th anniversary of our National Wildlife Refuge System. Earlier this year our bill received 407 votes in the House. the Senate passed it earlier this month by unanimous consent. and the President has said he will sign the legislation. I would urge everyones support of this bill so that we can send it to President Clinton for his signature.",

The National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act provides an organic act for the Refuge System similar to those which exist for other public lands. Its principle focus is to establish clearly the conservation mission of the System. provide a mechanism for unitspecific refuge planning. and give refuge managers clear direction and procedures for making determinations regarding wildlife conservation and public uses of the System and individual refuges. The other body passed this bill. amended. on October 9. 1997. The House concurs to the amendments. I urge all Members to vote in support of this bill. which greatly benefits the Refuge System.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when President Theodore Roosevelt established the first wildlife refuge in Florida 94 years ago. he could hardly have imagined a national system of 500 refuges covering 93 million acres. Today. we have another opportunity to make a genuine contribution to this remarkable legacy of wildlife conservation and management. It is in that spirit that I rise today in support of H.R. 1420. the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. The Chairman and Ranking Member have worked together to craft a bill that ensures the future biological integrity of our refuges. Legacies are not historic relics: like the species that inhabit our refuges. they survive only if they prosper and evolve. This bill will help protect species large and small. beautiful and notsobeautiful. endangered and common alike. and specifically recognizes the benefits that refuges bring to people who live and work near them. The bill explicitly encourages the Interior Department to work with local communities. states and private and nonprofit groups. It is precisely such a partnership that has characterized our progress toward one of the newest additions to the refuge system. in Mashpee on Cape Cod. home to over 180 migratory fish and bird species. Like so many others across the country. the Mashpee Refuge has value even beyond its statutory objectives--in this case. in safeguarding the quality and quantity of the areas fragile water resources. This imperative has become particularly acute with recent findings that pollution emanating from a nearby military reservation is seriously contaminating groundwater and jeopardizing future drinking water supplies. For all these reasons. I urge my colleagues to enact H.R. 1420and then to pay for it by passing a 1998 Interior appropriations bill that includes the $700 million for land acquisition provided for in the budget agreement. This bill draws on historic. bipartisan support for the basic mission of the refuge system. and makes adjustments that keep this refuge system alive and vibrant. I urge my colleagues to again join me in helping the House send this legislation to the President.",

I do not normally quote from Albert Hunts column in the Wall Street Journal but I am going to today. because I think he has his numbers right. If we take a family of four with two children that are earning $23.000 a year. they would pay approximately $700 in Federal income tax. That would be what they would owe the Government in Federal income tax. However. under current law they would qualify for an earned income tax credit of about $1.700. So if we deduct what they owe the Government from the amount that they get back from the Government. they are getting a check back from the Government for $1.000. Our tax bill is focused and targeted on families who are still sending funds in to the Government for their taxes. That is why those families that are getting a check back from the Government do not qualify under the Republican plan. I think that is what the majority of people in my district want.",

H.R. 858 represents a bold new approach to solving todays environmental problems. an approach that Is long overdue. The legislation put forward by the gentleman from California marks the new beginning of an era of environmentalism in America. one that emphasizes local wisdom. local cooperation. and incentives not in conflict and controversy.

If Congress intends to go forward with this legislation. it should at a minimum. at a minimum. Mr. Chairman. include the Miller amendment to bring H.R. 858 into compliance with Federal environmental laws governing forest protection and particularly the protection of the spotted owl and its habitat in the region. The Miller amendment stipulates that environmental impact statements under the legislation must be prepared in accordance with existing Federal law. The management of these vast tracts of California forest should be based on sound science and environmental policy. We should not proceed with anything less than the Miller amendment. While the original goal of the Quincy Library Group. and indeed the distinguished chairman. was to reduce catastrophic wildfires. that is an important goal for the Quincy communities and surrounding forest. it has been lost in this debate. H.R. 858 is a drastic departure from the intended goal. Instead H.R. 858 sets a poor example for citizen involvement by allowing Federal laws to be circumvented and sends the message that the activities of local communities can be made immune from Federal laws governing Federal forests. The echo from this message will reverberate in future forest management decisions. signalling that environmental laws can be disregarded. Let us not set a bad precedent today.

Congress will vote on DayCare Fairness for StayatHome Parents. a resolution recognizing the importance of stayathome parents and the care they give their kids. I plan to support H. Con. Res. 202. because I believe that the Federal Government has for too long discriminated against parents who choose to stay at home to raise their children. We as lawmakers need to recognize the sacrifices these parents make to be at home with their kids. and encourage the kind of care that only they can give. But a sense of Congress means nothing unless we back these words up with action. We should pass legislation that brings real tax relief to parents who stay at home. The keystone of our child care effort should be to reverse current federal tax policy which effectively discriminates against parents who choose to stay at home to raise their children. That is why I am introducing legislation today that will universalize the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) to give stayathome parents tax relief equal to that received by parents who choose to leave their children with an outside caregiver. Under my bill. parents who stay at home with their preschool age children will receive credit on $2.400 of expenses for one child. and $4.800 for two or more children. The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) is currently available only to working parents for expenses related to nonparental child care. In effect. the DCTC subsidizes parents to leave their children in the care of others. In my view. this is a fundamentally misguided and harmful policy. While I support H. Con. Res. 202. parents who sacrifice a second income to stay at home with their kids deserve more than just a pat on the back. Lets show stayathome parents that we mean what we say. Support extending the Dependent Care Tax Credit. Americans families and our children will be better off for it.",

Res. 202. legislation designed to ensure that parents who choose to stay home and provide child care are not excluded from any future child care tax credits. Our children are our most important resource for the future. Studies show that quality child care from a loving and interactive caregiver is imperative to the growth and emotional development of infants and young children. Parents are the most significant influence on their children. They are often the best caregivers. combining love and attention in the comfort of the childs home. Parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children often sacrifice a much needed second full time income. The average income of two parent families with a single income is $20.000 less than the average income of two parent families with two incomes. At least 70 percent of preschool children are in families that do not pay for child care and many of these families are struggling to make ends meet. These families should not be discriminated against for their decision to put their children first. Any congressional proposal that increase child care funding should also provide financial relief to families that choose in order that a parent stay home and care for their young child. Therefore I support H. Con. Res. 202. a resolution that will protect a families choice to have one parent stay at home and care for a small child. I urge my colleagues to join in support of H. Con.

Thats why this Congress has a responsibility to address the growing child care crisis in America in a commonsense. fiscally prudent. \"realworld\" way. But as we move to craft legislation that addresses the needs those families who must have both parents work due to economic necessity. we also must be careful to recognize those families who have decided to pursue on another course. This resolution makes sense for the American people. It is important that we acknowledge the importance of stayathome parents and we should not discriminate against families who make the economic sacrifice to stay at home with their children. There can be no doubt. In this day and age such a decision carries and economic price. If a mother stays at home there has got to be some recognition in the tax code for her contribution. For my way of thinking. we need to make it more attractive for a family to make the decision for one parent to stay at home. It is a struggle. but one that is worthwhile. Stayathome parents are carrying on the traditions of our mothers and grandmothers. Those of us who were fortunate enough to have enjoyed the luxury of having our mothers stayathome realize what a great gift this was. This is our opportunity to show the value we place on the loving care that only a parent can provide. I chose to stayathome full time with my children. We need to help make such a choice available. While there are many who are not able to afford allowing one parent to stayathome. we must help make it more equitable for those trying to be full time homemakers. We need to remember both the parents who must place their child in care outside the home. and the parents who are struggling to afford keeping their child in care in the home. This is only the beginning of what I believe will be a constructive debate on this subject of those who need affordable quality child care. Support the Goodling resolution. Lets not forget the stay at home moms.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 202. the Equitable Child Care Resolution. which ensures that all families with children will be included in future discussions on child care proposals. It is important to recognize that all parents have child care needs. whether they choose to stay home. depend on a family member or utilize a day care center for their child. The fact that more than seventy percent of children are cared for by an athome parent or relative. while most of the proposals before Congress focus solely on commercial child care. reveals the need for such a resolution. Furthermore. this resolution states that any financial relief considered for parents who work outside the home should also be contemplated for families with athome care givers. There should not be a bias against athome parents. who many times forego a second salary to be home with a child. This resolution will start the child care debate off on the right path by emphasizing the fact that there are many forms of child care. In seeking a federal policy. we should not favor one form of child care over another.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 927. a bill to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. This bill is very similar to the legislation that I introduced in January. 1997. and in fact. that bill passed the House with 422 votes on June 18. Mr. Speaker. the bill that passed the House on June 18 by a vote of 422 to zero was virtually the same as this bill. The House bill had the bipartisan support of 107 cosponsors. including the gentleman from Alaska . Committee on Resources chairman. the gentleman from California . ranking Democrat. and the gentleman from Hawaii . ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation. Wildlife and Oceans. The version of the bill adopted by the House was a compromise version adopted by the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Science. The National Sea Grant College Program was established by Congress in 1966 to improve our Nations marine resources and conservation efforts. to better manage those resources. and to enhance their proper utilization. S. 927. the National Sea Grant College Program Reauthorization Act of 1997. authorizes funding for Sea Grant through fiscal year 2003. simplifies the definition of issues under the Sea Grant authority. clarifies the responsibilities of State and national programs. consolidates and clarifies the requirements for the designation of Sea Grant colleges and regional groups. and assures that the Sea Grant research will be adequately peer reviewed. It also authorizes funding for timely research on oyster diseases and oysterrelated human health risks. Pfiesteria and other harmful algae blooms and zebra mussels. Mr. Speaker. I have carefully reviewed the language in this Senatepassed legislation and find it substantially the same as that passed here. and I support the changes approved by the other body with the minor changes we are making today. By enacting this legislation. we will be sending a clear message supporting the conservation and researchedbased management of our marine and coastal resources. The Sea Grant program has been a big success. and I am pleased that after 3 years of hard work we are now poised to extend this most important environmental program. Mr. Speaker. I urge an \"aye\" vote on this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I too rise in strong support of the bill. S. 927 provides a strong reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College Program which. for over 30 years. has addressed important local. regional and national marine resource problems through education. research and public outreach. The legislation before the House is a compromise with the other body. It reauthorizes Sea Grant for 5 years. It clarifies the roles of the national office and the Sea Grant colleges. It strengthens competitive peer review for grants and contracts for research. education and outreach. and generally brings Sea Grant up to date as a modern education and research program. The authorization levels in the bill will fully fund Sea Grants ongoing base program. while providing additional funding for certain research priorities. which include nonindigenous species. oyster disease. and toxic microbe Pfiesteria. While I do not question the validity of research in these areas. I regret that some Members have felt it necessary to question whether all of these research options are necessary. One of the sea grants great strengths over the years has been its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to local and regional needs. Mr. Speaker. I think that that is something that is now involved in the program in a way that both the gentleman from New Jersey and myself can support. There is no reason to think that it will not continue to do so. that is to say. respond effectively to local needs under its usual effective peer review processes. I would like to express my appreciation for the cooperation that we in the minority have received from the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Alaska and the staffs on this bill. I can assure my colleagues that on this bill any partisan considerations were put to rest with respect to the thrust of the legislative activity under consideration. This is not. therefore. a bipartisan bill. this is a nonpartisan bill. I think all of us who represent coastal areas have long appreciated the benefits of this practical and noncontroversial program. It is a good bill. reauthorizing a popular program. I am glad we are doing it at this time. I most certainly urge the House to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. to show the support of Texas for the sea grant reauthorization. I rise in support of the National Sea Grant College program. The National Sea Grant College program was established in 1966 to provide wide stewardship over our marine and coastal resources. It is a partnership between universities. States. communities and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The mission of the sea grant program is to promote and sponsor research and education and outreach aimed at the wise use of resources and the development and effective management and conservation programs that target our Nations coastal and marine resources. Texas A&M university has a Sea Grant College at Galveston. Texas which is actually in the district of the gentleman from Texas . The program has spread throughout the Gulf Coast of Texas and throughout the whole State. I represent the port of Houston. So my home State of Texas allows individuals to learn about the ocean and the coastal environments and innovative marine technologies. The 29th district that I represent has the port of Houston and the port plays a vital part in our economy and the livelihood of our surrounding communities. Texas A&Ms Sea Grant College provides business owners. fishermen and the community groups that live and work along the port of Houston with information on how to achieve the most benefits economically while responsively conserving the environment. Without the sea grant program. the citizens of Texas and our Nation will not stay current and be innovative and competitive with the rest of the world. By reauthorizing the Sea Grant College program through the year 2003. we have ensured that we will train our future citizens. future citizens who will not only look to protect our oceans and coastal areas but also be trained to properly manage our marine resources. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. This bill makes significant improvements in the sea grant program by streamlining the proposal review process. reducing the administrative costs and clarifying the Federal and university roles in the program. This program. in its 30year history. has proven its value and worth to our country. I rise in support of the bill and I thank my colleague from Hawaii for yielding me the time and also the chairman of committee for bringing this bill forward.",

We are saddened by Ihe passing of Roland Manteiga. one ot the most pralifc. influential and admired chroniclers of politics and history In my hometown of Tampa. For decades. you could count on walking into La Tropicana In the morning and at lunch and seeing Roland dressed In his trademark white suit sitting at his private table chatting with leaders ot our community. Without fail. he always knew what was going on in Tampa politics and he faithfully shared it with his readers every week in his newspaper. La Gaceta His \"As We Heart It\" column was a must read for thousands. If you wanted to know the pulse of the town. you read Roland. The passion for the news business grabbed Roland early and hooked him. As a young boy. he started working for the paper his father. Viclodano. started in 1922. Except for his distinguished service in World War II. he spent his tile at the paper and became Its owner when his father died in 1982. He transformed the paper Into the only tnlingual weekly newspaper in the country. In addition to political news. Rolands paper was the voice ot the Latin community and reported on it better than anyone. La Gaceta thoroughly documented the story of the immigrants who came to Tampa and contributed so much to the fabrlc of our community. Rolands work won him many awards and recognitions. including Citizen of the Year and Hispanic Man of the Year. But typical o1 his selfettacing style. he always downplayed his importance to our town. His genteel manner made him equally as comlortable with presidents and governors as he was with store clerks and construction workers. And thats just one of the qualities that endeared him to so many people. I think Fardle Pacheco. the \"Fight Doctor.\" summed up Rolands contributions to our com. munty best when he wrote. \"Years from now. when we are all gone. the historians will know exactly how we were and who we were because of the lifetime of dedicated work of one man.\"",

I rise today In support of H.R. 4646. a bill allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs for Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced prices already available under the Fed. eral supply schedule. This Important piece of legislation would dramatically lower prescription drug costs Ior senior citizens. Most Americans are aware of the ever Increasing costs of health care and prescription medication. But no segment of the American population Is Impacted more than our senior citizens. Senior citizens are having an IncreasIngly difficult time affording prescription drugs. For senior citizens on fixed incomes. the cost of prescription drugs Is one of their highest monthly bills and can mean the difference between buying basic necessities or medicine. No senior should ever be forced to choose between buying food or medicine. especially those with disabling ailments who often depend on their medication just to make It through the day. Seniors are being forced to pay much steeper prces than the \"most favored customers\" of drug companies such as HMOs. its just plain wrong for large pharmacautical companies to be charging the highest prices to those who can least afford to pay them. Large corporations should not be making a profit at the expense of our senlors health. HR. 4646 would fix this problem by leveling the playing field for retail pharmacies who sell diugs to senior citizens. This legislation would allow retail pharmacies to buy medications used by senior citizens directly from the General Services Administration (GSA) of the Federal Government. Because the GSA Is one of the entities able to purchase prescription medication at much lower prices. this procedora will allow pharmacists to pass on significant savings to senior citizens. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation that protects the health of our Nations senior citizens. I urge all my colleagues to join me In supporting this leglsla. lion.",

I rise today In strong support of H.R. 2. the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act. which I believe addresses the last bastion of our failed experiment with the welfare state by ending our tragically broken Federal public housing system. The public housing system created by decades of Federal micromanagement has actually harmed these it was meant to help by penalizing work and family unity and championing neverending bureaucracy. H.R. 2 will encourage selfsufficiency. ending the rent provisions which have Illogically and disasterously penalized public housing tenants for working and at the same time encouraging community involvement and responsibility by requiring 8 hours a month or community service for unemployed individuals receiving housing assistance. I believe this legislation will create a healthier environment in public housing by admitting more working families into housing and stop the Federal Government from artificially sustaining communities mired in hopelessness and devoid of opportunity. I encourage all my colleagues to support HIl. 2. and I commend the gentleman from New York for his leadership In this legislative initiative.",

We worked very hard in the Committee on Banking and Financial Services to try to make this a better bill. And what this debate will not be about is a choice between whether we are In favor of reform or the status quo. The bill itself can be improved. And to posture this bill a the only version of reform that anybody can support and the alternative is that we are supporting the status quo Is just a very. very. very bad thing to do. and I hope my colleagues on the other side will not do it Second. this debate is not about flexibility because. while all of us support more flexibility for local housing authorities. time after time after time in this bill we are taking away flexibility from local housing authorities by mandating that they do a number of different things. not the least of which is to require occupants in public housIng to volunteer. Now. how we require somebody to volunteer and call It volunteerism. I simply do not understand. What this debate is about is how the Republicans would like to posture the poorest people in this country against those who are also working poor or the near poor. as I will call them. because that is the dilemma that this bill will put all of us in. What they want to do Is to put more and more working poor in public housIng. and that will be at the expense of the most poor people In this country and will deprive them of housing. And we are providing no funds for any additional housing under this bill. This is a paternallstio. inflexible. socalled reform bill.

We bad 100 Democrats who stood up last year for change and reform to recognise the failure of the system. What we have here again is defense of what exists. the failure that exists In many of our communities. the poverty. the superconcentration of poverty in the very backyards of some of the Members who are speaking out against this bill. I will tell my eolleagues it is an outrage in this Chamber to talk about community service a something that is to be mocked or denigrated. I ask. where were the voices in this Chamber when we asked for people who got medical scholarships to give their service to low income areas? Where were the voices In this Chamber to oppose the Presidents AmerCorps program because the only way somebody could get education Is to expect them to give back to community service. I would say to this Chanber. where Is the compassion for people who are just as poor who cannot get into public housing but have got to work 40 or 50 or 00 hours just to make ends meet? Mr. Chairman. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jonas]. a distinguished member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. for 60 years this country has essentially run its public housing program the same way year after year. For 60 years public housing has gotten worse and worse. People living in public housing should have a right to live in clean and safe conditions. and taxpayers should have a right to know that their money is being well invested. For that to happen. we must make changes. This bill will eliminate the 60yearold law which has given us rundown and unsafe public housing projects. It will give more local control. and it will require more responsiblilty from public housing residents. Mr. Chairman. for too long we have concentrated the poorest families In the worst housing. For too long we have punished public housing residents who work. We have had generations of children who have grown up in public housing complexes and never soon a parent or anyone else get up and go to work. They have only lived In projects that are covered with graffiti. overgrown with weeds and littered with empty wine bottles. The only business people they have ever known are drug dealers. prostitutes and food stamp hustlers. Mr. Chairman. that is wrong. With this bill we will begin to change the reality of life for poor children across America. For the first time in many of their lives. they will live in communities with people who work and who take responsiblity for their behavior. They will live In public housing complexes that are held accountable. Mr. Chairman. this bill may not be perfect. but It makes the right changes in the right direction. and changing the way we conduct our public housing policy Is the first step to getting positive results. 1 urge my colleagues to vote In favor of the bill.",

H.R. 2 is a piece of wall thought out. comprehensive legislation that will make a real dffference in public housing in America. We have based this legislation upon simple goals thal will move our public housing programs in a strong new direction to empower the resdents. These goals are: First. personal responsibility that extends to a mutual obligation between the provider and the recipient. One of the ways we accomplish this is through 5 hours a month work requirements lOt residents. exempting the elderly. the disabled. the employed. those who ere in school or are receiving training. and those who are already involved In a welfare reform program. Second. retention of protections for the residents. One way this Is accomplished Is through the exclusion of income for the first few months of a new job and the Income of minors from the determination of a residens Income level. Third. removal of disincentives to work and empowerment of the Individual and family tenant through choices that I believe will lead them to economic independence. One of the ways we do this is by giving residents a choice between a ffat rent or a percentage of their income. I would like to emphasize that everyone has the same. shared objective: clean. sale. al. fordable housing that empowers the havenots in our society to become people who can reallze their own American dream. We at want to realize this goat. but we just have different ideas on how to get us there. So. ti we all keep this vitlly Important objective In mind. we will be able to move forward In a unified effort to make sure that the benefits of this legislation become a reality.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today In strong support of H.R. 2. the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 1997. As a member of the Banking Committee. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the gentleman from New York for his leadership and his successful efforts in bringing this Important legislation to the floor. Families in this country have found them. selves caught In a housing system designed as a shortterm solution that Instead. has become a longterm problem. The Depression. era United States Housing Act of 1937 has evolved Into creating a centralized housing program that is both very complex and Ineffective In serving the needs of the distinct communities across the United States. It was never the intent of the Federal Government to have 57 percent of le residents of public housing to stay there for at least 5 years. The cookiecutter housing policy created by bureaucrats In Washington does not always successfully serve rural communities like te ones I represent In the Third District of Alabama. H.R 2 will return the housing policy dectsonmaking to the local level through the deregulation of the wellrun public housing authorities. Under this legislation. local communities and their PHAs will have the flaxIbility to create mIxedIncome environment by admitting low. Income families. as opposed to only verytow. income families. Mr. Speaker. we are taling about helping working families who simply cannot afford housing without some temporary assistance. Not only will the Federal Governmen help these working families by allowing Income mixing. It will create an environment where a working resident may be looked upon as a role model and Inspire another neighbor to seek empAoyment. This will allow us to break the cycle of dependency on the Federal Goemiment which has trapped so many of the residents of public housing. I urge my colleagues to support the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 1997 so that we can. once and for all. turn the Federal housing program Into a temporary assistance program instead of a permanent solution.",

In addition. 1 thank the committee for IncludIng language to correct the improper median Income calculation for Westchester and Rockland Counties. Currently. the median incomes of Westchester and Rockland Counties are calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a parl of the primary metropolitan statistical area which includes the Income data fom New York City. For this reason. HUD is listing the median Income of these two counties as being far less than they truly are. Since HUDs Income levels are used In calculating eligibility for almost all State and Federal housing programs. these Inaccurate statistics have drastically reduced the access ol both Rockland and Westchester County residents to many needed programs. A myriad ol programs have artificially tow Income caps. thus residents. financial institutions. realtors. and builders from these two counties are at a severe disadvantage In relation to their counterparts in neighboring counties. Mr. Chairman. I thank the committee and Chairman LAZIO for their great work in reformIng the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and attending to this extremely important local need. Accordingly.

While I support H.R. 1048. I rise today to express my strong dieappointment about the fact that a Clinton administration proposal to set aside onehalf of 1 percent of mandatory child care funds for allotment among the territories was dropped from the bill during the markup in the Committee on Ways and Means because the Congressional Budget Office scored the provision as having a cost to the Federal Treasury. I am disappointed. Mr. Speaker. because when the Welfare Reform Act was enacted. no mandatory child care funds were provided for over 4 million U.S. citizens residing in the United States nonState areas. even though residents of my district and the other territories have been operating child caro programs under section 402(g) of the Social Security Act. Mr. Speaker. welfare reform Is Intended to promote selfsufficiency through work. As a result. securing adequate child care funding will be one of our more pressing needs if we are to be successful in our goal of moving former welfare mothers from dependency into our work force. During the markup of HR 1048. the gentleman from Florida . chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the Committee on Ways and Means. stated that there were several provisions that would be dropped from the bill because they were scored as having a cost and not purely technical in nature. The chairman went further to state that his subcommittee will go back and take a look at those Issues that were left out of the bill as it came out of the subcommittee markup. It Is my Intention. Mr. Speaker. to work with the gentleman from Florida . the chairman. and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. LpviN]. the ranking member. to ensure that lowincome parents In the U.S. territories receive adequate child care to enable them to be able to go to work to support their families.",

One is the juxtaposition. if you will. of the amount of money that we spend on prisons versus education. Of course. we all know we have to have prisons and the Federal Government. of course. has been providing funding to build more prisons. But the bottom line is that I think that our whole reason why we think education Is such a priority is because it builds a foundation for the future and is essentially preventive. People that are well educated. It is less likely that they are going to have to be committing crime or going to prison. If we leverage the amount of money that we would spend. for example. on school construction and compare that to what would have to be spent on prison construction down the road. clearly there Is no comparison. That is why it makes sense to spend Federal dollars on school construction and renovation. I yield to the gentleman again.",

I have two small children. one is 2 and the other is Th. and I have listened to what some of the educators are saing and I can just see how true it is. that we need to spend more time. A lot of it of course is Just the family. that the family spends time reading to their ohildren or spending time with their kids. but also in terms of resources as well. on very early childhood education. because so much happens in those formative years. That is why I think programs like Head Start. which really do not even start that early. but start fairly early. and that has been a very successful program.

But even with that. if we look at Read Start and the young people who need to he there. we are still serving less than half of the young people that need to be served in that area. I was in Durham Just 2 weeks ago. and they served somewhere in the neighborhood of over 700 children in an old abandoned school that they moved out of several years ago. but they have moved Into It and done a lot of work.

We have lost a number of refineries. They are closing because there is not enough product grown anymore. because the growers cannot make a living on the current sugar price. What we see every year when we have this debate is a fight between the processors. the candy and other sugarconsuming industries. like soft drinks. and those hardy farmers who continue to struggle to remain in businesses. This is a predatory battle. and regardless of what we do today. and I hope we defeat this amendment. it will continue to be a predatory effort to eliminate sugar growers of all types in all 17 States that grow beets or cane sugar. What we see. unfortunately. is an effort to appeal to consumers and environmentalists. Frankly. if we continue to see dumping from overseas sugar interests we will see the end of this domestic industry. and then we will be at the mercy of people who bring their product here. And sugar prices would certainly increase. If we continue to take land out of agricultural production. it will not help preserve open space. Environmentalists are wrong if they oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman. the bottom line here is. for environmentalists to take up this cause and use this as a way of determining how people should vote this fall by using this issue is wrong.

I was here during the farm bill. I worked for sugar reform. I come from an area where there were reforms on cotton and on peanuts and other commodities. but I can say this. sugar was not reformed.

It is a great company in Savannah. Georgia. that refines sugar. They invited me to their 80year anniversary 2 years ago. Last year they did not. Why? Because they went out of business. They had to sell because of this governmentsanctioned cartel that kept sugar prices higher than what they could sell it for. Because of this governmentsanctioned cartel. there are people like Robert Johnson. who worked for the refinery for 18 years. whose daddy worked for the sugar refinery. who is part of the Savannah great economy. and Mr. Johnson is not sure he is going to have a job.

Our 1996 farm bill created a free domestic sugar market. We froze the support price at 1995 levels. We required the USDA to impose a penalty on producers who forfeit their crops instead of repaying marketing loans. and sugar is the only commodity with such a penalty. We even raised by 25 percent the amount that sugar growers pay in a special assessment for debt reduction. And we increased imports to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to bring more sugar into the United States if we do not produce enough. These reforms have had a significant impact on our growers. Prices have gone down. Twentythree thousand industry jobs in Michigan. and nearly 3.000 family farmers in Michigan and farm families all across the country have accepted our reforms. and they are doing the best they can under a new program.

We have an example here. The price of corn sweetener. which is in competition with sugar. has been down over 50 percent. Has it had any effect as far as consumer prices? Yes. The carbonated soft drink cost has actually gone up. almost a percent. Anyone who thinks that there is going to be a benefit to the consumer simply is not looking at what are the facts of the situation. What a lot of these folks would like to see happen is to have the price of sugar go down. put American production out. the sugar producer. the farmer. put him out of business. import a bunch of cheap sugar substitute for corn fructose in the soft drinks.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the amendment to eliminate the MAP program. I think many of us would like to see these programs eliminated. But the problem is for American agriculture that we have to compete worldwide. U.S. agriculture exported exports in excess of $55 billion in 1998. resulting in a trade surplus of $25 billion which generated over $100 billion in related economic activity. One thing that helps us achieve this laudable goal is MAP. the Market Access Program. I just returned from the ministerial meeting of the WTO in Geneva. and I can tell my colleagues. we have problems with the EU. the European Union. who heavily subsidizes their exports. And probably our biggest trade problem in agriculture is with the European Economic Union. The one thing that they really recognize and are concerned about is our program like MAP. something that helps us get the attention of customers around the world for agricultural products. If we eliminate it at this time. it is like disarming while your adversaries continue to arm. This is minuscule compared to what is spent by the European Community to promote their exports. We need to keep this program until the European Community. until the negotiators of the World Trade Organization can bring other countries to the table and eliminate their subsidies. I suggest that this is a good no vote for agriculture.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to this amendment. If we think back to the reforms we have made in our farm programs. trade is at the center. international trade is at the center of trying to prepare and improve our programs for the 21st century. If we look at the trade ledger for our country today. the only positive parts of the account exist in the areas of agriculture largely. Over a third of our domestic production is exported and. in fact. we have been experiencing a record trade surplus just in agriculture of over $30 billion annually while the rest of the budget and trade ledger is in serious deficit at historic levels. So something in what we are doing is working. and the Market Access Program is an important piece of this puzzle. If Members look at who we are in competition with. it is U.S. farmers. individual farm families. individual producers against the European Union. against Asian production. It is very important that we help these farmers move their product into the international marketplace. This program is targeted to smaller producers and to farmers cooperatives. It Is not helping the big companies. In fact. if you look at the amount of money in the program. $90 million. it does not even come close to what the European Union is currently spending. over $500 million. half a billion dollars. in trying to promote their products in the international marketplace. These exports just in agriculture represent well over a million jobs in our country. Quite frankly. unless you have dealt in the international market. you really do not understand how subsidized a lot of our competitors production actually is. Certainly their advertising programs are. So I would rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The Market Access Program is so vital to. just take one part of the agriculture industry. the apple growers in America. particularly in the Hudson Valley. We are up there. and the temperatures drop down to 30 or 40 below zero. It is tough enough to make a living as it is. But this Market Access Program has provided vital. vital help to these small farmers. to export our apples into Europe. into Israel and different places. The European Union does everything they can to stop everything from going in there. This at least gives us a little bit of an advantage. It is like promoting tourism in America. It is necessary. Promoting this kind of a program is so vital to the small dairy farmers in America. Please defeat this probably wellintentioned amendment by a wellintentioned Member. but it is a bad amendment.

Agriculture exports about $55 billion. For each $1 billion. there are about 20.000 American jobs. It is extremely important to maintain this program so that we can compete in the world market. We have got to also understand that this program is on a 50/50 basis with the producer out there who is paying half of the cost. The corn growers. the Soybean Association. the pork producers. the beef folks. the cattlemen pay their share to make sure that they have the opportunity to promote their American product overseas and to make sure that the jobs stay here in the United States rather than have our foreign competitors take away our jobs. This is extremely important to continue this very. very valuable program. I would certainly urge a strong no vote to this illadvised amendment.",

There is a great interest in a bipartisan way to see us move ahead with the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1997. and the other suspension which we are hoping to bring up today. if we can move ahead with this rule. is the American Samoan Development Act of 1997.

Yes. let us continue on with the investigations. but what we in fact do know is that the system is broken and that it needs to be fixed. Let us have that discussion. The 1996 elections broke all records for campaign spending: $2.7 billion. The Washington Post shows that 8 in 10 Americans agree that money has. quote. too much influence on who wins elections. The amount of money in politics disenchants the American people and tells citizens. ordinary citizens in this country. that their votes are not as important as fundraising dollars. The record amounts spent in 1996 are a powerful argument for meaningful limits on campaign spending. We need less money in politics. not more. And if we are to achieve limits on campaign spending. we need to act immediately. because every delay takes us closer to the next election. I doubt the American people want more money spent the way that the Speaker would. Let us have the debate on campaign finance reform. and let us just stop fooling around.",

Why are you spending millions of dollars on investigations and doing nothing to help us?\" I believe that from my experience if we cannot find people who care about campaign finance reform we are not looking very hard.

We could only take $1.000 from an individual or $5.000 from a PAC. we must report everything we receive and everything we spend. and that system did not break down. and no one is accusing it of having broken down. There is another system for Presidential campaigns. If they accept $75 million of taxpayer money. they may not spend a penny more. That is precisely what Bob Dole did. that is not what President Clinton did. He accepted the $75 million. and he spent $40 million more than that. He admitted to doing that. but he said it was necessary to break the law because \"we would have lost.\" Now.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote in favor of the Craig amendment that would require specific congressional authorization for the deployment of troops to Bosnia. However. I would like to make clear that I am supporting this amendment for reasons that I think differ slightly from the intentions of its author. the distinguished Senator from Idaho. As my colleagues in this Chamber know well. I have always had serious questions about U.S. involvement in this mission. I was the only Democrat to vote against the deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995. in large part because I did not believe the United States would be able to complete the mission in the time projected and for the price tag that was originally estimated. Nowmore than two years laterI think I have been proven right. and I take no pleasure in it. But. regardless of my objections to the mission. I have always felt it is vitally important that when largescale deployment of U.S. troops is involved. it is necessary to have specific congressional authorization for it. And I have tried on several occasions to move the Congress to enact such authorization. In that light. I view the Craig amendment as another such attempt. Unlike Senator CRAIG. however. I support the expansion of NATO and do not feel this amendment is inconsistent with that support. Unlike Senator CRAIG. I am not necessarily opposed to the involvement of NATO in peacekeeping missions. There may be times in the future when it would be appropriate for NATO to become involved in peacekeeping missions when conflicts threaten the security of NATO members. But I do agree with Senator CRAIG that if and when these situations arise. if the deployment of U.S. troops is proposed. it will be necessary to get specific Congressional authorization for such deployment. It is for this reason that I support Senator CRAIGs amendment.",

The New York Times reports this in the terms we have been speaking about on this floor. the exact same terms. with no idea that was coming. It says. \"Russias Disarray Brings a Nuclear Risk to the U.S.. Study Says.\" The Physicians write. \"Although many people believe that the threat of a nuclear attack largely disappeared with the end of the cold war there is considerable evidence to the contrary. Each side routinely maintains thousands of nuclear warheads on high alert. Furthermore. to compensate for its weakened conventional forces. Russia has abandoned its nofirst use policy.\" Madam President. that is all I and my friend from Virginia has said on this floor this week of debate and when the expansion of NATO was debated a month ago.

Is he aware that that doctrine which was changed in 1992 had nothing to do with the expansion of NATO? In 1992. when the Russian military realized that they. in fact. had imploded when they were incapable of defending their borders. they did exactly what NATO did when we concluded we did not have the conventional force capacity to stop an allout attack in Europe and indicated that we would use nuclear weapons if. in fact. we were attacked. I ask my friendI am fascinated by his rendition. and I share his concern about the hair trigger. But is he suggesting the decision in 1992 where Russia declared that it would not any longer abide by its previous policy of no first use of nuclear weaponsis he aware that was long before the contemplation of expansion of NATO?",

I rise today to offer an amendment to S. 947. the Budget Reconciliation Act. that will redress what I assume to be an inadvertent omission in a section of this bill that discriminates against Amerasian children of U.S. military personnel who served in Vietnam. My amendment will add a new provision to section 5817 to include Amerasian children to the category of legal aliens eligible for Medicaid. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 excluded from eligibility these children of American soldiers because they are admitted as refugees under section 584 of the Foreign Operations. Export Financing. and Related Programs Act of 1988. rather than section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. under which refugees are excepted from the Welfare Region legislations ban on Medicaid. SSI. and other forms of assistance. This amendment corrects that oversight. Because there is a cost associated with this amendment. I propose to offset it by mandating that the Attorney General of the United States. acting through the Immigration and Naturalization Service. impose a $150 processing fee on each illegal alien deported from the United States who committed a felony while in this country. According to CBO. this will generate the revenue necessary to offset the cost of my amendment over the 5year period for which the welfare bill excludes aliens from Medicaid eligibility.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take this time to discuss an amendment that would give families with uninsured children the opportunity to obtain proper health coverage. Congress is constantly searching for ways to provide children with adequate health care. and I have proposed an amendment that would allow children the means to be covered. My amendment would give the working poor health expense accounts to use for their families. It is reported that there are 10 million children who are uninsured in the United States. Many of these children are uninsured because their parents have incomes that are high enough to be ineligible for Medicaid or do not have private or employersponsored health insurance. My amendment would allow families to deposit money in a medical savings account to use for health care services. I believe it is critical to provide lower income families with the option to establish medical savings accounts. MSAs allow consumers to pay for medical expenses through affordable taxdeductible plans that are most suited to their needs. Americans want choice in health care. It is time for the Federal Government to listen to the American people and make medical savings accounts an available option. Medical savings accounts are a viable freemarket approach to ensuring greater access to affordable health care coverage for the uninsured. Through MSAs. individuals would be given the choice and opportunity to obtain affordable health services. I believe our efforts need to be focused on providing uninsured children with accessible health care services. My amendment would give these families the opportunity of setting aside MSA funds. especially benefiting those who are selfemployed. between jobs. or employed where health coverage is not available. I am hopeful that in the 105th Congress. we will be able to expand the availability of medical savings accounts. Medical savings plans allow individuals the freedom to shop for competitive health care services. which in turn. can help keep the costs of health care down. My amendment is one step to achieving the goal of decreasing the number of uninsured children by providing families with the option to receive much needed health care coverage. By making more MSAs available. we can make it easier for parents to finance their childrens health care. after all. the health of our Nations children is at stake.",

President Clinton and supporters of MFN for China. have taken on a new burdento show they are serious about finding a way to persuade China to stop abusing its citizens rights. stop unfair trade practices. stop sending weapons of mass destruction to rogue regimes. and live up to its commitments on Hong Kong. The debate over China policy is far from over. During the coming weeks and months. I will be considering new measures on China. For example. Mr. President. the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold hearings on legislation to deal with serious problems in the United StatesChina relationship. and on the commercial activities of the Peoples Liberation Army in the United States. I do hope that Senators who have asserted that there is a better way to influence China than revoking MFN will work with the Foreign Relations Committee in finding that better way.",

In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce. I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of \"till death us do part\" seriously. demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love. honor. and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. For these important reasons. I rise today to honor Dorothy and Roy Zinzer of Affton. Missouri. who on June 19. 1997. celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. My wife. Janet. and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Zinzers commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.",

We had a vote. 350 Members voted to do that. And now we have had two other votes. my vote and the vote on the Fossella amendment. In three cases now we have decided that legal permanent aliens should not contribute. So my point is that I think it is easy to identify.

Let me just read a portion of this so we can clarify it: No candidate for election to the office of President or Vice President may receive amounts from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund unless the candidate certifies that the candidate shall not solicit any funds for the purpose of influencing such election. including any funds used for an independent expenditure. unless the funds are subject to the limitations. prohibitions and reporting requirements under the law. The reason I offer this amendment. of course. is that. again. some of the testimony in the Senate hearing that brought forth the clear intent. And so we need to establish that a candidate for President and Vice President will certify that they are going to comply and that they have a full understanding so that they cannot use rigorous. specious logic to say they were not aware. There was a lot of testimony that came out from Dick Morris. which I have here. and I will. Mr. Chairman. include Dick Morriss testimony as a part of the RECORD so I do not have to read the whole thing. I just would like to summarize some of the things that he testified to that committee and that is why I think the certification is required. The President reviewed and modified and approved all advertising copy. reviewed and adjusted and approved media time buys. reviewed and modified polling questions. received briefings on and analyzed polling results. So the President had significant involvement with the DNC media consultants in the area of polling. advertising. speech writing. legislation strategy and general policy advice. I think that is. frankly. what the ShaysMeehan bill is trying to prevent.

So I am not categorically going after Mr. Morris or anybody but other than to say this is a clear example of what the committee on the Senate was talking about. which we need to prevent.

And we talked about the groups that supported ShaysMeehan. and one of those groups is Public Campaign that has been running newspaper ads in my district against me for the last day or two and also in the Washington Post. and. as I said earlier. I did not particularly like it. but I think they have a right to do that. That is an issue ad in my view. I think they have a right to do that. but they really pounded me because they said. \"ED WHITFIELD is trying to triple the amount of money that an individual can give.\" and yet I find It quite ironic that one of their largest contributors is a guy named Mr. Solls. who is one of the wealthiest men in the world. He contributes heavily to them. So I guess that sometimes it just depends upon who gives the money. but I think that we are doing a great disservice to our political system if we prevent individuals from giving up to $3.000 to candidates that they have confidence in. that they believe in and they want to support. particularly when they know that challengers are not going to receive political action committee money.

This amendment would move $50 million into the Land and Water Conservation Fund Stateside Grant Program and reduce funding for the National Endowment for the Arts by $50 million. The Stateside Grant Program. which is a matching grant program. helps States in recreational and open space efforts. This is a very good bill and it is a lean year.

I think we have here obviously a conflict of major things within one appropriations bill. The fact is that we won that battle for the arts by 253 to 173. I would hope we do not have to fight that every day the bill remains before us. But it seems to me the answer to the gentlemans question on the how to acquire land and open space and all the rest means that the Forest Service ought to start prioritizing its various forests. portions of various forests. and we ought to be talking about land exchanges. not moving money from the arts. which means a lot to thousands of schoolchildren in America and millions of other people. I am sure the chairman has explored that. but I would think we need to be more vigorous in the Forest Service in classifying the weaker part of a forest with the richer part of the forest and making the availability of millions of acres. which perhaps would gain the type of space the gentleman needs closer to the urban populations that would profit from it. I would hope the gentleman might go that route. rather than create a friction within the House of Representatives of the arts versus trees. because a lot of us are for both of them.",

Both sides of the aisle seem to muddy the waters with rhetoric that does nothing more than to exacerbate emotionalism and further ignore scientific reality. It is for this very reason that I am proud to announce an event being held later this month in my home state of Nevada. This event is specifically designed to cut through such rhetoric and provide real solutions to fight one of our most pressing environmental problemsthe control of oxides of nitrogen or NOx. one of the most pervasive air pollutants. The Gunnerman Foundation and numerous other federal. state. and industry organizations are sponsoring The ReNOx 98 Conference in Reno from July 26th through July 28th. Developing solutions to NOx is just yet another in a long line of success stories for Gunnerman Foundation Chairman Rudy Gunnerman. Ten years ago. Mr. Gunnerman was called an alarmist for bringing to light critical air pollution problems. I call him a pioneer. His leadership has spurred technology and policy innovations on air pollution issues for over two decades. Similarly. this conference will stimulate action on the issue NOx. This conference will bring together industry. government and community interests to address barriers and develop policy recommendations that will benefit NOx reduction strategies. NOx emissions come from cars and trucks. coalburning power plants. and industrial combustion and waste disposal operations. NOx emissions increased over 220 percent between 1940 and 1996. with a 9 percent rise from 1970 to 1996. NOx interacts with other compounds in the air to form groundlevel ozone and acid rainprimary threats to human health and the environment. These critical air pollution problems have levied serious costs on our society. which range from asthma and other respiratory illnesses to the deterioration of our lakes. forests. soils. and our national monuments. Therefore. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Gunnerman Foundation and Rudy Gunnerman for sponsoring this worthwhile forum. I invite my colleagues to join this effort to develop real solutions to an environmental problem that deserves our attention and commitment.",

I dont think there is much disagreement about that issue. But I ask the Senator from Minnesota. is it the case that. when we talk about overtime pay for American workers. 80 percent of the workers in this country that are getting overtime pay are workers earning less than S28.000 a year? Then therefore. by definition. these are workers somewhere toward the lower end of the economic scale who get less than 328.000 a year. and many of them rely on overtime pay. They need it. It is very important to them. To the extent that anybody opposes a bill that says lets provide flexibility in the workplace in a manner that might threaten the opportunity for those who want and need the overtime pay. especially those at the bottom of the pay scale. boy. that is not moving in the right direction in terms of providing flexibility.

In an effort to make it easier for persons with disabilities to work. this legislation will allow the Federal Government to take the lead in providing Federal employees who have disabilities with critical access to technological tools in the workplace. The Federal Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Compliance Act of 1997 strengthens Federal requirements that electronic tools and information technology purchased by Federal agencies be made accessible to their employees. Additionally. it would require States that receive Federal resources toward disability programs to meet accessibility guidelines when they purchase technology. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires such compliance. but currently there is no enforcement mechanism to assure that this is done. The House of Representatives today passed similar legislation introduced by Representative ANNA ESHO0. Barriers to Information and technology must be broken down. By giving Federal employees with disabilities the opportunity to utilize technological advancements. we provide them hope and encourage selfsufficiency. Additionally. I believe these new efforts will encourage the private sector to adopt similar procedures. Let the Federal Government provide a good example to the private sector in its efforts. Concrete examples of technological advancements that have aided persons with disabilities include: Telephones and fax machines with voice features for the visually impaired. voice mail that is converted for the deaf or hearing impaired. and CDROM or networkbased Information systems that can be equipped with audio descriptions of visual elements. Nationally. there are 49 million Americans who have disabilities. It is critical. Mr. President. that given the rapid introduction of new technologies. persons with disabilities not be allowed to fall behind. The more we can do to promote their equality. independence. and dignity. the better. I want to commend Mr. William Paul of United Technologies Corp.. In my state of Connecticut. for first bringing this matter to my attention. Mr. Paul has identified a critical need among members of our society. His civicminded actions deserve to be commended not only by people with disabilities. but by all Americans. Mr. President.

Infants. and Children. or WIG. nutrition program. I must say. we are far from home free on this Issue. The Senate. unfortunately. has provided only W56 million for WIC. and Democrats today will offer a resolution on the House floor stating that the House should stand firm in Its negotiations and demand that the Senate agree to restore funding for the remaining 85.000 atrisk women and children. Republicans also voted yesterday for automatic cuts that could undermine the commitment for WTC by freezing funding for it at. current levels. this years level. The President has made it clear he will veto this funding bill if that is what It Includes. but I have to say that we still have a lot of work to do to make sure that the full funding is provided for WIg.

First. the California law provides further information about toxins present in childrens consumer products and eventually In consumer products for adults. based on this very successful 10yearold program and law in California.

Balancing efforts to remove unnecessary regulations. improve competition and protect consumers is never easy. but I think this bill balances all those important goals and will contribute to strengthening the financial services industry and promote new products for consumers. I would like to comment in particular on sections 222 and 223 of the bill which I believe will promote competition and increase the quality of financial products available to consumers. These sections will lift some outdated restnctions from limitedpurpose banks and allow these institutions to offer new products consistent with their charter. crossmarket the financial products of their affiliates. offer business credit cards to their customers. and correct problems in a reasonable period of time in consultation with the Federal Reserve. These changes will increase the products available to consumers without unfairly affecting other financial service providers.

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4364. the Depository Institution Regulatory Streamlining Act. This legislation represents the tireless efforts of many of my colleagues. especially the gentleman from Washington. Mr. METCALF. H.R. 4364 is a well balanced legislative package of financial services regulatory relief. I was pleased when provisions from my legislation. H.R. 4082. were included in this bill and know that these provisions will help banks better serve their customers. One of these provisions will allow banks to conduct \"24 sweeps\" in a given month for their commercial checking customers. Currently. banks are prohibited from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. These sweeps allow banks to move funds sitting in a commercial checking account into an interest bearing account daily after all transactions have occurred in the commercial account. The next morning the money would then be \"swept\" back into the commercial accounts. with interest. Currently. banks are only allowed to do this six times a month. Operation of additional sweeps each month would not affect the safety and soundness of banks and will allow banks to pay interest on commercial checking accounts. In my discussions with banks. I have found that complying with this provision would take minimal effort since we will only be increasing their ability to sweep from six times a month to 24. This initiative represents a real \"winwin\" for banks and businesses.

S. 2561. the Consumer Reporting Employment Clarification Act of 1998 amends the Fair Crediting Reporting Act FCRA to revise certain changes that were made to the act last Congress. Some of these changes had inadvertent consequences on the trucking industrys hiring practices. Specifically. the bill amends the FCRA to remove burdensome restrictions so that trucking companies will be able to conduct background investigations of driver applicants in a timely and efficient manner to help ensure highway safety. S. 2561 has bipartisan support and the agreement of the Federal Trade Commission and consumer advocacy groups. The bill is also strongly supported by the American Trucking Association and the Truckload Carriers Association. The legislation also amends the FCRA so employers have access to critical information in order to make informed hiring decisions. Current law exempts convictions of crime from consumer reports after 7 years for individuals applying for jobs with an annual salary of less than $75.000. S. 2561 would remove this exemption. Such information is particularly crucial in the hiring process for employers in the area of child or elderly care. school bus driving. and household services. This bill provides for small changes to the FCRA that will have a significant impact on the efficiency of many employers hiring practices. resulting in a safer environment for all.

Senators CONNIE MACK and RICHARD BRYAN. and Senate Assistant Majority Leader DON NICKLES--Oklahomas Senior Senatorfor their hard work on and their support of this legislation that will streamline the trucking industrys hiring of competent. professional. and safe truck drivers. Unfortunately. current Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulations have forced the trucking industry to add multiple. unnecessary steps to its hiring procedures. Worse. because of burdensome paperwork requirements under these regulations. and because the industry is currently facing a critical shortage of drivers. many carriers have been forced to put drivers behind the wheel before their safety records can be verified. This is not what Congress intended when it enacted changes to the FCRA. This legislation will expedite the process by which employment background information is exchanged between truck company employers and truck drivers. Instead of having to obtain written consent from a potential employee to procure a consumer report. truck company employers will not be able to obtain a potential employees consent by mail. over the telephone. or by means of computer or fax machine. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. It has received the endorsement of the Federal Trade Commission--which enforces the FCRAmajor credit institutions. consumer advocacy groups. and is strongly supported by the American Truckers Association and by trucking companies and truckers in Oklahoma.

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy are currently responsible for overseeing components of the worlds largest stockpiles of nuclear weapons. materials. and infrastructures. It is within the responsibilities of these two agencies to address the environmental impacts of nuclear activities resulting from the cold war. It is my understanding that these two agencies have recognized their responsibilities and are discussing the formation of ICES to address these important areas of responsibility. The establishment of ICES enjoys strong support among DOE officials and representatives in the field. The primary mission of ICES would be to resolve environmental issues associated with the production and management of nuclear weapons materials. decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. and restoration of associated sites. ICES would be particularly helpful in assisting Russia decontaminate and decommission its obsolete nuclear submarine fleet. especially its spent nuclear fuel. The centers will draw upon the wealth of knowledge. expertise and technologies within the existing scientific infrastructures to accomplish these objectives. In March of 1998. Russian Minister Adamov proposed to former Secretary of Energy Pena that ICES be established in the United States and Russia. Minister Adamov proposed that these centers be modeled after the International Nuclear Safety Centers that were established under former Secretary OLeary and former Minister Mikhailov in January. 1996. Minister Adamov suggested that the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and the Russian Research and Development Institute of Power and Engineering serve as the host sites for the centers. Subsequent discussions have been held between Minister Adamov and Secretary Richardson. I agree that the INEEL is the optimal site for this new mission because of its facilities and technical expertise working with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials. Mr. Speaker. I urge Congress to support DOEs efforts to deal- with the important environmental impacts associated with the cold war and to support the creation of ICES.",

As a matter of fact. we do not even know who half a million of them are. The purpose of this amendment is for those people that we do know who they are.

How much is doing enough when somebody is going to die between now and next year? When 6.000 people are going to die?

Have my colleagues ever heard the gentlewoman from California say we have done enough for AIDS prevention. AIDS research. and AIDS care? Never. This is not what this is about. This is about taking one deserving program and pitting it against another for funding and. on emotional value. against other deserving programs. We know there is an AIDS epidemic. But let us talk about funding AIDS programs by cutting the B2 bomber program. $2.2 billion for each B2 bomber that will not even fly in the rain. Would that not be a good way to fund AIDS programs. AIDS research. AIDS care. and AIDS prevention? Let us talk about AIDS prevention. Why are we not talking about education and programs that teach our children about safe sex and about contraception? Why are we not talking about needle exchange programs so that we will prevent AIDS in the first place? Let us stop talking about pitting one deserving program against another. Refugees are deserving. Civil rights programs are deserving. Veterans are certainly deserving. AIDS patients need care. we need the research. and we need to take care of every single AIDS patient in America. This is America. We have enough. We could take care of every AIDS patient if we chose. and we could do it without pitting these funds against other deserving funding programs. We must have the will. That is what is missing. It appears that we do not have the will to take care of deserving people unless we take away from other deserving programs and other deserving populations. I say.

I would hope that the recognition of need will not go away. It will still be there. May I just say another thing. The gentleman said there is no help for people with HIV. ADAP drugs are administered to people with HIV. and. in fact. the best prospects are when people take these drugs earlier. because the immune system has not been as devastated as it would be in a person who has a more veteran case of AIDS or HIV.

But the questions that were raised a moment ago that this money was taken from deserving programs. let us talk about where the money is coming from again. Almost $10 million from the Office of the Secretary. the General Department of Management and Policy Research. That is a good thing for Americans to spend their money on. while 6.000 people die? I agree that if this body thinks that that is what we should do. then that will be the will of the House. I do not believe that Is what the minority party believes. They do not believe we ought to spend $10 million additional. above what the President requested. on general policy research and general department management. instead of spending extra money to help people live with HIV and prevent them from dying. So we are really not contrasting deserving programs. We are talking about people who do not have available to them drugs. and. because they do not. they will not be with us a year from now. Mr. Chairman. I do not want to leave this body saying I voted to spend money on a bureaucrat and let 6.000 people die in the streets of this country from AIDS. when we could have prevented it.

For all of my colleagues listening today. I want them all to remember and to understand that there are a lot of us here that have not forgotten that all of these dollars that they are talking about spending are coming from hardworking people out in America. We are very concerned when we see a spending increase in a particular bill of $5.2 billion. or 7 percent. in one portion of the budget. Many of us out here are concerned that the overall spending level is too high. but that is what was agreed to in the budget agreement. and that is what has brought on this debate about which programs the money should be spent on. Mr. Chairman. for my colleagues. I would like them all to know many of us are very. very concerned. and remember through all of these debates that this is the peoples money that we are spending. and these dollars that they are talking about spending on various programs are coming from the people through their hardearned work that are collected in taxes and brought out here to Washington.

In that agreement the majority got tax cuts that it sought and restraints in entitlement increases In the future that it sought. in return for certain agreements to provide for priorities that the minority sought.

It is not a simple subject but the question is simple. When I first came to Congress. 1975. it is a long time ago. the fashion in political advocacy was to use the word \"defense.\" Everything that had a \"defense\" in it was going to have a leg up in passage. The Defense Education Act. In the Clinton era. the key phrase was \"change.\" We all campaigned as agents of change. Lately. family values has become a universal aspiration. We all stand foursquare for family values. One family value is parental responsibility. Any program that deliberately bypasses parents to provide birth control devices to minors. in my judgment. is an egregious violation of family values. It is little less than legitimating promiscuity. What kind of a lesson do we teach? We teach youngsters. young ladies in particular. young women. to conceal from their parents the fact that they are engaged in sexual activity and we. the clinic. will facilitate. if not condone. that activity by providing condoms. drugs. or pills. We legislate as though every family or most families are dysfunctional. I submit there are dysfunctional families but they are the minority and not the majority. Sexual activity has serious. serious consequences. the movies on cable television notwithstanding. We frustrate family values by legitimating the concealment from parents of a childs participation in activity of the most sensitive. intimate. and consequential nature. We should be strengthening parental rights. not diminishing them. I suggest a vote for the Manzullo and Istook amendment is the appropriate one. I think if you vote for Istook and Manzullo and vote against the Castle amendment. a gentleman for whom I have boundless admiration but do not agree with him in this situation. oppose the substitute and vote for Istook and Manzullo. and then if you do that. you can campaign for family values with a straight face.",

I am pleased that the Leader has allowed it to come to the floor and encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. President. the bill reforms and reauthorizes discretionary agricultural research programs that play an important role in keeping our nations farmers competitive in the ever expanding world market.

The bills reforms will ensure more collaboration and efficiency in federally funded research and provide for greater accountability to the American taxpayers. The bill also provides $600 million over the next five years in mandatory funding to the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. This new mandatory spending will provide $120 million per year on a competitive grant basis for six high priority mission areas: agricultural genome research. food safety. food technology. and human nutrition. new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and products. agricultural biotechnology. natural resource management. including precision agriculture. and farm efficiency and profitability. In addition. the bill addresses the immediate concerns facing all those who rely on federal crop insurance. provides for the Fund for Rural America. and funds food stamps for the elderly. disabled. and children of the nations poorest immigrants. Mr. President. more than just a reauthorization bill. the legislation before the Senate today is an investment in the future and represents our commitment to Americas farm families. By providing the technical research and extension activities that help expand farm income. improve resource management. and develop new crop varieties. federally funded agricultural research assures that our nation will continue to lead the world in farm production and help bolster the stability of our rural areas.

S. 1618. which addresses the unauthorized switching of telephone service carriers by competing service providers. This abusive practice has become an increasing problem in my home state of Colorado where slamming has grown at an alarming rate. Last October. Chairman BURNS of the Communications Subcommittee of the Commerce. Science. and Transportation Committee held a field hearing in Denver on this issue. In addition to this hearing. antislamming legislation has recently passed the Colorado State Legislature. With Colorado as one of the nations top five states in complaintspermillion customers. I intend to vote for this antislamming legislation. I also am pleased that S. 1618 incorporates provisions from my AntiSlamming Bill. S. 1051 which I introduced on July 22. 1997. This language requires that the FCC annually report to Congress the \"Top Ten\" slammers for each year. as well as carriers assessed fines or penalties during the same period. The \"Top Ten\" list identifies those carriers subject to the highest number of subscriber slamming complaints compared to the total number of subscribers they serve. This ratio approach ensures that large companies are not automatically singled out by virtue of having a large customer base. The focus of my \"Top Ten\" amendment is on those companies with the highest percentage of slamming complaints relative to their total customer base. This \"Top Ten\" list will give Congress an annual opportunity to review and publicly comment on this serious problem known as \"slamming\". I am convinced that this approach coupled with the language in S. 1618. will prove valuable in deterring carriers from engaging in illegal tactics.",

The losses every year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. My amendment will help law enforcement to more effectively combat these abuses. Today. its all too easy for telemarketing ripoff artists to profit from the current system. How do these ripoffs occur? Advertisements regarding sweepstakes. contests. loans. credit reports and other promotions appear in newspapers. magazines. and other direct mail and telephone solicitations. The operators of many of these phoney promotions set up a telephone boiler room for a few months in which a number of phones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads. They steal thousandseven millionsof dollars from innocent victims and then they simply disappear. They take the money and runmoving on to another location to start all over again. Heres just one example. Not too long ago. 30.000 Iowans received postcards from an organization calling itself Sweepstakes International. Inc. The postcard enticed recipients to call a 900number and they were charged $9.95 on their phone bill. Based on a Postal Service investigation. civil action was initiated in U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result. the promotion was halted and $1.7 million was frozen. This represented just one and a half months revenue from the scam! My amendment will protect telemarketing victims by providing law enforcement the authority to more quickly obtain the name. address. and physical location of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. Phone companies would have to provide law enforcement officials only the name. address and physical location of a telemarketing business holding a phone number if the officials submitted a formal written request for this information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation. It will make it easier for officers to identify and locate these operations. This is similar to the procedure that is already in place for post office box investigations. Mr. President. it is necessary to crack down on serious consumer fraud. With this change. we will have many more successful efforts to shut down these ripoffs artists like several recent cases in my home state of Iowa.",

To help combat the problem of child pornography through the Internet. through computer technology. the U.S. Customs Service established the ICPICC in April 1996. ICPICC is staffed by special agents with expertise in both child pornography and computers. There is a need to adequately direct Federal resources toward attacking the problem of child exploitation over the Net. The U.S. Customs Service has long been recognized by law enforcement and the international community for its knowledge and skill in investigating cases of child pornography and child exploitation. Mr. Chairman. it is my understanding that all members of the Committee on Rules expressed support for my amendment. so it should have been made in order. but it was not.

As I heard the gentleman from New Jersey speak of great tragedy. so many of us can cite incidences in our neighborhoods or in our cities or in our States that we much rather not discuss. and I am reminded of the time I was on the city council in Houston when a 3yearold was sexually molested and then killed by a recently released sexual predator who continued to deny to the very end. And not only did that occur. but they had to have two trials. One of the trials wound up with a hung jury. and so it put the family through that crisis again. In fact. I hope that this legislation. when passed. will be a tribute to that little life that was unnecessarily lost. And so the provision in this bill that clarifies that Federal kidnapping investigations do not require a 24hour waiting period and can be initiated immediately is crucial. How many times we have frustrated the law enforcement officers who have wanted to go out immediately once they have determined that there has been an abduction. This bill clarifies that. It also permits the government to seek pretrial detention of someone accused of a Federal rape and child sex abuse or child pornography. That means that individual is not out and able to attack others. And then. of course. it directs the Justice Department to establish a special center to investigate child abductions. child homicides and serial homicides. These particular provisions in this legislation are extremely crucial for untying the hands of our law enforcement officers and. of course. paying really a tragic tribute to those lives that we have lost and hoping that we will have this kind of legislation to prevent future loss. Mr. Chairman. I have no additional speakers at this time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to support the Child Protection Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998 and to urge its adoption by the House. As a longtime computer user. I am very aware of the many benefits the Internet presents. It allows people to communicate. learn. appreciate art and music. and collaborate across great distances. However as a parent of two young children. I am disturbed by what we have learned. Personally I can say that my children already use computers and take advantage of the World Wide Web. As we move into the 21st .century and the high technology future. Americas children will not have a choice. They will be expected to use computers at a young age to get ahead. Unfortunately the growing problem of child stalkers and predators is all too real and alarming. The situation will only increase as computers find their way into more homes. We know that children will always find a way onto the computer. for example. their schools or the home of a friend. so we must make sure cyberspace is a safe place. The evidence of the type of dangerous. sick behavior of predators presented to the Committee on the Judiciary is an issue that we must confront and develop intelligent approaches to protect our Nations youth. Congress has a role of protecting our most precious resource. our children. The Subcommittee on Crime did it the right way. holding much more hearings and listening to an array of experts. The Internet and computers pose very difficult and novel questions for lawmakers. as I am sure the gentleman from North Carolina and the rest of the intellectual property community know. Yet. I urge each Member to support this bill that will help make the Internet a safer environment for family and legitimate users. In closing I want to commend the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Illinois",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding this time to me. When we consider an issue like child pornography. we need to understand that issue. A recent poll showed that most people in the United States know little about child pornography and understand little about it. They are surprised when they learn that child pornography is the tool of choice used by child molesters and pedophiles to entice young children into sexual activity. They also are unaware that most sexual pedophiles. sexual predators. possess child pornography that is usually on their person or found in their homes. They also. in fact. ask very often how does child pornography. how is it even created? How does it begin? Mr. Chairman. we can answer all three of those questions with one answer. and that is. and the final report of the Commission on Pornography outlined this. why sexual predators use pornography. why they always possess it. how child pornography is created. And Dr. Shirley OBrien. there was an attachment of her study on this. and it shows that this is how child pornography is created. Child pornography is shown to a child by an adult. 2. the adult uses the materials to convince the child that the depicted sexual act is acceptable. even desirable. 3. the material desensitizes the child. lowering his or her inhibitions. 4. some of the sessions progress to sexual activities involving the child. 5. photographs or home movies are taken of the activity. and finally the nude pornographic material is used to lure more child victims and also to keep the victim from talking about the experience. So. as we discuss this issue. bottom line. let us remember that child pornography is used in every community in America to lure children into this child abuse.",

The bill we have before us today. the sexual predator bill. is one which has been long overdue. dealing with serial killers. serial rapists. but. most of all. pedophiles who use the Internet. It is amazing how many of them go into the chat rooms of this Nation and actually engage children. Usually they do this. as I understand it. for a considerable period of time. when they pretend often to be other children. What they are doing is gaining the confidence of this child. without the child realizing it is an adult on the other end. let alone a pedophile. Then they will gradually engage in sexually explicit conversations. and building up. often times. sending pornographic material to that child. and. finally. trying to meet that child out on the street somewhere. Current laws at the Federal level do not allow for the arrest and the conviction of somebody until they have actually induced in some manner the child to actually go meet with them somewhere to engage in a sexual activity. The key portion of this bill. and there are a lot of other things in it. is to make sure when there is contact made over the Internet for the first time by a predator like this with a child. with the intent to engage in sexual activity. whatever that contact is. as long as the intent is there to engage in that activity. he can be prosecuted for a crime. I think that is an exceedingly important change in this bill. There are a lot of other things in here with wideranging importance. but that is number one. and it is the heart of this bill. to get to the Internet problem.",

There are a number of problems inherent to a national namecheck system. Such a system could result in many misidentification and cause the government and any misidentified individuals much embarrassment and unnecessary complications in their lives.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 3493. the \"Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act.\" a critical measure to protect Americas children from the dangers that lurk on the Intenet. The McCollumDunn bill increases federal penalties for sexual predators and defines new sex crimes against children. ensuring that our criminal code keeps pace with rapidlyexpanding technology. This measure provides the tools we need to keep our children safe while allowing them to take advantage of all the benefits of the information superhighway. We live in an age of incredible access to vast amounts of information. and the Internet is quickly becoming an integral part of our lives. For our children. this represents a wonderful opportunity to gain knowledge and enhance their educational experiences. Unfortunately. it also represents a terrifying new way for some in our society to prey on innocent children. Increasingly. pedophiles and sexual predators are using the anonymity of the Internet to lure children into dangerous situations. Given the estimates that 20 million children will have access to the Internet by the year 2000. it is clear that urgent action is needed to combat this situation. In addition. Mr. Chairman. I would like to register my support for the amendment offered by Representative CONYERS regarding violence against women. Domestic violence is one of the most disturbing and pervasive problems in our society. and I commend my colleague from Michigan for his efforts on behalf of women throughout this country who should not be forced to live in fear of emotional and physical abuse to themselves and their children. I hope my colleagues will join with me today in sending a strong message to sexual predators that we will not tolerate the abuse of our children any longer. The Internet is quickly causing community boundaries to disappear. and we have learned that it is no longer enough to focus our efforts on the local level. We must ensure that children are safe not only at home and at school. but also as they continue to explore the exciting new world of cyberspace. H.R. 3494 provides the strong protections required to combat the unconscionable and indefensible actions of pedophiles and sexual predators. wherever they may occur. and I will proudly vote for its passage.",

The provisions in this amendment will strengthen the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act and help us continue our work to combat domestic violence. Every nine seconds. as we stand here on the House floor. another woman will be physically abused. Threequarters of these women will be assaulted by someone they know. It is impossible for us to know how many cases of this appalling crime go unreported. The Violence Against Women Act has helped us to combat this problem by providing grants to states to help set up rape crisis hotlines. counseling programs. and professional training for police officers to help them recognize and deal with domestic violence. The Conyers Amendment will strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. It contains provisions to help limit the effects of violence on children. to help prevent sexual assault from ever happening. and to protect women who have been the victims of domestic violence. Mr. Speaker. when we pass the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act. Congress will be taking a tremendous step to protect our children from harm that could come to them over the Internet. We must also pass the Conyers Amendment. to protect them and their mothers from harm at home. Lets commit ourselves to ending domestic violence so that women and children are safe in their own homes.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Im proud to rise in support of this legislation today. Im especially pleased with the lengths to which this bill goes in punishing those who utilize the Internet to prey on our children. The great need for protecting children from Internetbased crimes was reinforced to me last fall when Deborah Boehle (BayLee). the mother of a 9yearold girl. met with me in my Batavia. IL. office. Mrs. Boehle explained to me the hardship which her family endured because of an incident on the Internet. and which then led her to move her family into my district from their home in Juliet. IL. At the time. my colleague. JERRY WELLER was moving quickly to address this incident legislatively. and I am proud that I was able to work with him and Chairman MCGOLLUM in addressing this everincreasing problem. The culmination of those efforts is this legislation which establishes fines. and sets prison sentences of up to 5 years for individuals using the Internet to facilitate the contact of a minor for illegal sexual activity. Just like those who recklessly drive on our roadways and pose a danger to the traveling public. we have to pull over and lock up those criminals who are abusing the information superhighway. Although the Internet is by and large used for wellintentioned purposes. we have to be mindful of those twisted individuals who want to use it as a vehicle to threaten our children and their families. As weve seen in northern Illinois. crimes against our kids over the Internet can and do happen. Its for that reason its so essential we update our laws for the information age. Although there are no legislative fixes for the anxiety and anguish the Boehles have suffered. Im hopeful that this legislation will prevent future crimes against kids over the Internet. and keep other families from having to experience the same heartache and hardship that the Boehles have had to endure.",

United States taxpayer funds would have to be spent. every 90 days to file a report by the United States Government with regard to any and all complaints against United States citizens made by the dictatorship of Cuba. one of the handful of terrorist states on the list of terrorist states by the State Department. It is important that we recognize what the socalled noncontroversial amendment that we are simply seeking a vote on. what that would do. United States taxpayer funds would have to be expended so that any and all complaints made by the terrorist state. the dictatorship of Cuba. any complaints against United States citizens. any and all complaints. would have to be reported on and paid for by United States taxpayers. To call that a noncontroversial amendment is really almost inconceivable. Now. we are simply asking for a vote. and we are going to ask a vote. the gentlewoman from Florida is going to ask for a vote at the appropriate time.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to explain a senseoftheCongress amendment which calls on the Government of Peru to respect the rights of prisoners to timely legal action. My amendment was adopted by the House as part of Chairman GILMANs en bloc amendment last week. The amendment contains strong language commending Peru for their efforts to control drugs and stating that anyone convicted for possession of drugs should face stiff penalties. A constituent of mine. Jennifer Davis. and her friend Krista Barnes. have been held in prison in Peru for more than 8 months without being formally charged with a crime. without a trial. and without being sentenced. They are being held under horrible conditions which are in violation of basic international standards for the treatment of prisoners. I have a very serious question about whether the United States should continue sending about $100 million in foreign aid to Peru every year when that country is denying American citizens protection of their basic human rights and holding them more than 8 months without a trial. Jennifer and Krista. who are only 20 years old. were arrested in Peru in September 1996 after being recruited by some Peruvians to carry cocaine. They deserve to be punished for this crime. and they know that. In fact. they immediately admitted their guilt and have gone out of their way to cooperate with the police. As a result. three Peruvians who put them up to this have been arrested. Their willingness to cooperate has benefited them in no way. Eight months later they sit in prison without being charged and without a trial. The prison where they are being held is not fit for humans. It was built for 230 but has about 700 prisoners. including small children. The women share a communal bathroom with no running water and no soap. The food is unsanitary and they do not receive any milk. vegetables. or fruit. Disease is rampant as well as rats. roaches. and sick animals. Health care is virtually nonexistent and Jennifer has lost over 22 pounds. My senseoftheCongress language calls on Peru to respect the rights of prisoners to timely legal procedures. This is the minimum the American taxpayers should expect in return for the millions of dollars we give to Peru every year. Eight months without bringing charges and without a trial is unreasonable and unacceptable.",

Yesterday. the President reiterated that he expects the mission should be completed on schedule by June 1998.

Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili have stated that a fixed. statutorily mandated date for the withdrawal of U.S. forces could undercut the safety of our troops. When the consequences of a false step could be severe. Congress should be extremely careful how and where it treads. In this case. the stakes are high: the danger of renewed genocide.

Our service people must do more and more with less and less. while readiness suffers and our military families are strained to the limit by overseas deployments. I strongly support peace in Bosnia. but we cannot perform the peacekeeping mission there indefinitely. Our forces have provided a significant period of tranquility for implementation of the Dayton accords. We have provided aid to help rebuild. Fundamentally. however. it is up to the people there to decide whether they will work for peace. If Bosnias factions have not moved significantly toward resolving their problems by June 1998. how long will it take? I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.",

I rise today to thank Chairman SPENCE and the committee for adding language to the Defense Authorization Act that would help resolve United States commercial disputes against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As many of my colleagues are aware. in the late 1970s and early 1980s. the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia refused to pay hundreds of millions of dollars owed to American firms. After years of inaction on the claims filed on behalf of these companies. language was included in the fiscal year 1993 defense appropriations bill establishing a claims resolution process for these cases. It charged the Secretaries of Defense. State. and Commerce with issuing periodic reports on the status of pending claims. While many of these claims were resolved under this process. there are still debts outstanding. The directive language included in this bill is intended to reopen the claims process set up in 1993 and require the Department of Defense to conduct a broad and comprehensive search into any remaining claims. With Saudi Arabia now seeking admission into the World Trade Organization. I believe it unconscionable that they refuse to settle their debts with private businesses. over the years. at least 50 Members of Congress have urged the Saudis to pay their debt. but nothing has happened. Mr. Chairman. I am hopeful this directive and the ensuing report will illustrate to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the importance of honoring debts. I am also prepared to offer this language every year if necessary until each claim outstanding is resolved. I want to thank Chairman SPENCE again for his time.",

He goes into very great detail about how it impacts a lot of students. but he says. and I quote. \"that the higher education community was encouraged by the bipartisan budget agreement reached by the President and congressional leaders because it put the country on track to a balanced budget while targeting tax relief to families struggling with the cost of higher education. Chairman Archers bill. however. reduces this tax relief and imposes new burdens on students and families.\" and he goes into the details which I will not get into at this point. But it is real. These are real people. There are thousands of students at Rutgers in my home State of New Jersey who are impacted by this and really had hopes based on what was agreed to that this was going to be something that was really going to help the average working family meet the costs of a college education. and now the President and many others are very disappointed when they read what the Republicans have in mind here.

The Democratic tax cuts would basically target the working middle class. That is the way it should be. We have mentioned. the gentlewoman has mentioned over and over again. this is a balanced budget bill where we have limited resources. because we are trying to balance the budget. Those resources need to go to the working middle class. not to the big corporations. not to the top 1 percent of the people in this country. One of the things that really bothers me. and I just wanted to mention it. and then I will yield to our friend from Texas. is that the strength. if you will. of America. I was always taught. was the fact that we have a large and growing middle class. that we do not have this huge gap. if you will. between the rich and the poor. And I think that we need to encourage the middle class. We need to help people who are working in the middle class. One of the things. if I could just mention briefly. because again I think that now the media is giving this Republican tax plan some very serious analysis. there was an article that appeared in yesterdays New York Times under the headline. \"Study Shows Tax Proposal Would Benefit the Wealthy.\" with the subhead. \"Wider Gap Is Seen Between Rich and Poor. \" In that editorial. or in that article. the Times reports that the 5 million wealthiest families in our country would gain thousands of dollars. while the 40 million families with the lowest incomes. now these are still working people. that those 40 million at the lower end of that middleclass spectrum would actually lose money. with the effect of widening the already growing gap between the richest and poorest families. That has been one of*the real problems we have had in the last few years. is this gap between the rich and the poor keeps getting bigger and people drop out of the middle class.

I am so proud that the Democrats put forth a tax cut that spoke to tax cuts for the workingclass families. those families I represent in California. My families do not make much more than $26.000 a year. The Democratic tax cut speaks to that. But these charts really do show the disparity between the Democratic tax cuts and the Republican tax bill that absolutely does not speak to the workingclass families who I represent. I was really taken aback as I looked at the Republican tax bill and saw that they had really snuffed out the $16 billion that we had put in for the childrens health plan to really support at least half of the 10 million children who are uninsured. And we had initially said the $16 billion would at least help 5 million of those children. Now the Republican tax bill has taken that away. and the amount of money that will go for the few uninsured children. which is only about 100.000. will be sent to the States to let the Governors take hold of this. That is criminal at best because the Governors will not give that money to the children who need the health care. I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to look at the disparity of these two tax plans. The Democratic tax cut speaks to the workingclass families. the ones whom I represent.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I too rise today to salute the great American Jackie Robinson and hope that we all will recognize the great step he made for all of us. It is because of that reason that I also rise to speak to the decision made by the of the United States of America. Janet Reno. She made that under cover of law and under the respect of the Independent Counsel Act. which first of all says that. only If there are sufficient allegations of criminal activity by a public person such as President. Vice President. Cabinet member or others. should there be an Independent counsel appointed. And second. if there is sufficient evidence of criminal activity by those covered persons and there is an apparent conflict In the Justice Department. should the Justice Department not be the one to Investigate. Clearly. Mr. Speaker. there has been no evidence of Intentional criminal activity or criminal activity of any kind by a Cabinet member. President or Vice President of the United States with respect to campaign fundralsing. There is also no question that Janet Reno and the Justice Department have the integrity to Investigate. Stop this frivolity. stop following around and let us go on with the peoples business. Let the Justice Department investigate as they have been doing. Mr. Speaker. I rise to speak on the request of the majorily partys request for the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel to investigate possible fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 Presidential campaign. The Independent Counsel Act sets forth very clear circumstances in which an independent counsel may be appointed. First. if there are sufficient allegations of criminal activity of a covered person and if there are sufficient allegations of criminal activity by a person other than a covered person. and then an investigation or prosecution of that person by the Department of Justice may result in a conflict of Interest. and Independent counsel may be appointed. There must be specific and credible evidence. I urge my colleagues to read the statute which makes this quite clear. The Attorney General has already convened a task force that will Investigate Democratic campaign fundralsing. This does not call for an appointment of an Independent counsel and the Attorney Generals decision should be respected on this matter by all Members of Congress.",

That legacy continues. as you know. in the beautiful performance just this weekend of a young man named Tiger Woods. The Masters is another great example of breakthroughs in our society. That young man took a moment to think about those who preceded him and opened doors for him and the grace and skill that he exhibited at the Masters Tournament I think is also a part of that legacy you talked about tonight.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am proud to rise and pay tribute to a great man who not only contributed to the sport of baseball. but one who contributed to all of humanity. In both instances. the late great Jackie Robinson prevailed and taught the world an important lesson. if given the opportunity any man can excel to the greatest heights. Jackie Robinson was many things to many people. As father. husband. writer. political activist. military man. and of course. baseball player. Jackie did it all with ease. dignity. and respect. Jackie not only challenged the gentlemans agreement of segregated baseball. but he also won a courtmartial case for refusing to sit in the colored section of an army bus when he was transferred to Camp Breckenridge in Kentucky where he later received an honorary discharge. The love of his country kept Jackie determined to be the bes. that he could be. In 1947. he signed for $5.000 to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team where he led the National League with 20 stolen bases. As we celebrate this great man. I personally had the opportunity to witness the unveiling of a roadside sign renaming the Interborough Parkway in my congressional district. the Jackie Robinson Parkway in honor of the 50th anniversary of his first major league game. This tribute is well deserved for a man who In his 10 years with the Brooklyn Dodgers helped them to win six pennants. to finish second three times. and to never finish worse than third. Jackie Robinson rests at the Cypress Hill National Cemetery. In the 10th Congressional District In New York. we will continue to celebrate his life by breaking racial barriers and settling our own records of achievement.",

I rise today to pay special tribute to the legacy of Jackie Robinson. whose monumental breaking of the color barrier In Major League Baseball 50 years ago we are celebrating this spring. I would like to thank the distingusihed gentlewoman from Florida. Congresswoman CARRIE MEEK. for sponsoring this special order. As many of us will recognize today. Jackie Robinsons imprint on this Nation has been farreaching. not only as a prominent AfricanAmerican but also as a man who deeply cared about the Importance of integration and improved race relations In this Nation. Jackie Robinson was a man of great courage and character. two traits which he showed when he received the call from Brooklyn Dodger President Branch Rickey and made his debut for the Dodgers in 1947. Despite withstanding the taunts and illwill of many fans and players alike. Jackie proved his mettle and earned the Rookie of the Year Award. Over the course of 10 seasons in the big leagues. Jackie amassed a lifetime batting average of .311. and led his league in batting in 1949 and won the National Leagues Most Valuable Player Award in 1949. In 1962. he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame In Cooperstown. NY. becoming a member of baseballs most distinguished fraternity. While Jackie Robinson will forever be remembered as a Hall of Fame ballplayer. his strongly held convictions and advocacy of civil rights and improved economic opportunities for AfricanAmericans sets him apart as one of our Nations outstanding citizens of all time.",

That is the first decision we have to talk about: Is the current income tax system good for this country or is it bad for this country? So I suggest we do that first. Let us have a discussion. if you will. about why the current income tax system is a bad tax system for a country in this century. about to enter a new century in an increasingly globally free trade economy. Is this a good tax system for citizens who are filling out those forms tonight?

That is why it fails to compete when it gets overseas. because guess what happens if you ship it to England? In England they put another tax on it. so it is taxed in England and it is taxed in America. When England sends a box of cereal to America. they exempt that box of cereal from their valueadded tax. We do not tax it when it gets here. so it comes in taxfree. In short. our products are at a great disadvantage with our Income Tax Code. and. in short. if we changed it to what the gentleman from Colo ado. and I have recommended. that box of cereal would enter the market in Great Britain. let us say. without a single IRS tax on its back.

October 10. 1998 marks the 87th anniversary of the founding of modern China. This is a very special day for Chinese people around the world. and especially in Taiwan where October 10 is celebrated as National Day in the Republic of China on Taiwan. Dr. Sun Yatsen is the father of modern China. and is widely regarded and revered both in mainland China and in Taiwan. On October 10. 1911. Dr. Suns Revolutionary Alliance succeeded in putting an end to imperial rule in China. a date which also marked the formal planting of the seeds of democracy which continue to flourish in Taiwan today. People often speculate as to the real reasons for the \"Taiwan Miracle\" and how Taiwan continues to defy the odds today. how this island nation continues to expand economically when nations all around her are at an economic standstill or contracting. and they speculate as to how Taiwan not only survives politically. but how she has evolved into such a strong democracy despite the pressures by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) to isolate her from the international community. While there is no easy answer to this question. Taiwan is a flourishing and successful society in every sense of the word. and is a source of optimism in an increasingly uncertain world. In this light. it gives me particularly great pleasure to wish everyone on Taiwan. and Chinese people around the world. a very special October 10 National Day.

Dick has helped establish Westvaco and the Fine Papers mill into fixtures of Wickliffe. Kentucky. Though not originally from Kentucky. Dick became a valued member of the Wickliffe community. raised his family there and continues to have close ties to Kentucky. In 1966. Dick joined Westvaco as the Assistant Public Relations Manager at the Fine Papers Division in Luke. Maryland. The next year. Westvaco announced that Wickliffe. Kentucky would be the site of a new $80 million mill. It was while assisting in the public relations details of this announcement that Dick began his long association with the community of Wickliffe. Later that year. Dick. his wife Malinda and their two daughters moved to Wickliffe. Dick became Public Relations Manager for Fine Papers in 1970. Dick held that job until 1988. During that time. he played an integral role as the Fine Papers mill became the bedrock of the Wickliffe community. After a brief stint during 1988 in the Kentucky State Government as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development. Dick returned to Westvaco as Regional Public Affairs Manager. a position he held until 1991. At that time he moved to Washington to become Westvacos Director of Public Affairs. a position he continues to hold today. Since the 1966 announcement that the plant would be built in Western Kentucky. Westvaco has spent more than half a billion dollars to create a stateoftheart papermaking facility in Wickliffe. Today. Westvaco employs over 750 men and women in Kentucky. and makes an annual contribution of $134 million to the local economy. The growth of the mill and the companys great relationship with the community are a legacy of Dicks career at Westvaco and his 24 years in Kentucky. Mr. President. I have worked closely with Dick on several issues of great importance to both Westvaco and my constituents in the Wickliffe area. His hard work and dedication have allowed Westvaco to become an important part of the Wickliffe community. I have enjoyed working with him. thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Westvaco and the people of the Wickliffe community. and wish him the best wherever his future endeavors may take him.*",

Bettie left the Senate to pursue other endeavors. only to return in 1985 to work for Senator Jack Danforth. She was hired as a Staff Assistant for Senator Danforths personal office and was later moved to the Senate Committee on Commerce. when he became Chair.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to honor Shannon Grace Clark. who was crowned as Miss Michigan USA 1999 on Sunday. May 24. 1998. I am very proud to have her represent the State of Michigan. for Shannon is a shining example of service above self. Through her dedication to family. church and local community. she has made a tremendous impact on helping those who are less fortunate in society. enabling them opportunities of selfsufficiency. Her role has enabled her many opportunities. however. Shannon has shared them with homeless women and children throughout the State of Michigan. She has tirelessly dedicated herself to directly assisting those in need and to heightening public awareness to the importance of helping people facing unfortunate circumstances. Shannons platform \"People Helping People.\" comes to her naturally because she comes from a family dedicated to the importance of family. church and local community. Her parents. the Reverend and Dr. Pam Clark run the Pontiac Rescue Mission. a homeless and rehabilitation center in Pontiac. Michigan. which helps reclaim and rehabilitate the downtrodden of society. Through the program. Reverend and Doctor Clark designed and implemented. many individuals have reclaimed their lives. strength. pride. character. their children and themselves. They have developed into productive members of society. and loving families. free from the chains of addiction and destructive lifestyles. To build upon the accomplishments of her parents. she has formed a committee to raise additional financial support for the women and children program at the Pontiac Rescue Mission. Her efforts indeed are a fine model of leadership and selfless dedication that will help those in need as well as serving as an example for those to follow. I want to express my congratulations to Shannon Grace Clark and wish her luck in the Miss USA pageant in February. Most importantly. I would like to thank her for her commitment to those who are less fortunate in society.*",

It is an accomplishment for anyone to reach this chronological milestone. but in this instance. Walters nine decades have marked an extraordinary record of unparalleled public service to Baltimore and the State of Maryland. As a successful business executive. Walter Sondheim has served in \"volunteer\" public service positions on important state and local boards and commissions and as an advisor to Mayors and Governors for the last half century. His grace. good humor. extraordinary intelligence. and dedication have been powerful and good influences for progress and unity in Maryland. Achieving 90 years of age for most \"normal\" individuals. with rare exception. implies retirement or reduced activity. But among the several articles I am inserting in todays CONGRESSIONAL RECORD is an announcement in the July 30 edition of the Washington Post that Walter was unanimously elected to become the new President of the Maryland Board of Education. This public demonstration of confidence is a continuing vindication of his effectiveness in undertaking difficult tasks. I am also including an article from the July 25 Baltimore Sun which describes Walters exceptional and inspiring life of service. I know I express the deep appreciation of his fellow Marylanders for his many decades of commitment and their best wishes in his latest and most significant assignment. I ask that these articles be inserted at this point in the RECORD. and I yield the floor.",

Over the last few months. weve heard horror stories from our constituents about experiences they have had with the IRS. This is an agency that has had the ability to completely tear down a persons life. change their entire financial outlook and wreak irrevocable damage. sometimes with no further provocation than a computer glitch or a recordkeeping problem. I know that there are many hardworking. conscientious. and caring individuals who work for the Internal Revenue Service. but the current system is simply not working the way it should. Where else but in the massive bureaucracy of the IRS is a person guilty. until proven innocent. This legislation will make longoverdue and necessary changes to the IRS. shifting the burden of proof to the agency in tax liability disputes. providing crucial relief to innocent spouses who have become unsuspecting victims of the IRS. and establishing an independent oversight board. This bipartisan bill will also take several important steps to lower the tax burden on individuals who are trying to plan for retirement. save for their childrens college tuition. or buy a home by reducing the capital gains tax rate. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan once said himself that. (quote) \"the capital gains tax is the poorest way to raise revenue.\" He went on to say that it is \"counterproductive to longterm economic growth which affects all American society.\" Indeed. since Republicans paved the way for the capital gains reduction in the Taxpayer Relief Act of last year. our economy has boomed and now the Congress is fortinate to be debating how to use billions of dollars expected in surplus revenues. Mr. Speaker. I support the capital gains reduction and the overall legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same. It is a common sense way to restore power to our citizens and bring about changes that will make the IRS more efficient. accountable. effective. and taxpayerfriendly.",

The bill is a result of the cooperation and hard work of both parties and both Chambers of Congress. and it is very similar to legislation the House passed earlier this year by a vote of 414 to 1. and I would like to congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from Florida . to his staff. and to our staff. and to the administration for all of its work. This bill is tough because it is realistic. No more postponements. States will have to modernize their systems to collect moneys ordered by courts for noncustodial parents needed by their children or face certain penalties. H.R. 3130. as the gentleman from Florida has explained has two basic goals. First. the legislation would establish a new set of penalties for States that have failed to modernize their child support systems. Unlike the current penalties. these new requirements can be realistically enforced and therefore represent a meaningful incentive for States to computerize and centralize their child support files. These steps are necessary for reliable and timely payments to children and families. Second. the bill would revamp the current Federal system for rewarding performance among State child support enforcement systems. By establishing specific performance criteria. H.R. 3130 would make these incentive payments more closely track State efforts to enforce child support orders. Let me say the concerns from the other body unfortunately prevented us from including in this bill. as the gen- tleman from Florida has stated. a provision championed by the gentleman from Maryland to deny noncitizens entrance into our country if they refuse to pay past due child support to an American citizen. The provision would serve a clear and useful purpose and certainly deserves our continued support. Mr. Speaker. we all talk about parental responsibility.

This bill will go a long way in helping children and families who depend on the performance of child support agreements. In particular. I want to note the improved child medical support order provisions worked out in the bill. I am pleased that we have broad bipartisan support for these important provisions. They will help ensure that children who are entitled to medical support through a child support order actually get enrolled in the health plans of their noncustodial parents. Equally important. the agreement worked out in conference should greatly expedite this process. and give both State child support enforcement agencies and the health plans who must administer these childrens enrollments greater assurance that the process will work efficiently. Mr. Speaker. there are few things that are as important as ones health. Children in particular with their whole lives ahead of them. must have access to ongoing care. Similarly. there are few things that are as frightening for a family as having a child face illness without June.25. 1998 the protection of insurance. This legislation addresses these fundamental concerns: it will help ensure that more kids get the care theyve been promised and need. and give more families the financial security and peace of mind to which they are entitled.

This incident is just one example of the fact that the Fair Labor Standards Act is flexible. the Fair Labor Standards Act will yield to common sense after due deliberation. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I might point out also. is enjoying its 60th anniversary today. The Fair Labor Standards Act was passed 60 years ago. It established the 40hour week. overtime pay. the ban on child labor and the minimum wage. Today we celebrate an important day in American history. and on this day I think we should renew our effort to bring the minimum wage up to standard. The minimum wage now is $5.15 cents per hour. and that is still a poverty wage. It is a wage without opportunity or hope. As far as working people are concerned. the minimum wage still has not caught up with the years of inflation. We are still way behind in terms of buying power of the dollars that workers receive. so the minimum wage needs to be increased just to bring us one step closer to where the buying power of the dollar is today. I think it is only fitting and proper in a time of great prosperity that we increase the minimum wage. It is one way to share the prosperity and help us to guarantee the pursuit of happiness on a fair playing field for everybody. On this important anniversary of the minimum wage. let us recommit ourselves to create an opportunity for all working Americans. When we return after recess.

When Members have come forward. as the gentlewoman from New York just did. with an eloquence and passion that is a model of how issues ought to be discussed. and talk about threats to the health of women and talk about how this bill does not allow a doctor to take into account serious adverse health consequences. some of my friends on the other side said. well. health is too vague. Health could mean severe mental health problems. We want to rule that out. But what they do not say is that they do not only want to rule out mental health. which seems to be a valid consideration. they would deny the use of this procedure to a woman even if the doctor could show that it was necessary to avoid serious physical damage to her health. And I have offered an amendment that says only that. that we will not preclude this if a doctor finds it necessary to avoid longterm serious adverse physical health damage. They will not allow that amendment. They will not allow even a vote on that. The chairman of the full committee. a man of great intellectual integrity who was against abortion in any form or shape. says the reason he voted against that amendment was that if it is a choice between the life of the fetus and severe physical health damage to the mother. then the mother must incur that damage and not only that. we in Congress will decide that the mother must incur that damage. I think the failure to allow a vote on serious physical health adverse consequences in the first place deprives them the right to argue about mental health because they will not allow any health requirement. We are not talking about whether or not you have an abortion at all but about the procedure. And what they are trying to do is to force a vote which would. and let us be very clear. the vote would make it impossible for a doctor to even try to show that it was necessary to use this procedure to avoid serious longterm physical damage.",

Second. as to the medical argument. I do not think Congress ought to arbitrate disagreements among doctors. There are doctors who have said they would find this procedure useful in some particular circumstances. For Congress to legislate that it would never ever bL useful physically to use this particular procedure rather than another is. it seems to me. a great overreach. Again. I want to underline. as the gentleman from Oklahoma made clear. we are not talking about stopping abortions. We are not talking about stopping abortions even late in pregnancy.

The majority leadership wants to do away with Roe. the radical right wants to do away with Roe. and this bill is the first step. So let us be honest about this. This bill. which the President vetoed last year. will outlaw a medical technique which is rarely used but is sometimes required in extreme and tragic cases. o 1330 For example. when the life of the mother is in danger or a fetus is so malformed that it has no chance for survival. When a woman is forced to carry a malformed fetus to term. they are in danger of chronic hemorrhaging. permanent infertility or death. Friends. I have a personal story. My life has been touched by these extreme and tragic cases. In the early 1900s. when my grandmother was in the late stages of her first pregnancy. a terrible complication arose. At a critical moment they knew that my grandmother would die unless a lateterm abortion was performed. Because of my grandmothers life and health and because her life and health were saved. my mother was born a few years later. A lateterm abortion made my life possible. Let me read my colleagues a brief list of organizations that oppose this bill: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. the American Public Health Association. the American Nurses Association. the list goes on and on. Doctors and nurses oppose this bill because they see tragic cases like my grandparents all the time. They know that H.R. 1122 will cost women their lives or reproductive health. The majority party in this House has proved time and again its resolve to make Roe versus Wade ring hollow for most American women. We cannot let this happen. Protect a womans right to choose. protect womens lives and womens health. leave medical decisions up to the patient and the physician. not the Congress. Vote \"no\" on this bill.",

I would remind the gentlewoman from California that this radical right that opposed this procedure voted in record numbers last year. 288 Members of the House. which showed a bipartisan spirit. Both Democrats and Republicans supported this ban. If they are all radical right. then more power to the radical right. I want to talk very quickly on this issue of health. I sat on the floor last year and heard the arguments from the other side. maybe it is the radical left. I do not know. using numbers: There are only 500 of the procedures done a year and it is only in the most grossly abnormal cases. However. Mr. Fitzsimmons cleared that up when he came out and said no. that Is an absolute lie. We have seen reports out of a New Jersey newspaper where there are 1.500 procedures like this done in one hospital. Are there that many abnormalities in one hospital that they do 1.500 of these? No. I suggest to my colleagues that these are being done for the convenience of the doctors. It is a grossly inhumane procedure. If it were a criminal penalty. it would be outlawed by the eighth amendment to the Constitution which prevents cruel and inhuman treatment.",

Is there no point at which we can agree that the sanctity of human life takes precedence over the lure of choice? A recent editorial writer in Arkansas defined the true debate that we face today. He said partialbirth abortion has long since ceased to be a medical question. It is a political question. It is about competing values. It is about whether we should be able to destroy human life in order to shape ours in a way that we would prefer. It is about what we hold sacred in our Nation. It is about our culture.

These tiny feet that are fully formed are the exact size of an unborn babys feet at 10 weeks after conception. the first trimester. The procedure we are debating is most often performed during the second or third trimester. In some cases. the baby is fully developed and could survive outside the womb. If modern medical science considers a child delivered at 24 weeks viable. how can we consider his or her counterpart expendable? I agree that individuals should have the right to make decisions that affect their lives. I also strongly believe in the sanctity of life. If 80 percent of abortions in this country are elective. we have to reevaluate the value that our society places on human life. If this decision is not made in the case of rape or of incest. or if the mothers life is not in danger. then this is a selfish decision. At 10 weeks an unborn childs feet are perfectly formed. I ask my colleagues to think of an unborn child at 4 months or 8 months. That child is whole. alive. and in many cases can survive outside the womb.

PA. to learn how we might disagree In a civilized manner. and I think this issue is challenging and testing the commitments we made at that time to deal and disagree with each other in a way that is respectful and civilized. This is an issue that American people have very strong feelings about. and those strong feelings are shared by Members of this body. I think it is important that we state where we agree and where we disagree because there are some agreements. I do not believe there is a single Member of this body. and I definitely include myself. who believes that abortion ought to be an elective procedure post viability. and to the extent that any of us have suggested otherwise. we should stop doing that because we do not believe that. That is not where our disagreement is. There are those of us in this Chamber who believe. and oftentimes it is a matter of religious belief. that abortions should be made illegal in all cases. I am not among those who believe that. But I respect the Members of this body who do. The disagreement is over who should make the decision to terminate a pregnancy post viability. when a womans life is in danger or she is facing a serious health consequence. and then prior to viability who should make the decision in every case. There has been a lot of discussion about numbers and who said what when. The issue Is this. simply this. If there is even a single woman. and I know one. Vickie Wilson. who needs access to this procedure in order to protect against a very serious health ramification. then in my judgment she and her family. not the Congress of the United States. ought to make that decision. That is what this issue is about. We have an alternative that would prohibit abortions post viability on an elective basis. I think we ought to adopt this alternative and I think we ought to allow the woman and her family to decide when serious health consequences and her life are at risk.",

Republicans demonstrate our commitment to the 44 million people currently receiving Social Security benefits and the 82 million beneficiaries who will retire and begin collecting Social Security three decades from now. This bill sets aside $I4 trillion dollars for Social Securityfunds that will be used to strengthen a system that keeps millions of seniors out of poverty. Students of history will note this is $1.4 trillion dollars more than the Democrats set aside during their 40. year conrol of this chamber. In supporting this bill. Republicans demonstrate that we are proactive problemsolvers. Although the Social Security Trust Fund currently Is running a surplus. we know that changing demographics--Including the retirement of baby boomers like mewil threaten the longterm viability of the program.

Sir Francis Bacon said that \"Knowledge itself is power.\" As a man who has dedicated his career to furthering educational opportunities for students around the world. Mihran has ensured that future generations will be armed with the knowledge to understand and resolve the complex challenges they face. He has been particularly active in the Armenian community. and using his skills and resources has worked tirelessly to improve the standard of education in Armenia. Mihrans specialized degree and engineering background afforded him several opportunities. including the position of Chairman of the Civil Engineering Department at the University of Southern California. During his time at U.S.C.. Mihran concentrated on turning a practically nonexistent structural laboratory into one of the best in California. and as director of the environmental program. he integrated environmental research into a unified program in civil engineering. Mihrans exper.tise led him to Armenia in December of 1988 after an earthquake destroyed countless buildings. leaving over 25.000 people dead and more than 500.000 people homeless. This experience left a remarkable impression on Mihran and led to the idea of establishing an educational institution of higher leaming to help Armenia regain some of what it had lost in the field of education. Three years later. on the day that the Armenian Parliament declared independence. the American University of Armenia opened its doors to young scholars. As a driving force behind the creation and success of this institution. Mihran assumed the position of President and has continued to lead the University as a preeminent educational institution in Armenia. Mihrans distinguished career has been highlighted by several honors. including being named \"Man of the Year by the Armenian Professional Society in 1978. \"Distinguished Engineering Educator of the Year\" by the Institute for the Advancement of Engineering in 1992. and most recently receiving the Kabakjian Award for Science/Engineering of the Armenian Students Association in 1996. He and his wife play an active role in several community events and organizations. As an educator and a visionary. Mihranhas provided the students of Armenia with the",

We should all register our strong resentment with respect to the juvenile behavior of the press over the last week. Media men and women have dared to instruct the Congress in their premature calls for impeachment. These same voices were much more cautious when a separate government was set up in the basement of the White House to support Nicaraguan Contras by soliciting money and illegally selling weapons to Iran. Certain analysts and television celebrities were completely silent when the banks and other savings and loan bandits stole billions of dollars guaranteed by the taxpayers through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

It is rare to find an individual who exhibits such strong leadership in the community. and also maintains a compassionate relationship with all levels of individuals within that community. My friend John Cleghorn is one of these individuals. My hometown of Corona. California has been extremely fortunate to have had Chief Cleghorn protecting our community and making it a safer place in which to live and work. John Cleghorn served as the Chief of Police in Corona for 12 years. He came to Corona following a successful career with the Los Angeles Police Department where he rose to the rank of captain and served as head of the forces antiterrorism unit. He brought with him the knowledge and experience needed to lead a city that was experiencing massive population and economic growth. Chief Cleghorn was appointed to the position in 1985. and in the years that he served as Chief. Corona experienced the same massive population explosion that many other cities in California also experienced. As the Chief of Police. he dealt with difficulties associated with this type of growth in an efficient and effective manner. Chief Cleghorn has overseen a police department that grew from 66 sworn officers to 131 during his tenure. as well as adding a 12member SWAT team. a gang unit. and CAT. a program created to deal with an increasing number of car thefts in the Corona area. In addition to his responsibilities to the force. Chief Cleghorn devoted much of his time to various community organizations. These groups include the Corona Rotary Club. the Navy League. the YMCA. the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation. and the Corona Police Community Partnership. He is also involved with Peppermint Ridge. a facility that cares for individuals with developmental disabilities. Chief Cleghorn was recently recognized for his tremendous community efforts by being named Man of the Year for 1997 by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. On behalf of the citizens of the 43rd congressional district. I would like to thank Chief Cleghorn for his contributions and dedicated service to his community and for the example he has set for future generations. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.",

Mr. Chairman. our hearings have revealed. and this is why we support the bill. it showed that 300 foreign companies were able to come into this country and game the process. so the previous speaker who says that this is all just about domestic. well. it is about foreign companies coming onto our turf. sir. and taking our patents. That is what we are trying to stop. So to say that it does not involve foreign companies. it involves 300 foreign companies. according to our hearings. In one case. a British pharmaceutical company was so effective at the submarining game that the United States competitor had to relocate its operations abroad to be able to produce a competing project. So we have our companies going out of the United States to come back in because of the submarine system. and some say this is just a domestic problem. It Is not. It Is a national. international problem. Now. the submarine patents which we claim are now corrected on both sides. I would point out that there was one American. and this is not a foreign entrepreneur. was able to get $500 million in royalties. For doing what? For simply delaying for 35 years in some instances. the prosecution of a patent. and then suing other manufacturers who. in the meantime. not knowing about it. started using the process. Gilbert Hyatt submarined his patent for 20 years and extracted $70 million from Texas Instruments. who started using the same computer chip technology. totally unaware of Hyatts submarine patent. If the Robrabacher bill cures it and the bill discussed by all of the members of the Committee on the Judiciary and two Congresses. what is wrong with H.R. 400? As a matter of fact. the gentleman from California came before the committee. and his ideas and discussion were taken into consideration. and we thought that we treated him very kindly.

Section 202 of this act would require the publication of patent applications 18 months after they are filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. This is a signiticant departure from the current practice. whereby this Information Is not published until after the patent is granted. There Is a national security Issue here. Under the current process. before a patent Is Issued a review of the patent application is conducted to determine if it contains technical information that is sensitive from a national security standpoint. It. after a review by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy it is determined that the public release of the information in the patent application would be detrimental to national security. the patent application Is put under a secrecy order prohibiting its public release. In reviewing the original draft of H.R. 400. I was concerned that it would require the publication of the patent application before the Defense Department had completed its security review. A historical review determined that during fiscal years 1994 and 1995 eight of the patent applications that were eventually placed under secrecy orders did not have security review completed within 18 months. While that number is small. in 2 years there would have been eight instances in which classified technical information would have been publicly released under the procedures proposed by H.R. 400. To address this problem. I submitted an amendment on behalf of the National Security Committee to the Judiciary Committee that would prevent the publication of patent applications until the secrecy reviews have been completed and It Is found that their publication would not be detrimental to national security. I am pleased to report that the chairman of the Courts and Intellectual Property Subcommittee. Mr. COBLE. has agreed to accept this change and thereby fix this problem. I want to thank the Judiciary Committee and its staff for their assistance and for working with us to ensure that sensitive national security information is not Inadvertently released as a consequence of reforming the patent system.",

While the current bill ensures that the advisory board for the new PTO should be composed of diverse users of the office in order to help Congress conduct more effective oversight. the managers amendment expressly requires that inventors be included as members. The Committee on Appropriations has expressed concern over the borrowing authority in the bill. as have some critics. although many misunderstood how the authority works under the control of Congress. Much ado has been made about a procedure which would offer a small possibility for the new PTO to borrow money instead of having to raise fees on inventors to pay for any hightechnology future products. Accordingly. our amendment strikes the borrowing authority. In further guaranteeing diligent inventors at least 17 years of patent term from the time of issuance. the managers amendment allows inventors adequate time to respond to inquiries from the PTO regarding their applications. Small businesses and independent inventors have been concerned that the new PTO may not recognize the longstanding reduction in fees applicable to these constituencies. The managers amendment requires that the agency continue to provide that small businesses and independent inventors pay half price for their patent applications. Independent inventors have claimed that the scope of the reexamination provisions contained in H.R. 400 is too broad. This has been amended to extend greater due process. As we can tell. Mr. Chairman. the committee has worked hard to accommodate the interests of our small business community. not just in this amendment but in the many amendments adopted throughout the process. while maintaining strong protection for U.S. interests against our foreign competitors. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on the managers amendment.",

We have technology advancement second to none in the world. Why are we messing with It? Do my colleagues not think we should have a good reason before we change such a system as this that has produced such success for our country? What answers have we heard today? We have heard one. submarine patents. This is what the Congressional Research Service says about the Rohrabacher substitute and House Resolution 400. It says the patent disclosure provisions of the Rohrabacher substitute. House Resolution 811. should substantially curtail the practice of submarine patenting. Both bills seek to curtail submarine patenting and would likely end the practice. That is on pages 12 and 13 of the CRS report. Let me repeat that. Both bills seek to curtail submarine patenting and would likely end the practice. If we are messing with the U.S. patent system because of the abuse of the submarine patent. for heaven sakes. let us not go as broad and do the additional damage as House Resolution 400 would do when we can solve it with a much narrower solution. which is in the Rohrabacher substitute. But let us ask one further question. How large. how deep. how profound is this problem of the submarine patent? Commissioner Lehman. in GATT hearings. was reported in the Washington Times of April 15 of this year to have said that the submarine patent constitutes approximately 1 percent of 1 percent of all patent filings. The numbers that he gave worked out to thirteen onethousandths of 1 percent of all patent filings. For that we are going to compel all patent filings. after 18 months. to be made public. whether or not there has been the patent granted? It simply is unnecessary for the small problem and it does a tremendous amount of collateral damage. Mr. Chairman. I wish to conclude by pointing out that there has been no other case made for changing this present system that has worked so well. no other compelling case. If at the very least we do no harm. we have served our constituents well. Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent. as my colleague did. for 2 additional minutes.",

John Grennell and James Haines were the first settlers of the area now known as Brockway Township. After 12 years. the Michigan legislature passed an act on March 17. 1848 to legally establish the township. Brockway Township was blessed with fertile farming land and rich forests. Farming. lumber mills and woolen mills were the townships most successful occupations. In 1881. Brockway shifted to Brockway Center to take advantage of the railroads. It is said that people moved homes and business on skids to take advantage of the new technology. Small midwestern towns are Americas treasure. We are all drawn to the farmers markets. festivals. and parades that remind us of our heritage. Throughout the past onehundred and fifty years. Brockway Township has witnessed the evolution from carriages to trains to automobiles. from wood planked. hand laid roads to the concrete freeways.

Fannie Mae Chairman and CEO Jim Johnson announced that by the end of the year 2000 the company would provide a trillion dollars in targeted housing finance to serve families with incomes below the median. minorities and new immigrants. families who live in central cities. rural areas and distressed communities and people with special housing needs. This effort is intended to help 10 million additional families attain the American dream of homeownership. In order to achieve this goal. Fannie Mae is creating new products. breaking down financial and informational barriers to homeownership. reaching out to new partners and making the elimination of discrimination the number one priority of the housing finance industry. Fannie Mae has opened 29 partnership offices to assist with these efforts. Lenders. realtors. homebuilders. mortgage insurers. nonprofits and others in the housing industry have joined Fannie Mae in this successful effort which already has helped 5.6 million families achieve the dream of homeownership and which has provided $440 billion in housing finance. Recently. Fannie Mae announced two new programs that are having a positive impact on the affordable housing needs in my district. Fannie Maes initiatives not only encourage homeownership but also promote revitalization of cities through loans that provide for renovation of homes in highcost urban areas. These programs. Homestyle Remodeler and Flexible 97. allow homeowners and homebuyers to borrow money for renovation and rehabilitation of their homes. Homestyle Remodeler is being tested exclusively on Long Island. and Flexible 97 is being tested around the country. including on Long Island.

Back in the 1970s there were a series of widely reported scandals and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission into bribes and other illicit payments to foreign officials and illegal domestic political contributions by American corporations. Hundreds of United States corporations were found to have made such payments to foreign government officials including more than 25 percent of our Fortune 500 companies. Clearly the widespread corrupt practices that were taking place during this period were fundamentally inconsistent with the principles of free and fair markets and. I believe. ultimately harmful to the interests of the United States because they damage the interests of shareholders of these United States companies. In response to these practices. Congress enacted the Federal Corrupt Practices Act to establish an explicit bar against bribing foreign government officials and creating requirements for accurate books and records and devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls. When Congress enacted this legislation. it was hoped that by taking the lead to curb bribery by our corporations. America would put pressure on other developed and developing industrialized nations to adopt similar laws inside their own countries.

Res. 212 to encourage committees nationwide to increase awareness about and prevent suicide. I would also like to recognize the Light For Life Foundation of America and their founders. the Emme family. who tragically lost their teenage son. Michael to suicide in 1994. It was through the vision of the Emme family that the Yellow Ribbon Program. which is now responsible for saving over 1000 teenage lives since its inception. has become a reality. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of H. Res.",

This issue is important to every family with children and to every family that has suffered the loss of a loved one through suicide. This resolution recognizes that suicide is a national problem. And it encourages that the nation undertake suicide prevention efforts. Mr. Speaker. it is estimated that 750.000 people attempt suicide each year. These attempts are traumatic not only for the individual but also for family and friends who surround him or her. Just as tragic. more than 31.000 lives annually are lost to suicide. It may be hard to believe. but that is even more than homicide. In fact. suicide is the ninth leading cause of all death in the U.S. It is the third leading cause of death for young people. And it is on the rise. I hope that this resolution will help focus attention on this tragedyand will lead to action in our homes and our communities to save young and old lives alike from suicide.",

This amendment takes a giant step in the right direction toward advancing education. improving education in the classrooms of our children. I think it is best said that the money that reaches the teacher that knows my son Stephens name and the money that reaches the teacher that knows my daughter Courtneys name is the best money spent in education. And the ideas that the teachers and the administrators at Stephens school and Courtneys school have are better than ideas created and imposed top down thousands of miles away in Washington. DC. We are not increasing a program here of the Federal Government. What we are doing is embracing a concept. That concept is simple and straightforward: That the best education and the best education reform can be created not in Washington. DC. thousands of miles away from where my daughter Courtney and my son Stephen go to school. but right there at Courtneys school and Stephens school.

And this is what the Republicans are really trying to -do. They are trying. through any means necessary. to destroy American labor unions.

The use of the Republican slush fund to persecute working families and their Representatives combined with the countless hearings held by the Oversight Subcommittee on Education and the Workforce are being done to destroy unions.

Our children will compete for jobs in a national. and even global. marketplace. We know our workers. and our economy. can be the best in the worldif we also have a worldclass education system. Our schools are not living up to our expectations. Too many schools are overcrowded and crumbling. Too many schools arent safe. and arent teaching kids the skills they need to learn. We have failed to hold our schools and our students accountable to the highest standards. If you believe. as I do. that as a nation we have failed to hold schools accountable. you should be very wary of an amendment which would make it virtually impossible to ever hold them accountable. And thats precisely what this amendment would do. We need to hold our schools more accountable. not less. We need to demand higher performance and higher standards. And we need to target poor performing schools in resourcepoor areas and give them the funds they need to succeed. In fact. this amendment goes contrary to everything which Republicans and Democrats on this subcommittee and on the Education and the Workforce Committee have been trying to do in reforming the title I and Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs. Where we have attempted to target funds to where they are most needed. this amendment would spread them around to schools whether they are needed or not. Where the two committees have moved to tie funding to efforts to improve standards and promote better academic achievement. this amendment would spread funds around to schools whether they are taking steps to improve or not. Where the two committees have moved to tie funding to schoolwide programs rather than scattershot fixes that research shows dont work. this amendment would spread funds around to schools whether they.are reforming their practices or not.

There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that this amendment is nothing more than what the Republicans wanted to do with the Department of Education in the last Congressto abolish it. This is nothing more than a piecemeal attempt by Mr. HOEKSTRA to cut Federal funding for our Nations educational programs. to cut funding of Federal educational programs that the Republicans have been attacking for years. Mr. Speaker. the Republicans have previously sought cuts in such programs as Safe and Drug Free Schools. schooltowork. Goals 2000 School Reform. Eisenhower teacher training. and bilingual and immigrant education. Now. by the subterfuge of this amendment. by creating block grants. Republicans can succeed in ending these programs. As we all know. block granting funds for education eliminates all accountability for the use of Federal education funds. If this amendment passes. all education funds could be diverted for noneducational purposes. With the limited amount of Federal funds being spent on education. it is absolutely necessary that funds that are intended by Congress to be spent on specific educational programs. are. in fact. spent on those programs. Congress has identified education as a national priority and without the focus of these programs. funds would not be targeted to the neediest schools and districts. This arbitrary consolidation of Federal funds into block grants has to be stopped. lest we rob our most needy students of the programs that have proven themselves in the past. We must reject any attempts to undo 40 years of bipartisan Federal investment.in our childrens future. We must not back away from our commitment to education now. in its time of vital need.",

This amendment would essentially eliminate all accountability for the use of Federal funds in our public education system. I. too. believe in driving dollars to the classroom. and I believe that local education agencies must be afforded a certain amount of flexibility to use Federal funds in accordance with the needs of the local education community. Under this amendment. however. the Federal Government would hand over funds to local school systems and indicate that they may use the money in any way they please. without any standards of accountability. I believe that the education of our children should be a top priority. An investment in education is essential to our Nations future. Under the Hoekstra amendment Federal education funds could be used by local agencies for noneducation purposes. The amount that we appropriate for education is always short of what is needed to be fully effective. The Federal Government contributes only 6 percent to elementary and secondary education. As the Washington Post pointed out this week. Federal funds fill in the gaps and provide programs for lower income students who would be underserved without Federal efforts. We simply cannot afford to allow the small amount of money that we appropriate for education to be used for other purposes. This amendment would unravel years of progress that we have made in providing equality of education for girls and minorities. It would remove all of the Federal civil rights protections for race. gender. and disabilities contained in the elementary and secondary education laws. All of the hard work by the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues during the 103d Congress to incorporate gender equity through the funding of elementary and secondary education programs would be undone. These programs have made our schools more genderneutral. which improves education for all students. Mr. Chairman.

His commitment to the housing needs of this Nation. particulady the homeless. was unquestioned. in fact. his death was hastened by his Insistence on spending a night on a grate near Mhe Capitol in bitter cold in order to bring attention to the need for more funding for homeless shelters. Following his death. Congress approved legislabon to authorize the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. which has been a lifeline for the homeless. Slew was a moderate Republcan. and was active in the socalled \"92 Group.\" the organ. zatIon of moderate Republicans devoted to reaching a House majonty in 1992. Stew would have been thrilled to have learned that his efforts helped lead to that outcome only 2 years later. and he would certainly have been an active force in the Tuesday Group. of wich I am a member. Stews death from AIDS led to increased public awareness of HIVAIDS and helped to bring the reality of the epidemic to Congress. At the time of his death. AIDS was Still some. one ess disease--is death was a wakeup carl to Congress. I only td a few months to get to know StewI had just begun my service In Congrass In 1987. But during that bref time padod. I had the privilege of working with him on several Issues. He was an Inspiration to me and to many Members. and he is missed.",

But vivid as that memory is. my memories of Stew himself have even more life. Let me say it painly. Stew was always a man of principle. In every sense. he was a dedicated. thoughtful and earnest legislator. willing to take on the battles of those who am scarcely visible In thIs society. We remember his work for the homeless I still carry with me an indelible Image of Stew. spending a cold witer night outdoors to focus the public eye on what many had not wanted to see before. That was not a public relations ploy--ift was a call to Americas conscience. And I am very proud that Congress responded with passage of the Stewart McKinney Homelessness Assistance Act. Today. the fight he started continues. Stwar McKinney also authored and passed legislation to create the Connecticut Coastal Wildlife Refuge. which has been renamed in his honor. This important legislation protected some of our most threatened wetlands along the Connecticul coast on Long Island Sound. And today. those of us in Connecticut and the Northeast can still continue to enjoy the beauty of these tragle but important areasthanks to Stew. Stews compassion and dedication created a lasting legacy. But his most unique quality. in my opinio was his love of all people.

And we cannot provide health Insurance.

And there were a lot of things that are unknown. For example. we did know that only arguably 12 States would qualify. I must point out. California is not among those 12. But we did not specify who gets the excess funds. So it is possible that Florida gets Californias money or not. This Is a real issue because right now the money we are talking about. the $1. billion. is in the violent crime trust fund. Those funds are currently flowing to States and localities. Every State is getting some of that money and so it will be a real loss to cops and prosecutors who are currently getting funding if States do not qualify and we know some do not and some will never.

This illconceived measure breaks the marketoriented contract made with the hardworking sugar farmers around the country and in my home State of Montana and undermines the viability of our rural communities. This amendment flies in the face of common sense. Montanas sugar producers and their families have made investments based upon the Federal Governments word in the 1995 farm bill. In this planting year alone. farmers are counting on these promises for a fair return on their investment. Yet. this amendment would place Americas sugar producers at great risk by eliminating the safety net they were promised in the farm bill. For example. Montanas sugar producers are counting on getting up to 70 percent of their net returns from the nearby processors in December of this year. These net returns are ultimately based upon what was supposed to be a 7year Federal sugar policy commitment. The MillerSchumer amendment ignores that commitment and compromises the financial investments made by our Nations producers. Mr. Speaker.

As you know. during consideration of last years historic farm bill. significant reforms were made to the U.S. sugar program. Among the changes were the elimination of all domestic production controls. an increase in the marketing assessments sugar farmers must pay to reduce the Federal deficit. and new penalties to further discourage loan forfeitures and maintain the now 12yearold nocost operation of sugar policy. Our domestic sugarbeet and sugarcane growers provide taxpayers with almost $300 million in Federal revenues through the collection of assessments. In fact. because our domestic growers have been so successful in providing U.S. consumers with stable. highquality supplies of sugar at a retail price well below the developed country average. our farmers were willing last year to contribute their fair share in the overall goal of reforming Federal farm support programs. But while our sugar industry has been successful. it does face stiff competition from subsidized sugar growers throughout the world. GATT mandated no reduction in the price support for sugar in the European Union. Thus. while U.S. growers operate under a strict loan program. European farmers receive subsidies to artificially lower the market cost on their sugar sales. Recognizing the threat that dumping sugar by foreign countries could have on the United States. sugar growers have one remaining safety net. the nonrecourse loan guarantee. While some of my colleagues here have attempted to portray this as a gimmick to raid the Federal Treasury. in actuality. this program would only come into effect when at least 1.5 million tons of foreign imports begin to flood our markets. I believe this safety net is important to keep our domestic sugarbeet and sugarcane industry viable. Without this small measure of protection from the vagaries of foreign subsidized sugar. a critical sector of our farm economy could collapse. Mr. Chairman.

I rise in support of the MillerSchumer amendment to the fiscal year 1998 agriculture appropriations bill which would prohibit the U.S Department of Agriculture from spending Federal funds to implement the nonrecourse loan program for sugar producers. This amendment takes another step forward in our continued efforts to phase out the Federal Governments outdated sugar price subsidy. The USDAs complex program of loan subsidies. price supports. and good oldfashioned protectionism benefits only a handful of farmers at the expense of American consumers. I think the American people would be appalled to learn that more than 30 farmers and corporations receive in excess of $1 million annually in USDA sugar subsidies. Meanwhile. consumers pay $1.4 billion a year in higher prices on sugar products and hundreds of consumer items that use sugar. Last year. Congress passed landmark agriculture legislation. known as the FAIR Act. which opened up most American farmers to the free market and new agricultural opportunities. There is no reason why these same free market principles should not apply to sugar farmers. If passed. this amendment would also have the benefit of opening up new opportunities to sugar farmers while still providing them refuge from foreign dumping and unfair trade barriers in markets overseas.

I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin which compels the USDA to be fair to consumers when establishing a loan level for the peanut quota. Mr. Chairman I grew up on a family farm. a small family farm in Arkansas. and this is not about farming but this is about Government and Government quotas. The peanut program combines production quotas. price support. loans and import restrictions which stifle the U.S. peanut industry and endanger trade for other agricultural commodities. This is a program which benefits only the elite few. The GAO reports that 68 percent of quota owners do not actually participate in farming. They rent their Government quotas for a profit. If a farmer does not sell his crop. he can forfeit to the Government and receive $610 per ton. The world market price is only $350 per ton. that is more than what is necessary. That is an additional $500 million a year in inflated prices for American consumers. It is time we stop this arcane Government program. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.",

In the Dark Ages there was a feudal system wherein if you were lucky and drew the long end of the straw you were lord of the manor. and if you were unlucky you were a serf out there toiling on the land. In 1997. with our peanut program the way it is configured. if you draw the long end of the stick you have a quota from the Government and can sell your peanuts for about $600 a ton. and if you draw the short end of the stick you can sell them for about half that. the same peanuts. To make matters worse. about twothirds of the quota owners. and again we are not talking about farmers here. are people that live in Los Angeles and New York and Miami.

For us to provide $135 million In aid. which is the total amount. while it is wasting its own resources on the modernization of its weapons systems and military and its own oppression. it is ridiculous for us to do this.

Project for Pride in Living was originally established in Minneapolis in 1972 to buy and rehabilitate rundown. innercity houses. It has grown considerably over the years to address poverty issues on a variety of fronts. PPL now provides affordable rental and ownership housing opportunities. job training through direct employment. employment education and placement. youth development. neighborhood security. and support services. PPL has been a strong and effective agent for economic stabilization and community building in neighborhoods throughout the Twin Cities. but especially in the Phillips neighborhood. It has built or renovated more than 900 singlefamily and multifamily units. PPLs SelfSufficiency Program and employment and training initiatives have helped several thousand people. In 1996 alone. 509 families participated in the SelfSufficiency Program. by obtaining help to find jobs. to stabilize their finances and housing situations. and to make positive changes in behavior. attitudes. and school performance. On May 19. 1998. the Fannie Mae Foundation presented a Maxwell Sustained Excellence Award to Project for Pride in Living. This award is given to communitybased nonprofit organizations demonstrating the best examples of sustained creation and management of communities and neighborhoods. PPL was one of ten award winners this year. selected from a pool of 160 applicants from across the United States. All ten awardees have a history of building and sustaining communities. with housing being the lead component of their efforts. As a Maxwell Sustained Excellence Award winner. PPL will receive a threeyear grant of $150.000 to further organizational development. and a threeyear. $250.000 Community and Neighborhood Development Fund (CNDF) loan.

The article. entitled \"A State Without Snakes Keeps a Wary Eye Out for an Alien Invader.\" describes the threat that Hawaii faces from the brown tree snake. As explained by the articles author. the brown tree snake has already devastated the ecology of Guam. and it is one of the most frightening alien species threatening Hawaii today. If it manages to become established in Hawaii. the snake could decimate Hawaiis entire bird population. as it has already done on Guam. It is also known to attack babies. eat pets. and cause frequent electricity outages by climbing power lines. Numerous programs in both the public and private sectors have been organized to contain and control the brown tree snake population. They deserve our support. Hawaii has unique and endangered plant and animal species. many of which would be threatened if the snake succeeded in establishing itself in the Hawaiian Islands. It is possible. but unlikely. that this event may have already occurred. Because there are no natural predators. one pregnant snake could establish this species on the islands. As we move toward consideration of appropriations in the weeks ahead. I look forward to sufficient funds being approved by the House for brown tree snake research and eradication.

It requires a license to sell tobacco products similar to those for sale of alcohol. It provides loss of license to sell by retail outlets for repeated infractions.

As a result. this practice only perpetuates the distance between those inside the beltway and those on Main Street.

It is now time to apply that same logic to the private sector. I fully support the Mandates Information Act because it aims to extend the same accountability. currently afforded to state and local governments. to the private sector. The Mandates Information Act will force Congress to take a good look at how the legislation we consider will impact those whom it affects most. No longer should Congress to able to pass on mandates whose financial implications arent fully considered. If the citizens in the private sector must be held accountable for complying with Federal law. Congress should be held accountable to the people affected by those laws.",

Despite a tax system that discourages savings. many American families work hard to set aside a portion of their earnings because they hope to be able to leave something to their children. Not only are these lifelong savings subject to the death tax. however. but the value of the unified credita major death tax reduction toolhad. until recently. been seriously eroded by inflation. As a result of the historic \"Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\" the unified credit will now be increased from an effective exemption of $600.000 in 1998 to an effective exemption of $1.000.000 in 2006. Regrettably. while both the Houseand Senatepassed versions of that landmark tax reduction package indexed this $1.000.000 exemption annually for inflation. this provision was dropped from the final conference report and was not enacted into law. My Speaker. the legislation I am introducing today would simply provide for an annual costof living adjustment to the unified credit beginning in 2007.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Friday. July 24. I introduced legislation along with Senators ASHCROFT. BURNS. and ABRAHAM to repeal the legal mandate for personal identification codes for each patient that would be part of a national medical records system. Our legislation. S. 2352. the Patient Privacy Rights Act. would repeal the unique medical identifiers requirement of the Health Insurance Portability Law of 1996 (HIPAA). This law directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a system to use personal identifying codes as part of a system for electronically transmitting health information to aid implementation of the health insurance portability law. The unique health identifiers would be codes. numbers or other methods of uniquely identifying each patient that his or her doctors would be required to use throughout that persons lifetime. Hearings on the emerging system were launched in Chicago this week by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics. I believe it is irresponsible to expose patients to this massive new erosion of their privacy. The impetus to computerize medical records for the sake of efficiency cannot be allowed to overrun our basic privacy. People deserve the assurance that their medical histories will not be the subject of public curiosity. commercial advantage or harmful disclosure. This computerization of medical information has raised the stakes in privacy protection. Congress created this threat. Now Congress needs to just say no to the idea of a cradletograve medical dossier. Health care computerization not only is inevitable. it can be a useful tool to improve health care. But trusting our medical records to this rapidly developing technology will only be supported by the American people if they are assured that their medical privacy is protected. Privacy is not the only victim here. Without privacy protections. many will be discouraged from seeking help or taking advantage of the access we are working so hard to protect in this very same law. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. The text of the bill follows: S. 2352 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Head Start program has successfully served hundreds of thousands of children over the past 33 years. These are children who otherwise would have been left behind. Instead. they received an enriching opportunity to get prepared for elementary school. It is critical that we allow local Head Start providers to continue to focus on their mission of serving families and children first. They serve our most vulnerable populations. We need to make sure that we do not saddle Head Start with the additional responsibilities that some members have proposed. Responsibilities such as determining paternity. or enforcing welfare laws by verifying TANF requirements. are duties which are within the realm and expertise of social workers and other professionals. Requiring Head Start to handle these burdensome responsibilities would take their time. energy and focus away from serving families and children first. We are finding that the quality of instruction and programs at Head Start continues to improve. We must continue to improve quality. One major concern is the authority given to private companies in this bill. While forprofits are partners with many Head Start grantees. their profitmaking goals are not wholly consistent with the mission of serving the public good. Mr. President. in June. 1995. several respected researchers from Yale University and other universities issued a report comparing the quality and cost outcomes between forprofit and nonprofit centers. The research shows that nonprofit centers on average have more teachers with Associates of Arts in Early Childhood Education degrees than forprofit centers. Futhermore. forprofit centers on average had lower quality scores but higher costs per child than nonprofit centers. Also. forprofit centers make very little use of volunteers from the community. I fear that forprofits are not about quality and community. Mr. President. presently under 50 percent of the eligible population is served by the Head Start program. It is important that Head Start continues to expand and serve a greater number of children. However. during these times of welfare reform. it is also necessary that Head Start provide fullday. fullyear programs for working families. In order to achieve both goals. it is important that expansion occurs cautiously. Overall. the bill allows flexibility and focuses on school readiness and should be supported. Head Start is one of the most important investments we can make in our children.*",

The first Womens Rights Convention was held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20 of that year. There. a small group ratified the \"Declaration of Sentiments.\" a document which may be considered the Magna Carta of the womens movement. The Declaration proclaimed that: All men and women are created equal: That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. that among these are life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That was the first American political ideathat women are equal in civic rights with men. It did not come from Europe. or ancient Athens. or Rome. It came right from central New York. In 1980. we established a Womens Rights Historic Park at Seneca Falls and Waterloo. commemorating this monumental convention. Former Senator Javits and I proposed a bill to create an historic park within Seneca Falls to commemorate the early beginnings of the womens movement and to recognize the important role Seneca Falls has played in the movement.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the life and accomplishments of Thomas Clifford Estes of New Ipswich. New Hampshire. who recently passed away at the age of 66. The family of Tom Estes can take comfort and pride in the way that he lived his life. Born on November 28. 1931 to the late Bedford and Emily Estes of New York. Tom graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and later studied at RCA Institute. Following his fathers distinguished example in serving this country in the armed forces. Tom joined the United States Navy in 1951. shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. For three of his four years of active duty. Tom served on the U.S.S. Tarawa. a Navy aircraft carrier that entered the Asian war zone. He earned a number of Navy awards. including the Korean Service Medal. the United Nations Service Medal. the China Service Medal. the National Defense Service Medal. the Good Conduct Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal. Toms service to the nation was commendable. not just during the Korean War. but throughout his thirtytwo years of Federal civil service. He began his career as a quality assurance engineer for the United States military in Florida and later moved to Dallas. Texas. before settling in New Hampshire in.1967. Upon his retirement. Tom was recognized by the Defense Logistics Agency for his contributions. Tom was admired for his integrity. dedication to his community and positive demeanor. He remained a devoted husband to his wife. Mary. throughout almost thirtyfive years of marriage and helped care for his disabled sister for many years. An accomplished chess player. Tom also enjoyed baseball and studied the law. He and his wife ran a small. twentyacre farm in New Ipswich for many years. He was a man who cared about the needs of others and his community. whose sense of humor. cheery smile and knack for storytelling will be missed by all who knew him. Tom will be buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. August 3. 1998. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife. Mary. his daughter. Evelyn. his sons Thomas and Peter. and his sister. Nancy. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to this special American in the official RECORD of the annals of Congress.e",

I appreciate their commitment to address a matter of serious concern to me regarding provisions that would unintentionally impact the Rural Development Loan Fund currently administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Coats Act includes the repeal of section 407 of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Community Economic Development Act. These statutory repeals were included to achieve a reasonable clarification of the statutory authority held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Upon further examination of these provisions after the committee markup. we discovered that this housekeeping action for HHS would eliminate provisions essential to the USDAs administration of the Rural Development Loan Fund. a lending program that has provided vital economic support to several communities in Kentucky. I understand that during conference. Senators COATS and JEFFORDS have agreed to recede to the House position and drop the Coats Act provisions that repeal section 407 and CEDA.",

I commend Senator JEFFORDS. Senator COATS. and Senator DODD for their leadership in making this bill a reality. Together we have produced legislation that preserves and enhances these needed family programs while addressing the concerns that have been raised. Our bipartisan goal is to take these worthwhile programs and make them even better. The pending bill is an important step toward a more effective family policy. This legislation consolidates. reorganizes. and reauthorizes services for poor families and their children by investing in programs to strengthen families. promote child development. and build communities. In keeping with efforts to reinvent government. the Act promotes onestop shopping by consolidating several existing categorical programs into more comprehensive and coordinated programs. It improves performance by developing outcome measures and monitoring progress. and it puts families first by promoting selfsufficiency. We have worked carefully to draft a bill that addresses the concerns of Senators on both sides of the aisle.

Let me suggest it is far beyond just protecting livestock. Timber resources are sometimes protected against bear and beaver damage. crops such as grass seed production. which is huge in the Willamette Valley in the State of Oregon. from Canada goose damage. and. of course. predation from livestock. protecting the public safety of the Portland International Airport. All of these are issues that this money goes to protect. Mr. Chairman. to say that a horrible thing is to kill coyotes is from somebody who has never been in coyote country. Let me tell the Members that if they want to make the choice. they either take coyotes or deer and antelope. Which do Members like? The management of predators is about protecting wildlife. as well. so we cannot say that we are here in the great name of the coyote. while at the same time saying. but we have to protect deer and antelope. Wrong. Therefore. let the professionals determine how this money is to be spent. as they do today.

They are going to destroy the opportunity of the Fish and Wildlife Service to control predatory animal problems in almost each of our 50 States if we allow this amendment to pass. We can make arguments about the different amount of control all day. But the fact is that there are various damages to the tune of estimated up to $3 billion annually that occur and this is going to continue to grow.

But more specifically. let us look at some cases where children would be hurt if this money was cut. There have been eight fatal alligator attacks in the last 50 years and three of them have occurred in the last 4 years. including the killing of a 3yearold. A short while ago. an 18yearold high school senior was killed by a cougar while out jogging. Recently in Montana. the Department of Fish and Wildlife captured a cougar on a campus stroll at the University of Montana. And last year. a 4yearold was mauled by a mountain lion in Colorado. We have countless cases. Children traveling on aircraft. for example. would be put at risk if animal damage control were not allowed to deal with wildlife that puts aviation at risk near many of the airports in this country.

Today. there are a variety of lowcost. humane approaches to controlling wildlife. The trend all across the country is to try to find ways to live with wildlife. on both public and private lands. Yet USDA continues to use leghold traps. poison. and aerial gunning to kill bears. mountain lions. coyotes. and other wildlife. In addition. leghold traps and poisons are indiscriminate methods that end up killing nontarget species. including threatened and endangered species. It is high time for Congress to stop forcing taxpayers to subsidize this senseless slaughter. This program is athrowback to a happily bygone era when we \"managed\" bison. wolves. grizzly bears. and other species by nearly extirpating them from the landscape.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in strong support of the BassDeFazio amendment. In past Agriculture Appropriations bills I myself have led the fight to curtail funds for this wasteful and abusive program. Wildlife Services. formerly known as Animal Damage Control. is an anachronism. It was created in 1931 and except for a cosmetic name change the law hasnt been changed or reformed since. This program is based on poor science. and has virtually no accountability to Congress or the general public. The program focuses excessively on lethal control. despite numerous Congressional attempts and GAO investigations to curb this practice. This program wastes taxpayer dollars and is an unnecessary and ineffective government subsidy. Consider these facts: In every western state in FY 95. ADC spent more money controlling predators than the value of the livestock allegedly lost to predators by ADC beneficiaries. Western livestock ranchers and ranching associations contribute less than 14 percent annually to the costs of the program. This subsidy puts livestock producers in other areas of the country at a competitive disadvantage. Between 1983 and 1993. Federal appropriations to ADC increased 71 percent while the number of coyotes killed increased 30 percent but the number of livestock losses to predators did not decline. From 19901994. ADC killed at least 7.8 million animals. This includes nontarget species such as bald eagles and ferrets killed by nonselective ADC methods like poisoning. leghold traps and snares. This amendment will not touch ADC funding to protect human health and safety or endangered species. What it will do is free taxpayers from having to foot the bill for predator control activities that benefit private ranching operations in the Westthese interests are free to contract with ADC and pay for those services themselves. This amendment is supported by taxpayer. conservation. and humane groups which object to public land subsidies that undercut the competitiveness of livestock producers in other regions of the country. Please join us in ending this inappropriate and inhumane taxpayer subsidy. Vote in favor of the BassDeFazio amendment.",

What if anything should be done to allow taxes or taxation or a series of taxes on the access to the Internet? That is a central problem. We have grappled with that for quite some time. and the central issue has become whether or not we should take our time and really study the issue before we look into that dark realm of taxation as it pertains to the Internet.

Electronic commerce over the Internet is one of todays most dynamic and important business segments. By approving this bill. the Congress will be taking yet another strong action to protect and foster the socalled information superhighway. The Committee on the Judiciary has already approved on a bipartisan basis bills protecting copyright in cyberspace and eliminating burdensome encryption controls. This bill will help ensure that State taxes do not impede the vibrancy or growth of the Internet. The Internet Tax Freedom Act ensures that States do not enact discriminatory or double taxes which discourage the use of the Internet. At the same time. the substitute protects the States legitimate rights to tax Internet sales transactions in the same manner they tax the sale of ordinary goods. We also create a moratorium on new taxes on access to the Internet. Currently a complex patchwork of State and local laws creates an impossible situation for online service providers in determining who to tax and to whom to remit. There is also a grandfather clause that will allow current taxes to stay in place if States reaffirm within the 1year period. We also set up a balanced commission of representatives from the Federal Government. the States and industry to help develop a coherent blueprint for interstate taxation of Internet transactions and mail order goods in the future. The bill grandfathers those States which currently tax Internet access.

It may have been when he was serving in the United States Air Force. I do know that since serving his country in the Air Force. Pastor Tom has been a pastor for 40 years. In fact. 20 of those years he has been Pastor at the First Assembly of God Church in Alexandria. Virginia. Now. during that period of time he has gotten all kinds of awards. and I could list all of them. and he has spoken on the 700 Club and he has become nationally known. both for his sermons and his books and his leadership. But we know him because he is a dynamic figure in our community. People gather together under his leadership and are inspired by his commitment to God and to the principles that he has dedicated his life to. So it is a particular pleasure to have him address this body this day. I thank the majority leader for arranging it. I thank Pastor Tom for all of the many. many years that he has served our community and our country. Thank you. Tom.",

While the Laotian Constitution guarantees religious freedom for its citizens. in reality the government restricts freedom of religion. especially for Christian denominations. Recently. 40 Laos citizens and 5 foreigners. 3 of whom were Americans. were arrested and imprisoned. The official reason given for their arrest was \"illegal assembly.\" however. the real cause was related to their practice of the Christian faith. The record of Laos in this regard is troubling. According to the State Departments Country Reports on Human Rights for 1997. the Lao government has harassed. arrested and jailed clergy members. Members of the Lao Christian community are often looked upon with distrust by their government as having connections to \"foreign influences.\" There are also unconfirmed reports that Christians have been barred from joining the Lao Peoples Revolutionary Party or from securing government employment. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. this Member sincerely hopes that the United States and Laos can develop warm and cordial relations. The potential Is there. However. Mr. Speaker. this Member. through this forum. now urges the government of Laos to stop the growing trend of religious persecution within their borders.",

Never was this more apparent than on Friday when California reached a historic agreement with local Indians regarding Indian gaming in California. In fact. the tribal chairman there is quoted as saying \"a turning point in tribalstate relations\" has been reached. The real significance of this agreement. however. lies more in its origin than in its content. Despite numerous attempts by Secretary Babbitt to backdoor his way into negotiations and the approval process. California has rightly asserted its sovereign status and jurisdiction. This compromise between California and sovereign Indian nations is proof that Federal intervention was not necessary. nor would it have been appropriate in this issue. California correctly and repeatedly told the Interior Department to butt out. that they do not need to be told by the Federal Government what is best for their State. Now we have proof. The Tenth Amendment works. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 3094. a bill which will ensure that no State must sit back while the Federal Government tramples the Constitution and blatantly disregards their sovereignty.",

Women employ over 350.000 people in Colorado and were responsible for generating $39 billion in sales in 1996. While many of the businesses owned by Colorado women are traditional. such as service and retail. the greatest increase in womenowned firms has been in Industries like transportation. communications. construction. and mining. Women are making significant contributions to the economy in Colorado and across the country.

Here is a lesson in government accounting. In 1998. the Congressional Budget Office. CBO. projects there will be a surplus of $8 billion. and the national debt will be $5.5 trillion. Remember. the national debt is the total from accumulated deficits and. interest payments. In 2002. after 5 years of balanced budgets.

Let me repeat. the national debt in 1998 will be $5.5 trillion. after years of surpluses. the national debt in 2002 will be $6.4 trillion. What is wrong with this picture? How can the government say the Federal budget will be in surplus at the same time that the national debt will increase by nearly $1 trillion?

That is exactly what is happening. I could support various provisions in the Patients Bill of Rightsthe clinical trials. I think we should have them. I want to support them.

The Labor Committee has dealt with this issue at more than seven hearings. hearings that have brought people in from around the country. talking about this particular problem and about how serious it is. There has been one meeting in the subcommittee of the Finance Committee on his bill. So lets talk about hearings. Lets talk about the array of people who have come forth and said. \"Why are you waiting? Why arent you moving ahead with this legislation?\" I dont have an answer to that. Our caucus is attempting to promote the opportunity for all people to be heard on this issue. The Senator from New York also made mention of the fact that his bill deals with mastectomy. and it is a very important contribution. I applaud Senator FEINSTEIN and others for making the effort. as they have. to get to this point. But his legislation is very. very narrowly focused. He said he supports clinical trials. We want to give him the opportunity to vote for it. He says he supports access to specialists. We want to give him the opportunity to vote for it. He wants to protect the information. the records of patients. Lets give him and others a chance to vote for it. That is what our bill does. It goes way beyond simply the right. that a woman surely should have. to be more confident about her ability to get the proper treatment when in a situation as sensitive as a mastectomy. But lets provide them the protection through clinical trials. Lets ensure that they can see necessary specialists. Lets ensure that their records are going to be protected. Lets do It all.

The program was designed to operate as an extensive partnership involving professionals from the disciplines of parks and recreation. education. city government. social services and criminal justice. It was designed to operate year round with expanded activity during the summer months and over extended holiday periods. Youth participants were involved through various avenues such as schools. home school associations. youth service agencies. and neighborhood community centers. The program has provided various activities such as backpacking in Olympic National Park. whitewater rafting on the Thompson River in British Columbia. crosscountry skiing in Mount Ranier National Park. winter camping. innertubing and snow shoeing in various winter sports areas. water safety instruction. fishing. canoeing. boating and swimming. mountain packing on designated State and Federal lands. weekly environmental education outdoor skills workshops. leadership training for advanced youth participants and youth hosteling and meeting travelers from around the world.

These opportunities are targeted at urban youth and the expansion of pre- and afterschool activities. Mr. Chairman. in my own district in the City of New Brunswick. which is located in the central part of New Jersey. UPARR grants have been used to renovate jogging paths and playing fields and to construct new playing fields at Buccleuch Park. The park is used as a recreational facility by local high school sports teams. as well as sports teams from Rutgers. the State University of New Jersey. In addition. a UPARR grant made additional renovations possible so that senior citizens and disabled persons from the senior citizen resource center next door could make use of the parks facilities. Other UPARR grants have facilitated similar activities at Feaster Park. Joyce Kilmer Park and Recreation Park. also located in New Brunswick. The National Park Service anticipates applications from 100 to 150 urban localities across the country for UPARR grants in fiscal year 1999. requests which will total approximately $20 million. The $2 million that we are trying to add to the bill today with this amendment will enable the Park Service to award 10 to 15 grants. only 10 percent of those requested.

This discourages our young men and women who are involved in the service. I think it is very important that we send a very positive message to them. to our current active military as well as our veterans. that we will make good on our commitment to them. And this is an opportunity to ensure that those benefits will be there and that we will continue to work to fulfill those commitments. I recognize that this is difficult and the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Arizona have worked very hard. but I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for offering this amendment.",

This amendment is not intended to imply in any way that his concern and care for veterans and that his responsibility for increasing veteran spending in the last 4 years is anything less than stellar. I think the assumption made by the gentleman from Wisconsin that if this money is not in there that everything is going to shut down is not an accurate assumption. E 1445 As a matter of fact. that assumption would mean to say that the Senate intends to shut down HUD and FHA loans because they have put no money in for this amendment. The other thing that I would want to make sure that the Members are aware of. that the American Legion. the Order of Purple Heart and the Veterans of Foreign Wars adamantly and fully support this amendment. It will in fact move us in a direction of meeting the obligations that we are obligated and morally bound to fulfill.",

In spite of a few of them maybe being bad. I believe that they are doing better. doing a better job and being more responsible. I can cite the Dallas VA as an example of that. So I do not think that we need to wait to increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans are probably our most important product here in this country. and it is time we supported them fully. I think it is important that not only all the veterans organizations support this amendment but our Conservative Action Team also on this side supports it. I think $304 million that we have been discussing back and forth here is kind of one of those nebulous things that nobody has really put their finger on to say it is really needed. If it was not there last year. why do we need it this year. and they can waive the rules so that it can operate under mandatory funding. Apparently that is what our Senate did. I would encourage us to help our veterans. It is an aging population. as has been stated before. Our age is going to peak in the year 2000. We need to have more money in that system. The Committee on Veterans Affairs recommended about $452 million above the House level. This $300 million will start to make our veterans well.

This is wrong. Our current system clearly is not working to keep cigarettes and chewing tobacco out of the hands of children. Selling tobacco products to minors is illegal in 50 States. Nonetheless. 13 studies showed that children can buy tobacco 67 percent of the time in this country. Three thousand young people under the age of 18 will begin to smoke each day. a third of them will die. They will join the ranks of the 400.000 people who die each year from tobacco related illnesses.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for the 17 years that I have been a Member of Congress. abortion advocates have often let the Republican abortion advocates offer proabortion amendments. It has played well with the press. it is contrarient. 80 percent of our caucus is prolife. and the gentleman from Pennsylvania . the gentleman from California and the gentleman from New York certainly have proabortion credentials. They were among 7 members of our caucus who voted against the partialbirth abortion ban. Let me just make it very clear that when the gentlewoman from California appeared before the Committee on Rules. and I listened intently to every word she said. she said that either she or someone else would be allowed to offer a perfecting amendment. That someone else is the socalled prochoice Republicans. Their perfecting amendment. let it be very clear. absolutely guts the SmithHydeOberstarBarcia amendment. It is a totally gutting amendment. So they get their opportunity. which makes me wonder about this whole proceeding that we are watching. I also wanted to make the point that the gentleman from Alabama said he does not want to deal with legislative policy language on an appropriations bill. Then do not authorize the appropriation itself. At some point there will have to be a waiver. Let there be no waiver. let the authorizing committees do both. the funding and the policy. [] 1830",

The problem with the rule and the situation that we have today. when we had the rule on the floor. originally the Agriculture appropriations bill. the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox] had an amendment. and I had a perfecting amendment to his amendment. His amendment. I felt. went way too far. because what would happen is it would cut off all humanitarian aid to North Korea. I amended that. with his support. saying that no food aid. no humanitarian aid should go to the government or to the military of North Korea but do not deny. do not deny humanitarian aid to the people. the innocent people. These are always the people that get the short end of the stick. So. as a result of that. as a result of passing this modified closed rule. I am prohibited from offering a perfecting amendment to the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox]. Therefore. what we will have is an amendment that really does injustice and great harm to a lot of innocent people that are now facing famine. And this is the problem with the rule that we now have before us. So what is needed is a change in the rule. It is my understanding that the gentleman from New York or the gentleman from Washington was going to offer a change in the rule that they could offer an amendment to change the rule to accept a compromise amendment from CoxHall. which would be acceptable to me.

They have limited prenatal care. isolation from family and friends. and the great tragedy of having this infant. if to term. to be lost to them forever. but. more importantly. incapable of taking care of them. Abortion is legal. The right to life and the right to choice are things that are not mutually exclusive. We want to give life again to these women who have been battered and abused.

Children whose parents have not been near prisons cannot be taken. We find no homes for them. and the children of incarcerated parents are more dammed than those whose parents have not been incarcerated. The figures tell the story of what happens to foster children and children in prison. and the figures do not lie. Now Mother Theresa might have taken them. but there are not other takers out here. The gentleman would be the first to come to the floor if Planned Parenthood came forward to try to pay for abortions for these children. to try to deny them funds to pay for abortions for these women. We are talking about voluntary abortions here. as always. I would prefer if there were a mechanism for these women to have their children adopted. assuming there were people who would. in fact. adopt them. There are not people who will adopt a homeless child on the street today. and everybody knows that. The notion of violence raised here in this context is an amazing one indeed. What would of course be violent is forced childbirth. That is what would be left here. All of the inflammatory debate about abortion has not reduced support for abortion in this country.

I was particulady pleased by passage of the TreasuryPostal operations spending bill this past week because of a provision I worked hard to include in this legislation which will protect the rights of Federal employees. With the help of my colleague. ERNEST ISTOOK. who sits on this subcommittee. we were able to attach language to prohibit funding for nontechnical Federal employee training. including HowTo sessions on condom use. sex techniques. and the proper way to clean needles in order to shootup illicit drugs. In 1995. I fought to deny funding for the Clinton administrations controversial agenda to promote diversity through mandatory training sessions. I have seen some of this training and it is truly shocking. I worked to retain this provision to ensure that Federal workers wont have to endure this training and taxpayers wont have to pay for it. Mr. Speaker. the training sponsored by the administration goes far beyond employees professional responsibilities. It is inappropriate for the Federal Government to use taxpayers money to subject Federal employees to this kind of social engineering. Our language should put an end to this lunacy. We should only fund those things vital to the function of the Government. I think most hardworking Americans would agree that training Federal employees to safely use drugs or wear condoms in no way falls under that category.

Some of you may know about the market access case the United States Government filed against the Government of Japan before the World Trade Organization concerning consumer film and photographic paper. Eastman Kodak Company has been routinely prevented from competing fairly in Japan by the Japanese Government. which has been protecting Fuji film. the domestic film manufacturer. For over 30 years. the Japanese Government has worked closely with Japanese business. using nontariff barriers. unspoken agreements. and implicit understandings to keep foreign competition out of the Japanese market. This case has farreaching and precedentsetting ramifications. Why? First. this case highlights the nature of our trade relationship with Japan. where trade fairness has been a recurring concern. Japan is Americas second largest trade partner but maintains Americas largest trade deficit. which is 43 percent of our total trade deficit. Second. this case centers around the future of the WTO as an effective forum to settle international trade conflicts. The ramifications of the photographic film and paper case before the WTO are immense. At stake is the.future of free and open market access not just for film. but. for all companies looking to trade with Japan.

Former Generals of the United States armed forces have called for such a commitment. The International Court of Justice has opined on the obligation nations have to achieve this goal. The United Nations General Assembly has recently acted in this regard and circulating now is a draft convention on the elimination of such weapons. I urge our government to take the lead in changing its own policy and in advancing the cause of nuclear disarmament in the world. We should not be inventing new uses for these weapons of mass destruction. but should instead use all of the power of our imagination. diplomacy and statecraft to achieve this objective. In this light. Mr. Speaker. I want to share with my colleagues two documents that are part of the legal and moral fabric that surrounds this issue. The first is of the \"dispositif\" of the International Court of Justice which illuminates the legal obligations that face the nations of the world. The second is the General Assembly Resolution on this subject. I hope that my colleagues will familiarize themselves with the issues raised within these important documents.",

Bob was a familiar figure in Southampton and a regular columnist for the weekly Southampton Press. where according to his editor Peter Boody. :\"He wrote mostly about things that irritated him. and that included everything from people with no class to historians who didnt give Southampton the credit it deserved.\" Bob was a vocal and articulate advocate of Southamptons cause in the debate with Southold over which community was the first on Long Island to establish an Englishspeaking settlement. For 31 years. Mr. Keene ran a bookstore and art gallery in Southampton that brought him into daily contact with such notables as Truman Capote and Willem de Kooning. His store carried many rare titles. including a first edition of Dr. Samuel Johnsons dictionary and a copy of the first Roman Catholic bible published in America. Bob also had a very passionate appreciation for art and eventually he combined his love for books and art by displaying art work in his shop. Bob started working with the town historians office when it was under William Dunwell. Mr. Dunwell was first appointed town historian in 1939 and served the people of Southampton faithfully for 43 years until 1981 when he retired to become historian emeritus. Bob took over the historians office in 1979. although he was not officially appointed historian until Mr. Dunwells retirement in 1981. From day one Bob office was an historic treasure trove piled high with books. documents. photographs and local history memorabilia. The local history that Mr. Keene carried in his head. garnered from his own personal experiences and his years working with William Dunwell. was considered so valuable. that the town board recently budgeted $10.000 to capture it all in an oralhistory project. Regrettably. that project was not begun before Mr. Keenes untimely death. An irreplaceable history is lost to us forever.

The same White House that releases documents. subpoenaed documents. no less. one drip at a time. now is complaining that the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight is not being forthcoming in release of documents.

The same Democrats who took the criminal intercept of a private conversation on a cellular phone last year and then released it to the press is now upset that the perfectly legal and routinely taped conversation of a convicted prisoner has been exposed for all the world to see. Maybe all these people simply wish to divert attention from the greatest scandal of them all: the one in the White House.",

It has not been tested across the country. Virtually nobody really understands what is in it. In addition. it is a travesty that we are not in this body voting on NEA funding. which every single Member knows would be reinstated to the exact amount it got last year if we were given that opportunity. because of legislative process and procedures that has been avoided. The bottom line is that most groups In this country that I have been in touch with through fax. by telephone call. whatever. are in opposition to this amendment. That goes all the way from the Conference of Mayors to arts groups in general to business leaders to State arts agencies. all of whom are saying this is not the way to proceed.

It is a simple attempt at providing continued Federal funding for the arts. given the fact that the House at this moment in time is not prepared to continue the NEA. So the issue is clear. Do we want to send a bill to the Senate that has no NEA and no arts funding. or do we want to send a bill to the Senate that has no NEA but does have continued arts funding? The choice to me is very clear. Let us continue the Federal support for the arts. Let us continue to provide funding for the arts through the various State agencies that are available. through the arts education programs at various States and that school districts have. I believe it.will be a more equitable distribution than we have had. It certainly will be far less controversial. and I believe it will be beneficial for the arts. for the people of this Nation who are interested in the arts. and it will be beneficial for the students who will be learning about the arts. I think it is a winwin situation. I urge all Members of this body to forget partisan differences. to forget the arguments about the NEA and say at this point in time the best thing we can do is pass this amendment and send this bill to the Senate with continued funding for the arts. and we will there. in conference. resolve the issues about the future of the NEA.

Representative SIDNEY YATES. The regular order of the House will call for the ranking member to have an amendment made in order on a subject on which he has standing. No one in the country has more standing on the arts than SID YATESa champion indeed. We are all privileged to call him colleague. Yesterday. Mr. ARMEY said that the Ehlers amendment would put Crayolas in the hands of our children. Yes Crayolas and thats about all. The Ehlers amendment would translate into less than $1 per child. Thats for a small box of crayons with no burnt siena and azure blue. The Rep leadership has shown its true colors on this Ehlers amendment. In the debate on the NEA they claim they need to reduce the deficit. Today they are spending that money on the Ehlers amendment. This is about content restruction not deficit reduction.

I suggested to the House today that if they gave the opportunity to this House for me to offer my amendment to reinstate NEA and give it some money to operate.

I would like to express my strong disappointment that the rule for debate of the Interior appropriations bill blocked an open and fair vote on funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I support the NEA. as do a majority of my constituents and. according to poll after poll. a majority of Americans. NEAfunded activities have permitted public school students in San Pedro. Venice. and Torrance the opportunity to participate in improvisational theater sponsored by a touring performing arts and musical company. They have enjoyed special education operatic performances. They city of Venice has hosted numerous performing arts events. arts displays. and multimedia activities. And. a grant to the LA Theater Works Program in my district enabled a set of five American stage plays taped for radio to be donated to 500 underserved libraries throughout the country. Events. programs. and gifts such as these foster creativity and an appreciation of our rich and diverse cultural and artistic heritage. Mr. Chairman. private funds alone will not permit the continuation of activities like these should Congress eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. And. while I certainly understand the necessity of restructuring and reforming the NEA. elimination is not reform. As mandated in past Congresses. the NEA has worked tirelessly to ensure that local decision makers are given the ability to fund the programs needed and requested by their communities. The proposal to transfer arts funding to State agencies will only waste precious dollars in creating 50 new bureaucracies to administer a program effectively run now by the NEA. States and cities tell us they are concerned that other funding sources they currently enjoy in support of their arts programs will dry up. The House should be allowed to debate the future of this agency openly and fully and to vote. Regrettably. it wont.

Although I did vote in favor of the rule yesterday. which allowed for arts block grants as a substitute for NEA funds. I did so in strong recognition of the importance of arts and as a method of continuing dialog between arts supporters and opponents. I do however. have concerns that the Ehlers compromise does not adequately recognize the importance of the Federal arts presence. and that it does not adequately fund or allow States to fund traveling art projects and other activities which had been funded by NEA program grants. Many of these grants. such as the Glen Ellen Childrens Chorus. the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra. and the American Western Composers Midwest Chapter have done an excellent job of providing arts education and enrichment throughout the State of Illinois. and I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD a complete list of the outstanding arts organizations funded by NEA program grants in Illinois. The amendment. although not a perfect compromise does continue arts funding in America. I support its affirmation of the State and local arts agencies funded by State arts councils. Indeed. its recognition of the Importance of arts education is also well intended. I therefore urge support of the amendment. While saying this. I also urge the House and Senate conferees to strongly consider the importance of the Federal arts programs ongoing in the United States as they evaluate arts programs either within or outside of the National Endowment for the Arts structure.

One day. however. the Emperor began parading through the land with his clothes off. He even assured himself and his followers that he was in fact wearing clothes. They just could not see them. because only stupid people could not see the clothes. Because they did not want to be thought of as stupid. his lawyers and followers and supporters agreed. \"Oh. yes. he must be wearing clothes.\" And so they trumpeted throughout the land.

This was the first public hearing held on the bill since our committee that I serve on did not have any hearings on the bill that passed this House. That hearing confirmed what we have been saying for months. that families in managed care want and need some reform this year.

It is interesting. the same Republicans who just a few months ago right here in this House were saying it was dishonest to raid money from the highway trust fund are now saying it is okay. though. to raid money. to steal money. from the seniors trust fund. their Social Security trust fund. Mr. Speaker. if Republicans felt it was dishonest to steal from the highway trust fund. then I assume they are admitting it is dishonest to steal from the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Speaker. I support tax cuts. But I will not vote for a tax cut next week pushed by Republicans that steals money from our seniors future. from our seniors security and our cherished Social Security trust fund. I think Republicans should think twice before they say highways and concrete and election promises are more important than saving our Social Security trust fund.",

This past Monday I had the opportunity to visit Freehold Borough High School for a tour of the school and to teach a class on the U.S. Constitution. Throughout my visit I was consistently impressed with the sophistication and knowledge of the students and the innovation and dedication exhibited by the teachers and administrators. I began my visit by taking part in a lunch that was prepared by the students of the culinary arts and restaurant management class which is just one of the many ways they expand their curriculum to serve the dynamic and evolving opportunities faced by the students of today. After speaking with Dr. Carolyn MulhareMcKee. the schools principal. it is abundantly clear that the Freehold Borough High School is committed to providing a firstclass education that will prepare its students for the 21st century. The residents and parents of this area should be proud to have such a fine school educating their children.",

We did not even give the President the simple courtesy of seeing the report a day or two before its release even though we had given the Speaker of the House the courtesy when the House Ethics Committee had charges against him.

I am proud of what we have done so far. passing tax cuts for families with kids and making it easier for them to afford higher education. But there is much more to do. especially for younger children. State and local taxes pay most of the cost of education. They always have. But while the Federal Government provides only about 7 percent of all the funding for local schools. it creates over half of their paperwork. Mr. Speaker. that is why I have cosponsored legislation to guarantee that at least 95 percent of Federal education funds get to the classroom instead of being consumed by the bureaucracy. We cannot allow Federal paperwork to continue to siphon off valuable time. energy and resources away from the classroom. Our children are too important.",

But we have also heard stories of SFOR commanders telling their troops that if they encounter an indicted war criminal they should leave the area immediately and take no action. I can think of no better way to honor the memory of Srebrenica then if today SFOR turns over a new leaf. and vows to pursue its mandate vigorously and to the maximum degree possible. If indicted war criminals are not brought to justice. the international community will have betrayed the legacy of Nuremberg. the victims of the war that tore Yugoslavia apart. and women worldwide. This will also set a dangerous precedent that will give encouragement to others elsewhere in the world who may consider the use of rape and genocide as tools of war. In the aftermath of the Holocaust 50 years ago. the civilized world vowed that we would never again allow crimes against humanity to blacken our history. In the aftermath of the tragedy of Srebrenica 2 years ago. we vowed that we would bring peace and justice to Bosnia. Today. on the second anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica the international community must vow to redouble its commitment to take immediate strong action to see that the indicted war criminals are brought to justice. If not. as I stated in my letter to the President on April 21. 1997. we run the risk that future historians will look back on current U.S. policy and conclude that the ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as an instrument of war is acceptableand that those who perpetrate this crime can do so with impunity. This would be a tragic betrayal of our history. our principles. and the people of Srebrenica. I ask that the correspondence to which I earlier referred be printed in the RECORD.

Latvia and Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ever since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. there has been talk of expanding NATO membership to include countries of Central Europe and the former Baltic Republics. These Baltic countries are continually striving to transform their political and economic institutions in accordance with democratic ideals and free market principles. We have seen remarkable achievements in this respect. from countries that have endured many years of communist occupation. I believe that expanding NATO to include Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia would benefit bilateral trade and investment through a stable security environment. Furthermore. these countries have made great strides in the areas of human rights. civil liberties and the rule of law. and have also actively participated in the Partnership for Peace. They should be rewarded for these efforts. Most importantly however. enlargement of NATO to include these Baltic States would secure a principal gain of the cold war by strengthening new free markets and democracies in the region. Latvia. Lithuania and Estonia are all working very hard to satisfy the prerequisites of entry into NATO. As such. I am supportive of all efforts to integrate them in the membership of that organization as soon as the process permits.*",

This resolution recommends the return of. or compensation for. foreign properties that were wrongly confiscated in formerly Communist countries and by certain foreign financial institutions. I join my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission in calling for restitution to the many victims who have suffered property losses at the hands of Communist and Fascist dictatorships. These victims had their property confiscated solely because of their religion. national or social origin. or expression of opposition to the regimes in power. In fact. many churches. synagogues. and mosques were destroyed and/or confiscated by these repressive regimes. Private property ownership is one of the key hallmarks of a free society. as are the freedom to practice ones own religion. express ones own social or national traditions. and speak against ones government. Violation of these freedoms. and disrespect for these concepts. is a glaring signal that a country is ignoring democratic norms and violating international law. Even more egregious is the fact that some financial institutions cooperated with these repressive regimes in converting to their own personal use those financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims. and their heirs and assigns. This is a clear violation of these institutions fiduciary duty to their customers. We must not sit idly by while they enjoy their illgotten gains. In this new and welcome period of transition for many of the formerly Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. it Is my sincere hope. that victims of confiscation will be sought out and compensated.

This amendment is a recognition that we need to look at all our weapon systems and determine that some need to go forward and some need to be discontinued in terms of research and development but not deployment. It is a recognition that this Republican Congress will realize that a freeze is not a cut. as we have said when we have argued against domestic spending. It is a freeze. It is a recognition that we need to look at our defense budget with the same kind of scrutiny and desire that we have looked at other parts of the budget.

As we continue our efforts to balance the budget and reduce the Federal debt. each and every Government program. including defense. must be scrutinized for potential savings. By freezing the defense budget we force the Pentagon to cut wasteful and duplicative programs and to live within their means. like every American family and business must do every day. This freeze is a modest reduction. In other words. this reduces the defense budget by only 1.7 percent or $4.3 billion. While I fully understand and strongly support the need for a strong national defense. I believe freezing defense appropriations at last years level will produce further Pentagon cost savings reforms. without endangering our national security. Above all. it will show the American people that Congress treats all parts of the Federal budget fairly when it comes to cutting programs. balancing the budget and reducing the deficit.

Other headquarters reductions. we took $149 million. civilian personnel overbudgeting. we took $245 million: for consultants and advisory services. we took $210 million. for defense dual use and commercialization programs. we took $188 million. We stopped certain programs. JASSM. $140 million. we took out of the program. In appropriating budgeting and working capital funds. we took out $111 million. automated data processing programs. excess growth in the programs. we took out $110 million. excess defense supply inventory. we took out $100 million. the Joint Aerostat Program. we could not find anybody that supported it so we terminated it. $93 million: the improper use of RDT&E funding for using RDT&E money for procurement. we stopped that. $71 million we took out. growth in federally financed research centers. $55 million we took out. growth in civilian employee travel. $52 million we took out. The list goes on and on. We took out a lot of money that we did not think was being spent wisely. We have scrutinized this bill probably better than any other appropriations bill that has been on this floor.

Brent Scowcroft. and Alton Frye recently wrote an article for The New York Times in which they assert that \"Linking NATO expansion to the expansion of the European Union would underscore the connection between Europes security and its economyand offer certification that entrants to NATO could afford to meet its defense obligations.\" It is our contention that Poland.

All three of the candidates are eager to join the European Union (EU). which has now decided to begin accession negotiations with them.

The EUs offer affords the Senate an opportunity to lend support to these countries bid for EU membership. without accepting any presumption that entry into the EU guarantees admission to NATO.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. we have debated long and hard on this bill. the idea of a mandatory work requirement that is referred to as mandatory voluntarism. We have spent hours debating the provision in H.R. 2 which would require public housing residents. including mothers of young children. to perform 8 hours of community service each month. Whether this represents mandatory voluntarism. as Democrats have charged. or work for benefit. as Republicans have claimed. the sponsors of H.R. 2 were adamant that public housing residents who are not employed should be required to perform community service or be evicted from public housing. Well. fair is fair. This amendment would take the very same requirement. the very same idea. the very same sense of giving back something to our country and apply it to owners of section 8 housing. These owners get a clear financial benefit from the Government. federally subsidized rents on projects owned by such owners. Without such assistance. many such properties would go bankrupt. potentially bankrupting their owners. Therefore. all this amendment says is that. if public housing residents who get a financial benefit from the Government should perform community service. so should the landlords. Please note that my amendment contains identical language and the provisions as those contained In H.R. 2 in the section dealing with public housing residents. We Include exceptions for the elderly. We include exceptions for the disabled. And we include cxceptions for anyone working or complying with welfare requirements. This amendment only applies to idle landlords. those who simply collect rent checks from the Federal Government or spend their days watching Oprah Winfrey or playing golf all day. In other words. basically what we are suggesting here. Mr. Chairman. Is what Is good for the goose is good for the gander. What we want to do is make certain that this is not a punitive provision that is contained in H.U. 2. which would suggest only people in public housing who get a benefit from the Government who are not working should go ahead and volunteer but. rather. anyone who gets a benefit from public housing programs who does not work ought to also volunteer as well. I hope that the gentleman from New York would consider accepting this amendment in the spirit of voluntarism which he has so adeptly included in the rest of this bill.",

This amendment is offered obviously in response to the various attempts to strike the community service requirement in the bill and in fact. if adopted. would have the counterproductive effect of discouraging additional units of housing for low income people under the section B program. The differentiation Is. in this case. the program was created in order to encourage owners to develop properties and to dedicate their units to service for people of low Income. low and moderate income. So in that sense. there is very much a public mission involved in this. We are not extending a benefit to owners of lowincome housing. which only moves one way. in the direction of the owner. In fact. in this sense there is a sense of reciprocity. that the benefit. to the extent that there is one. is the incentive to develop properties for lowincome Individuals and that in exchange for these incentives that the owner would commit by law to ensure that those units in his building or her building were only available to those of low income or moderately low income. Of course. the adoption of this amendment. as I say. is in response. I believe. to the actions of this House in defense of the community service requirement but would have the perverse effect. in the end. of potentially undermining our ability to expand our affordable housing stook. ensuring that we have fewer owners who are particlpating in this program.

Many of these youngsters live in the poorest areas of our Nation. areas with a high concentration of public housing units. In response to the findings of this study. I rise today to offer an amendment which will help to save the lives of many asthmatic children who live in public housing. We all know that asthma Is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases and we know now that there is a strong link between cockroaches and asthma. According to the New England Journal of Medicine. cockroaches cause one quarter of all asthma In inner cities. Asthma Is increasing in cities and in suburbs. but it Is especially bad in our inner cities. My amendment would permit the Secretary to provide for assessments to identify any pest control programs and evaluate the performance of public housing agencies as it relates to the eradication or control of the pest problem in public housing. This year in the Committee on Commerce we have had numerous hearings on ozone and particulate matter and its possible effects on children with asthma. As we try to find reasonable solutions to this environmental issue. let us take this opportunity to solve a problem that we know is a major cause of asthma In inner city children. I would also like to point out that in 1990. and we are spending a lot more now than then. that we spent $6.2 billion In terms of dealing with asthma. Now that we know that cockroaches have a lot to do with it. we will be able to save some money. So I am hoping that my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment because this is a moneysaving amendment that also makes it possible to improve the qualIty of life for so many people.

The statistic he quoted bears repeating. Among families that pay payroll taxes 80 percent pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. Ifand I say ifwe are going to have a tax cut look no further than the payroll tax. Albert Hunt. writing in todays Wall Street Journal. agrees. noting that for most families it is \"the most onerous levy .... Even excluding interest income. the Social Security Trust Funds will generate $698 billion of surpluses over the next 10 years. That is just about enough to finance the 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax that Senator KERREY and I have proposed in our comprehensive Social Security rescue plan. In contrast. the operating budget will only have a $32 billion surplus over the next 10 yearsand no significant surplus until 2006. Finally. maybe we shouldnt be considering any tax cuts. Those surpluses can easily evaporate. even in the absence of a recession.

We keep hearing the good news about surpluses but of the $1.55 trillion surplus over the next decade. all but $32 billion comes from the social security trust fundfrom payroll taxes paid by working Americans on their wagestaxes that American workers paid to insure the viability of their Social Security benefits. Of families who pay payroll taxes. 80 percent pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. The payroll tax is the most regressive tax in America. disproportionately burdening low income families. Remember that almost 50 percent of households in this country earn under $35.000 per year and most of this income is from wages which are subject to the payroll tax. Given these facts. the payroll tax cut is clearly the tax cut this Congress should be discussing. And we should be discussing it along with the reforms necessary to fix Social Security for all Americans for all time. I know there are many Senators here who share my sentiments. I served with Senator GREGG on a bipartisan commission that thorougly studied this issue and we have recommended a comprehensive reform package.

I have an amendment at the desk that basically would equalize the treatment that the Budget Committee gave to the defense side of the ledger. would equalize that with the nondefense side of the ledger. Now. let me try to explain it as best I can. A couple of years ago in a situation involving Social Security here on the Senate floor. the Parliamentarian of the Senate ruled in a way that gave the chairman of the Budget Committee the authority to decide whether or not scoring would be done under the CBO estimates and rules or under OMB. This year. using that authority. the chairman of the Budget Committee sent a letter dated April 27. 1998. to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator STEVENS. This letter. among other things. basically saidand I will quote from the letter: Staff have also identified $2.0 billion in potential policy outlays scorekeeping adjustments. If the Administrations own policy initiatives are legislated for the DWCF. I will exercise my authority to score the legislation recognizing the administrations outlay estimates. What that means. in \"bureaucratese.\" is that the chairman of the Budget Committee decided to use his authority to use the administrations policy initiativesread that to be OMB--to adjust the outlay figures for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. What did that add up to? We looked at it and those adjustments added up to $2.2 billion2.2 billion under OMB. Then the Budget Committee identified another $737 million in asset sales to come up with $2.9 billion additional for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. But I am looking at the $2.2 billion. Forget about the other. The $2.2 billion came about because the chairman of the Budget Committee decided to use the administrations own policy initiatives and use the administrations outlay estimates from OMB. Mr. President. what that means is that the Budget Committee chairman has the authority because of a ruling by the Parliamentarian of this body that he can decide whether to use OMB or CBO estimates for outlay purposes. I think it is appropriate to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a copy of the letter from the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Senator DOMENICI. to Senator STEVENS. dated April 27. 1998.",

The chairman has agreed to have the markup on September 3 to bring this complex bill to the floor at an early date. I have taken the preliminary step in a very small meeting with Secretary Shalala of Health and Human Services and Secretary Riley of Education and Secretary Herman of Labor. to try to ascertain their real priorities so that we can try to move this bill ahead and get it passed. I think the Senator from Iowa is performing a real service in highlighting the necessity for similar scoring so we can have additional funds. I think we will get there. I thank my colleague for his yielding and for his cooperation this year and through the years.",

He ought to understand better than anybody in this Senate Chamber that education is power. education levels the playing field. education gives people an opportunity to do things that they have always wanted to do. The employers will be able to reach out to get individuals who are educated and trained. These people we are trying to help here want to get out of welfare. They want to be educated. They want better jobs. They want to take care of their children. If education does not belong on a higher education bill. I dont understand where it belongs. The employers want better employees. Where do you get better employees but educated employees? Where do you find them today? Those who are on welfare. trying to get out of welfare. get out of Catch22. We have the American Association of Community Colleges that endorses this amendment. the State Directors of Vocational Technical Education Consortium. Career College Association. the Childrens Defense Fund. Center for Women Policy Studies. American Association of University Women. the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education. the American Council on Education. I could go on and on. of the associations that endorse this amendment. So we are saying here this is going to destroy the welfare program? How in the world are they going to buy a Roth IRA. if they dont have a better job and have more money so they can save? Mr. President. I hope the distinguished Senator would understand we are trying to get them out of poverty. give them a good job. help the employersand higher education is where this amendment belongs. I hope this doesnt destroy welfare. We have a bipartisan effort here. These people are Democrats and Republicans who have endorsed this amendment. So I am hopeful we would not look at this amendment as destroying the welfare reform bill that I voted for and that I supported. I think this is one place. now that it is in place. soon to be a 2year anniversary. that we would have an opportunity to correct those things that we made a mistake on.

I want to be clear one more time. this just gives the States the flexibility to allow a mother who is in college or wants to go to college for 2 years. to be able to do that and not be penalized for it. No State has to adopt this amendment. It is entirely up to the judgment of the States. But right now we have a situation where States face penalties and they are put in a position of having to drive some of these women out of school where they could do so much better in terms of employment. so much better in terms of jobs. There is a wealth of evidence that I could go into. but I think we want to go to a vote. This is the right thing to do. This is a terribly important initiative supported by many Senators who supported the welfare bill. and I hope there will be a very strong vote for it. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Center for Women Policy Studies. that has over 100 signatures representing children. women and education organizations in support of this amendment. along with a letter from the National Urban League be printed in the RECORD. Since I dont have time to go into other organizations of support I ask that a list of these organizations from all around the country also be printed in the RECORD.

Senator JEFFORDS. in a colloquy on an important measure which will be a subject of discussion during the HouseSenate conference on the Higher Education reauthorization Act. It has been observed that America does not send its athletes to the Olympic Games. Americans do. Indeed. the U.S. Olympic Committee. whose responsibilities include the support for training and selecting athletes to represent the United States in the Olympic and Pan America Games. is the only major national Olympic Committee from among the 197 participating nations that receives no funding whatsoever from its federal or state governments. All funds for training U.S. athletes must come from private sources. including an individuals personal resources. In September 2000 more than 800 young American men and women will gather in Sydney. Australia to represent their countrymen in the XXVII Olympiad. They will join more than 10.000 other athletes from nearly 200 nations to engage in friendly competition. Many will have spent more than a decade preparing for what Jesse Owens once referred to as \"fifteen seconds of glory.\" As they have since the modern Olympic Games were instituted in 1896. Americans back home will follow with great pride the accomplishments of the U.S. athletes. and will vicariously share in each triumph. But when the Olympic flame is extinguished and our American heroes return home most will leave forever the athletic careers to which they have devoted so much of their lives. The greatest homecoming we can prepare for our U.S. athletes is assistance in obtaining the educational foundation that will enable them to pursue productive lives outside of their athletic arenas. We can achieve this by reauthorizing the Olympic Education Scholarship program. Originally authorized in 1992. this important program recently expired. however. reauthorization language has been included in the House version of the Higher Education Act and it is my hope that our Senate conferees will support the House reauthorization of this important Olympic Education Scholarship program. The $5 million authorization level for this program would be an important step toward allowing these young men and women to simultaneously advance themselves on the training field and in the classroom.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the common threads throughout the American experience is the strong yearning for religious liberty. It is what brought the Puritans to Plymouth Rock. the Mennonites to Lancaster County and the Mormons to Utah. It is part of what we are as Americans. Protection of religious expression is a bedrock principle of the Constitution enshrined in the very first amendment to the Bill of Rights. The freedom to fully participate in religion includes the right to make offerings. Sometimes those who make contributions will fall into financial problems and end up before the local bankruptcy court. Over the past few years bankruptcy courts with neither divine guidance nor the direction of Congress have struggled with reconciling competing interests of creditors and churches. In my view. it is inappropriate for the bankruptcy court system to force religious denominations to disgorge goodfaith offerings or tithes in order to comply with rigid formulas. S. 1244 seeks to resolve this by establishing a simple formula: Religious contributions by a debtor. if consistent with past practice or if totaling less than 15 percent of gross income. shall not be reachable by a creditor in the context of bankruptcy. In a sense. this measure follows Christs admonition to render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesars and unto God the things which are Gods. It avoids the effect of our current course that puts Federal bankruptcy court judges in the position of knocking on the doors of our churches wearing the hat of the repo man and demanding the return of tithes. offerings and other contributions. I compliment the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Pennsylvania for their hard work and encourage a yes vote.",

Sandy. thank you very much. and we appreciate all the hard work Kim and others on our side have done. The Social Security program is vitally important. as everyone knows. to all Americans. The disability program is particularly critical in protecting those workers and their families who become smitten by an incapacitating illness or accident. Through our Subcommittee on Social Security hearings over the last 3 years we have been told over and over by individuals with disabilities. their advocates. rehabilitation experts and various providers of services that. due to advances in medicine. technology and the field of rehabilitation. many individuals with disabilities want to work and they believe they could work if provided needed rehabilitation and support services and if the program could be changed to remove the barriers preventing beneficiaries from becoming selfsufficient through employment. Topping the list. and we have heard it before. is the fear of losing health care coverage and cash benefits. Another disincentive is that beneficiaries currently have limited choices in selecting rehabilitation services and who provides those services. The gentlewoman from Connecticut",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for yielding this time to me. I would like to express my strong support for this bipartisan legislation. I think. given the choice. most disability beneficiaries would rather be working. However. as we have learned during committee hearings. there are currently numerous obstacles facing these beneficiaries in their pursuit of employment including the fear of losing health and cash benefits and little known and complex work incentives. In a true bipartisan manner Congress has addressed these issues in the legislation before us today. After five hearings over nearly 4 years involving individuals with disabilities. advocates. rehabilitation experts. providers and the administration. we finally have a comprehensive bill which we believe will significantly ease the transition of SSDI and SSI disabled beneficiaries into the work force. In short. H.R. 3433 would establish a ticket to work and selfsufficiency program which would provide beneficiaries with a ticket to obtain vocational rehabilitation employment or other support services. These tickets would provide beneficiary choices and essential rehabilitation and support services. More specifically. this legislation would institute employment networks which would encourage disabled beneficiaries to establish employment goals. This measure also addresses the fears associated with potentially losing ones health care during pursuit of employment by extending health care coverage an additional 2 years. And another important component of this proposal is that these networks would be paid on a resultsoriented basis. In other words. payments to providers would be based on the success of returning the beneficiary to work. Is not this making government and these programs more efficient and effective? I would like to thank the Committee on Social Security and. more specifically. the chairman. the gentleman from Kentucky and ranking member. the gentlewoman from Connecticut for their hard work and commitment to opening these doors to employment. This is a strong and effective piece of legislation. and I urge my colleagues to give this measure their full support. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3433. and commend the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentlewoman from Connecticut for all of their hard work in putting together this important. comprehensive. and what I would call historic legislation and bringing it to the floor today. This bill will provide a true Ticket to Work for disabled individuals by bringing them back into the work force while providing them with a safety net of needed government services. It addresses the disincentives which exist in current law that discourage disabled individuals from joining the work force. According to a recent Washington Post article. 6.6 million workingage Americans receive disability checks from the Federal Government every month. All too often. these individuals are unable to return to the work force. Among the barriers they face upon returning to work is that they risk the loss of important medical benefits such as Medicare health coverage. Under this legislation. individuals would be eligible for up to 6 years of Medicare benefits. In addition. this bill provides a voucher that individuals can exchange for rehabilitation. employment or other necessary services. The Ticket to Work bill will change the Social Security Administrations disability programs for the better. As Tony Young of the United Cerebral Palsy Association said in his testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means in March. these programs. and I quote. \"are transformed from a safety net into a trampoline. not only catching people with disabilities as they fall out of work. but also giving them a boost back into work as they are ready.\" . I know how important this work is. One of my constituents. Matt Conway of Florham Park. New Jersey. has been honored by the Foundation for Excellent Childrens Yes I Can!

It was a great example of rolling up your sleeves and working on a tough problem that not many people want to face. I also want to congratulate the gentlewoman from Connecticut who worked on a bipartisan basis with the gentleman from Kentucky . We have heard over the last couple years on the subcommittee from a lot of people who have disabilities but they truly want to work. and technological as well as medical advances might permit them to work. might make it possible for them to work. Unfortunately. the current Social Security disability program has an inherent number of obstacles and disincentives that make it pretty difficult and undesirable for people to leave the rolls and seek gainful employment. because they might lose cash or critical Medicare benefits. This proposal is designed today to eliminate obstacles. I know there has been a lot of discussion on it already. Again. I want to say it is good common sense work. It took a lot of time to put together something that makes sense. It is bipartisan. In the end. what is exciting about this is it is going to help people to work. to be able to have gainful employment. to be able to take care of themselves. It also. in the end. saves the taxpayer money. The information we have is that it will save the Social Security system nearly $40 million over the next 5 years alone. Again. the key to It is it can provide people with opportunities and means that they have asked for to become productive members of society. It is a good. fiscally responsible bill. and I want to congratulate again the gentleman from Kentucky for spending the time and effort to put this together. and his cosponsor. the gentlewoman from Connecticut .",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise on behalf of the Ticket to Work and SelfSufficiency Act of 1998. I support this bill because it facilitates the task of rejoining the workforce for the over 8 million people with disabilities who are currently collecting monies from Social Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). More than 30.000 of these people live in Harris County. in which my district sits. I truly believe that the majority of people with disabilities want to work. This act opens up a multitude of resources that they can use to find work that were only sporadically available to them before. Under current law. vocational counseling for people receiving SSI or SSDI can only be done by staterun Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies. who are only able to serve about 10% of the disabled people referred to them. This bill allows nonprofit and private organizations to help these people find meaningful and productive work. Furthermore. by extending benefits to people who join this program for two years. it alleviates a fear common to almost all people who receive public assistancethat in reentering the workforce. they will lose the entirety of their benefits. Without this loss of necessary income to stop their progress. these people will no longer feel inhibited to go out and find work. I also support this Act because it furthers the goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-to help disabled persons participate in a meaningful way in our society. This bill. coupled with the ADA. not only prohibits employers from discriminating against disabled persons. but also gives those employers access to a new pool of potential recruits. who are both qualified and willing to work. Finally. I am happy to report to you that current estimates have this bill saving the taxpayers $38 million over the next five years. Colleagues. this bill is fiscally and socially beneficial for all Americans. I ask that all my colleagues join this bipartisan effort to give hope and meaning to millions of peoples lives.",

Two other Subcommittee Chairmen of the House Banking Committee--SPENCER BACHUS of the Subcommittee on General Oversight and RICK LAzio of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity--cosponsored the legislation with me.

We introduce the same bill today to continue our efforts in the 105th Congress to overhaul the program for those most In need of housing and to eliminate fraud and mismanagement in the Federal Government.

Here is how the program works: If a person defaults on the mortgage payments of his/her home and the home has an insured mortgage by the Federal Housing Administration [FHAj. then the Federal Government becomes the owner of the home. In other words. In case of defaut. HUD pays the mortgage to the bank. acquires the property. and is required to dispose of It. For most of these acquired properties. HUD leases the properties to nonprofits to serve homeless persons. An acquired property Is leased to a nonprofit for $1 a year for up to 5 years. The home is to be provided for those persons who are homeless. One major restriction Is that the tenant must have an income that is 50 percent of the median income (in Baton Rouge $19.146 for a family of four). The nonprofit can purchase the home at any time for 10 percent below the appraised fair market value. as established at the time the $1 lease is signed.

Many of us concerned with our surface transportation Infrastructure were troubled when In 1993 this tax of 4.3 cents per gallon of motor fuel was imposed not for the purpose of bostering receipts into the highway trust fund. but for the purposes of deficit reduction. As we all know. the basic premise of the Federal motor fuel tax is that it is a user fee collected for the express purpose of making Improvements to our road and highway Infrastructure. It Is one of the few taxes where Americans can see an Immediate and direct result for having to pay it as they drive on the Nations highways. Last year we debated repealing the 4.3 centspergallon tax. At the time. I offered an alternative. Restore it to the highway trust fund. Today. I do so again. Few. if anyone in this body. can say that the areas they represent do not require road and highway improvements. The legislation I am Introducing today will not only restore faith with the American people on the uses of the Federal motor fuel taxes. but will certainly assist in making needed surface transportation enhancements. I would note that as introduced. this legislation would dedicate the entire 4.3 centspergallon tax to the highway trust fund. and would not earmark any portion of this amount for mass transit. or for that matter. for any proposed new area of eligibility such as for Amtrak. This Is not to say that I am necessarily opposed to the use of some portion of the 4.3 centspergallon tax for these purposes and policy decisions of that nature can certainly be made during further consideration of this legislation.",

The Balddge Award. which highlights customer satisfaction. workforce empowerment. and increased productivity. is given annually to companies that symbolize Americas commitment to excellence. No company could be more deserving of this award than Trident Precision Manufacturing. Trident manufactures precision sheet metal components. electromechanical assemblies. and custom products. It has grown from a 3 person operation at its founding in 1979 to an employer of 167 people at its facility in Webster. NY today. Between 1991 and 1995. Tridents employees submitted more than 5.000 processImprovement recommendations--and TrIdentrs management implemented 97 percent of those ideas. It is a testament to Trldenrs workers and management that over that 5year period. Trident made significant gains in productivity. efficiency. customer satisfaction. sales. and profitability. Sales per employee jumped 29 percent. time spent on rework decreased nearly 90 percent. and customer complaints fell by 80 percent. Defect rates have fallen so consistently that Trident now offers a full guarantee against defects In its custom products. In 1995. Tridents five major customers rated the quality of Tridents products at 99.8 percent or better. The company has never lost a customer to a competitor. I am delighted that President Clinton and Commerce Secretary Kantor chose to recognize Trident for its strong record of quality and its excellent business performance. This award was a result of Tridents exceptional commitment. not only to the companys bottom line. but to its employees and customers. Tddents efforts to train and reward its workers are to be particularly commended. Since 1989. Trident has invested an average of 4.4 percent of its payroll on training and education. This is a remarkable Investment for a small company. and two to three times above the average for all U.S. industry. Trident represents the very best In American business: putting its customers first. trusting its employees. building quality Into products and services. and being responsible corporate citizens. I am proud of Tridents success. its achievement. and of the contribution it makes to our community. Congratulations to everyone at Trident who shares in this honor.",

The fact Is that the USPS Is not a fair competitor with private enterprise. The USPS Is not forced to charge State or local tax on retail items. it Is Insured by the Federal Government. and it often does not pay the same Federl. State. and local taxes that private companies must pay. These are only some of the advantages enjoyed by the USPS. creating a playing field tilted against private Industry. Moreover. when a customer brings an item to be packaged by the USPS. the USPS requires that the customer send the package through U.S. mail. Commercial mail companies do not require this of their customers. In addition. on December 16. 1996. the Postal Rate Commission [PRC] declared that the USPS packaging service. Pack and Send. Is subject to the PRCs ratemaking. In Its decision. the PRC found that \"the Pack & Send service Is postal In character. and that establishment of the service and recommendations concerning Its fees are functions that the Postal Reorganization Act contemplates to be withIn the jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission.\" The USPS must now either discontinue the service or submit the service for a rate with the PRC. Under our bill. the USPS will return to focusIng on the core services that it was offering as of January 1. 1994. This is a reasonable approach to protecting jobs and satisfying Amerlean consumers seeking postal services. I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring Mr. HUNTERs legislation.",

Given the vast sums of money required to run for office. wealthy individuals have a significant advantage over ordinary citizen candidates. That is hardly representative government. The cost of running for political office In America has simply become too high. and I am determined that we find a better way. On election night. I vowed to redouble my efforts to clean up our outofcontrol campaign finance system. Today I am reintroducing the Fairness In Political Advertising Act. which would both reduce the cost of elections and level the playing field by requiring broadcast stations to make free political advertising time available to candidates. as a condition of those stations renewing their licenses. And because so many voters have expressed dismay over negative advertising. my bill would also require that the programming consist of unedited segments in which the candidate speaks directly into the camera. In this way. candidates would be directly accountable for any statements made. My first responsibility In this Congress is to see that the people of New Yorks 28th Congressional District. as well as our Nation. experience fair and clean campaigns in the years to come. The Fairness In Political Advertising Act would go a long way toward reducing the Influence of money on our elections. I urge Congress to enact it now.",

I rise today to introduce a bill to ensure that a computer owner may authorize the activation of their computer by a third party for the limited purpose of servicing computer hardware components. This Is the same language that I worked with former Chairman Carlos Moorhead to include in H.R. 1861. section 7. \"Umltations on Exclusive Rights. Computer Programs.\" during the 104th Congress. Under suspension of the rules. H.R. 1861 was passed by voice vote. The specific problem Is when a computer is activated. the software is copied into the Random Access Memory (RAM]. This copy is protected under section 117 of the Copyright Act. as interpreted by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits Court of Appeals. This technical correction is extremely important to Independent Service Organizations [ISOs] who. without this legislation. are prohibited from turning on a customers computer. A wave of litigation has plagued the computer repair market. The detrimental effect Is that ISOs are prevented from reading the diagnostics software and subsequently cannot service the computers hardware. The financial reality Is that the multibillion dollar nationwide ISO Industry is at risk. My bill provides language that authorizes third parties to make such a copy of the limited use of servicing computer hardware components. My bill does nothing to threaten the integrity of the Copyright Act and maintains all other protections under the act. The intent of the Copyright Act is to protect and encourage a free marketplace of ideas. However. in this Instance. it hurts the free market by preventing ISOs from servicing computers. Furthermore. it limits the consumers choice of who can service their computer and how competitive a fee can be charged.",

I am Introducing this legislation after learning of a problem in the Village of Grady. a small community in eastern New Mexico. Strapped for adequate office space. municipal employees sought and received what they thought was appropriate Government approval to move into a small space in a facility built with CDBG funds. But lo and behold. once the move took place. a further examination of Government regulations revealed that the village is prohibited by law from occupying any space In a building built with CDBG funds. The financially strapped village is now stuck with a $13.500 expense to remain in the building. A small town has a severely limited tax base. It cannot afford to construct separate buildings for every essential service offered its residents. It cannot afford to purchase duplicate office equipment and supplies nor to pay Insurance. utilities. and maintenance expenses on several buildings. Citizens who are hired for municipal jobs in small communities. such as clerks. policemen. firemen. and emergency medical service employees. must often share job responsibilities. Not only is it not economically feasible. but it is very difficult for these employees to work form separate buildings in terms of job communication and coordination. Small towns must provide vital services to their residents. To do so efficiently. municipal employees must be able to conduct business In decent. affordable. and convenient facilities. We must give our small communities special consideration and enable them to make the best use of limited funding resources. A multipurpose use of facilities purchased. built or renovated with community development block grants is the only answer.",

I support expanding lifeaffirming research on Parkinsons. Increasing resources to find a cure is not only a compassionate response to the sufferng experienced by over 500.000 Americans. but it Is a wise and economical use of our nations tax dollars. In addition to the human tragedy resulting from the condition. Parkinsons patient advocates note that this terrible disease costs our society some $25 billion a year in direct medical expenses and reduced productivity. Parkinsons is a progressive and debilitating disease that affects a large segment of our population. Therefore. the discovery of a cure or an effective treatment will pay dividends far in excess of the $100 million in authorized funds provided in this bill. As you already know. Parkinsons disease results from a degenerative condition in the brain whereby nerve cells lose the ability to produce the neurotransmitting chemical dopamine. Common symptoms include tremors--particularly in the extremitiesrigidity. loss of balance. and bradykinesia. or very slow movements. Parkinsons disease is an incurable condition which afflicts roughly 1 in every 100 people over the age of 60. Existing treatments. such as Ldopa. a pharmaceutical substitute for dopamine. and pallidotomy. a surgical technique which can relieve symptoms. are not longterm solutions. and their effectiveness diminishes over time.

As the first AfricanAmerIcan to play major league baseball. he endured insults and threats with a quiet dignity and his talent won him recognition as a great player. Included In his esteemed titles are 1947 National League Rookie of the Year. 1949 National League Most Valuable Player. and 1962 Hall of Fame Inductee. In his decade long career. Robinson led the league in stolen bases and hitting. and he also garnered six AllStar selections. Following his career in baseball. Robinson served as the first AfricanAmerican vice president of a major American corporation and played an active role in the civil rights movement. We should remember that Robinsons integration of major league baseball preceded the Brown versus Board of Education Supreme Court decision and Rosa Parks by 7 and 8 years respectively. He struggled to bring dignity to his participation in major league baseball and other avenues of American life for AfricanAmericans. As a young man. with Jackie Robinson as a profound role model.

Jackie Robinson. came from humble beginnings and was bom on January 31. 1919. The son of a sharecropper. was never one to let adversity or racial discrimination stand In his path. He attended the University of California. where he won acclaim in basketball. football. baseball. and track and field. Jackies collegiate experience was cut short in 1941 because of financial hardship. Jackie was forced 1o leave the university. To support his family. Jackie enlisted In the Army in 1942 and was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1943. In 1947. the Brooklyn Dodgers signed Jackle up as a player. He became the first AfricanAmerican to play major league baseball. During the .early years. his debut into professional baseball was anything but easy. Jackie was forced to face facial discrimination. hatred and bigotry from white major league baseball players and fans on an almost daily basis. Yet. despite this hostile environment. Jackie achieved fame as one ol the greatest baseball players. Before his retirement in 1956. Jackie had compiled a career batting average of .311 and had played for six pennant winners and one world championship team In Brooklyn. He was named Rookie of the Year in 1947 and Most Valuable Player in the National League in 1949. the year he led the league in stolen bases. Although Jackie played many positions. he was primarily a second baseman. Jackies lifetime accomplishments go well beyond the limits of a baseball diamond. He was a noted civil rights leader. devoted family man and shrewd businessman and banker. Hariem was his adopted home. Today is indeed a special occasion. for it marks the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinsons debut into the professional baseball league. Jackie has been a positive role model for so many aspiring youth. We have only to look at the recent accomplishments of Tiger Woods. Please join me in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinsons debut into professional baseball.",

I would like to commend the gentleman from New York on the other side and the gentleman from Massachusetts for their hard work on this bill. This bill is seriously deficient because it reneges on our national commitment to create decent affordable housing. This bill provides absolutely no specific funding to make any new housing available to low income or moderate income families. My amendment. which the gentleman from New York joins me in offering. would authorize 50.000 new section 8 vouchers to help low Income families afford safe decent housing. We must send the appropriators a message that we believe the creation of new section 8 vouchers is a priority. I would like to thank the chairman of the subcommittee and gentleman from Massachusetts for including language In the bill so that funding will be available to renew all existing section 8 vouchers. It is vitally Important that those families currently benefiting from this program not be suddenly thrown out on the street. But it is not enough. The need for housing assistance remains staggering. Today 5.3 million poor families either pay more than 50 percent of their income for rent or live In severely substandard housing. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. founder of the public housing system in our Nation. spoke eloquently In 1944 of the fact that. and I quote. \"True individual freedom cannot exist without i .onomie security and Independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\" FDR was right. Every family has the right to a decent home. or do we no longer believe this to be so?",

Mr. Chairman. 1 want to say. first of all. that under the terms of H.R. 2. the bill we are debating today. we do authorize incremental or new vouchers. In the language of the bill we simply authorize that such sums as may be necessary are authorized. The reason for that is because we do not have any basis for fixing a sum. For example. certain buildings in public housing will be demolished. in which case some of those residents may receive vouchers. In some eases the cost of remodeling will be so great that it will be more cost effective and the choice will be better for the tenant to receive a voucher. and they will receive that voucher. In other situations. people that may be displaced are seniors or disabled and will be receiving vouchers but. again. we are not sure exactly how many there are. So we have tried to make it clear from an authorizing standpoint that we are for additional new vouchers. but we cannot exactly say for sure because there is no basis to say for sure how many new vouchers we are authorizing. Now. under the amendment offered by the gentlemen from New York. they are requesting a sum certain. 350 million in budget authority for new section 8 certificates and vouchers of the choicebased program under the terms of the bill. According to the General Accounting Office. there is no basis In fact in which to determine. other than this objective. that 50.000 vouchers Is the appropriate amount of vouchers. It may be too little or it may be too much. but there Is no certainty. That is why we have allowed maximum flexibility in the bill but. at the same time. a statement that we believe that additional vouchers should be authorized. they are authorized and should be appropriated for.",

Canada has escalated the Pacific salmon treaty negotiations beyond the scope of the treaty.

House Concurrent Resolution 124 asks the President to use all necessary and appropriate means to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any further illegal actions.

I would also like to urge Canada to return to the negotiations without further incidents. Mr. Speaker. this is an extremely important matter.

I personally appeal to the Canadian Government and to others who may be aware of our discussions here today to move as rapidly as we possibly can on an international basis to bring this very important conservation matter to a conclusion. We care about American fishermen. we care about Canadian fishermen. and we care about the salmon stock very much. That is why we are moving so diligently to try to accomplish the goals outlined here today. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 124 to respond to what I call goon squad tactics taken by Canadian fishermen on the weekend of July 19. 1997. Canadian fishermen. frustrated with their Governments effort to resolve Pacific Salmon Treaty disputes. further escalated the salmon strife by illegally blockading the MN Malaspina. an Alaskan ferry. in Prince Rupert. British Columbia. What I find most reprehensible. is the failure of the Canadian Government to enforce a court order to end the blockade. Innocent passengers were held hostage while the Government of Canada turned a blind eye. This isnt the first time the Government of Canada has condoned illegal actions. In 1994. 258 United States fishermen were unfairly charged an illegal transit fee by the Canadian Government to transit from Washington to Alaska through the Inside Passage. U.S. fishermen have only two choices when traveling from Washington to Alaska. The safe route is through the Inside Passage. while the alternate is traveling in the treacherous waters of the Pacific Ocean. This illegal fee forced U.S. vessels to either risk their safety or be illegally fined. In 3 years. the Canadian Government or its citizens have purposefully ignored and violated international law and harassed United States citizens. How many times are we supposed to put up with Canadas disregard for international law? House Concurrent Resolution 124 asks the President to use all necessary and appropriate means to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any further illegal actions. Mr. Speaker. Canadas past actions are serious and I would hope that Congress and the administration can work together to develop and implement measures to help protect the interests of the United States with respect to the Pacific salmon fishery. The United States should not tolerate threats to those interests from the action or inaction of a foreign government or its citizens.",

It is possible to craft a system that meets the narrow requirements of the Constitution in terms of protecting free speech. but it is not possible to do one in a way that makes any logical sense at all. I had risen to ask my colleague this question about the example we have before us. We are being told this is constitutional because it is voluntary.

The Senator from Kentucky has said it isnt really voluntary. There is a huge incentive which the Senator from Kentucky describes as a gun pointed at your head to see to it that you are voluntary. So it is not voluntary. This is the question I had in mind. We have an example before us of people giving up their constitutional rights in return for Federal dollars.

But in the Presidential system now. virtually every candidate for President accepts the bribe. that is. he or she accepts the Federal dollars in return for agreeing to limit their speech.

All of this is voluntary. but it becomes voluntary because there is a huge bribe out there waiting for you if you agree to give up your constitutional rights. I think it is absurd. I was delighted over the weekend to read the comments of George Will. who said that this debate is one of the most fundamental we have had since the founding of the Republic.

This one would leave behind a huge Federal bureaucracy aimed at producing exactly the kind of results the Senator from Kentucky is talking about. laying out that this candidate in this State can spend this much. and as soon as he steps across the State line. if he decided to run in another State. then the rules would change. the limits would change. the circumstances would change.

MI. as she suffered a nearfatal asthma attack. As reported by the Gladwin County Record. 15yearold Travis Lieu and 12yearold Josh Garvie had just left Beaverton. Michigans Gem Theater August 19 when Jessica Doherty began to suffer a serious asthma attack. The boys alerted the girls mother. who drove them to the hospital. On the way. however. young Jessica began gasping for air and lost consciousness. As they stopped the car. Tom Garvie. Jessicas other cousin. rushed into a local business to call 911. Travis Lieu and Josh Garvie began to administer mouthtomouth resuscitation and other emergency procedures. While they waited for an ambulance to arrive. the boys successfully brought Jessica back to consciousness. I am pleased to report that after a 2day stay at MidMichigan Regional Medical Center in Gladwin. Jessica Doherty was released from the hospital and has resumed a normal life. Both Travis and Josh had just learned CPR in health classes during the previous school year. Mr. Speaker. no amount of training can prepare a person for the moment when they face a real. lifeordeath situation. but Travis Lieu. Tom and Josh Garvie were given the fundamental tools by learning lifesaving skills at school. By using these skills. staying calm and taking control of the situation. they were able to give Jessica Doherty a second chance at life. Congratulations to Travis Lieu. Tom and Josh Garvie for a job well done.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing a bill that will increase competition among airlines. resulting in lower air fares for travelers throughout the country. Specifically. my bill would amend title 49. section 41714(c)(1) of the United States Code to enable new entrant air carriers to obtain access to airport slots at high density airports. Under current law. the Secretary of Transportation may grant exemptions for new entrants to obtain slots at designated airports only if: First. it is in the public interest. and second. the Secretary finds that exceptional circumstances exist. An October 1996 report by the General Accounting Office found that few new entries have occurred because the exceptional circumstances requirement has been interpreted narrowly by the Department of Transportation. although there is no language in the legislative history to support a narrow construction. My bill would eliminate the exceptional circumstances criterion. thus encouraging the distribution of slots to new entrants. Section 41714 governs the distribution of airport slots at the four slotcontrolled airports in this country: LaGuardia. Kennedy. Chicago. and Washington National. To reduce congestion during peak traffic periods. in 1969 the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] set limits on the number of takeoffs and landings that can occur at these airports by allocating takeoff and landing slots equitably among airlines. In an effort to minimize the Governments role in the allocation of slots. in 1985 the Depart-",

That is why we. as national leaders. should take a moment to recognize and honor Mary and Phillip Kenter for all of the love. loyalty. and faith that goes into creating a marriage that has endured and grown for 40 years. Though Phillip is a native of Flushing. Queens. and Mary is from Norwalk. CT. their love first ignited on the warm sands of Jones Beach. Long Island. where they met in 1955. With a courtship that progressed while Phillip attended the U.S. Navys Officer Candidate School. the two were married on September 7. 1957. 1 month after he graduated OCS and a week before he shipped out aboard a Navy destroyer for the next 21/2 years. Their first son. Phillip. was born a little more than 2 years later and Dennis was born about the time his father left the Navy in 1961. Two years later. with a vision of providing TV to all of Long Island. Phillip founded Long Island Cablevison. a company he sold to the Los Angeles Times Mirror Co. in 1968. By then. their son Kevin had arrived and the Kenters settled in Riverhead. Gifted with an entrepreneurial spirit. Phillip and Mary then founded Relay Communications Center. A true family business. each of the Kenter sons are active members of the telephone answering. twoway radio and paging services company. There are 45 other members of the Relay Communications work force and each of them are treated as members of the extended Kenter family. a feeling that Phillip and Mary extend to the entire Riverhead community.

We mourned the loss of those killed in the bombing at the marketplace on July 30. visited the West Bank and met with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat. During our meeting. I asked Mr. Arafat if he supported the actions of groups like the Hamas. He insisted he did not. Two days ago.

Ransom Everglades School. as it dedicates its new Middle School Science Center today. September 4. The Middle School Science Center has been built in true Ransom Everglades form. with all volunteer and donated funds. Ransom Everglades School traces its founding to 1893 when a young Harvardeducated lawyer. Paul Ransom. came to pioneer Miami from Buffalo. NY. Mr. Ransom built a small tutoring camp he called Pine Knot Camp in Coconut Grove. He also contributed property in New Yorks Adirondack Mountains. and started a northern campus. making it the first migratory collegepreparatory boarding school for young men. with winter months spent at the Coconut Grove campus and the remainder of the year spent at the Adirondack campus. Duty to ones country and society. along with academic excellence. was always emphasized by Mr. Ransom. In 1974. Ransom School merged with another independent school in Coconut Grove. Everglades Schools For Girls. and was later renamed as Ransom Everglades School. Today. the school continues as a nonprofit. taxexempt. independent. and coeducational collegepreparatory day school for grades 6 through 12. with 870 students on both campuses. Although it has only a small endowment. a significant number of its students are on scholarship based on financial need and merit admission. Ransom Everglades is also a founding member of Summerbridge. a national program to educate students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds at the Nations best collegepreparatory. independent schools. Despite its very limited financial resources. Ransom Everglades has achieved national stature. sending its wellprepared students to the finest colleges in the country. I comment Mr. Eric Buermann. chairman of the board of trustees.

For over 50 years the School of the Americas has been a powerful force for supporting and expanding democracy in Latin America. I believe that it is very useful for Latin American military officers to come to the United States to learn how to soldier in a democracy. to understand why America has been strong and free. and to study an experience which is totally different than the Latin American tradition of military dictatorship. Cuba. which does not participate in the School of the Americas. is the only remaining authoritarian or totalitarian regime in Latin America. Since the U.S. military presence in Latin America has steadily been reduced during the past several years. it is critical that we rely on exchange programs. such as the School of the Americas. to establish and maintain our military and civilian relationships as neighbors and friends with common interests. Like other exchange programs we have with Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. the School of the Americas promotes American foreign policy and regional stability in Latin America. Moreover. the School of the Americas provides more Spanish language instruction in how to conduct counterdrug activities than any other institution available in Latin America. Both foreign policy and military experts agree that the School of the Americas plays a crucial role in supporting U.S. interests in the region. As the former Commander in Chief of U.S. Southern Command. responsible for Latin America. and in his current role as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Barry McCaffrey called the School of the Americas the \"preeminent military educational institution\" for promoting and protecting human rights and democratic governance as well as fighting the illegal drug trade.

For more than a year now I have been working to increase the number of minorities and people of mixed ancestry on the National Bone Marrow Registry. not only through legislation but through coordinated outreach efforts throughout this country. I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida for working so closely with me to make sure that when we reauthorize this program. we do everything possible to increase the number of minorities and people of mixed ancestry. Every year. Mr. Speaker. more than 30.000 people are diagnosed with one of the 60 diseases that can be cured with a bone marrow transplant. Of those. only 30 percent will have a family member who is a marrow match. That means 20.000 people each year need to find an unrelated marrow donor. There are almost 2 million registered donors In this country. an increase of more than 260 percent since the beginning of 1993. But of these impressive numbers of transplants. Mr. Speaker. minorities continue to receive far fewer transplants. In fact. in 1997. only 65 African Americans received transplants. 105 Hispanic Americans received transplants. and approximately 37 people of mixed ancestry received transplants.

I want to also commend my good friend and colleague. the gentleman from Florida for introducing and working hard and diligently for the consideration of this legislation. and my subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from Florida and his ranking member. the gentleman from Ohio . for the smooth passage through the committee process. Mr. Speaker. this program is a vital one. This holds out promise for nearly the approximately 12.000 people each year who are diagnosed with diseases for which bone marrow transplantation may offer the possibility of a cure. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry established by this program provides for a central registry of bone marrow donors. linking a network of 100 donor centers. 111 transplant centers. and 11 recruitment groups across the country. The registry is also a research organization. studying the effectiveness of unrelated marrow transplants. This program has been effective in increasing the availability of unrelated bone marrow transplants. which have grown in number from 200 in 1989 to almost 1.300 in 1997 last year. In my State of Michigan our donor centers have. as of March of this year. registered over 92.000 donors and facilitated some 291 transplants. However. estimates suggest that those who could benefit from bone marrow transplants far outnumber the actual recipients by a 2- or 3toi margin. All of us have individuals in our districts hoping desperately that they will be successfully matched with a volunteer donor. For too many. that hope will not be realized. Mr. Speaker. this is particularly true for minority individuals. who are underrepresented in the donor registry. This legislation that we are considering this afternoon strengthens the programs focus on minority recruitment. I encourage all of us here to register as a volunteer donor. I did. because of my relationship with the gentleman from Florida . The process is very simple. You have to go to a donor center and give a blood sample. That is all it is. You can literally give the gift of life to another individual through this simple act.",

From modest beginnings. the program now maintains a registry of millions of potential donors. H.R. 2202 will expand and improve the National Bone Marrow Registry. establishing new services to help patients locate donors. redoubling efforts to recruit donors within underserved populations. and encouraging continued advances in the science of marrow transplantation. For me. this bill has very personal meaning. It calls to mind a very special young woman and her family in Duxbury. Massachusetts. whom I have had the honor of knowing since I learned of their story in the local press. The young woman is Brittany Lambert. who suffers from a rare blood disorder called myelodysplasia. for which she received a bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor found through the registry. When Brittanys first transplant failed. she needed a second one. Through it all. she has shown qualities of courage and tenacity that would make any parent proud. Brittany has been lucky in at least one respect: her parents. Jim and Linda Haehnel. and her sister. Brianne. have been with her every step of the way. In fact. when I met Jim Haehnel back in February of 1997. he was organizing a screening drive for Brittany at an Air National Guard base in my district. I was among the 300 people who registered as potential donors on that occasion. and I promised Jim that I would do everything I could to see that more people have the opportunity to join in this effort. The Haehnel family has shown tremendous fortitude in the face of repeated setbacks. They have continued to do everything they can to see that kids like Brittany get a second chance at life. It is because of the heroism and selflessness of people like Brittany and her family that this program exists. And it is because of them that I feel so strongly about this effort.

It makes Congress take notice and make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed. The Dreier amendment changes the whole picture. It says we should ignore real costs to private companies and individuals as long as that revenue generated is fully spent in tax or tariff reductions. A tax on coal deserves debate on its own. but if it is coupled with a tax break for ethanol. it suddenly is not worth Congress attention. The Dreier language says that we have to know how the revenue was spent before we know whether a tax or a tariff is a burden. Consider what that means to excise taxes like taxes on gas and tobacco. where many people believe that the revenue generated should be dedicated only to certain spending programs. If a measure increases gas taxes and requires that the money be spent on highway repair only. the measure would be subject to an unfunded mandate point of order. However. Mr. Chairman. if the same gas tax increase is completely offset by a provision to allow billionaires to avoid some kind of Federal tax liability. then the point of order just would not apply. Consider also a tobacco bill. which we may be considering some day. that raises cigarette taxes and spends that money to prevent teenage smoking or on health care costs and health care research or on aid to the tobacco farmer. that bill will be subject to a point of order. But. Mr. Chairman. under the Dreier language. if that tobacco revenue is given away in tax cuts rather than these programs I just enumerated. then the point of order just does not apply. I believe this approach is uneven. I believe it is arbitrary. It goes against the fundamental purpose of the bill. which is to make Congress reconsider whether it wants to impose any private sector burdens. Therefore. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I paid very close attention to my dear friends explanation. but the provision of the Dreier amendment really distorts the underlying purpose of the unfunded mandate bill. It used to focus on whether or not there was a mandate. Now. under the Dreier amendment. it focuses on whether it is a tax bill and how the funds from the tax bill would be handled. If Members choose to give a tax break to someone else. the issue of a mandate on a private business does not get debated in the House. The purpose of the unfunded mandate bill is very simple. It calls upon Congress to look and see how it affects that private business. And. therefore. if we raise a tax on that business and we do not use it to help those types of businesses. but give it back in tax relief. then it is not an unfunded mandate but it still hurts that private person who we are trying to protect. This is not a tax bill. it is an unfunded mandate bill. Now. for instance. if an aviation tax increase faces a point of order. if money is spent to improve airports. so the aviation tax goes to build up the airports. put new towers in there. then a point of order can lie. But if this money from that aviation tax goes to the fat cats. no point of order. Gasoline tax. If the gasoline tax is used to build roads. to improve safety factors. point of order lies. But if we take that tax money and give it for some other purpose. no point of order. Tobacco tax. If that money is used to educate children to stop smoking. if that money is used to show people through all kinds of means how bad tobacco is for them. point of order. But if we give that money back as a tax rebate to the big fat cats. no point of order. Mr. Chairman. the Dreier amendment distorts the basis of this unfunded mandate bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee for yielding me this time. Let me first of all concede that the authors of the amendment have made some valid points. that public broadcasting is indeed in need of reform. Duopolies exist that spending the kind of money that we are going to need to move public broadcasting into the digital age will be a very expensive proposition and that we will need to reform the whole concept of public broadcasting to make it work in the digital age. Let me also concede that there is something wrong in public broadcasting. and I think part of it is our own fault because we have chartered public broadcasting as a public entity to do publictype broadcasting and yet condemned it to act like commercial broadcasters. to go out into the private sector and seek commerciallike advertising for its products and to compete with commercial broadcasters for commercially viable products. That was not the concept behind public broadcasting. We need to return to the right concept. We need to fund public broadcasting correctly. We need to reform out the duopolies. move it into the digital age and make this thing work. but let me urge my colleagues to resist this amendment. as the gentleman from Massachusetts and I have urged them in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter this week. We are currently working on those reforms at the subcommittee level. The Subcommittee on Telecommunications. Trade. and Consumer Protection is right now drafting a set of reforms to make public broadcasting indeed public broadcasting and to set up a trust funding mechanism for the exercise of the public broadcasting function. We will be resisting the efforts of some to make commercial broadcasters look like public broadcasters. just as we will be resisting the effort to eliminate public broadcasting or to make it look like commercial broadcasting. It is time we have this debate. but to simply cut the funding now when we are in the process of actually enacting these reforms. devising them and setting out the proper funding mechanism for public broadcasting is a severe mistake. Public broadcasting is very sacred to America. We need to preserve it. But we need to reform it. The place to do it is at the authorizing committee. I urge Members to reject this amendment.",

Things change. but things stay the same. Let me make it very clear. What I propose to do here is not do away with public broadcasting. What I propose is to hold the funding level with what it was last year. In compliance with the intention of the Committee on Appropriations in 1995 when they said. we need to move public broadcasting. to begin to wean them off the public funding. which. as was pointed out by the other speakers. is a very small percentage anyway. to begin to wean them off the public funding and make them independent.

Through administrative cuts. the phaseout of multiple base grants. a moratorium on adding new stations to grant programs. and increased fundraising effort. the CPB is making strong efforts to address the committees concerns and make the most frugal use of its tax dollars while still carrying out its mission to provide excellence in programming. For 30 years. the corporation has provided educational. cultural. and informational programming to the American public. Public television is available to every child and adult. regardless of family income. or geographical location. CPB is dedicated to helping learners of all ages.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting [CPB] is an asset to children and families throughout the nation and is worthy of its funding. According to a Roper Starch Worldwide. Inc. poll from July. 1997. the American public rates public radio as the second best value in return for tax dollars spent out of 20 services. The quality and variety of educational. informational. and cultural programming found on public broadcast stations cannot be found anywhere else on radio or television. Public broadcast stations are among a limited selection of stations that cater to a large number of locally originated programs. In addition. public broadcast stations in rural and underserved urban areas greatly depend on Federal funds for their economic base. CPB provides services that reach out to people of all backgrounds and ages throughout the country. For example. many public radio stations provide radio reading services for the blind. In my own district of Rochester. NY the local public broadcasting station. WXXI. helps prepare young children to learn when they enter school and provides numerous college telecourses for adult education. In fact. the national Public Broadcasting Service arm of CPB is the leading source of college telecourses in the country. CPB plays an essential role in our educational and cultural growth as a nation. Vote against the Hefley amendment to the LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill to cut funding from the CPB.",

I find it surprising that people who say we ought to use Federal funds at the discretion of local governments to take the opposite position when a needle exchange program is involved. But before local public health agencies can even decide to have a needle exchange program. the law says the Secretary of HHS must make two findings: The Secretary of Health and Human Services must find that a needle exchange reduces the spread of HIV and that the needle exchange program does not cause any increase in illegal drug use.

I think it is very important that we recognize that maybe these horses are not indigenous to the island but they do add and enhance the beauty and the preservation of it. I represent coastal Georgia. and we have Cumberland Island there where there is a herd of wild horses. These horses are also of Spanish descent. The interesting thing about Cumberland Island is that the environmental community wants to eliminate the horses. Their reasoning is that it is not indigenous. Not all environmentalists feel this way. but many of them do. They come up with very specious reasons for doing so. We were told last year that the Cumberland horse population had been going up 15 percent a year for the last 10 years. Upon researching it within our office we found that the horse population on Cumberland Island had in fact been in the 250 to 260 range for about 10 years. and there was not an increase in the horse population. We further found this year after another census was done that the horse population had in fact declined. So I think it is very important that we recognize that on wild horse populations. many times we are arguing not necessarily based on science but based on political correctness. I believe that the gentleman from North Carolina is doing the right thing. Let the folks down there decide. Let them work with the biologists. get the emotion of the Park Service who sometimes gets involved in the politics on the politically correct politics. which says that nonindigenous animals have to go.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this legislation sponsored by the gentleman from California . While the concept of dams in the wilderness area may raise concerns. this bill addresses some very unique circumstances. The 18 small dams and weirs at issue were in existence in 1975 at the time Congress designated the Emigrant Wilderness within the Stanislaus National Forest in California. The Forest Service has released a draft management plan that would provide for the continued maintenance of 7 of the 18 structures. The bill. however. directs that all 18 structures be repaired and maintained. Initially. Mr. Speaker. the Forest Service opposed this legislation primarily because they were concerned about the added costs of repairing and maintaining of these facilities. In response to their testimony. the committee adopted a substitute to clarify that the maintenance and operation of these facilities shall be at private expense. It is important to note. Mr. Speaker. that we are grandfathering preexisting uses and not providing a blanket exemption from the Wilderness Act in this legislation. This bill is about people with backpacks. not bulldozers. who will be involved in the repair and maintenance of these small structures. The legislation does not contemplate that motorized vehicles of any kind will be allowed in the wilderness area. The small lakes created by these dams receive heavy use by recreationists. including fishermen. A positive aspect of this bill is that the recreational uses are more widely dispersed. rather than concentrated in fewer areas as would be the case if the dams were allowed to deteriorate.

Mr. Speaker. in July 1974 Turkish troops advanced into the Republic of Cyprus. and since then Cyprus has been divided. Over the past 23 years. there have been several instances where actions have led to increased tensions resulting in little progress toward resolving the conflict over Cyprus. Cyprus remains divided today. at a time when we have seen significant progress in the proliferation of democracy throughout this great world. In the last 10 years we have seen the fall of the Berlin Wall. the lifting of the Iron Curtain. the advancement of the peace process in the Middle East. yet. as has been mentioned just recently. the green line still remains across the Island of Cyprus. It is my hope that the green line will soon be erased and Cyprus will be added to the list of places where the conflict has been resolved and democracy flourishes. In light of the anticipated accession of Cyprus into the European Union. the appointment of Richard Holbrooke as special envoy and renewed peace talks. I think the opportunity for progress has presented itself clearly before us now. It is my hope that both sides will realize the economic and political importance of resolving their differences. With the cooperation of Ambassador Holbrooke. the United Nations and our President. I believe that the peace talks can reunify the Island of Cyprus. However. the agreement must abide by applicable international law. should include provisions for strengthening democracy. should protect human rights. and take into account the relevant United Nations security resolutions. A unified Cyprus will result in economic and political stability. In the Middle East we have seen that kind of work be very fruitful. Here in Cyprus we want it to be the same. Mr. Speaker.

For the people of Cyprus and the Cypriot Americans I am proud and honored to represent in Congress. when we talk about freedom. we talk about an important element of that nations identity that was robbed from them in 1974. For the people of Cyprus and the Cypriot Americans in my district. when we talk about justice. we talk about an ideal unseen since the de facto partition of that island nation in 1974. For the people of Cyprus and all those in America who believe in and cherish the value of peace. when we talk about Cyprus. we talk of an island where peace has been absent for 23 years. And that has been. in my estimation. 23 years too long. So today I stand here as a Member of Congress. as a member of the House Committee on International Relations. as a cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 81 to say that I believe strongly in the following: I believe in freedom for Cyprus. I believe in a united Cyprus. and I believe that we must support the efforts of the parties to negotiate and secure a longlasting and genuine peace for Cyprus. As my colleagues know. in 1974 Cyprus was invaded by Turkey. It was an illegal invasion. illegal and against all international norms recognized then or now. And most important. we must recognize that this invasion cannot stand. just as we took that same position with regard to the invasion of Kuwait. Some might argue that freedom for Cyprus might not be in the national interest of the United States. I wholeheartedly and emphatically disagree. Part of our makeup. part of our national history is founded on the simple belief that we are a people who believe in justice. Mr. Speaker. the little nation of Cyprus has a big dream. to be free.

This weekend we remembered the 23d anniversary of the illegal invasion of Cyprus and the horrible complications that have cost lives and stolen freedoms. When one thinks of a people or a country as a whole. it is easy to gloss over the real tragedies. So I would like to remember two people who lost their lives 1 year ago this August. A 24yearold protester. Tassos Isaac. was savagely beaten to death on August 11. 1996. by Turks. using rocks and iron poles. Three days later a group of mourners. people who were not even armed. became the targets of Turkish troop gunfire. The 26yearold cousin of Tassos was gunned down. 11 others were injured. Additionally. just 2 months after that. 58yearold Petros Kakoullis was out snail gathering with his soninlaw when he was gunned down as he assumed a position of surrender. Petros only mistake was that he had wandered across the green line into the occupied area. Our country must take an active role in stopping these abuses. The illegal occupation of Cyprus must end. The island must be demilitarized. Turkish troops must be forced off the island. The island must be unified. justice must be served. and the President of the United States must make it a foreign policy priority. I urge a vote in support of this resolution and in support of this island in crisis.",

I want to express my strong support as cosponsor for this resolution and commend the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Indiana for their leadership in bringing it before the House. On Sunday we commemorated the unhappy anniversary and tragic circumstances of 23 years of division on the island of Cyprus. which has been artificially divided following an invasion by Turkish troops on July 20. 1974. On that date. over 200.000 Greek Cypriots became refugees in their own country and to this date are denied return to their homes. Today. a full 37 percent of the island remains under occupation by Turkish troops which in defiance of United Nations resolutions. now number 35.000. making Cyprus one of the most militarized places in the world. After 23 years. the people of Cyprus in both communities deserve a solution which will reunite the island. its communities. and its people. As Secretary of State Albright recently pointed out. \"U.S.-Cyprus relations extend far beyond the socalled Cyprus problem. * * * Cyprus is a valued partner against new global threats.\" A resolution would strengthen peace and stability in the volatile eastern Mediterranean and significantly advance U.S. national security interests in the region and beyond. I recently sent a letter to President Clinton with 67 of my colleagues in the House. The letter outlines what we believe should be the parameters of any Cyprus solution. They are that Cyprus should be reunited with a strong federal government in which the federated states derive their powers from the federal constitution. a democratic constitution which would ensure the rights of all of its citizens and communities and which would guarantee the right to private property and free travel to all parts of the country. If Turkey is serious about its commitment to a permanent solution. then it must bring its views into conformity with the United Nations framework on issues of sovereignty and political equality which they have refused to do. Cyprus should not be a prisoner to Turkeys objections or threats. This is an opportunity for us to make a difference and the swift passage of this resolution sends a message of Congress deep desire to see a settlement and the reunification of Cyprus for all of its people.",

    "speech": "If the Senator will yield for response. one of my fears is that not only would this situation result in perhaps not giving the FDA data on uses that the companies are aware of In the marketplace. but it might provide a subtle incentive in marketing these devices to encourage uses that are not authorized by the FDA and certainly not to be attentive to those types of uses and report back to regulatory authorities. Again. when we think about this legislation. we have to think about also that there are a complex set of incentives and disincentives for the best possible behavior by pharmaceutical and device companies. I dont think any of us would like to unwittingly create a situation in which devices approved for one use are cavalierly marketed by companies for other uses and are merely winked at when they do not fall within the category of the approval. So that is another important issue. There is another aspect of this which I would like to raise with Senator KENNEDY. and that is. I understand that Secretary Shalala has communicated concerns about this issue. I understand that she is concerned about this and her concern may be of such a level that it could suggest that she recommend to the President a veto of this legislation. A veto would be. I think. particularly unfortunate since we have worked so hard. we have made so much progress. and we have reached a point where we are very close to legislation which could virtually pass with unanimity in this body. It would be unfortunate that this type of provision of the bill would disrupt that process. I wonder if that is correct.",

For example. the bill requires the agency to review the intended use of a new device based on the manufacturers proposed labeling. even If the devices technology clearly indicates the device will be used for a use not included in the labeling. So I think the point the Senator makes where they get approval for a particular purpose. it might be easier to get it for one purpose but with the clear intention of marketing for another purpose in which there has not been testing. and that can produce a hazard to the individual. We have seen. for example. in some of the laser technologies that they have been approved for certain kinds of cutting procedures. and then they have been in certain instances adopted. for example. for prostate cancer. where they have not been tested and have not been effectively cleared and pose some very important health hazards. So this is something that is very important. as we are moving through innovation. because we want to make sure we get those innovations. We want to make sure that the products are tested and have full information and disclosure. I thought we worked out language to try and deal with that. It is an important health issue. and I appreciate the Senators focus and attention on it.

But what we have to try and do is make sure that those who may want toand that is basically what happens in any regulatory procedureyou want to try and catch those particular items which are dangerous. that this is one that. with the tremendous expansion. in terms of certainly medical device technology. that we should address. I appreciate the Senator saying that it can be addressed. We had language that we had considered. that I thought the device industry had been very supportive of and was acceptable. Then in the rush at the end. somehow individuals who had been involved in it felt they didnt want to have any further kind of adjustment or change in the language. I think it is significantand I am sure the Senator would agree and the chairman would agreethat we have had. in the fashioning of this bill great support and cooperation from the industry. from the pharmaceutical and also the device industry. We have perhaps some differences that have been moving along on particular kinds of items. but I must sayand I think the Senator would agree. I know he is proud of the industry in his own State. as I am in my Statewe have had enormous cooperation and help. So many of these items are technologically difficult. complicated. and involved. We are basically generalists as Members of the Senate.

When we are talking about these technicalities. we have to remember that some of these items. particularly those medical devices that enter the body. have enormous health implications. I remember chairing. in 1974 or 1975. the Dalkon shield hearings where we found that 2.300 American women died from a perforated uterus from the Dalkon shield. That was before we had a Food and Drug Administration that really looked into medical devices. We have the Shiley heart valve that passed through the FDA. and then eventually the FDA was able to uncover some of the difficulties with that and took steps. I think. if my memory serves me correctly. they were going to use a perfected Shiley heart valve over in Europe. and they altered some opening where the blood went through by just about 10 degrees. and that resulted in a rather significant increase in the failure of that medical device which was actually marketed abroad. The FDA was very much involved in seeing the termination of that. So even very modest changes or alterations can have important kinds of health implications. We are not going to be able to solve all the problems and we are not interested In producing a bureaucracy that is going to halt innovative and creative ways of dealing with some of these issues. But it is important that we are talking about a Food and Drug Administration and public health. As I mentioned briefly at the outset. this is the one agency that is intimately involved with public health. It has broad jurisdiction on a wide variety of items. and it has important responsibilities for the public health. This is where the buck stops. Some feel it ought to just be the agency to fast track various kinds of devices or fast track various pharmaceuticals without considering the health and efficaciousness of those products. That is why I think it is useful to pause here for a little while to give some focus to exactly this legislation and what its implications are going to be in terms of public health.

S. 1061. supra. as follows: At the appropriate place. insert the following: SEC. (a) FINDINGS.-Congress finds that(1) over 53.000 Americans are currently awaiting organ transplants. (2) In 1996. 3.916 people on the transplant waiting list died because no organs became available for such people. (3) the number of organ donors has grown slowly over the past several years. even though there is significant unrealized donor potential. (4) a Gallup survey indicated that 85 percent of the American public supports organ donation. and 69 percent describe themselves as likely to donate their organs upon death. (5) most potential donors are cared for in hospitals with greater than 350 beds. trauma services. and medical school affiliations. (6) a recent Harvard study showed that hospitals frequently fail to offer donation services to the families of medically eligible potential organ donors. (7) staff and administration in large hospitals often are not aware of the current level of donor potential in their institution or the current level of donation effectiveness of the institution. (8) under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. 1396 et seq.). hospitals that participate in the medicare or medicaid program are required to have in place policies to offer eligible families the option of organ and tissue donation. and (9) many hospitals have not yet incorporated systematic protocols for offering donation to eligible families in a skilled and sensitive way. (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.-It is the sense of the Senate that hospitals that have organ or tissue donor potential take prompt steps to ensure that a skilled and sensitive request for organ or tissue donation Is provided to eligible families by(1) working with the designated organ procurement organization or other suitable agency to assess donor potential and performance In their institutions. (2) establishing protocols for organ donation that incorporate bestdemonstrated practices. (3) providing education to hospital staff to ensure adequate skills related to organ and tissue donation. (4) establishing teams of skilled hospital staff to respond to potential organ donor situations. ensure optimal communication with the patients surviving family. and achieve smooth coordination of activities with the designated organ procurement organization. and (5) monitoring organ donation effectiveness through quality assurance mechanisms.",

It is the hope of the leadership that we could clear this bill for passage without a rollcall vote.

Senators will be notified when the next vote would occur. if one should be necessary on this. Now. Senator DASCHLE and I were just talking. We think we should pass this by voice vote. and we will encourage Senators to allow this to happen. But if we cant get it cleared. one option we would have would be to have this vote occur. and I would need to consult with Chairman STEVENS further before we do it. but one option. if we cant get it cleared in a reasonable period of time. would be to perhaps have a vote on that issue tomorrow around 1:30 or so.

Within an hour or so. we hope we could get those papers ready and get that done on a voice vote. The Senator is now saying we may have to have a recorded vote.

In addition. I would say to my friend from Nevada. the current law allows the IRS to keep confidential and private all audit criteria. Citizens may be surprised to know this. but if you ask the IRS today. \"What are your audit criteria? On what basis do you evaluate the taxpayers of Iowa or Delaware or Nebraska or Vermont or Mississippi? How do you evaluate your audits? How do you decide on what basis you are going to proceed on an audit?\" the IRS will say to you. \"You dont have a right to know. We wont disclose that information.\" The only available information has been obtained through a woman at the University of Syracuse through a Freedom of Information Act request for that information. If you look at audit data she has collected. you see broad variations. broad variations from State to State. In one State there will be very high percentages of audits. in another. very low percentages of audits. It is very inconsistent and subjective.

More than 300 Members of this House have signed on to various campaign finance reform bills. Nearly everyone has an idea and they have worked hard to turn those ideas into legislation.

The procedure is performed several thousand times each year. primarily in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy. on healthy babies of healthy mothers. To the victims of partialbirth abortion. this is no rhetorical campaign statement. as some have said. Instead. it is a means. partialbirth abortion is a means to a brutal death. According to the American Medical Association. which supports H.R. 1122. partialbirth abortion is not an accepted medical practice. Hundreds of obstetricians and gynecologists and fetal maternal specialists. along with former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop have come forward to unequivocally state that partialbirth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the mothers health or her future fertility. In fact. the procedure can significantly threaten a mothers health or ability to carry future children to term. In conclusion. the health exception sought by the President would be both unnecessary and dangerous. We want to enact a meaningful ban on partialbirth abortions that will protect innocent babies from a brutal death. That is exactly what the bill does. No changes in the bill are necessary.",

Members on both sides of aisle support the Coast Guard in this very bipartisan bill. The Coast Guard is on the front lines every day saving lives and stopping drugs from entering our country. They are the lead agency in the clean up of oil spills and protect our fisheries within our 200mile exclusive economic zone. Mr. Chairman. these are not partisan issues. The gentleman from Maryland . and I have worked closely with the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the ranking member. the gentleman from Wisconsin . to craft a bill that will meet the needs of the Coast Guard for fiscal year 1998. H.R. 2204 authorizes approximately $3.9 billion for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 1998. including $2.8 billion for their operations. $401 million for acquisition and construction of new ships and facilities. $19.5 million for research and development and $21 million for environmental compliance and restoration at Coast Guard facilities. D 1830 The only difference between the amounts authorized in this bill and the budget proposed by the President is that we have added approximately $97 million for increased drug interdiction operations. We have also worked closely with the administration to include much of its legislative program for this year. including extending the territorial sea from 3 miles to 12 miles. We have also included a number of recommendations made by the maritime industry. such as prohibiting people from interfering with the safe operation of commercial vessels. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 2204. the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

In addition. the completion of the new air station In Atlantic City will ensure better and faster search and rescue missions along the east coast. I want to thank the Coast Guard for the important service that they are performing in southern New Jersey and throughout our Nation. Their small boat stations have been a great help to fishermen and recreational boaters. Their rapid response saved the lives of two Air National Guard pilots forced to eject into the Atlantic in a recent accident. In general. Mr. Chairman. the Coast Guard personnel have proven to be very welcome members of the community in southern New Jersey and. in fact. throughout our Nation where the Coast Guard has a presence. And I would like to. Mr. Chairman. in conclusion. congratulate and to thank the Coast Guard for the great job that they are doing in so many different ways.

My interest in the VTS began when on August 10. 1993. a collision occurred in a navigation channel outside the entrance to Tampa Bay between two tug/barges and a 357foot freighter. This accident resulted in a thunderous explosion that shot a fireball hundreds of feet into the air. In addition. approximately 380.000 gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. The cost of the cleanup of this spill was enormous. not to mention the damage to the environment. This is not the first accident to occur at the mouth of Tampa Bay. In May 1980. a freighter. traveling through dense fog. ran into the Sunshine Skyward Bridge causing one of its spans to collapse. Some 40 people were killed. Had the VTS been in place prior to these incidences. these disasters could have been avoided. Today. the port of Tampa Bay is still without a VTS system. The VTS represents a costeffective answer to the prevention of these types of environmental disasters. The 1993 accident resulted in over $100 million in economic penalties and pollution cleanup costs. Nationally. the cost of cleaning up accidents such as the 1993 oil spill could easily outpace the cost of operating a VTS program. Over 2 billion tons of cargo move in and out of all U.S. ports each year. Almost half of this total consists of petroleum products. which pose environmental hazards. Increased use of waterways by passenger and recreational vessels only increases the risk of serious accidents on our Nations waterways. Mr. Chairman.

Title IX has been very successful in increasing the visibility and strength of womens collegiate sports. Its success can be seen in the two newly formed professional womens basketball leagues. Title IX has been very important program. and it should not become a scapegoat for fiscal difficulties affecting the institution. Title IX is not the only problem with this bill. Congress should not restrict a college or universities ability to decide on its programs and budget. Colleges and universities do not set their budgets four years in advance. yet this provision would force them to make decisions while just guessing at what the future may hold. In a time when the cost of college is rising much faster than the cost of living. we must find ways to help colleges decrease costs. not create obstacles to suspending programs that the college or university can no longer afford. This provision intrudes into the decision making policies of universities and colleges. and it would force colleges to make decisions prematurely about their athletic programs.

H.R. 6 contains language that would require universities to give at least four years of advance notice if they plan to discontinue any sports programs. The RiggsRoemer Amendment would remove this language from H.R. 6. and prevent the federal government from micromanaging college sports in this dangerous manner. Once a college announces that one of their sports teams is being disbanded. immediately. that team becomes a lame duck. The program permanently loses its fan base. any potential recruits and also the support of its financial boosters. The potential thus becomes a reality. It would be a shame if a college were forced by law to announce the discontinuation of a sport four years early. only to find enough money to keep the program afloat a year later. By then. that program will have suffered irreparable and unnecessary damage to its reputation and viability. The government should not force colleges to announce four years in advance that they plan to discontinue a sports program. That rule would limit a colleges options when it comes to possibly saving a struggling sport. I urge my colleagues to support the RiggsRoemer Amendment to H.R. 6. so we can save college athletics from government overregulation.",

I agree with my colleagues about the importance of ensuring autonomy for university administrators for their own athletic programs. I am astounded at the thought of the compliance issues associated with the provision in the bill this amendment proposes to strike. I am also concerned that this is a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the gains that we have made through the Title IX program. The provision in H.R. 6 that the RiggsRoemer.amendment would eliminate would force recipients of Higher Education Act funds to justify cuts in college athletic programs. Forcing an institution to maintain a failed program for four years after they report the cut is ludicrous. Imagine if this requirement were imposed on Congress. We would not be able to cut a program even if an emergency demanded it. We would never accept such a restriction and should not impose one on university administrators. This provision is an attempt to allow colleges and universities to use Title IX as a scapegoat for cuts to other athletic programs. No one understands better the difficult decisions that balancing a budget brings than we do in Congress. Title IX. which creates equal access to important programs for young men and women. should not suffer because of painful budgetary decisions. Last year Title IX celebrated its 25th anniversary. Since that time. womens participation in school athletic programs has increased dramatically. This increase has benefited young women in many aspects of life. Young women who play sports are more likely to graduate from high school. and less likely to use drugs or have an unintended pregnancy. They reap multiple health benefits from athletic participation. including a 40%-60% decrease in their risk of breast cancer. In addition. athletic participation helps improve selfesteem and discipline. I urge my colleagues to support Title IX and preserve autonomy in decisions at institutions of higher education. Please support the RiggsRoemer amendment.",

Although a very diligent effort has been made and is continuing to be made by the staff of the current administration to locate these records. it is to no avail due to failures of previous personnel. There has been an effort made to produce these records. and they are just not available. They produced a number of answers to the questions. inquiries submitted by the Department of Education.

Texas Colleges current application for participation in the title IV student assistance programs is being. I think. needlessly delayed based on the absence of records and assertions that failure to produce such records means the current administration is financially irresponsible and administratively incapable. That is just not the situation. We have Texas College. which is a black college founded in 1894. affiliated with the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. Bishop Gilmore serves as the Episcopal bishop in Texas. We have had a new president. Dr. Strickland. at Texas College since November of 1994. The members of the board and their associations have put millions of dollars into this college in order to keep it open. They. have. against great odds. kept it open since the funds were cut off in 1994. We intend to keep on doing that. Although Texas College may be liable for certain deficiencies associated with the absence of these records. their absence should not bear on the present capacity to administer title IV funds with personnel. new personnel. new administrative policies. and new financial aid procedures. Mr. Chairman. this amendment simply relieves Texas College. if they make a goodfaith effort to furnish such records. from having to produce records that may no longer exist as it seeks to reestablish its title IV eligibility.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Riggs amendment. This amendment would involve an unprecedented Federal intrusion into the admissions practices of colleges and universities. It would require an extensive apparatus to monitor admissions policies nationally. This seems monumentally unwise. Twenty years ago. the Bakke decision developed a careful and delicate balance for college admissions. Quotas were declared unconstitutional. as they should be. Gender and race can never be the sole or decisive factor in the admissions process. This made sense then and it makes sense now. But colleges and universities should be able to reach out to widen their pool of applicants. to bring previously deprived or disenfranchised people into higher education without fear of legal retribution. I know how this works from my years of experience as an admissions officer in a graduate department of a large university. Affirmative action offers a way of taking into account the backgrounds from which students come. assessing their true potential. and opening the doors of opportunity. For the Federal Government to interject itself into these decisions. to reduce flexibility. to force the use of overly narrow or rigid criteria. would be most unwise. Affirmative action. Mr. Chairman. is about fairness and equal opportunity for individuals. But it is also about community: about the academic community itself. diversifying that community to make education a broadening and enriching experience. And it is about serving the wider community. recruiting a student body that reflects the society being served. and training doctors and lawyers and teachers and business people and others to serve all elements of that community. The Riggs amendment ignores this experience and threatens these values. For those reasons. it ought to be rejected.",

As I listened to the debate. one thought kept crossing my mind. and that is how easy it is to be a philanthropist with other peoples money. It is really easy to give away other peoples money. $9.5 million. The impression some Members would give us. and the movie stars. is that the arts and arts programs in this country are hanging by a thread. and if we do not fund the NEA all of the arts are going to go away. Well. the truth is that is not true. The fact is there are several people that are contributing to the arts community in our country today. One is the Federal Government. Now. not just the $98.5 million that we are trying to stop being funded to the NEA. There are over 200 programs funded by taxpayers that go to the arts: Holocaust Museum. Commission of Fine Arts. Indian Arts and Crafts Board. JFK Center for the Performing Arts. National Endowment for Childrens Educational TV. NEH. National Gallery of Arts. the Smithsonian. How much money is the Federal Government spending of our tax dollars on the arts? Well. in 1997. it was $696 million. in 1998 it was $710 million. and in 1999 it will be $815 million that is going to go to fund the arts. So we are great philanthropists with. other peoples money.

For a small and carefully safeguarded investment of taxpayer money. NEA funds activities that enrich all aspects of our society. We will hear a good deal today about the economic benefits. NEA offers to our local communitiesand thats right. Last year. we invested $98 million in the NEA. This investment supported 1.3 million fulltime jobs in local communities. generated an estimated $37 billion in economic activity. and returned almost three and one half billion dollars to the federal treasury in income taxes. Clearly. any investment which provides a return of nearly 35 times your initial investment is worth continuing. Since FY96. the NEA has directly contributed over $3 million in awards to the Connecticut economy. and 19 individual awards were recommended last year. But more important is the immeasurable contribution that NEA makes to our nations art and music. creativity and talent. When we invest in NEA. we add to the store of artistic expression in the world. We add to the human spirit. And that is the most important investment of all. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and fund this important program.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as a Member of Congress who supports the arts. I believe that the Federal government should remain an important contributor in this area. Critics point to a few controversial grants that the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has made. and I agree that some funding decisions may have been unwise. However. in recent years. the NEA has taken strides to eliminate controversy from the grant process by eliminating \"individual grants\" and \"subgrants.\" In fact. most of the funding from the agency is directed toward the cultural life and diversity of our countryto people of all ages. to people in our inner cities. in our suburbs. and in our rural communities. In Delaware. the NEA provides assistance to the Delaware Division of the Arts and the Delaware Humanities Forum so they may grant funding to the Delaware Symphony Orchestra. the Delaware Theater Company. Opera Delaware and many other community and school activities. When it comes to partnership between private. state. and Federal funding of the arts the NEA sets an outstanding example. According to the agency. one endowment dollar attracts twelve dollars or more from state and regional arts agencies as well as corporations. businesses and individuals. In fact. NEA funded programs generate economic activity through tourism. urban renewal and economic development throughout the nation. According to the NEA. nonprofit arts programs contribute an estimated $37 billion to the economy and are responsible for 1.3 million jobs. It is also important to note that most industrial countries have a national budget for the arts and humanities. The United Kingdom. Canada. the Netherlands. France. Germany and Sweden not only have national budgets for the arts. but in most cases. provide more funding for the arts than the United States. Federal support of the NEA opens the door to the arts for all Americans. sets a standard for private and public investment partnerships and generates economic development in our communities. In light of these facts. the Federal government can not neglect its responsibility in continued support of the arts. and I urge my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment to restore NEA funding.",

As a member of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee. I have learned a great deal about the NEA in the last few years. I know that the NEA would admit it has made mistakes in the past. but it has instituted a series of management reforms to ensure that those types of problems will not recur. Even given those problems. opponents of the NEA can point to only a handful of questionable grants out of hundreds of thousands that have been awarded during the 32year history of the NEA. After hearing real people and real artists discuss what the NEA has brought to them and to their communities. I know that the NEA is an incredible catalyst for bringing people together and expressing. in a creative fashion. the full range of the human experience. The National Endowment for the Arts is successfully working to bring arts to underserved communities. through after school youth programs that are introducing our young people to the power of creative expression as an alternative to violence. and through folk and traditional arts that remind us of our common bond and what it means to be an American. Moreover. the American public supports public funding for the arts. A Louis Harris poll indicates that. by a decisive 79 percent to 19 percent margin. a better than 3to1 majority of the American people is convinced that it is important that there should be federal. state. and local councils for the arts to develop new programs. research and provide financial assistance to worthy arts organizations. By 57 percent to 39 percent. a clear majority of the American people favor the Federal Government funding the arts. Lets stop playing politics with this agency and follow the direction of the American people on this issue. Support the Johnson amendment and restore funding for the arts.",

In northern Michigan. where communities are rich with pride in their unique culture and heritage. eliminating the NEAs role as a source of state endowments and grant funding will effectively silence many quality programs. I have received many letters from local arts councils. senior centers. community theaters. youth programs and museums detailing the positive effect their programs have had and how even a small amount of federal funding can impact their program. The arts draw these communities together to celebrate and to educate each other. The past controversy over the NEA has led to reform and restructuring of that organization. The NEA has a new Chairman. Bill Ivey. These reforms and this chairman should be given the opportunity to prove themselves. not be stripped of their funding. Support the Johnson Amendment.",

This is a failure born of shortsightedness and is particularly troublesome given the challenges our Nation confronts in the next century. With regions around the world competing to develop the most efficient economies possible. we are holding ourselves back in this race by declining to support energy conservation. The Department of Energys renewable energy and efficiency programs have been extremely successful. These programs have saved American consumers billions. and I underscore the word billions. of dollars in utility bills. They have made housing more affordable for low and moderate income families. and these vital programs have helped communities nationwide reduce air pollution levels that burden local industry and threaten public health. The evidence is clear. energy efficiency is a wise investment. an investment with substantial return for consumers. business and the environment. Every dollar cut from energy efficiency programs represents a lost opportunity to make our buildings and motor vehicles more efficient and less costly for manufacturers and owners. These cuts in energy funding take dollars directly out of the pockets of our constituents. I believe that the American people want government that works. They want a government that saves money and improves our quality of life. The amendment before us will restore adequate funding for programs that achieve these important goals. Mr. Chairman. a wise man once said that those who fail to see the forest through the trees are doomed to get lost in the woods. We are lost indeed. I ask all my colleagues to support the SkaggsFox amendment so that we may find a way to a cleaner environment and a stronger economy. I ask simply that we look at the heat waves that are affecting our cities across this Nation. how it is we are handing out simple fans to people and how many senior citizens are suffering because of lack of energy efficiency to the point where they will not put on their air conditioning system because the energy costs are so hard for them to burden. That is but one example across our Nation. From Massachusetts to Illinois to California to Texas and Florida. energy efficiency is important if we are going to deal with global change.",

We decided long ago that if a person filed bankruptcy. we would allow them to protect certain things that we considered essential. and one of those things was a home. Now. of course. that is understandable. 50 percent of the people filing* for bankruptcy are homeowners. but we left it to the States to come up with the amount of money that your home could be worth. and you could exempt it. As a consequence. with 50 different States. we have basically 50 different approaches. Some of these approaches. unfortunately. have led to abuse. The Senator from Wisconsin described two or three cases where people literally owed millions of dollars and quickly raced out to buy a multimilliondollar home to put everything they could into it and to basically guard it away from any creditor in bankruptcy. I do not think that is what we had in mind when we put the homestead exemption in place. It was a legitimate effort to protect someones home. I see the Senator from Alabama has taken the floor. I congratulate him. Senator SESSIONS. as well as Senator KOHL for their leadership here. Let me tell you why I think this is important. The idea behind this bill was to stop the abuses in bankruptcy. Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School. whom I have really come to respect for her knowledge of this subject. calls the disparity among State homestead exemptions \"the biggest single scandal in the consumer bankruptcy system.\" To think. in the instance of a doctor in Miami who refused to carry malpractice insurance. who was sued by four different people. one of them a person who lost a leg. and then when they went to collect against the doctor personally. because he had no insurance. he basically hid behind the homestead exemption and said. \"Everything I own is in my home and you cannot touch it\"-that really is an abuse of the system. I am glad Senator SESSIONS and Senator KOHL have shown leadership on this and I am happy to support their efforts.",

Those things will probably be much more controversial in conference than what the Senator from California is trying to do. She. from my standpoint. through the year that we have worked on this legislation. and being prodded also by the Senator from Illinois about the problems that we have or the potential problems we have with credit card companies. and they not being too careful in their anticipation of who they take on to give credit to. does back up the study that the Senator from California has called for. She does not give new statutory authority to the Federal Reserve. She does give the Federal Reserve authority. after the study. if the Federal Reserve wants to do it. to issue regulations that would require additional disclosure to consumers. then. within their existing statutory authority. if the board finds necessary. \"to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\" This is all based upon a study which we believe. based upon our years consideration of this legislation. probably is a very worthwhile thing for us to have and to promote.

And they pointed out that the Fed has not had a loss for nearly 80 years--will never have a loss. You cant lose money when you create money. So there was no reason to have a rainy day fund or some sort of provisional fund of $3.7 billion. And the GAO recommended that it be returned to the Treasury. It belongs to the American people. Not only has it not been returned. the $3.7 billion has now been increased to $5.2 billion. So you have to say to somebody. if you think there is reason to get some of these resources to do something with itpay down the Federal debt or to do some of the other issuesthere is $5.2 billion down at the Fed that they have for a rainy day fund. and they never have rain down there. They create money. They make their own money. And they have never had an annual loss. and will never have a loss. and yet they have squirreled away $5.2 billion of resources.

One that came to mind was this. As I understand section 120. tribes who did not want to give up their sovereign immunity would be denied Federal funds. If they did willingly give up Federal funds. then they would not have had to give up their sovereign immunity. which seemed strange to me because the tribes that are the most destitute and therefore the most dependent on Federal help. would have been the ones who would have had to give up immunity and therefore would have been sued more. where the very few. perhaps 1 out of 100. who do have a casino and have some money. simply would have said we dont want Federal money. we have enough. therefore. their immunity would have been intact.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take a moment to bring an issue to the Senates attention related to the National Park Service and its new initiative called Vanishing Treasures. In a number of park units throughout the Southwest. the Park Service is responsible for maintaining and interpreting numerous ruins and historic structures. some that date back over 1.000 years. One example of the wonderful ruins that exist in our National Parks is the Chetro Ketl kiva found in Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. a fascinating structure demonstrating the advanced architectural skills of the ancient Anasazi culture. Many of these structures have become unstable and are constantly being degraded. primarily by the effects of the harsh desert climate. Furthermore. the almost artistic skill required in the stabilization methods that are necessary to preserve these structures is being lost because of the emphasis on other programs within the Park Service. The Vanishing Treasures initiative will provide a 10year program to stabilize these kinds of ruins to the point where they can be preserved by routine maintenance activities. Additionally. the initiative will place an emphasis on the training of younger employees. both permanent and seasonal. in the skills needed to perform this needed work. In all. over 2.000 prehistoric and historic structures in 41 Park Service units. and countless numbers of future visitors will benefit from the work performed under this initiative. The bill before us provides $1.5 million for this program. which is $0.5 million more than provided by the House. and $2 million less than requested by the administration. I hope that the chairman will work with me to ensure the Senate level is at least maintained in conference. and I look forward to working with him to explore other opportunities to see that this initiative has sufficient resources to do this Important work.

Floodplain communities participate in FEMAs Community Rating System and are offered incentives to adopt and enforce measures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood prevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses. the program provides stringent building standards. including increased elevation. designed to reduce the risk of future damage. These flood protection standards must be met before any structure which suffers substantial damage may be rebuilt. In addition. persons who receive disaster assistance and fail to subsequently purchase flood insurance are barred from receiving future assistance. Mr. President. the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs of Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay approximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this premium income. the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs in disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State and community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster prevention and mitigation activities. Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming the commitment of the Federal Government to help American families protect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks of catastrophic floods. Clearly. we must do more. Lenders and private insurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. States and local communities must improve their disaster planning. prevention. and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to increase participation in the program to improve the safety and soundness of the NFIP fund.

It is. therefore. appropriate that the U.S. Small Business Administration has honored Washington State businessman. Mr. David Giuliani. as the National Small Business Person of the Year. Mr. Giuliani is president and chief executive officer of the Bellevue. WA. based Optiva Corp. which manufactures the Sonicare brand of toothbrushes. Starting Optiva as a technology transfer project from the University of Washington in 1988. Mr. Giuliani has overseen the companys progression from a startup business to an employer of 250 with sales of over $50 million in 1995. With growth of this kind it is not surprising that. last October. Inc. Magazine recognized Optiva as the secondfastest growing private company in the entire nation. To celebrate its success at the production of its millionth toothbrush last year. Mr. Giulianis company gave away more than 1.000 Sonicare toothbrushes to individuals who couldnt afford them on their own. Mr. President. I am proud to represent a State that is home to such an outstanding businessman and citizen. Mr. Giuliani certainly deserves the title of Small Business Person of the Year.*",

On a chilly. rainy winter day. three generations of the Chamberlain family. Dale. Mark. and Justin set out on snowshoes in a wooded area of Lyndonville. VT. After 5 hours of trekking in the woods. the eldest Chamberlain. Dale. attempted to forge an icecovered river when the ice gave way and dragged him under. Mark. his son. managed to grab a hold of his coat and pull him back to safety amid the chunks of ice and strong river currents. Despite the fact that Dale was numb with cold. Mark assured his father that he would be fine and convinced him to begin walking. Mark led the party back to their vehicle and the three Chamberlains returned safely to the warmth of their home. Mark Chamberlain. not only set an heroic example for his son. Justin. to admire and follow. he also demonstrated the strength of the bonds that tie families together. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the achievement of Mercymount Country Day School of Cumberland. RI. which was recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School. As I think all in this chamber know. it is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. since these schools represent some of the cream of our educational crop. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the State level and continuing through a Federal Review Panel of 100 top educators. many of the very best public and private schools in the Nation are identified as deserving of this honor. These are schools that are particularly effective meeting local. State. and national goals. But. Mr. President. this honor is not about determining who is best. it is about learning what works in educating todays childrenthe leaders of tomorrow. Now. more than ever. it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students. that we truly engage and challenge them. and that we make their education come alive. At the Mercymount Country Day School in Rhode Island. partnerships between parents and teachers have made an enormous difference in the education of their students. They have understood that the quality of education depends not only upon the efforts of schools and government. it also depends upon the ideas and innovation of parents and community. At Mercymount. parentteacher cooperation has brought computers into the classroom. and their \"Pull the Plug\" on TV initiative has helped students get away from television sets and into reading and other challenging activities. Mercymount has also developed a wonderful fine arts program. and as research has shown. the pursuit of education in the arts at an early age improves a childs cognitive ability. Again. Mercymount is making a huge difference in the lives of its students. Mr. President. the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students. and the techniques that can be replicated in all schools to help all students learn. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like Mercymount Country Day. Under the leadership of its principal. Sister Martha Mulligan. its capable faculty. and its improved parents. Mercymount will continue to be a shining example for years to come.@",

My bill will rescind the dollar limitation on police and firefighter benefit laws allowing these employees to collect the money that they have rightfully earned by contributing to their benefit fund. to their pension fund. Currently. under section 415 of the Tax Code. police officers and firefighters are not eligible to collect the funds that they have earned and instead are required to retire with benefits generally based on the percentage of their highest 3year salary average. Regrettably the average in most instances does not exceed 65 or 75 percent. Thus many officers living along the east coast or in large metropolitan and surrounding suburban areas throughout our Nation are forced to work past their general retirement age in order to afford the high cost of living in these areas. This bill will not initiate a tax revenue loss. In fact. under my bill. we would gain Federal revenues due to the disbursement of previously uncollected funds to retirees.

Our strong support for the fourparty talks is a further proof that the United States Government wants to see improved relations between North and South Korea. which will hopefully bring a final and lasting peace to the peninsula.

Unfortunately. these refugees have found themselves stopped along the way and killed if they belong to the wrong ethnic group.

We would think it is an anomaly. Mr. Speaker. to have a request for new bankruptcy judges at a time when the gross national product seems to be in good shape and inflation is down and the economy is in fairly good shape. yet the evidence is sound that bankruptcies. personal and otherwise. are on the rise. Therefore. the Judicial Conference. on whom we rely in the Committee on the Judiciary for the general themes of what we can best do to serve the Federal judiciary. has requested that these new judgeships be created. There would be 7 permanent new judges and 11 temporary judges across the 14 Federal judicial districts. It would extend one temporary judgeship already in existence in another district. Because I personally put so much stock In the findings of the Judicial Conference. those findings have formed the basis for the hearings that we held In this regard over the last two terms and the reports on which we based some of our recommendations. The bill that is in front of us has been cosponsored by Members on both sides of the aisle. The gentleman from Illinois . the chairman of the full Committee on the Judiciary. and the gentleman from Michigan the ranking member on the minority. as well as the gentleman from New York the subcommittee ranking member. and this individual. all of us have cosponsored and have urged the passage of this legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. H.R. 1596. the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1997. This legislation is both urgently necessary and long overdue. Although bankruptcies continue to rise. over 1 million filings in 1996. Congress has failed to provide the necessary resources to do the job. We have not provided for any new bankruptcy judgeships since 1992. When the cases pile up in bankruptcy court. businesses that are owed money are left holding the bag. families trying to straighten out their lives face delay. and many cases will receive less attention than they merit. I would note that this year the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has recommended an increase in the number of permanent bankruptcy judgeships in the Central District of California by four and the addition of a temporary bankruptcy judgeship in the Eastern District of California. This bill also reflects the improved method instituted by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for measuring the work required to adjudicate the huge chapter 11 cases. Until recently. the largest unit of measure used for the purpose of calculating judicial workload was a $1 million chapter 11. Under that system of measuring judicial workload. a case involving $1 million worth of debt was statistically indistinguishable from a $1 billion case. By failing to measure the actual workload in these cases. the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts consistently failed to recommend adequate resources for courts that heard the massive chapter 11 cases. This bill reflects the newer and more accurate measure. We cannot afford to have debtors and creditors held up in court because there are not enough judges to hear the cases. H.R. 1596 is a measured response to the need for additional bankruptcy judges. I urge its adoption and join with the chairman in pointing out that this is indeed a measure that has received bipartisan support among its sponsors and on the committee. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 1596. the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1997. I come to the floor today to speak not only as a Member of Congress but as a former county surrogate court judge. I am very concerned about the bankruptcy system in the United States. not that it does not work but that with the sheer number of cases being filed. Americans cannot be assured of speedy bankruptcy filings. As the gentlewoman from California said. that means that individuals and businesses who are owed money by individuals and companies that take advantage of our bankruptcy laws. they will not receive their just compensation in a timely enough fashion. So as Members of Congress. as legislators. it is our responsibility to equip the judiciary with the tools they need to ensure fair and speedy bankruptcy trials for Americans. In 1996 there were over a million bankruptcy filings in the United States. This was an increase of 27 percent over 1995 and more than triple the number filed since 1984. In my home State of New Jersey there were more than 34.000 filings in 1996. up almost 23 percent from the previous year. While this number continues to rise. one thing has not changed. Since 1992. no new bankruptcy judges have been added. New Jerseys 34.000 bankruptcy cases were handled by only eight bankruptcy judges. It is. therefore. unreasonable to think that eight judges can adequately handle 34.000 cases. and that turns out to be the fact. This number is too high. We cannot expect cases of this number to be heard expeditiously as well as thoroughly and fairly and creditors to be paid promptly if the number of judges does not increase. It is unfair for all of the parties involved. We will be increasing with H.R. 1596 the number of new bankruptcy judges by 6 percent over 1992. even though the caseload went up 30 percent. I think that this is a good start. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1596 puts into action the Judicial Conferences recent recommendation to add 7 permanent and 11 temporary judgeships nationwide. and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 1596. the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1997. Spurred by credit card debt. bankruptcy claims in the United States have escalated by more than 20 percent over the past 5 years. increasing from 971.000 in 1992 to 1.2 million in 1996. This has translated into expanding caseloads for U.S. bankruptcy courts and placed a substantial added burden upon bankruptcy judges and staff. The district of Maryland is among those jurisdictions affected most severely by the rise in bankruptcy filings. experiencing a staggering 35.8 percent jump in the last year. and an astounding 544 percent increase over the 12year period beginning December 31. 1984. and ending December 31. 1996. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act will help to alleviate the mounting stress on the most severely overburdened U.S. bankruptcy courts by establishing an additional 7 permanent and 11 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in various jurisdictions around the country. Under H.R. 1596. Maryland would receive one permanent and two temporary bankruptcy judgeships. I would like to commend the bills lead sponsor. Mr. GEKAS. chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative law. and the rest of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. including Chairman HENRY HYDE. ranking member JOHN CONYERS. and the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. NADLER. for taking this action to help bankruptcy courts meet the challenge of rapidly expanding caseloads. Enactment of this legislation will bring muchneeded relief to the U.S. bankruptcy court system and more expeditious adjudication of bankruptcy claims.

    "speech": "Madam President. last week I talked about the balanced budget movement from a historical perspective. I discussed the fact that when our country started out as a new nation. policymakers felt a moral and ethical obligation to balance the budget year after year after year. and they did that. However. as time evolved. a process was developed under which programs were funded based on demand. This process produced what are called entitlement programs. It created a blank check. As a result of these entitlements and the corresponding lack of accountability. there is no longer the same concern to balance the budget that existed during the time of the Founders. I wanted to talk a little bit this afternoon from the perspective of a family man who has grown up in America. from the perspective of a small businessman who has had to start his business from scratch. Those obligations that I faced as a family man and those obligations that I faced as a businessman are pretty much the same obligations that we are facing as a Congress. as the leaders of this country. this great country called America. Thus far. we have had two amendments presented before this body which. in effect. provide for exceptions to a balanced budget amendment. One is the Durbin amendment. and the most recent one is the welfare amendment. These amendments are unnecessary. We already have a provision to meet emergencies in the balanced budget amendment proposal that is before us. Madam President. 60 percent of the vote in the House and 60 percent of the vote in the Senate. or 261 votes in the House and 60 votes in the Senate. and we will be able to waive the provisions of this amendment to meet those national emergencies. Madam President. I understand I will have an opportunity later on to continue with some of my remarks and that there is an order on the floor for another amendment.

They say these very people that do not deserve any of the surplus that you. the American people. created. Democrats say government should keep it and spend it to create new government programs. It is time to reward the American taxpayers. The truth must be told and scare tactics need to end. Social Security will be protected. Americans want. need and deserve tax relief.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first. let me compliment the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means for bringing out a bill that its provisions on tax relief are very good. The marriage penalty relief is a good provision. The extenders of our expiring tax provisions. that is very good to help small investors. I agree with all those provisions. I think most of the Members of this body agree with those changes. The problem is that the budget deficit next year. excluding Social Security. will be $37 billion. We do not have a surplus. If we pass this bill. the budget deficit will be $44 billion. adding to the deficit on budget. if we do not count Social Security. The year after. the budget deficit is projected to be $46 billion. With this bill. it will be $65 billion. The year after. it is projected to be a $45 billion deficit. And with this bill. it will be a $63 billion deficit. We are adding to the deficit of this country. We are not paying for the tax bill. We are raiding Social Security. That is wrong. This bill will be vetoed if it is passed in its current form. It cannot become law. The votes are not here to do that. Thank goodness. The reason is quite simple. We know that the passage of this bill will make solving the Social Security problem more difficult. plain and simple. Without Social Security. we have no surplus. pure and simple. But there is a way that we can get these good provisions enacted into law and help the taxpayers of this country. We have the Rangel substitute that we will have an opportunity to vote for a little bit later. I hope my colleagues will keep this issue alive. Support the Rangel substitute. Let us work together and figure out a way that we can pay for these very worthwhile tax provisions so that they can become law without raiding Social Security. Let us work together in a bipartisan way so that we can really help the taxpayers of this country and we can preserve our Social Security system. It can only work if we work together in a bipartisan way.",

How enlightening for my colleagues on the left to employ and embrace wholeheartedly the politics of fear. Congratulations. Mr. Speaker. to my colleagues on the left who will do anything and everything to stand in the way of the American people and the chance for working Americans to hold on to more of their hardearned money. That is what we are seeing here today. But moreover. Mr. Speaker. it is very interesting. They cite arguments from the President of the United States. They cite arguments of what they would call responsible tax cuts. And we are aware. in the current climate in Washington. D.C.. that definitions can change in a nanosecond. But to follow their logic. last year when they joined us on tax relief and tax cuts that were long overdue. they did so in a climate of deficit. And now here we have the hope and the policies of surplus. And. yesterday. Mr. Speaker. we set aside $1.4 trillion to supplement Social Security. $1.4 trillion. when the left had set aside nothing over 40 years of control. And here we stand today. standing up for working families by providing relief from the marriage penalty. standing up for the selfemployed by giving them deductibility of their health insurance costs. standing up for seniors by relaxing some of the limits on their ability to earn money past the age of retirement. The answer is clear. Mr. Speaker: Stand with the majority for tax relief. That is the truth.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me try to clear up what was just stated by the gentleman from Arizona. This is as clear and concise an argument as I have witnessed in the House of Representatives during the 10 years that I have been here. We are being told by the Republican majority that the best way to save Social Security is to take 10 percent of it for tax cuts. That as I stated yesterday was not only a misguided vote. it was Orwellian philosophy. that the best way to save Social Security is to take 10 percent of it out six weeks before the national elections and provide a tax cut that nobody in Washington believes is ever going to happen. And we are accused of demagoguing the issue. There are many seductive proposals in this tax bill. most of them Democratic proposals that we would gladly vote for. You talk about a turn of events. the Democrats standing up for fiscal responsibility and saying. \"Save Social Security first.\" My friend from Arizona said that this is about politics. Now. who among us in America today would measure that argument when we are offering here in this proposal tax cuts six weeks before an election? We had from January to discuss these things. But on the eve of the national election. we are going to talk about $80 billion worth of tax cuts. we are not going to talk about saving Social Security first. and the argument the Democratic minority makes today is simply this: Do not touch the Social Security trust fund until we decide that we have permanently fixed this issue for the American people. Mr. Roosevelt offered a contract with the American people in 1935. We stand with it today. We are witnessing here the slow erosion of the Social Security surplus for the purpose of providing tax cuts to the American people who. by the way. the wealthiest among us are not asking for these tax cuts. They want fiscal stability. George Bush in 1991 and Bill Clinton in 1993 with minimal or no hope from the other side gave us the fiscal picture that we have today. It is one of responsibility. Leave the Social Security trust fund alone and let us have a substantive debate about its future. Mr. Speaker. I include the following for the RECORD:",

Marriage penalty relief for 48 million taxpayers. an average of $243 per couple.

Tax relief for farmers who have carried the loss forward for five years. AMT relief and incomeaveraging. permanent incomeaveraging for farmers. 5 years. And we cut the death tax even further. Mr. Speaker. we must remember that the budget surpluses do not belong to the government. It belongs to the American people. It is their tax dollars that make up the surplus. We should let them keep more of their own money. because they know how to spend it better than the government does. Yesterday we protected Social Security by devoting 90 percent of the surplus to it.

Were facing the highest peacetime tax burden in our Nations history21 percent of G.D.P. If taxes today were at the same level as 1950. the average American household today would be twice as rich. American families pay 38 percent of their income in taxes. up from 26 percent back in 1955the Federal Government is taking too much from the American taxpayer. So the bill before us today cuts taxesand it does so in a responsible. restrained and fair manner. Our tax relief is focused squarely on middle and lower income taxpayersexactly those who need it the most. Husbands and wivesfarmers and rancherssmall business owners and senior citizens. Democrats said it couldnt be done. For 30 years. they controlled Congress and never balanced the budget! Instead they used the Social Security trust funds on programs like midnight basketball and other porkbarrel spending. Now the G.O.P. comes in. and not only balances the budget and preserves Social Security. but also provides sweeping tax relief. When was the last time the Democrats balanced the budget? And more importantly. when was the last time they paid $1.4 trillion back to Social Securityinstead of spending the trust funds? This debate is about Social Security. and we make a significant payment to our Nations seniors. We also allow the American taxpayer to reap the rewards of their hard work in the form of reduced taxes. Who is complaining about our tax relief bill? Mr. Speaker. its the same people who buried us under a mountain of debt and saddled our children with the burden of paying it off. Some on the other side believe we need to keep that surplus in Washingtonbut its your money. And hardworking Americans deserve a break. Our opponents say that its not enough to wall off $1.4 trillion dollars to save Social Security and both save Social Security and reduce taxes. But I believe we can.

In short. we can stand with those who defend todays record high tax burden or we can stand with the hardworking middle class.

I know the majority is sensitive to references to stealing from Social Security. but the above quote is not from Democrats but from a leading official at the conservative Cato Institute. Surely the Republicans are proposing the diversion of Social Security moneys. Unlike in past years when the overall deficit was so huge. we are now at a point where we can undertake the difficult but vital task of assuring the longterm soundness of Social Security. This means putting Social Security first. and then a tax cut. Being a 90 percenter. diverting 10 percent of Social Security funds. is wrong. This bill also erodes the fiscal discipline that we fought so hard for in 1990 and 1993. In 1997. we passed a tax cut. I voted for it and would do so again. We paid for it with program cuts deep enough that they caused many to vote against the bill. Today the majority turns its back on that hardwon fiscal discipline. They pay for this cut from the budget surplus. Social Securitys surplus. waiving the budget rules. This Nation has benefited from fiscal discipline. We who voted for it in 1990 and 1993 were right.

I would ask anybody that is watching this debate today to take with a grain of salt and be very cautious about any Member who gets up and says that any other Member on either side of the aisle is guilty of raiding the Social Security trust fund. It just simply is not true. It is a baldface lie. The question is coming down as to whether or not the Social Security trust fund should be legislatively adjusted before the American people are given any tax relief whatsoever. That is the debate. and that is where there is an honest difference of opinion. The President. when he stood right before us in this very hall and said \"We are going to save Social Security. save Social Security first.\" and then went on with all his big plans for spending the surplus. he got a standing ovation from both sides of the aisle. We are still waiting for his plan to save Social Security. We are going to have to bite the bullet and make some tough political decisions on both sides of the aisle in order to accomplish what all of us want. and that is to leave Social Security in a solvent position for 75 years and even beyond that. And that is important. and that is a responsibility of this body and something we should work on together. But let us not start out by lying to the American people. It just simply is not true. We are trying to make some adjustments and put some fairness in the tax law itself.

I rise today very disappointed with the Republican majority. Their tax bill is both fiscally irresponsible and socially bankrupt. It calls for $80 billion in tax cuts over the next five years by raiding projected Social Security surpluses. Surpluses that Congress designed to secure retirement benefits for current and future retirees. The longterm solvency of Social Security depends on sound policy choices and fiscal discipline. With an aging population and the onset of the babyboom generation entering retirement years. tampering with Social Security is dangerous and irresponsible. I strongly support extending tax credits. such as work opportunity and research and development. and accelerating the selfemployed health insurance deduction to 100%. I have cosponsored bills to do just that but with the belief that offsets would be real and fair. While I support these provisions and others in the Republican tax bill. the bill is clearly in violation of the payasyougo budget rule this House championed for budget discipline. PAYGO has worked. We have offset spending and revenue proposals with real spending cuts or revenue increases. We have also shielded Social Security from budget gimmickry. We have promised not to use Social Security surpluses to mask the Federal deficit. Just as we balanced the Federal budget the Republican majority has turned its back on fiscal responsibility. Adoption of this tax bill will unravel the budget discipline by which we have operating in the last few years. With the adoption of President Clintons deficit reduction and economic growth package in 1993. we have put our fiscal house in order. For the first time in thirty years we have balanced the Federal budget. We have made hard choices. and we have respected the PAYGO rule that proposals be budget neutral. Offsetting a tax bill with projected Social Security surpluses is irresponsible and wrong. I urge my colleagues to reject the Republican tax bill.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 3130. the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. This bill sets forth an alternative penalty structure for states that did not complete their statewide child support computer systems by the deadline. Under current law. states like my home State of Illinois. Michigan. Pennsylvania and Ohio stand to lose all of their child support enforcement funding plus the states entire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. Such a loss would be devastating to millions of children and adults and undermine welfare reform efforts underway in the various states. Child support enforcement is a vital component of any welfare reform plan and efforts to cut any funds for enforcement could hurt those who need the help the most. The alternative penalty structure in this bill is fairer and more reasonable than current law. This bill recognizes states good faith efforts to complete their systems and targets federal child support enforcement dollars only. However. this bill provides real incentives for states that actually do a better job at child support enforcement. Such inducements provided by this bill gives a real glimmer of hope that those children seeking assistance. whether in Illinois or any other state will in fact secure the support they need. Therefore. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Thank you.",

Under current law. 16 states. including my state of Illinois. are facing very severe penalties for failing to complete a statewide child support computer system by October 1. 1997. These states stand to lose their entire TANF Block Grant and their federal child support funding. If these penalties were to stand. the states welfare programs would be completely jeopardized. and many people could be left without their benefits. This bill restructures the penalty system in a way that will encourage states to get their systems up and running as soon as possible. The bill will increase the penalty for each year that states fail to comply. thereby giving them more incentive to get their programs online quickly. Everybody agrees that it is important to have an efficient statewide system to enforce child support payments. The bill also restructures the Child Support Incentive system. This program awards almost a half billion dollars per year to the States. This bill would make the incentive program based on performance measures such as: paternity establishment. collections on current payments and cost effectiveness. In order to qualify for this funding states would have to show that their child support program is successfuland thats what this is all about. Payment of child support is everyones goal. and I believe this bill will help states in their efforts to do so.

Today I would like to acknowledge the career of Bob Childs. who recently left us for retirement after 37 years work on Capitol Hill. Bob came to government service in 1960 in the electrical engineering department under the Architect of the Capitol to work on the inauguration of President Kennedy. In 1961 he assisted in wiring the House for sound. Due in large measure to his efforts. our voices ring loud and clear through this Chamber to this very day. Early in 1970 Bob worked on the Senates very first sound system. and in 1973 became the supervisor for the sound systems of both Chambers. In 1976 Bob participated in the design and installation of our present sound system here in the House. while maintaining supervisory responsibility for its overall operation and for the TV lighting in the Chamber for all joint sessions. It is worth noting that Bobs schedule often required him to arrive at 7 a.m. and to remain on duty until the session ended after special orders. During his 37 years on the Hill. Bob accumulated a wealth of knowledge as to how this institution functioned in terms of both the legislative process and behind the scenes operations which support our legislative efforts here. His eagerness to share his knowledge. combined with the skill and integrity always present in carrying out his duties. leaves us at a loss on many levels. He can easily be classified as a resource. and we know all too well that a resource is rarely appreciated until it is no longer available. But in Bobs case. we want to let him know how much he have meant to us in this institution and to convey our thanks for a job well done for 37 years. In closing. it is important to us that Bob realize how special his contributions have been and that wherever retirement takes him and Nancy. to Myrtle Beach. to Cape May. to the Maryland or Delaware coast. we hope that his path will from time to time lead back to us. Madam Speaker. we say to Bob. \"Goodbye. good luck and God Bless you.\"",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I am joined by the gentleman from Nevada here today in support of this resolution. This resolution is necessary to return to the Senate the bill S. 104. the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. S. 104 contravenes the constitutional requirement that revenue measures shall originate in the House of Representatives. It would repeal a revenue provision and replace it with a user fee. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 imposes a fee of one mill per kilowatt hour on electricity generated by nuclear energy. S. 104 would repeal this fee and replace it with a new fee that would be limited to the amounts appropriated for nuclear waste disposal. The current one mill per kilowatt hour fee is unquestionably a revenue measure. Regardless of the stated intent of the fee. the amount of fee proceeds collected have greatly exceeded costs. The fee Is being used to raise revenue to finance the Federal Government generally. Therefore. the Senate bill. by repealing what is in effect a tax. constitutes a revenue bill. The provision would have a direct effect on Federal revenues. The proposed change is \"revenue affecting\" and therefore constitutes a revenue measure in the constitutional sense. Accordingly. I am asking that the House insist on its constitutional prerogatives. Madam Speaker. I want to emphasize that this action speaks solely to the constitutional prerogative of the House and not to the merits of the Senate bill. The proposed action today is procedural in nature and is necessary to preserve the prerogatives of the House to originate revenue measures. It makes clear to the Senate that the appropriate procedure for dealing with revenue measures is for the House to act first on a revenue bill and for the Senate to accept it or amend it as it sees fit. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This hearing has been arranged so the committee may take testimony about the report of the Inspector General of the CIA regarding allegations that the CIA was somehow involved with the spread of crack cocaine to California during the 1980s. As Members know. since the publication in August of 1996 of a series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News. our committee has been conducting an oversight investigation into the validity of the very serious allegations made by those news stories. This public hearing is an important step in that process. We have invited the CIAs Inspector General. Mr. Fred Hitz. to discuss his investigation and to walk us through the conclusions in his report. which has been available to the public since the end of January. In addition. I wish to inform Members who have an interest in this subject and who may wish to comment on the IGs report that they are welcome to testify before the subcommittee on March 16. Members wishing to avail themselves of this opportunity should contact the committee as soon as possible so proper arrangements can be made.",

I am a strong advocate of fair trade and expanding markets for American products. Our sound economy is due largely to our commitment to open trade. This open trade has led to global competition. which. in turn. has improved our productivity and our efficiency. We are all painfully aware of the economic crisis in Asia. We will likely have a spirited debate on what the United States should do to help out our troubled allies and trading partners in that region. Regardless of whether we vote to use more American money to replenish IMF accounts. we are already the largest contributor to the fund. As such. it is our obligation to speak up for what is right. My bill does not focus on what role the United States should have in the Asian recovery. My bill is focused on what the Asians should do to help themselves by upholding their trade reform commitments and ensuring fair trade. Many of the socalled Asian tigers have enjoyed dramatic growth by focusing on exports. They have insulated their markets from foreign competition and often subsidized their exports to undercut the world price. This lack of real competition has weakened their domestic economies to the breaking point. As the world struggles to deal with the Asian crisis. we ought to take responsibility as the world leader in trade and democracy. The bill I have introduced would use our voice and vote as the IMF. the World Bank. and the Asian Development Bank to insist that promised marketingopening reforms are carried out in Asia. For too long we have been shut out of these growing markets. For too long we have faced Asian goods unfairly dumped into our markets. hurting our factories and our workers. Now is the time to make the changes that will help. We can help our workers and businesses by requiring that the Asians allow fair trade. and fair markets. for U.S. goods. I urge my colleagues to support the Asian Trade Reform Implementation Act. It will send a strong and firm message to Asia: Open up your doors to U.S. products.",

As an original cosponsor of the legislation. this Member would like to commend the distinguished gentleman from Colorado. Mr. DAN SCHAEFER. and the dIsttnguished gentfeman ftom Michigan. Mr. Su PAg. for Introducing this bill and working for Its enactment Across the Nation. leaking underground storage tanks present a hazard which must be addressed. Unfortunately. less than half of the identified leaking tanks have been remedied. In addition. there are likely thousands of other unidentified leaking tanks which require action. This legislation improves the current situation by distributing more money from the existIng trust fund to the States whew It belongs. The Insel fund was establishod by Congress in 1886 and currently contains about $1 billion. Although the trust fund Is Intended to provide assistance In the cleanup of underground storage tanks. too much of the money in the trust fund has been used to offset general Federal spending. This Member certainly believes that the money in the trust fund should be used for the purposes for which it was originally intended. money simply accumulating in the trust fund obviously does not address the current needs. The large number of remaining leaking under. ground storage tank sites is evidence that the States could use this money which Is currently accumulating In the trust fund. This bill would assist States in more efficlently receiving and disbursing money from the trust fund. If would also give the States Increased flexibility In the use of money from the trust fund.

I rise in support of iKR 688. the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Act. commonl referred to as the LUST program. My colleague. Mr. ScnEfER. has developed a welltcrafted piece of legislation which has two primary purposes. The first is to ensure thai 85 percent of the money Congress appropriates for the program goes to the Slates. and to expand the uses for which the trust fund moneys can be used. In 1980. Congress created the LUST Trust Fund. paid for with a onetenth of one cent per gallon tax on motor fuels. The Trust Fund is to be used by the EPA or the States. in accordance with Federal law. to enforce Underground Storage Tank corrective action requiremani. to conduct cleanups where no slvent responsible party can be found. wher there is a known but unwilling responsible party. or where a responsible party does not have the financial ability to pay for the entire deanup. Unlike many other wellilntentioned bills enacted by Congress. which then fall victim to the law of unintended consequences. the LUST program has el its intended purpose to set leak detection and prevention standards for underground tanks. HR. 688 Improves on the current program because it provides an Increased amount of stability and certaity to State agendas while granting greater flexiblity.

HR. 1272 reauthorizes the programs and activities of the U.S. Fire Administration. a small but important Federal agency within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The USFA was created by Congress in 1974 in response to a report by the Presidents National Commission on Fite Prevention and Control. entitled \"America Burning.\" which presented a dismal assessment of the Nations fare problem. The report found that nearly 12.000 lives were lost to fire yearly in this country. In addition. fire was found to be responsible for more than 300.0 injuries and over 3i million in economic losses. Congress reacted to the report by declaring a Federal role for reducing fire losses and created the USFA and the National Fire Academy. The USFA In currently charged with helping prevent and control firerelated losses through. first. coordination of the Nations fire safety and emergency medical service activities: second. educating the public on fire prevention and control. third. collecting. analyzing and disseminating data related to fire. fourth. promoting the use of sprinkler systems in residential and commercial buildings: fifth. conducting research And development on fire suppression. sixth. promoting fire fighter health and safety. and seventh. coordinating with other agencies charged with emergency response responslbIllties.",

Here all we are really saying is that if one country. in this cae it happens to be Turkey. but It could be any country. accepts U.S. assistance. they have to allow humanitarian assistance that the US. is providing to its neighbor to pass through that first countrys bordera. I cannot imagine anyone. I cannot Imagino any American who would think that it would be possible for a country that receives American assistance to deny safe passage of humanitarian assistance through its borders to another country. I think if we told any of our constituents that the U.S. government allowed that first country to deny access. they would be outraged. Yet not only is that done routinely by Turkey through Its blockade. but when we passed the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. we see year after year the administration coming forward and waiving it and saying. for national security reasons. whatever the reasons they gave. I thought were rather poor. it is OK to waive this Corridor Act and allow Turkey to blockade humanitarian assistance to Armenia It just totally flies in the face of any notion of humanitarian assistance or human rights.",

The reason we are trusted to play the role we play in the world is because we are. yes. we axe concerned and I think perhaps should be even more concerned with our own national interest. but we also are guided by morality. And for us to ignore the strangulation of both economic and humanitarian aid that Turkey is Imposing on Armenia is actually harmful to our national security Interests because it calls into question the foundation. the ideological foundation that allows us to be the only world superpower. Another factor that I think is Important. every time I go back to my district. and I wan just there earlier today. people are concerned with how effectively our money is spent. They are willing to see the U.S. Government do things that are good but only if the money is spent effectively. When we have an international aid program which aids Turkey on the one hand and allows Turkey to prevent the aid program from being effective. when the recipient is also the obstructor. then how do we go back to our districts and say we are paving for air freight Into Yerevan because we cannot truck things through Turkey and at the same time we are spending money to provide aid to Turkey.

Again. if I could Just mention that. and perhaps you would like to comment as well. right now under the Freedom Support Act. section 907. there is no direct assistance to Azerbaljan. no direct U.S. assistance. because they also have a blockade of Armenia. So Armenia Is really effectively blockaded on almost all sides between Turkey and Azerbaijau. However. the U.S. continues to provide humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan through nongovernmental organizations. Unfortunately. none of that assistance goes to NagornoKarabagh. NagornoKarabagh is an Armenian country. between Azerbaljan and Armenia. that fought a war of independence about 5 years ago. successfully. and is In the midst of trying to gain recognition by Azerhaijan and Turkey and other countries of Its existence. And I was there in January at the same time that I went to Armenia.

Our own country was born. perhaps the worlds greatest exercise of the coneept of selfdetermination. our own Declaration of Independence. and we set forth In that declaration some standards that ought to be applied. Because when you render a country apart. when you change borders. the whole world can be affected. We talked about the injustices imposed upon us by King George ITT. But they seem somewhat pale compared to the pogroms. compared to the aggression and the expulsions that the Armenian population of NagornoKarabagh has had to suffer over the last decade. Certainly If we made the case for selfdetermination. NagornoKarabagh has as well. But also the argument for territorial integrity. There are borders and there are borders. The borders of Azerbaijan were drawn by Joseph Stalin for the purpose of dividing the Armenian people and placing NagornoKarabagh not for any logical reason except mischief. except division. except to deliberately cause peoples to be at conflict with each other. If there was ever a border that should not be given a lot of respect by the International community. it is a border drawn by Joseph Stalin for the purpose of oppressing peoples in the Caucasus. And when we weigh territorial Integrity. where the integrity Is a Joseph Stalin border and the right of selldetermination for a people who have sufferod.

Does the subcommittee chairman agree that the purpose of subjecting these funds to the notification procedures is not to prevent funding for these activities notwithstanding any other provision of law. since we could have done that by simply leaving the section as it is. but rather to be sure that the Congress gets the information it requests?",

The Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA). headquartered in Louisville. has responded to international disaster issues in 37 countries and has mission relations in 80 countries. It is dedicated to responding to national and international disasters. aiding refugees and displaced persons. assisting refugee resettlement. educating the worlds children. and making efforts designed to foster development abroad. Clearly. it has made a difference in the world and brought hope to the needy. Just recently. following the tragic bombings in Kenya and Sudan. PDA provided the staff services of its eye clinic and specialized orthopedic rehabilitation center for victims. PDA also worked closely with the Presbyterian Relief and Development Association of Sudan. In early summer. Presbyterian Disaster Assistance. in cooperation with other organizations. was able to provide a shipment of fishing supplies to over 25.000 households in the Upper Nile Region where the ability to fish the rivers will keep these people from slipping into the grip of famine. PDA was able to serve people across several ethnic boundaries. ensuring that this assistance benefited those most in need. Mr. President. I know the entire Senate joins me in saluting the courageous work of Presbyterian Disaster Assist-. ance. It gives me a great deal of pride that this organization which offers such important and valuable service is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Tunisia has been a longtime friend of the United States. Tunisia has. since the beginning of the Peace Process. fully committed itself to this process. which is viewed as the only way to restore peace in the Middle East. They launched the first U.S.-PLO dialogue as well as the first preparatory talks between Israeli and Palestinian leadership in Tunis. Tunisia was the first Arab country to host meetings within the framework of the Peace Process. Furthermore. a trilateral meeting was held in Washington in October 1995 bringing together the three Foreign Ministers of the United States. Israel and Tunisia. followed soon afterwards by another trilateral meeting. in January 1996. in Washington. D.C. A decision was then announced to open. both in Tunis and in Tel Aviv. interest sections in order to encourage the process of normalization between Arab States and Israel. The Tunisians have undertaken these diplomatic initiatives at some level of security risk. Tunisias next door neighbor is Libya. Nevertheless the Tunisians have refused to engage in an arms race. In 1997. they participated in 20 joint military exercises with the U.S. and the European Command.

In my judgment. the events of the past several days make that the Senates number one priority. Following Indias nuclear tests. Pakistan is now preparing for similar tests. North Korea has stated its intention to move forward to develop nuclear weapons and Iran and Iraq are lurking in the background. At a hearing before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday. Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Senate consideration and ratification of the treaty. As you know. the President submitted the treaty to the Senate on September 22. 1997. and the only hearings which have been held were conducted by the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security. Proliferation and Federal Services on October 27. 1997. and March 18. 1998. and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development on October 28. 1997. I noted the comment in your letter to the President on January 21. 1998. that this treaty is very low on the Committees list of priorities. and I also heard your staffer on National Public Radio this week state that the Foreign Relations Committee did not intend to move ahead on the treaty. I am concerned that inaction by the Senate may have led the government of India to think that the United States is indifferent to nuclear testing which. I believe. is definitely not the case. The events of the past several days threaten an international chain reaction on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and an imminent threat to world peace. From comments on the Senate floor and in the cloakroom. I know that many. if not most. of our colleagues share my concern about action on the treaty. I realize that there is some opposition to the treaty. if it is the will of the Senate not to ratify. so be it. but at the very least. the matter should be submitted to the full Senate. Sincerely.",

In fact. it was just last week that the gentleman from New Jersey stood at this podium and could not tell us whether the birth control pill was abortion. In fact. he told us the IUD is abortion. The reality check is. and I will turn to this chart. the reality check is that this is when abortions occur in America: Overwhelmingly early in pregnancy. Now. let us have a compassion check.

I loved them and I cared about them. I love and I care about my children. I love babies. That is not what this is about. This bill is based on a fraud. and the fraud is that this procedure is used frequently late in pregnancies.

The reason Americans are confused about this bill is because people have intentionally tried to confuse them with the notion that somehow women in their 7th. 8th and 9th month of pregnancies are having abortions.

It is not about the women who need the health services so they can bear more children. My good friend and colleague the gentleman from Texas said. \"where is the common decency?\" Well. how is it for common decency when we tell a woman that she is going to lose the ability to bear more children if she cannot have a certain type of procedure?

Hugh has worked long and hard to foster the growth and appreciation of the arts. particularly through his service as a Trustee of the Fords Theatre Society. The Society is the notforprofit organization that brings new musicals. American classics. and other live entertainment to that historic stage. After the assassination of President Lincoln. Fords Theatre was used as an office and warehouse until an act of Congress initiated the Theatres restoration. which was completed in 1968. This years Gala for the President celebrated these 30 years of memorable performances illuminating the character and vibrancy of American life. As a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins. L.L.P.. Hugh McIntosh has guided Fords governing board and staff through legal thickets. including contract negotiations with playwrights and agents. strategic planning. development of ethical guidelines. and daytoday legal questions. Hugh has worked closely with Frankie Hewitt. the Ford Theatre Societys founder and producing artistic director. and with the National Park Service. which administers the Theatre as a public museum. Hugh is a discerning theatergoer. and his love of \"a good show\" has fueled his enthusiasm for contributing backstage at Fords. He is a strong supporter of education and outreach programs that invites a diverse audience to Fords and aim to foster a greater appreciation of the performing arts in the Washington area. But as valuable as Hughs legal expertise has been to Fords Theatre. his greatest contribution has been to bring wisdom. a sense of perspective. and quiet humor to the complex issues facing the Theatres performing artists and playwrights. It is these special qualities. in fact. which will assure Hughs success in the new direction his life is about to take. This fall. Hugh will begin studying theology at the Harvard School of Divinity. If Hugh is called to pastoral service. he may find many friends from Fords Theatre in his pews. At its June meeting. the Ford Theatre Societys Board of Trustees honored Hugh McIntosh with a resolution thanking him for his invaluable service to the Theatre. Mr. President. I ask that the text of this resolution be printed in the RECORD. The text of the resolution follows:",

Don lead a team of dedicated folks that revived Buttes economy after the loss of a major mining company in 1982. After serving ten years in that role. Don left local government to become a leading voice for the private sector. Today. he is President and Chief Executive Officer of MSE. Inc. MSE is now one of Buttes top employers. His company is currently working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on a variety of projects that will help launch the next generation space shuttle and other research projects. The United States Defense Department is also working with MSE to develop technologies for use in pollution control and cleanup. The company is also researching new methods for heavy metal and mine waste remediation projects. I believe that because of Dons tenacity. this kind of cutting edge technology is being tested in Butte. Montana. I also applaud Dons commitment to many other organizations and committees in the mining city. He continues to make a difference through his affiliations with the United Way. Carroll College. St. James Community Hospital. Butte Central Schools. and so many other worthwhile causes. I must also acknowledge Dons wife Cathy and their four grown childrenDon. Jr.. Tracey.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the passing of one of the great leaders of Michigans conservation community. On Saturday. my friend Richard Jameson. the executive director of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs. succumbed to liver cancer. Rick was 48 years old. Rick was an environmentalist and an avid outdoorsman whose roots extended beyond our state. A native of Oklahoma. he received his bachelors and masters degrees in natural resources management from Michigan State University and began working for the Michigan United Conservation Clubs in 1976. Ricks expertise and hard work were quickly recognized and in 1980 he headed back to his home state to serve as executive director of the Oklahoma Wildlife Federation. He continued in that capacity for eight years until 1988. when MUCC was fortunate enough to lure him back to serve as assistant executive director. Rick was a strong and dedicated environmentalist. Among his accomplishments was the passage of Michigans beverage container deposit law. a law which has been widely acknowledged as greatly reducing litter in our state. Rick also played a vital role in providing Michigan voters the opportunity to pass a constitutional amendment that will ensure a constant source of funds for Michigans state parks. Rick was also an avid outdoorsman. Here. too. he achieved important successes. He was instrumental in securing the overwhelming approval of a campaign which will guarantee that Michigan game animals are managed on the basis of sound biological science. He also helped defeat another initiative which would have virtually eliminated bear hunting in the state of Michigan. In short. Mr. President. I believe that Rick Jameson was one of the few individuals who truly understood the importance of both conservation and sportsmans rights. He spent his lifes work protecting both as few others could. And Rick was a fighter. Despite suffering the effects of both his illness and the chemotherapy he was undergoing. Rick continued to work as long as possible. My office consulted with him as recently as last month. soliciting his input on legislation I have drafted and on other bills pending in the Senate. When it came to conservation. hunting and fishing. there was no one in the state whose opinion I trusted more than Ricks. Rick is survived by his wife of 18 years. Robbie. his daughter. Christine. and two brothers. My thoughts and prayers go out to them.e",

Senator MACK and Senator GRAMS. in sponsoring the \"Printed Circuit Investment Act.\" This legislation will remove a significant barrier to technological investment and innovation in this country by updating the tax codes treatment of the electronic interconnection industry. Mr. President. manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies currently must depreciate their production equipment over a 5 years period. Given the speed with which technological advances continue to come in our hightech industry. 5 years is an unreasonable amount of time for depreciation. In effect. the tax code is penalizing these companies for keeping up with their competition in the global marketplace. This not fair. nor is it in accordance with our national interests. In the fastpaced information age in which we live. we cannot afford to hobble our hightech companies with outdated tax policies. This is why I am pleased to support legislation reducing to 3 years the time over which companies in the electronic interconnection industry must depreciate their production equipment. Through this measure we can encourage greater investment among electronic interconnection manufacturers and keep our hightech industry competitive in the global marketplace.

Conservatives. on the other hand. look at all human history and are skeptical of such agreements. instead placing greater faith in a strong and secure defense. Given these two world views. it is time to reexamine our current vulnerability to ballistic missile attack.

GAO found that partLicipating agencies had different Interprorations of what should be Included in their extramural research budgets. This is a problem because a participating agencys extramural budget is the base from which that agencys SHIR funding is calculated. To resolve any discrepancies.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce to my colleagues Reverend Allen Novotny. He is our guest Chaplain today and I hope some of you will take the time to introduce yourself. Fr. Novotny is the President of Gonzaga College High School. a Jestilt high school for boys located only a few blocks away from the Capitol. In 1821. the Jesuits founded Gonzaga which operates in the tradition of teaching and learning established by the founder of the Jesuits. Ignatius of Loyola. Throughout our nations history-- -through the Civil War. the Great Depression. the World Wars. and the civil rights movement. Gonzaga has maintained its commitment to teaching and learning In the heart of Washingtons Innercity. on a street it. shares with leaders of business and government. on a block where it ministers to and comforts the least fortunate of society. It is both Ironic and appropriate that Gonzaga be situated just a few blocks from our nations Capitol Building. Gonzaga. like so much of the United States. is a melting pot. Gonzaga combines the largest minority population of any Jesuit High School in the United States with one of the lowest tuitions in the Washington area. Conz.aga is a realized mission of social and economic diversity that offers all who attend the school a glimpse of the full life spectrum. Gonzaga combines service to the communitytaking the form of service projects both in the U.S. and abroad. studentassisted tutoring for underprivileged children. and an oncampus. studentassisted McKenna Center & Food Wagon homeless shelterwith top academics and athletics. Gonzaga is. in other words. a complete educational experience. I hope my colleagues will take the time to learn more about Conzagas special character. Gonzaga has served the Washington community well and. under the steady leadership of Fr Novotny. I believe it will continue to do so.",

What. are we doing to offset the loss from the special tax preemption provision in this hill? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not a thing. Mr. President. if this speclal provision had been offered on the Senate floor. I would have offered a aeconddegruo amendment requiring us to at least study the broad boopo of the precedent we were setting here before we acted. I ant not sure a great dual of thought has been given to tiu farreaching effect of this one little amendment in the defense authorization hill. It was a special political decision. and that special polil.ical decision will have ripples that will turn into waves In tihe future. Mr. President. had this special provision been offered on the Senate floor. I would have asked for a study. fets think through this one. We are preempting the States. we are telling the States how they can tax and how they cannot tax. This Is not a Federal tax. This is a State tax. I think my colleagues would have been shocked at how broad this precedent is by applying this sweetheart deal at Federal facilities across the country. They would be embarrassed to find out the extLL to which we are meddling in iState tax law matters on a defense authorization billall to create a special State tax status for a select group of Federal and private sector workers.

One of the things my distinguished friend said is that Kentucky provides no facilities. Well. if a person who Is employed at Fort Campbell files for unemployment benefits in Tennessee. guess who pays for It. Guess who pays for it. Kentucky reimburses Tennessee. Isnt that a service? 7 heard talk about other States. Lets talk about our Statesthe roads that enter at the nearest gate. Sure. we have electrical service that Is provided. That comes out of Kentucky Into Fort Campbell. We have cooperative fire suppression. If they say it Is serious. both Tennessee and Kentucky would be there. Unemployment benefits-!T am surprised the Senator would say that we dont pay anything. We reimburse Tennessee for the unemployment. Kentucky pays. He raised the fact that the Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on this but the Finance Committee did not. When did the Governmental Affairs Committee take over for the Finance Committee? The Senator has talked about Oregon quite a bit. [ have a copy of a letter to the Senator. written from the director of the Department of Revenue. saying that they settled their own problem. that Oregon passed their bill and thre States worked it out. There is no need for them to be included in this legislation. Here is the letter. dated October 21. 1997.
