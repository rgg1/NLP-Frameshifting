    "speech": "As the chief judge and the clerk of the court of the gentleman from New Jersey say. this bill does not do what the gentleman wants. I am sure that most of us in this room want to have the finest Federal jury system that there can be. and we are willing to go along with a proper revision of the system if it is needed. Why did the authors of this proposal. the folks who wrote it down in the Justice Department. not first. at least. telephone Chief Judge McGuire in the District of Columbia? That would not have cost the Government a penny. Why did they not ask him if he would look at what they were doing? Chief Judge McGuire and Judge Holtzoff take the position that this bill is totally unworkable here. I am not here to wave any flags. I am merely saying that we had better be careful of what we are doing. Why is the Justice Department so anxious to do something about the Federal jury system? As I remember the last report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation it was said that in 95 percent of the cases they had submitted to juries in the Federal system they had obtained convictions. I have not noticed that the Federal authorities are losing many civil actions in the Federal courts in my area. What is the reason for destroying the system which is working and which is understood. for something which has not been studied by people of competence? My statement is not hostile. I believe. to what the gentleman from New Jersey. the gentleman from Colorado. and others would like to see. I just say that unless this amendment is adopted we are going to have here a statute which the combined wisdom of the judiciary of the U.S. federal system says will not work.",

We are not told the opinion of the balance of the judges. But. beyond this. the opinions expressed by these 25 judges were addressed to a bill entirely different than the bill now pending before us. Mr. Chairman. I can well understand how these 25 judges do not want anyone to poach upon their preserve. These judges are very jealous of their powers. They want to exercise control over everything and anything that happens to be in their court. But. Mr. Chairman. Congress is duty bound to legislate on this matter. Throughout our judicial history and ever since we passed the Judiciary Act of 1789. we have legislated time and again on the question of jury qualifications and selection. Mr. Chairman. why should we now throw up the white flag and surrender to the Judicial Conference? Now. as the gentleman from New Jersey said-",

Mr. Chairman. beyond that. the gentleman from North Carolina has always complained that the judiciary and. particularly. the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. who is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference. is constantly legislating. But. now. the gentleman from North Carolina throws into Chief Justices lap the power to legislate. The gentleman just abets what he condemns. Mr. Chairman. that is a rather broad inconsistency. Mr. Chairman. I would say. with all due respect to the gentleman from North Carolina. that this involves a delay of 2 years. because the gentlemans amendment is to the effect that the Judicial Conference shall report back within not later than 2 years after the enactment of title I. Mr. Chairman. why should we delay this matter? It is crystal clear. It is palpably plain that there are all manner and kinds of diverse systems being used throughout the various 90 districts. A jury commissioner can select men in the community to whom he says. \"Give me the names of a number of men whom you believe to be suitable for jury duty.\" Well. Mr. Chairman. this is the socalled keyman system. the social lines. cultural lines. of the jury commissioner. They cannot possibly involve a broad crosssection of the community. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. there are all manners and kinds of diversities today in the Federal system in connection with the qualification and the selection of jury men. Mr. Chairman. that fact was pointed out. for example. in the Rabinowitz case. coming out of the fifth circuit. to which the gentleman from Colorado referred.

After you select \"at random from the voter registration lists\" the names of persons residing in the district. it is conceivable that the 1% of the total number of registered voters so selected might come from one particular area of the district. In a district as large as ours with residential areas ranging from poor to very rich. the 1% might represent the rich area or the poor area.

AssURANcE ENOUGH If anyone requires further proof of the wanton disregard of all principles of morality by the Vietcong terrorists. they need only recognize the execution of U.S. Army Sgt.

They are in effect. saying. \"This is what we believe.\" When the bombs exploded in the Saigon restaurant--hardly a military objective. which the Hanoi radio proudly confirmedkilling and wounding more than a hundred men. women. and children. they told us again. \"This is what we believe.\" Behind that simple statement and the two latest acts of savagery lies the inescapable and deadly truth about the enemy in Vietnam. They hold nothing sacred except the will to win. We have met this breed before. Certainly well be hearing from the selfappointed getoutofVietnam magistrates that these are only acts of desperate men eager for selfgovernment. Their thinking has as much reasoning behind it as the statements of justifiable revenge coming from Hanoi. Weve had assurance enough just what kind of government the South Vietnamese would be forced to endure under the direction of the Red comrades. A Look Ahead",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to address this body today on the topic of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the United Nations. Today. more than ever. we see the critical importance of this international body as the development of nuclear weaponry proliferates. We see how the complexion of international diplomacy has changed since the time when the German strategist von Clauswitz stated that war is but an extension of diplomacy. The United Nations has served a vital function during the years since it was set up at the Dumbarton Conference following World War II. It has sent peace forces into Korea. Yemen. the Congo (Lopoldville) and the Sinai Peninsula. Currently. the United Nations is maintaining a precarious peace in Cyprus between the Turkish and Greek communities. These forces have been able to take the heat out of strained situations and give nations some time to cool off before bringing them to the conference table. In the field of technical and economic assistance. the United Nations has perhaps served its most vital role. By giving help and advice to the developing nations. the United Nations has helped to make these states more economically viable. The work of Paul Hoffman. Managing Director of the Special Fund. has been invaluable in this regard and is worthy of the greatest praise. The Economic and Social Council. the Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional economic organizations of the United Nations have been the sustaining framework for the poorer nations of the world. Mr. Speaker. today the weaponry of this world includes not only arrows and axes and gunpowder but also the hydrogen bomb. We have enough weapons today for the first time in history to eradicate human life on this planet. The question thus becomes not one of the need for a United Nations but how to increase its effectiveness. Only through a worldwide effort can we ever hope to avoid the ultimate holocaust. If in 1995 we do not celebrate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. it Is highly likely that there will not be anyone left to celebrate anything on earth. Vietnam BackgroundI",

The principal reform called for in the Celler bill and my companion bill. H.R. 2856. is the elimination of the nationalorigins quota system over a 5year period. Over the years. Congress has recognized the injustice caused by the present system and has enacted special legislation and private bills to remedy specific cases. The proposed bill would substantially reduce the number of private immigration bills introduced each year for the relief of individuals. By way of example. in the last four Congresses 14.672 such bills were introduced and 2.155 were enacted.

There are many conflicting interests that have been brought to bear on the coinage issue. but the overriding interest. which must guide the action that will be taken by this Congress in establishing a new coinage system for this country. must be the national interest. That interest will only be served by a new system of coins that will fulfill their primary functionthat of a circulating medium of exchangeand assure the smoothest and least disruptive transition from our present coins to the new coins. That interest calls for more than a compromise proposal.

The proposed amendment was received by the Joint Committee on August 23. 1966. Yesterday I informed this body of a proposed agreement for cooperation with Sweden and a proposed amendment to the agreement for cooperation with Israel previously received by the Joint Committee.

The proposed agreement with Sweden and the proposed amendments to the agreements With Israel and China will be the subject of a subcommittee public hearing scheduled for Thursday. August 25. 1966. The proposed amendment to the agreement for cooperation with the Republic of China would increase to 8 kilograms the quantity of uranium 235 which may be transferred to the Republic of China for fueling of research reactors. The amendment would also reflect changes in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 permitting private ownership of special nuclear materials by enabling private parties in the United States and the Republic of China to be parties to arrangements for the transfer of special nuclear material. Special nuclear material transferred under the existing agreement and under the amended agreement will be covered by safeguards administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Section 123(c) of the act requires that the proposed amendment lie before the Joint Committee for a period of 30 days while Congress is in session before becoming effective.

After the awarding of the first contract on a 6monthconstructiontime basis. in the face of the warning to the General Services Administration by the other contractors that the contract coq ld not be completed within 6 months. we find that they were right. The contract on the substructure was not completed on April 1. I point out thatf those contractors were right in their warnings that it would be physically impossible to do so. the contract was not completed in 6 months. Quite to the contrary. it ran over about 75 .days. Instead of being completed in 6 months. or April 1. as originally bid. the work was not completed until June 17 of this year. T*herefore. the penalty clause In the contract should be effective. If the General Services Administration enforces this contract. it should collect from McCloskey a..penalty of between $200.000 to $300.000. I have been advised that they. have been negotiating on this point. but the understanding is .that the penalty may iot be enforced. Why? Other contractors were bound by these rules. This first contract had been awarded on the basis that the construction would be completed within 6 months from October 1. 1965. As the result now.stands with the change orders allowed. unless this penalty is strictly enforced. it will mean the contract was not awarded to the lowest bidder. since It was not completed on time. Mr. Knott has already said .he saw no reason for complaint for this overrunning. This was a most generous gesture. but unless this rule is enforced. I will expect an explanation. The Wall Street Journal has referred to it as a competitivenegotiated bid authorized by the Treasury Department. and said the rush was because it was so important that the construction be completed at an early date. If that is true. I am sure the Administration will be diligent in assessing the penaltyof $3.500 a day as provided by the penalty clause for McCloskeys failure to complete the contract by April 1 as agreed. This penalty August 24. .1966 for each days delay should be collected from the McCloskey Co. I will be following their efforts to see just how much is actually collected. Mr. President.

Food accounted for only onequarter of the rise. This last sentence. Mr. President. is a point that should set the record straight. You and I have known all along that farm prices are not causing the terrible Inflation gripping this Nation. Now.

Mrs. Stevens has been a shining example of the private citizen who. with idealism and determination. can directly shape Federal legislation and substantially add meaning to our democratic political process. We. as a nation. owe much to Mrs. Stevens as a champion of a just cause. Because of her. human decency. a fastdisappearing quality today. has become a requirement of law in animal treatment.

I read with interest the speech of the gentleman of yesterday in opposition to title II as presently drafted where he said that title II would \"create a Federal Lord Mayor over our cities. telling them what must be done on a local level.\" The gentleman was particularly bothered by the language on page 55 of the bill which would grant broad powers to the Secretary of HUD to determine whether metropolitanwide planning agencies had sufficient control over local zoning ordinances. But his amendment in no way would cure the situation. All his amendment would do would be to make eligible several metropolitan areas that would be prohibited from participating in the program because they lack local zoning ordinances. But listen to what the amendment of the gentleman from Texas would permit: Secretary Weaver would still have vast control over metropolitan planning. He would have control over both the location and the scheduling of all public facility projects in that metropolitan area. even those projects which are being built without Federal aid. As Secretary Weaver himself testified on page 53 of the printed hearings. the Casey amendment would still permit Secretary Weaver to have broad discretionary controls over metropolitanwide education facilities. The Casey amendment would still permit Secretary Weaver to seek establishment of metrowide zoning controls as a prerequisite to Federal aid. I can well understand why the gentleman is upset by title II and I commend him for calling the attention of the House to the huge power grab by the Department of HUD over purely local matters. such as zoning. land use patterns. subdivision regulations. as well as the location and scheduling of all public facility projects within a metropolitan area. It makes little difference to me whether or not the House accepts or rejects this amendment. because the amendment would change nothing. It would merely permit the Secretary of HUD to hold a club over the heads of more metropolitan areas than the bill before us would permit. Nevertheless because acceptance of this amendment might further confuse the House. I urge that it be rejected.",

The committee is convinced that unless there is a substantial change In the general economic condition of the Nation. construction costs will continue to Increase about the same rate during the forseeable future. Inflation is the very thing that is cutting back on our ability to build the highways and has brought about the picture that the committee further reports to us on page 18. that we are now about $6 billion shy in the trust fund. and unless my committee. the Committee on Ways and Means. comes forward with increased taxes. we are going to have to stretch the highway program itself out until 1975. So these are pertinent arguments. not narrow partisan political arguments. and I do hope that the Committee will view it in the light of those arguments.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. since the gentleman mentioned my name. I move to strike the requisite number of words. I do not intend to take the full 5 minutes. but I will say to the gentleman that I believe in view of his statements the record ought to be clarified. First. the striking of this section 8 on page 15 will not scuttle the program. because we do not have to authorize until 1967. which is next year. and it will not scuttle the program. Secondly. the basic reason for even considering putting any authorization in was to try to make certain that money would not come In the future out of the trust fund. That language is not affected in any way by the amendment of the gentleman from New Hampshire . Those provisions were drafted to make certain beautification or safety will not come out of the trust fund and they appear in other sections. That remains in the language of the bill and is not stricken by the amendment of the gentleman. So that basic justification for putting any money in is not affected by the gentlemans amendment. Those restrictions remain in if any money is going to be used for beautification after 1967. . I call attention to the fact that the 1966 and 1967 authorizations were approved last year in the substantive language of the basic act. So we are discussing in this legislation the authorizations for the years 1968 and 1969. The amendment of the gentleman does not. in my opinion. do destructive damage to the beautification program. Basically the problem I have with regard to the figures contained in the specific authorizations in the bill is that we have no testimony whatsoever on the record of our hearings as to how much money it would take in 1968 to. first. take care of the billboards. seend. take care of the junkyards. and third. provide for general beautification purposes. So I say it is not imprudent at all to consider next year how much money should go in. in the form of specific authorization. because I challenge anyone to showyes. the gentleman who just rose. Mr. SWEENEYwhere in the record it shows how much money is going to be needed. Where did the $80 million figure come from in the record? Where is the amount of money? I asked the question.

I rise in support of this amendment and I had fully intended to file supplemental views to the committee report on this bill setting forth my objections to this particular provision in an otherwise very fine piece of legislation. However. as my colleagues know. I was granted an official leave of absence because of serious illness in my family and therefore was precluded from filing my objections. In this particular provision. while the concept of beautifying our highways is a worthy one. it is certainly an untimely approach to alleviating the problem. As others have pointed out. the fiscal policies of this Government have contributed to the continual increase in the cost of living for all Americans and. until and unless this Government reduces its unnecessary spending on untimely domestic programs. I feel that the cost of living will continue to rise. The President has. from time to time. reprimanded the Congress for exceeding. his budgetary requests and as a matter of fact did not request the sum set forth in this legislation for highway beautification. This provision in the bill authorizes the expenditure of some $493 million and begins with fiscal 1968. We have ample time next year to review this program and make a reasonable authorization if conditions warrant at that time. One of the principal causes for the continuing increase in interest rates is the fact that the Federal Government has no money of its own with which to pay for this largesse and. therefore. must compete in the commercial market for money. This has driven the cost of borrowing money to an alltime high and has also created a lack of available funds. The results of this activity are reflected in the many problems the people of America. the small businessmen. and the homebuilders. are encountering in trying to find adequate funds with which to meet their current needs. For this and many other reasons. Mr. Chairman. I believe the amendment should be adopted and the Committee should take another look at this particular program next year.

Hundreds of my constituents have written and spoken to me about the plan of the Post Office Department to truck the mail into northern Vermont. They are opposed to this plan. because of the hardships that would result from the loss of employment by several employees. and the resultant curtailment of passenger service. The feeling that this plan would be a detriment to the economy of the area and to the efficiency of the mail is reflected in the recent action of the General Assembly of the State of Vermont in unanimously adopting Joint Senate Resolution 12. I congratulate the general assembly. and hope this expression of sentiment will help alert the Senate to the feelings of Vermonters on the proposal of the Post Office Department. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the Vermont General Assemblys Joint Senate Resolution 12.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. for many years I have been Increasingly concerned about the expanding role of Government competition with private enterprise. In an attempt to prevent the Government from engaging In any activities with private business. I have Introduced in this and in past Congresses legislation designed to get the Government out of many business activities and to keep it out. My bill would establish a carefully framed policy to phase out gradually and terminate existing Federal activities which compete with the free enterprise system. Unfortunately. the administration. rather than ending programs which compete with free enterprise. on balance. the competition is being sharply Increased. It is my feeling that it is both unfair and unjust for the Federal Government to compel private companies to pay taxes that subsidize Federal competitors against themselves and perhaps put them out of business. Because of the opposition of the administration of this proposal. hearings have never been held on the subject and copsequently the bill has died with each ending of a congressional session. Mr. President. once again I urge that immediate hearings be held on my proposal so that the bill can start through the legislative mill. Recently Alan Otten. the wellknown Washington reporter for the Wall Street Journal. analyzed the subject quite succinctly. He pointed out that the drive to cut rivalry with the Government and business is making little headway.

Senator ROBERTSON. is making a speech today before the New York Chamber of Commerce on the subject of the Bank Merger Act. In his speech. Senator ROBERTSON discusses the importance of banks and the banking system to industry and commerce generally. He discusses the dual banking system and the importance of competition and regulation in the field of banking. He discusses the background of the Bank Merger Act of 1960. and the decision the Congress made at that time to handle bank mergers under general all around factors. rather than under the strictly competitive standards of the Clayton Act. and he concludes by discussing some of the problems which would be raised by breaking up the many banks which have merged under the Bank Merger Act and in the years preceding the enactment of that statute. As you know. Senator ROBERTSON has introduced a bill. S. 1698. to correct this situation by making the approval of a merger under the Bank Merger Act final and conclusive and not subject to later attack under the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Senator ROBERTSON has announced that hearings on his bill will begin May 19. 1965.

I am very happy to have introduced a similar resolution in this Congress. The gentleman from Indiana. who has been here for a long time and has been witness to some of the forward movements that have been made in the past in the procedures and organization of the Congress. has certainly expressed the viewpoint which I have heard personally from the senior Senator from Oklahoma on several occasions with regard to this measure. The Senator from Oklahoma was very emphatic in his understanding that testimony and views and ideas could be received by this joint committee and it could act as an educational forum on practically the entire field that concerns our good friend from Wisconsin. The only limitation that is present in this particular resolution with regard to the joint committee is that the joint committee is not chartered to make recommendations on these particular matters that affect rules and parliamentary procedure and practices and/or precedents. But as was pointed out in the debate in the other body the other day. so many of these things involve matters of heart rather than matters of head and when you move over into the area of attempting to reach a consensus which is almost imperative in a study of this kind. when you move into this area of matters of the heart on questions of seniority and rules that affect seniority. you get into a trouble zone indeed in trying to reach recommendations. I think the experience of the LaFolletteMonroney committee is the best map we have to follow in trying to make this a constructive undertaking.

It is the first necessary step to further democratize our legislative processes. Like others who have expressed themselves today.

Not since 1946 when we had the La FolletteMonroney Act did we have an overhaul in 60 years. And everyone agrees that it accomplished a great deal. But that was almost 20 years ago. Since then we have witnessed the development of complex national and world problems unknown even 5 years ago. As one of the three branches of government constitutionally responsible for passing judgment on the most crucial issues. all of wide variety. the legislature has the obligation to equip itself to effectively fulfill its task. Mr. Speaker. it is imperative that we have a modernization of our processes. a meaningful reorganization. From all quarters of the Nation. from every field of endeavor. the call for reform has steadily grown. I trust this resolution will provide the firm foundation for such reform. I feel it will.

From a background of eight terms in the House. it is obvious to me that the work of Congress could be conducted in a very much shorter period of time. thus allowing Members of Congress to spend more time in their districts and States. which certainly would be in the interest of greater democracy. A Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress would undoubtedly show that if Congress operated on a better schedule that more democratic representative government would result. Members would have more time to mingle with their constituents. They would also have time to plan for a vacation with their familiesfor the last several years a rarity in Congress. While we make speeches and preach that parental influence and concern would help our growing problem of juvenile delinquency. we are flagrant violators of what we preach. J. Edgar Hoover reported this week that the juvenile delinquency rate was up 13 percent in 1964 over 1963. The machinery of Congress should allow Congressmen time to have vacations with their families so we can practice what we preach. Further. there are many things that are done by Congress which may have made sense in the early days of Congress. but make very little sense now. For example. the rule requiring a person to be present when his name is called during the rollcall the first or second time when there is in fact a third time available to all others. He cannot vote unless he qualifies by being present during one of the first two times the roll is called. As far as I can see. this serves no modem purpose and it should be abolished.

During the 20 years that have passed since we in Congress last took a good look at ourselves the Federal budget has skyrocketed. our population has increased by more than 35 percent. or some 50 million. and Americas gross national product has increased almost threefold. \"Atomic energy\" and \"space\" are now household words and the world problems of today are unlike anything in our previous history.

Certainly. it is true that conditions no longer obtain today that existed at the time NATO was established. when there was imminent danger of Russia marching across Europe. That situation no longer exists. It is also true that the other countries of Europe in NATO have fully recovered from the damage inflicted on them during World War II. and are in a much better position to defend themselves at this time than they were then. should such defense be necessary. In any event. the United States has effectively demonstrated its ability to airlift troops and could do it again if necessary. So instead of constantly criticizing President de Gaulle for what he considers to be desirable programs in the interest of France. which is his primary concern and responsibility. perhaps we should be grateful for his opening up this whole question. and leading us into a more uptodate realistic policy. and opening the way to lessening our heavy financial commitment abroad which should be borne by others if needed.",

Yet it seems to me that the whole justification for the cutback proposal is that priority must be given to children who cannot afford to buy their own milk at school. The Department of Agriculture. of course. feels it is highly unlikely that the entire $21 million would go to children in schools without a lunch program. Let us look at the figures. The Department estimates that $10 million can provide a school milk subsidy for 2 million children at schools without a lunch program of any kind. Yet the Department. itself. estimates that 9.277.000 children would attend such schools. Even assuming that half of these children were in rural areas without a readily accessible supply of fluid milk. we would still find more than 41/2 million children who could qualify to receive first priority on milk under the Child Nutrition Act. These children would more than account for the $21 million the act would provide.",

The people of Odessa are making extensive plans to put this facility to many creative uses. This increased activity in the arts is a good example of how sound governmental support can motivate latent interest and initiate a reaction which. through the real interest of the people. results in developments of far greater magnitude than can be accounted for by the governmental support alone. This. I believe. will be increasingly true of the arts as time goes by. The work of the National Endowment for the Arts. I predict. will help create a new environment in which the arts in America will flourish. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Taubmans article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. my amendment is designed to simplify procedures for taxpayers. The amendment is essentially a very simple one. It merely provides that when the amount due or the overpayment of tax is $5 or less. taxpayers at their option may skip payment or not claim a refund. This amendment should have the effect of encouraging taxpayers either by withholding or by declaration payment to make sure that the withheld amount comes within $5 of their tax liability as shown on their return. If they do this. they can ignore the balance due and will not have to write a check for the balance. The significance of this is indicated by the fact that under Treasury Department estimates with respect to the new withholding procedures. it is believed that 20 million taxpayers will have within $10 of the correct amount of tax accounted for by the new graduated withholding system. To the extent that these amounts are within $5 of the amount due. taxpayers will find It unnecessary to write a check at all when they file their income tax return. Thus. for these taxpayers the withholding system will account for the payment of their entire tax liability. In addition. there will be other taxpayers who. by declaration payment either supplementing withholding or in addition to it. will also find that they need to make no payment at the time they file their final tax return. I hope that the amendment might be considered in conference. The amendment. if adopted. would save 10 million taxpayers a great amount of bookkeeping.

I suggest that that would wipe out all of the revenue that can be extended in the event that the Vietnam war continues for 8 or 10 years. as some people fear. There is only about $1.200 million of revenue that can be extended or continued in the event it is found necessary. This is the type of measure that at best might be considered at a time when we have a budgetary surplus and no period of inflation. at a time when the Nation is in good condition. However. at the present time. I would say that before we start thinking in those terms. it might be well to determine whether the $10.000 of socalled war risk which we provide for these boys who lose their lives is adequate. or whether the veterans benefits provided for boys who lose their eyes or legs while fighting for their country is adequate. We should consider those things before we start to provide a completely unnecessary and unneeded benefit for those who are able to provide these things for themselves. In the last analysis. I believe the Senator would agree that. even though $7.500 or $8.000 is not a great amount of money. it would not be asking much to ask a family to pay some interest on money in order to put a boy through school at a time when other boys are making sacrifices far beyond what that boy is expected to make today.",

It is a significant commemoration. not only because it marks the anniversary of one of a long series of persecutions inflicted on the Jewish people. but also because it marks the valiant stand of the Jews in the face of religious discriminations. cultural repressions. physical tortures. and even the horrors of attempted genocide. Purim celebrates the deliverance of the Jews of Persia from a plot to destroy them. The book of Esther relates that Haman. a close adviser of King Ahaseurus. convinced the King to designate a date on which all Jews would be killed for allegedly being unfaithful to the state. Ahaseurus Queen was Esther. a Jewess who had concealed her religion when she married. When she learned of Hamans plot. she told Ahaseurus that she was Jewish and that she would join her people to die with them if he signed the decree. Ahaseurus instead ordered his adviser. Haman. to be killed. On February 4. 1965. I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 177 to express the sense of the Congress against the persecution of persons by Soviet Russia because of their religion. It is public knowledge that Soviet Russia has prevented the Jews behind the Iron Curtain from participating in the traditions and institutions which have long been an integral part of Judaism. During the Purim observance it is fitting for us to join together in renewing our efforts to insure religious freedom for the Jews. and indeed for all peoples. who wish only to practice their faith without interference and harassment from more powerful neighbors. Passage of House Concurrent Resolution 177 and similar legislation would be tangible evidence of our intentions and would reaffirm to the Soviets and to all nations our belief that mankind the world over has the inherent and inalienable right to be free from tyranny and oppression.

On two occasions. first on February 1. 1965. and again an January 20. 1966. President Johnson urged the Congress to approve a constitutional amendment abolishing the electoral college. The draft of a proposed electoral reform amendment. which the President sent to the Congress last year. has been introduced in the Senate as Senate Joint Resolution 58 and in the House of Representatives as House Joint Resolution The Senate subcommittee began hearings a week ago but. as it happens. I was the first witness to testify in support of the basic approach to electoral college reform as incorporated in the Presidents proposal. In most respects. I think this proposal is a sound and realistic one. However. as I pointed out in my prepared statement to the Senate subcommittee. I feel that there is room for improvement.

I am not a producer or consumer of tobacco. but I represent more than 2.000 tobacco farmers who earn most of their cash income from the sale of tobacco. People will continue to consume tobacco products. and will continue to do so regardless of what is done on the floor of this House today. The amendment is wrong in principle and is discriminatory against one class of farmers. If we are going to penalize the tobacco farmers. then we perhaps should penalize and help destroy other segments of our economy. I agree that use of tobacco is a very complex subject to evaluate. One can secure a professional opinion that the use of tobacco is harmful. and at the same time obtain professional advice disclaiming such opinions. Research is now underway. and a Tobacco Research Laboratory has been established. The tobacco industry has shown good faith. and we should not be too eager to destroy an $8 billion industry in the United States. I further agree that if this amendment is adopted it would certainly not cause a decrease in the use of tobacco or related products. because the amendment does not curtail the production. marketing. or sale of tobacco.

H.R. 706 has two general purposes: First. To eliminate the large backlog of undecided claims of railway employees pending before the National Railway Adjustment Board. Second. To provide equal opportunity for judicial review of awards of the National Railway Adjustment Board to employees and employers. The backlog of undecided claims frequently has grown from a procedure under the act of 1934 that calls for both the carrier and the employee to agree on the establishment of special boards of adjustment to settle cases. The present bill. H.R. 706. would change this so that either management or labor may demand at any time the establishment of a special board on the properties of the carrier affected. Also. under the 1934 act. in cases where the carrier refuses to pay an award made to the employee by the Adjustment Board. the employee is forced to go to court and try his case again. There is no means specified in the act. other than resort to the courts. whereby any award of the Board to the employee may be enforced. If the employee fails to receive an award in his favor. there is no means by which judicial review may be obtained. The present bill would change this so that all awards of the National Railway Adjustment Board would be final and binding on both parties. Judicial review is provided either party If they can prove fraud. corruption. or that the Board went beyond its jurisdiction In handling the case.

But there is another aspect of the present operation that I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues that also accounts for the delay in handling these cases to a conclusionand that is the fact that all awards of the National Railroad Adjustment Board are final and binding except those involving money. Under the preseht arrangement a railroad carrier can refuse to abide by an award of the Board If it involves the payment of money. t Ironically if an employees case in a claiminvolving money is denied by the Board. the employee has no further recourse. he must accept the denial. But a railroad carrier has \"the right to refuse to pay a money award. thereby forcing theemployee. if he is still Interested. tb file a lawsuit in a Federal district court and have his case tried all over again. This is a burdensofe\" procedure for~ the average railroad employee. Mr. Chairman. since he usually: does not have the financial wherewithal to process a lawsuit. If he does choose to incur this expense. he is faced with the additional delay of a court trying the case again from the beginning. And this may not be the end of the line yet. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chairman. for a type of case that is initially filed with the National Railroad Adjustment Board as a minor dispute over an employees grievance on one rail carrier. I stand in support of H.R. 706 since it will eliminate this oddity in the present setup by making all awards of the Board final and binding. including the money awards. Mr. Chairman. I submit there is no other just alternative to this proposal. and I urge its favorable consideration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to urge my colleagues to act favorably on H.R. 706 to amend the Railway Labor Act. This legislation is designed to eliminate the huge backlog of undecided employee grievance claims now pending at the National Railroad Adjustment Board in Chicago. I was distressed to learn from reading the hearings held during the 1st session of the 89th Congress and the report of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce that the jam at the Board has reached thousands of cases. I note particularly that division 1. which handles the claims of all ontrain railroad employees. is .approximately 4.000 behind in its work. The figures contained in the committees report indicate that at the present rate of deciding claims. it would require more than 30 years of the Boards time to clear up this backlog. provided no additional cases were submitted. Mr. Chairman. we often say that \"the wheels of the gods grind slowly but they grind exceedingly fine\"-but as far as the National Railroad Adjustment Board is concerned. they have come to a halt. In my opinion. Mr. Chairman. the enactment of H.R. 706 is an act of simple justice to correct a situation which has been permitted to grow too bad for too long. The provision in this legislation for the establishment of special -boards of adjustment. upon the request of either management or labor. is a fair and sensible way of attacking this problem. and I would like to urge my colleagues to enact this worthy item of legislation without delay. I am pleased to lend my support to the unanimous views of the committee as set forth in Report No. 1114.",

I would like to ask the indulgence of the House today to listen to an editorial by WSPDTV of Toledo. Ohio. dated January 25. 1966. on this subject. The editorial is as follows: Far too often. in our opinion. stories crop up concerning apparent delays over foulups in supplying American fighting men In Vietnam. Several weeks ago we reported the exchange of correspondence a woman In Wayne. Ohio. carried on with Federal representatives. concerning alleged faulty combat equipment. Before that we checked into an Associated Press report listing other equipment shortcomingsand got a debatable \"white paper\" from the Defense Department claiming the allegations just werent so. Now. our attentions been called by local businessmen to still another item in this same vein. Recently. a young signal company repairman with the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam wrote an earnest plea to a Toledo manufacturer asking if it could please rush him 40 parts for generators needed to supply communications for an emergency field hospital. The young soldier explained that if he had to go through routine Army channels hed have to wait 90 days or more. whereas he felt the Toledo manufacturer could get the parts to him in about 5 days. Needless to say. the parts requested were shipped to him immediately and without charge. Shortly thereafter the soldier wrote his thanks. And this was followed by a note of appreciation from the young mans commanding officera note that verified the serious nature of his units supply problem and concluded with the words. \"your (parts) were a lifesaver.\" It is. we think. a sad state of affairs when an American soldier is placed In a position where he feels compelled to correspond with a private manufacturer. offer to foot the bill himself. so he can quickly get the material his unit requires to sustain its war mission. The frequency of these reports. the redtape and foulups they suggest or reflect. are worthy of a long. hard congressional look at the workings of our Nations supply line to the men at the front. A full revelation on this score would be interesting as well as generally constructive. Mr. Speaker. that is the end of the editorial.",

This situation means that there is considerable strain on private industry seeking to attract and retain skilled workers.

It has come to my attention that the Internal Revenue Service has proposed that expenses incurred by teachers obtaining advanced degrees will no longer be tax deductible. a policy that will work a definite hardship on our teachers. since most State and local governments are encouraging. if not requiring. teachers to obtain additional training. In my opinion. if we are going to encourage better education through Federal action in many areas. it seems incomprehensible that we should neglect this simple device of tax deductions which can be accomplished through a clearer interpretation of existing law. I am sure we will all agree that teachers should be encouraged to increase their knowledge and training. We would all agree as to the importance of competent and welltrained teachers in our educational system. We would also agree that teachers should be given every incentive to gain new knowledge of teaching techniques. Certainly. one way we can do all of these things is by clarifying the Internal Revenue laws and regulations so that teachers will. by law. not regulation. be permitted to deduct from their gross income any proper expenses for educational purposes relating to teaching activities. I have been requested to support such legislation by Mr. Walter Egan. assistant superintendent of curricular services. Sonoma County Schools. Santa Rosa. Calif. I have reviewed H.R. 17757 introduced by my colleague. Congressman WILLIAM CRAMER. and find myself totally in accord with its provisions.

Since I believe this article might well be studied by every Member of Congress. I have asked unanimous consent that it be reprinted at the conclusion of my remarks. It should be noted that industrypackagers and their suppliershas already expressed its willingness to clarify any potential areas of consumer deception. This is most evident in the new model State regulation. which was developed by the National Conference on Weights and Measures with the full and enthusiastic participation of the packaging field. This regulation. which is in force in many States and therefore is binding on any packager which deals in interstate commerce. constitutes the first nationally uniform and nationally enforceable definition of \"clear and conspicuous\" labeling.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday I introduced a bill which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow teachers in our schools and colleges to deduct those educational expenses which they incur in increasing their skills as educators from their gross income for tax purposes. Though the IRS has had an official policy of permitting these expenses when necessary. they have in the past been arbitrary in their actual treatment of teachers returns and the variety of interpretations of the policy has meant that there was much confusion and that individual agents were making educational policy. In order to reduce this confusion. on July 8 of this year the IRS published a proposed regulation which would have the practical effect of making the educational expenses of teachers nondeductible. It is for this reason that I have introduced a bill identical to that of the gentleman from California. the Honorable CECIL IING. the respected ranking majority member of the House Committee on Ways and Means. I feel that only in this way can I adequately express my strong support for this important legislation. Today we are facing an educational revolution. in which we must educate record numbers of young people in an increasingly complex technology and civilization. If our youngsters are to receive the education which is their birthright. the one essential is dedicated. competent teachers who are ever alive to new techniques and fresh material in teaching those whom we entrust to their care. How shortsighted. then. of the IRS to draft regulations which actively discourage teachers from obtaining the additional knowledge and skills which are so necessary if we are to maintain our educational excellence. It is not. as if. Mr. Speaker. teachers were a highly paid or underworked profession. We all know that though salaries have increased in the last few years. they still do not adequately compensate teachers for their time and skills. This makes the action of the IRS doubly unfair. in penalizing teachers and not treating them equitably in comparison with other. more lucrative professions. I think that there is no question that this legislation which I have introduced should be passed immediately. so that the teaching profession may be protected by law and that every encouragement may be given to those who would devote their time to the professional improvement which insures that they will be the kind of teachers whom American children deserve.",

Unfortunately. while the Congress and Nation have been moving forward in this field the Internal Revenue seems to be moving in reverse. I refer to the indications given recently by the IRS that it will change certain tax regulations it has followed with regard to the deductibility of certain educational expenses accrued by teachers in pursuit of academic courses for academic credit and degrees in institutions of higher education and for travel thereto and return. Until July 7 of this year these expenses were deductible. Now the IRS has drawn new regulations revoking this deduction. The new regulations are scheduled to go into effect January 1967. More important to our teachers today than ever before is the need to fulfill their need for advanced training. Our store of knowledge is increasing at a pace which defies assimilation today and promises to increase even more rapidly in the future. There are not only new fields of learning today but constantly altering methods of teaching existing subjects. Therefore I am joining with my colleague. CECIL KING. of the Ways and Means Committee. in sponsoring a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to allow teachers to deduct from gross income. the expenses incurred in pursuing courses for academic credit and degrees at institutions of higher education. and including travel.",

For many years the Federal Government has carried on many lending programs to finance essential activities. These loan programs have been financed by direct appropriations. We are all familiar with the various Federal credit programs to help the farmer. the businessman. the homebuyer. the veteran. students in college. and others through Federal loan programs. These loan programs currently exceed $33 billion. What we are attempting to do here is to sell some of these Federal loans and sell \"participations\" in pools of loans to private investors. The substitution of private for public credit is a recognized. sound method of financing. This proposition is not new or novel. It has been carried on by a number of agencies for a number of years. By this act we will be extending the principle to include additional types of loans. The substitution of private for public credit has advantages. It makes effective use of the taxpayers dollar. It offers private investors and opportunity for sound investment and a fair return. It benefits business and those of our citizens helped by these programs. It insures the Government the best possible return on the sale of financial assets. It provides private Investors with widely accepted and highly desirable assets. It reaches sources of capitol which are not otherwise available and the sales will be handled by a centralized agencyexpert in handling these sales--the Federal National Mortgage Association. And. finally. there will be a diminishing demand for direct appropriations while the Appropriations Committee controls the amounts of participations which will be sold. The Congress. through the Appropriations Committee. will have an annual review of this matter. This act provides that. in all cases. the Appropriations Committee must authorize in advance the amounts of participations which can be sold against the Governments assets. So. Mr. Chairman. this is needed legislationit is desirable legislationI support the Sales Participation Act and urge its passage.",

The main purpose of the bill. it seems to me. is to try to confuse the public about the amount of Federal spending going on this year. The administrative budget predicts a budget deficit of $1.8 billion. That is based on socalled participation sales of $4.7 billion of financial assets. In other words the proposed deficit would be $6 billion were it not for the sale of $4.2 billion in assets. If we knew an individual who sold part of his capital assets and counted it for income we would think him very foolish. If a farmer sells part of his acreage and then brags about his income. we know he is following a course which will lead to financial ruin. Obviously. by this kind of sleight of hand it would be possible to balance the budget and even show a surplus. The trouble is you can only sell assets once. If they are sold this year. they cannot be sold again next year. and you have that much more of a problem in meeting expenditures.

Now that I have listened to some of the debate and had opportunity to study the legislation. I see nothing really wrong with it. I realize that it will authorize actions that will. to those who do not give it adequate consideration. make the national debt appear lower and make the administrative budget seem smaller. But why should that deny a bill if it otherwise is valid and makes good sense. Why should not these loan assets. which the Government owns. be pooled as a basis for sale of these certificates? It is not creating a false picture to indicate what the real truth is. namely. that the obligation will be paid and that the payment from the Treasury generally will be the disparity between what the interest rates might be and the losses that the Government may take. These losses will be out in the open for all to see to a greater degree than heretofore. I realize that for many years the budget and appropriation system has to some extent been confusing. I know of a project in the district which adjoins mine. a reclamation project. to provide water for several cities. which will cost about $90 million. According to the present system of budgeting. this shows up as an outlay by the Government that from first appearances will never be returned. just like buying an Army tank or a military aircraft. Actually. though. more than 90 percent of the money spent on this project will be repaid under the repayment provision of the reclamation law. This is not on all fours with exact budget techniques Involved in the pending bill. but it emphasizes a point which I think is valid. If there were no precedent for the procedure involved in this bill and if we had not been doing it from year to year. it might be something we would approach with far greater concern. But we have done some of this. It seems to be acceptable. It has been recommended by previous administrations. However. whether anyone recommended it or did not recommend it. or whether the Republicans are for it and whether the Democrats are for it is not the point.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. of all the momentous events that have occurred since the end of World War II. the Hungarian revolution of October and November 1956 stands out as the most courageous single act undertaken by an entire nation. In standing up to Soviet totalitarianism. the Hungarian people added a significant chapter to the story of mans struggle for individual liberty. That is why we honor. 10 years later. those freedom fighters who pitted flesh and stones against Soviet steel. In 1956. the leaders of the Soviet Union viewed a genuine war of national liberation in Hungary. they did not like what they saw. Thousands of ordinary Hungarians rose up against Soviet domination and Communist rule. At first it appeared as if a new dawn might emerge in that troubled land. Moscows Communist puppets proved ineffective in suppressing the revolt and had to yield to the insurgents demand for liberty and selfgovernment. One dark question remained. however: Would the Soviet Union accept the will of the Hungarian people? The Soviets soon made known their answer. Red tanks and troops poured into Hungary and. after days of bitter fighting. destroyed the Revolution. Thousands of freedom fighters were killed in the bloodbath. and thousands more left their homes and fled westward into Austria. The Communists still rule Hungary today. but they rule remembering those days 10 year ago. The people remember too. Though they must often despair over the failure of their efforts. they must gain inspiration and hope from the memories of those courageous days. In this sense. the Revolution lives on unextinguishable. It is only fitting that we commemorate those courageous days in the hope that the light of freedom which dawned so briefly in the autumn of 1956 will reemerge to cast a permanent glow over Hungary.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we live in an age of rapid technological development in every field. Progress in transportation is no exception. Yet in many instances progress in safety does not keep pace with improved equipment and service. This is abundantly clear in the continued existence of our grade crossings in New York State and across the Nation. The citizens of the village of East Williston and neighboring communities located in the congressional district I represent are to be commended for taking the initiative in trying to get action to eliminate a dangerous grade crossing in their area. I believe that the depressed railway concept is the approach that holds the most promise. both from the point of view of safety and preservation of the beauty of both of our rural and suburban areas. Furthermore. below ground level stations would eliminate the grade crossing hazard. provide for parking space at ground level above the station. and would not compromise the integrity of the surrounding neighborhood by bisecting it with an elevated line. When the Long Island Expressway was built depressing the road bed was the technique widely employed rather than elevated construction. and New York City got rid of its elevated railway years ago. which resulted In greatly enhancing the Third Avenue and Lexington Avenue areas. An elevated railway through a town is like a Chinese wall which rends the community in twain. wreaking havoc with local efforts toward neighborhood beautification. The twin objectives in replacing grade crossings are the safeguarding of lives and the preservation and enhancement of property and the below ground level rail line concept meets both criteria. Nassau County Executive Eugene Nickerson has long been a champion of this approach to the elimination of dangerous grade crossings. as has John A. Occhiogrosso. a candidate for the State senate from the Fifth District. Grade crossings are a dangerous anachronism that have claimed many a life. and a concerted effort should be made to secure their replacement. I stand ready to use my office to call for Federal assistance in this important effort and have called upon Governor Rockefeller to urge that the New York State government move with all possible speed toward a long overdue solution to this urgent suburban problem:",

It would have been difficult indeed to sustain the 1965 level of activity for 2 years. I think it can truthfully be said that the 1st session of the 89th Congress was the most productive in our Nations history. The second session had a tough performance to follow. The 1965 session had turned out the first general education measure in history. expanded the social security system to help senior citizens meet the costs of health care. passed a Voting Rights Act protecting the right to vote for all Americans. established a Department of Housing and Urban Development. giving the cities and suburbs of America the same standing in the Presidents Cabinet that agriculture had enjoyed for a century. enacted farreaching legislation to help local communities in building needed public facilities. increased Federal assistance to higher education. reducad excise taxes. reformed our immigration system to make it more equitable and passed a water pollution control measure. To this list of major legislation could be added other new lawsthe highway beautification program. Federal and military pay bills. the Appalachian Regional Development Act. and the Economic Development Act which extended the Appalachian Act concept to other regions experiencing economic difficulty. There are several reasons for the outstanding legislative record compiled during the 1965 session of the 89th Congress. One reason was the overwhelming victory of President Johnson at the polls in 1964. The American people not only gave him the largest vote any President has ever enjoyed. but they turned to the Democratic Party at other levels as well. When the smoke of the election campaign had cleared and the votes were counted. the Democratic Party had control of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate by substantial margins. and the balance of power was held by Congressmen and Senators who were committed to such programs as aid to education. medicare. and community development.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on March 2. my distinguished colleague from Texas. Senator YARBOROUGH. introduced a bill to authorize the creation of a national memorial in El Paso to commemorate the 1964 settlement of the Chamizal controversy. The enactment of the Chamizal Treaty signified the friendly settlement between the United States and the Republic of Mexico over land on the Rio Grande between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. Mexico. The term \"Chamizal\" is the Spanish name for the plants which once covered the ground in the area. The Chamizal controversy originated under the imprecise terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848. which set the border between the United States and Mexico as the Rio Grande. But. as rivers in Texas sometimes will. the Rio Grande changed course in the ChainIzal vicinity. The Chamizal Treaty of January 14. 1964. provided for a permanent relocation and channeling of the river in a concretelined bed. and ended the controversy by designating the center of the river as an international boundary. Approximately 630 acres of land were transferred to Mexico and 193 acres went to the United States. with a portion of the U.S. land going to the city of El Paso. This legislation I am cosponsoring today would set aside 55 acres of U.S. land for a suitable monument and a museuminformation center. The Department of the Interior. which has endorsed this legislation. says that development of the memorial will include administrative offices. parking facilities. and landscaping.

    "speech": "heads a delegation of New England Members of Congress who have long sought an end to the Governments quota system. Senator EDMUND S. MUSKIE. Democrat. of Maine. said the delegation would continue to push for complete removal of quotas \"even in name.\" He said that. as long as the Presidential proclamation in quotas stood. \"the situation could change.\" \"The retention of quotas as such\" Senator PASTORE said. \"becomes merely a fiction. We would have preferred to see the quotas taken off completely. but. short of this. we feel this satisfies our needs.\" The quota system was originally created as a national security measure to restrict and lessen dependence on foreign oil supplies. a requirement that Mr. Udall said was now without foundation. However. coal interests bitterly fought the lifting of quotas because coal competes with residual oil for use in producing electric power in the East. The Interior Department said that the revised program was \"responsive\" to the advice of the director of the Office of Emergency Planning. Buford Ellington. who wrote to Mr. Udall last December 18. In the letter. Mr. Ellington. who has since then resigned said that a thorough consideration of all issues \"indicates that the control of these imports could be substantially relaxed without impairment to the national security.\" He said this view was consistent with the view of Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. \"which takes into account the current military situation\" in Vietnam and elsewhere. For the year beginning April 1. the Government will retain the basic residual fuel import allocation for the east coast of 352.000 barrels a day. the 1957 level. This does not include 11.000 barrels a day assigned to the Defense Department and General Services Administration. As of April 1. additional allocations will be made on the basis of evidence that importers have contractual agreements for sales. In effect. licenses to bring in more oil will be automatic and importers not now eligible will be able to participate. For the year ending March 31. the ceiling on imports has been 755.000 barrels a day. In his action last December. Mr. Udall liberalized this to permit 35 million additional barrels by the end of March. This had the effect of virtually ending the quota system. Since then. importers have brought in less than half the 35 million barrels.",

A succession of choral groups. glee clubs. bands. orchestras. and other aggregations of vocal and instrumental musicians passes through the District of Columbia in an almost endless parade and invariably each schedules an appearance intended to bring pleasure to the Congress. An outstanding musical organization from my native State. one which proudly boasts a history dating back to the last decade of the preceding century. is scheduled for two performances in this city in the next 2 days. The University of Californias marching band from the Berkeley campus. a 101member organization making a 10.000 mile summer tour of the country. will put on a brief show on the Capitol steps on Wednesday noon and is booked for a fullscale varietytype presentation at the Monument grounds Tuesday night. tomorrow. at 8 oclock. The history of this talented. versatile musical contingent is almost as fascinating as its repertoire and its range of accomplishment. Founded in 1891 by a handful of students to play at military drills and university ceremonies. .t has served as a group of musical ambassadors and demonstrated its capabilities at the New York Worlds Fair this year. the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1958. the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939. the PanamaPacific International Exposition in 1915. and the San Francisco Fair in 1894. Fittingly. it performed at the dedication of Californias State Capitol in 1909. a building some decades later to be occupied by a student who. in another era coincidentally was perhaps the bands most prestigious member. the present Chief Justice and onetime Governor of my State. the Honorable Earl Warren. Under the direction of James Berdahl and garbed in striking uniforms. the University of California marching band will bounce easily from cherished classical numbers and musical comedy favorites to jazz and Dixieland specialties. highlighted with vaudeville and songanddance routines. I cordially invite all colleagues to join in enjoyment of this groups performance on the steps at 11 to 11:30 Wednesday morning and hope that they will suggest their families and friends attend the more ambitious performance at the Washington Monument tomorrow evening at 8 oclock.",

S. 520. which would extend wartime benefits to our valiant fighting men and women. and their families. who serve in defense of liberty in any area designated by the President as an area of hostility. As some will recall. I have long had a keen interest and concern for our men in uniform. and for their welfare once they left the service. In the 84th Congress. on April 23. 1956. I authored S. 3697 to extend the socalled GI bill of rights to all persons who entered the Armed Forces of the United States after January 31. 1955. thus affording them the same benefits enjoyed by those who had entered the service prior to that date. While not successful on that occasion. my interest in the problem. and the need to remedy it. did in no way diminish. On February 11. 1957. I tried again with S. 1158. I offered S. 270 on January 14. It seems appropriate. Mr. President. to this day quote part of the testimony I gave in 1959 before Senator YARBOROUGHS Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare: We no longer can assume that ones contribution to the defense of our society ends the moment an individual leaves the service. In fact he might make a greater contribution as a researcher in the laboratory. a skilled engineer and worker in the industrial plant. and the administrator who coordinates complex and farflung activities. These are the Armed Forces of democracy in the broadest sense. These sentiments. I submit. have as much impact today as they had 8 years ago.

Our film industry has to its credit the production. over the last 50 years. of some outstanding screen stories depicting great events In the creation and development of these United States. While we might think of such portrayals as entertainment only. because they are a part of our theater. we should also recognize that they are also impressive and often tremendously inspirational . to young people and adults who see them. It is not coincidence that two of the greatest motion pictures ever produced. \"Birth of a Nation.\" and \"Gone With the Wind.\" have as their subject the most climactic event in American historythe Civil War. Both were made with sensitive regard for authenticity in the unfolding of an unparalleled event. This is probably one outstanding reason for their lasting greatness as motion pictures. I should like to call your attention to another recent film production which I have had the pleasure of seeing. Also having to do with the Civil War period. it is appropriately called. \"Shenandoah.\" A Universal Pictures film. set in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. and photographed with great authenticity for details. the story of \"Shenandoah\" concerns a family which resided in the valley. the members of which tried to remain neutral as the War Between the States encroached on their lives. The head of this family is played by one of Americas foremost actors. James Stewart. I think he may very well be nominated for another Academy Award in recognition of his excellent performance in this new film. \"Shenandoah\" is a warm. emotional story of a most unusual family. It is also a reminder of the overwhelming tragedy of war. Already the picture -has received wide critical praise. On the basis of my viewing of this film.

Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD an extremely important resolution approved by the Dade County community task force on January 7. 1966. strongly urging favorable consideration of the pending bill. and to which the two letters previously placed in the RECORD. from the Transport Workers Union of America and the Dade County Federation of Labor.

Their resolution. made so strongly. recommending as it does the immediate initiation of the Interama project. was really set in motion by the appointment of the task force by Mr. Gardner. I read two of the \"whereas\" clauses in the resolution. I am placing the whole communication in the RECORD. but am choosing for emphasis only those parts which I think are most important: Whereas. this task force has thoroughly reviewed all potential means available within this community of reaching the Presidents goal by generating new jobs to absorb the large and everincreasing number of refugees in this area. and Whereas during the course of this review it has become apparent to this task force that Interama offers the greatest and most immediate assurance of creating new employmentapproximately 5.000 skilled and 7.000 unskilled manyear jobs during its initial construction phaseand that the construction of Interama will assure permanent employment for additional thousands thereafter. The task force. organized at the request of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare to cooperate with that Department. is charged with the duty of seeking all proper and justifiable means of attaining the Presidents objective \"to maintain and stimulate economic growth in the Miami area and to avoid introducing an additional burden on the economy as a result of the influx of refugees.\" I submit. Mr. President. the construction and development of Interama will assist in the acomplishment of this objective. The third letter is from Mr. Donald Wheeler Jones. president. Miami Branch of the NAACP. dated October 13. 1965. wherein he points out the problem of unemployment created in the Negro populace as a result of the increase in the number of Cuban refugees in the Miami area. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Jones be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

Only today I read again the debate on the TaftEllender measure in 1948. In some respects this bill embodies principles of the TaftEllender bill. I direct the Senators attention to a question which is controversial. and which raises emotions. nevertheless. it is an important question. and it must be discussed. It is the question whether the bill contravenes the first amendment to the Constitution. Let me say that I have studied the bill in light of the issue. and I intend to vote for the bill. But I would like to have the Senators interpretation of this issue. I believe the Senator. great lawyer that he is. will agree with me that a very serious question has been raised in several cases. among them being the Everson case. which held in substance that taxes could be used for incidental purposes directed to the benefit of the pupil in private and parochial schools. the case held. of course. that tax funds should not be used for the general support of private church schools. As I understand the pending bill. it does not prescribe that Federal funds shall be used for private or sectarian schools. On the other hand. it does not prohibit their use in certain cases. if the State desired to so use them. and such use were approved by the Federal Commissioner of Education.",

May 16. it was my pleasure to attend a cornerstonelaying for the construction of a great new hospital. the building of which exemplifies the best in American tradition. The hospital. named the Morris Cafritz Memorial Hospital after the late prominent Washington builder. is located at the District line. next to my home. Prince Georges County. Md. The Morris Cafritz Memorial Hospital is the culmination of more than a decade of dedicated volunteer work by a group of interested citizens under the leadershop of Raymond J. McDonough. who is also an attorney and a delegate to the Maryland General Assembly. It was my pleasure when. as a delegate to the general assembly. Mr. McDonough and I and a majority of other legislators approved a $650.000 authorization to be contributed by the Prince Georges County commissioners toward construction of the new hospital. which is expected to serve a large number of Maryland residents. The significance of Sundays ceremony is illustrated by the fact that one of the great friends of American hospitals. JoHN W. MCCORMACK. Speaker of the House of Representatives. gave the major address. I might add at this point that the hospitals board of trustees under Mr. McDonough have announced that they will dedicate their suite of operating rooms to Speaker and Mrs. McCormack. an honor justly accorded them. I would like to reiterate that the new Morris Cafritz Memorial Hospital represents the efforts of a group of dedicated citizens. those of a leading political figure whose lifelong interest in hospitals has paved the way for construction of many with Federal aid. and the community interest exhibited by a prominent builder. We shall long appreciate everyones efforts in the building of this new community service. which will be dedicated in March 1966. Therefore. I insert the following address of Speaker MCCORMACK at the Morris Cafritz Memorial Hospital. Sunday. May 16. 1965:",

Education. and Welfare has a regulation in effect which would deny to the State of Massachusetts. and I am sure many other States. the use of Federal funds. The use of Federal funds will be withheld where the State is entitled to reimbursement. This regulation of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare requires that all welfare workers have to be college graduates. In my opinion. this is bad. Furthermore. it is my understanding that anyone who has been working for the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare for a number of years cannot get a promotion unless he or she is a college graduate. While I doubt the wisdom of the regulation in the first place.

To a person who is even passively observing. this is a patent falsehood. While there is every effort to downplay the continual subversive conduct of the Communists. their ardor to achieve their goal of global conquest has not abated and they still use their traditional toolsdeception. subversion. criminal conspiracy. The only thing that is incredible in this case is the unexplicable gullibility of many Americans who through some rose colored glasses tend to view communism as a genuine. respectable political party. The record of Communists and their efforts to penetrate U.S. Government agencies and every other segment of our society from education to labor unions to business is not necessary to recount at this point. What I thought I might present. Mr. Speaker. is a capsule summary of what the Communist Party is doing now. in this decade. It is not necessary to recount the Alger Hiss story nor the sequence of events that led to the spy trials of Harry Gold. the Rosenbergs and others. What is going on now? I maintain that the same effort is proceeding as methodically as ever with a change here and there to better cover up. a little more polish and a different set of Communist Front organizations. As the ranking minority member on the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. I have a close connection with the effort to legislate a legal framework for our security laws to protect our American interest. For more than 20 years I have studied communism and believe that they are now ready to make their \"great leap forward\" in the United States. to borrow from the Chinese Communist dictator. Historically. the Communists stand condemned for their murder. treachery and global conspiracy. Most Americans know this. What most Americans overlookand their Government. unfortunately. helps in this evasion of responsibilityis the Communist Party of the sixties is no different.",

The explanations offered are varied and many of them questionable. Two of the most often repeated objections to the present treaty are its \"sovereignty\" and \"perpetuity\" provisions. which have been used by Panamanian politicians to inflame the Panamanian people to a high degree of emotionalism. In this connection. these politicos never point out that the \"perpetuity\" feature applies with equal force to the United States. and that as long as our country retains the powers of sovereignty over the Canal Zone. the independence of the Republic of Panama is guaranteed. The chief of the Panama team in the current diplomatic negotiations is Dr. Diogenes de la Rosa. an \"acknowledged Marxist intellectual and longterm socialist.\" He has frankly stated that the task for Panama after finishing the negotiations is \"to remake the state from within. revise its institutions and rectify its method of conducting public affairs.\" He then emphasizes that if this is not done. \"any benefits from the negotiations would lose all significance.\" The meaning of such pronouncement is obvious. The canal is to become the source of still more extensive benefits for Panama. and this can be done only by revenue from greatly increased transit tolls or by further taxation of the American people. Unfortunately. the shipping industry of the United States has not been alert to what has been transpiring on the isthmus. no one in the Senate has spoken out in defense of our countrys interests. and the taxpayers of our Nation are not organized. A recent article from Panama City. Republic of Panama. by Ralph Skinner. a longtime resident of the isthmus and distinguished correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor. gives new light on the subject of why Panama seeks a new treaty and is commended for reading by every Member of the Congress.

The program calls for cooperation between the Federal Government. the States. institutions of higher learning. the financial community. and private nonprofit organizations which guarantee student loans. Despite the great need for financial aid to students. the program has been slow to get off the ground. although loans totaling $700 million were guaranteed by the Federal Government for fiscal year 1966. only about $150 million were borrowed. I was therefore very pleased to read in Tuesdays newspaper that the American Bankers Association is taking new steps to encourage its members to participate. beginning this fall. in the loan program. The private banking resources of our Nation are urgently needed. if we are to remove the financial barrier to a college education for every capable individual American. The 1965 Higher Education Act enlists the help of Americas 18.000 banks for this purpose.

Beginning teachersthose with bachelors degreesare required by the State of Indiana to obtain the masters degree within 5 years to qualify for a professional teachers certificate. Yet. teachers working to fulfill that State requirement are told this expense of getting an advanced degree is not deductible. On the other hand. an attorney in Indiana is allowed to deduct the expense of any additional training as soon as he is admitted to the bar and allowed to charge moneyfor his services. In this light. it seems to me that teachers are being penalized to meet Indianas standards of excellence in education. In fact. it seems to me that this policy contradicts the administrations emphasis on educational excellence. I have been in contact with officials of the Internal Revenue Service. but there have been no indications that an administrative order to change this situation is in the offing. Therefore.

I would like to point out that the newspaper to which the gentleman from Indiana referred also supported editorially Mr. Castro as an agrarian reformer. While I have great respect for my colleague. the gentleman from Indiana . and his knowledge of Latin America and the people there. I also have dealt with that area for the past 7 years as chairman of the Subcommittee on InterAmerican Affairs. I have visited almost every country in Latin America. know many of the leaders of those countries. and have attended at least three international conferences on interAmerican affairs. I do not agree with the conclusions reached by my colleague from Indiana as I believe- the passage of this resolution will accomplish at least two things: first. it will make unmistakably clear to any wouldbe Communist adventurers that they cannot count on any declared doctrine of nonintervention to shield their aggressive activities. Second. it will make it clear to our allies in Latin America that we must work out a system of collective security which will meet the new type of Communist aggressionsubversion. infiltration. and so forthwhich has become the primary instrument of Communist expansion.",

I specifically endorse the resolution because of two features: First. the fact that it reaffirms again the Monroe Doctrine after some lapse and doubt about its application in the last several years. and second. it does call for collective action by the Organization of American States. Such joint action is most important. At the same time I want to be very clear that I disassociate myself with the report as written. The report is badly written. In many respects it does not coincide with the context of the resolution itself. Specifically I want to disassociate myself with one sentence or. a substantial part of one sentence in the report. I ask you to turn to page 3. The sentence reads as follows: Recognizing that the subversive forces of international communism threaten the sovereignty and political independence of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. it supports (1) the President of the United States in any action he deems necessary to prevent in a timely manner Communist subversion in the hemisphere. Naturally I would support and have supported action by the Chief Executive against Communist subversion in this hemisphere. It should be pointed out he already has authority as President of the United States. and as Commander in Chief. In the past. particularly in the case of the Dominican Republic. I have supported the action which was taken. but I think those of us on the minority side of the aisle must reserve independent judgment as to the precise way in which the challenge to subversion is undertaken by our Government in Latin America. I want to make it crystal clear that by our voting for the resolution it does not mean that we. in advance. endorse any specific method of meeting the challenge of Communist subversion in the Western Hemisphere. With that qualification as to the report. I intend to support the resolution.",

The question is how to do it and the signal importance of initial collective actionwhile we. of course. reserve the right always of action in selfdefense. The fact remains that the Charter of the OAS and the treaty that is referred to in this resolution. the InterAmerican Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. talk about common action and common defense. Our failure in regard to the Dominican Republic was in failing to practice collective security. in failing to inform the OAS of our intentions to land troops or request observers to accompany our forces pending the arrival of OAS forces. I believe the resolution is ambiguous. I believe the minority leader made an excellent point. This gives support. at least in the report. for the President to take any step he deems necessary.

No issue has so divided the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations this year as the American adventure in the Dominican Republic. Within the last week a great debate has been taking place in that body discussing precisely the political. moral. and legal issues which we would propose to treat as unamendable and subject to little or no refutation. Nor is this resolution uncontroversial in this House. Certain members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs have expressed their grave concern about this matter and some are in outright opposition. And yet from its position on the suspension calendar the American people would be given to believe that there is neither debate nor major expert opposition to the resolutions contents. I also point out that this resolution authorizes a unilateral type of gunboat diplomacy that we have renounced since the beginning of the good neighbor policy of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Alliance for Progress of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. In addition it violates our commitments under the U.N. Charter and the Charter of the Organization of American States. Specifically. article 15 of the Charter of the Organization of American States says that: No state or group of states has the right to intervene directly or indirectly. for any reason whatever. in the internal or external affairs of any other state. And article 17 states: The territory of a state is inviolable. it may not be the object. even temporarily. of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state. directly or indirectly. on any grounds whatsoever. The passage of this resolution will be greeted throughout the world with despair by our friends and delight by our enemies. Mr. Speaker. I urge the defeat of this incredible resolution.",

Customarily the field of foreign affairs is left to the President. yet on this occasion the President has not communicated with me nor with other Members of the Washington Delegation and I feel. as I am sure they do. that we should have liked administrative comments on this prior to House consideration. Third. As many Members of this House stated on the floor the adddition of constructive amendments which would have made plain to the entire world our determination to follow democratic procedures could have possibly been proposed and discussed.

This Is a timely expression of the intent of the House that we will resist and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent a Communist takeover in any of the American Republics. It states our recognition of the danger to the security of each of us whenever international communism threatens the security of any American state. I deplore the confusion and distortions of fact which have characterized. in some quarters. our efforts to help stop a Communist takeover in the Dominican Republic. Passage of this resolution will help clear away the misconceptions about our foreign policy both at home and abroad. I urge its Immediate adoption. I would like to stress the following remarks from page 2 of the report on House Resolution 560: In short. the subversive activities are carefully cloaked with the appearance of being a domestic problem. As a result. a number of American governments have been reluctant to regard subversion as susceptible of international action. holding that such action would collide with the interAmerican principle of nonintervention. The Communists have recognized this unresolved dilemma within the interAmerican collective security system and have tailored their aggressions accordingly. The Alliance for Progress is designed to remove the underlying causes of social discontent in Latin America. which provide fertile ground for Communist machinations. However. success of the longrange objectives of the Alliance is endangered by continuing Communist efforts to increase the political tensions of the region.",

I join wholeheartedly in this sentiment. and I will continue to support those efforts which can deal realistically and effectively with international communisms efforts to subvert and to dominate independent nations. For the fact of the matter is that communism is diametrically opposed to the open society. which is the very strength and basis of both our system and that of many other countries in this hemisphere and elsewhere in the world. But I cannot agree to support this resolution as it has been presented to the House today. although I feel a better conceived and better drafted measure might very well be In order. This resolution. however. meets neither of these criteria: it is both inadequately considered and imperfectly drafted. In addition. Mr. Speaker. a measure of this importance should not be considered under the severe time limitations imposed by suspension of the rules. We should have more than 40 minutes to discuss a matter of this magnitude. and we certainly should be given an opportunity to consider perfecting amendments which. of course. is not possible under todays procedures. We must bear in mind when considering a measure such as this that the rising tide of popular feeling in Latin America today is directed toward social reform and economic improvement. These goals are not inconsistent with our own goals and our own traditions. But we trap ourselves. we seriously reduce our options. and we severely inhibit our opportunities to be effective if we automatically oppose reform and revolutionary movements just because a few radicals and extremists. along with progressives. liberals. moderates. and others. are associated with them. We force ourselves to be associated with the status quo. with often reactionary systems. and we find ourselves opposed to the constructive outlets and the bright future of the Alliance for Progress.

    "speech": "stated it very well when he said last week: The movement of the future in Latin America is social revolution. The question is whether it is to be Communist or democratic revolution and the choice which the Latin Americans make will depend in part on how the United States uses its great influence. Mr. Speaker. the Charter of the Organization of American States is perfectly clear in its opposition to unilateral action or to intervention in the internal affairs of any nation. Article 15 states: No state or group of states has the right to intervene. directly or indirectly. for any reason whatever. in the internal or external affairs of any other state. And article 17 states: The territory of a state is inviolable. it may not be the object. even temporarily. of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state. directly or indirectly. on any grounds whatever. It may be that unilateral action and direct intervention are not the objectives of this resolution. But this is not clear to many of us today. and I am certain that it would not be clear to many of our neighbors and friends. So. Mr. Speaker. I do not think we should approve this resolution today and I will not vote to support it. This resolution is much too negative in nature. It does not add one iota to the Presidents constitutional responsibility or authority to conduct our foreign policy. It will do little if anything to deter communism. And it in no way enhances our ability to contribute the strength. the vitality. and the great traditions of our own system to the changing and challenged societies of Latin America.",

In the report. Senators will find a listing of the few exceptions that have been made. They are in the Military Establishment. plus CIA. I believe the Senator cited the only case in which Congress has set this prohibition aside. and it was with respect to General Marshall. All of us. if we were Governors or President. would feel that we had the right to obtain from our legislative body approval of the man whom we felt we needed to do a job effectively. No one is happyat least. I am never happyat the prospect of having to oppose a presidential nomination. In the time that I have been in the Senate. I have done so only once. The Senator from Oklahoma urges that the necessity of delivering an effective SST in prompt time is the really compelling reason which would require that we set aside the prohibition. Additionally.

I rise to again urge the President of the United States to mobilize the forces of the Federal Government to protect those who are only exercising their constitutional rights in Alabama. Federal troops should be dispatched immediately to protect those citizens. and the Justice Department should use its full and present powers to curb police brutality. Congress must act to insure once and for all the right of every American citizen to vote. or admit segregationists are more powerful than constitutional principles. The outrageous and shocking conduct of the Governor of Alabama and the brutality of the sheriff of Dallas County. have made clear the glaring inadequacy of the present civil rights laws to stop the disenfranchisement of American citizens. Today I am introducing a voting rights bill which will cover all elections--local. State. and Federal. It would make it mandatory for the President to create Federal registration offices and to appoint Federal registrars where either the Commission on Civil Rights or the Federal district court finds that the right to register has been denied because of race. color. or national origin. The Federal registrars would issue certificates of registration and oversee elections. This bill would completely eliminate -literacy and constitution Interpretation tests as well as poll taxes. Yesterday the Supreme Court correctly characterized these socalled literacy tests and other devices as traps--not tests. The U.S. courts would be empowered to void any election--except a presidential electionin which registration certificates were not recognized and required to do so where 50 or more persons were denied the right to vote. Mr. Speaker. immediate and effective legislation is necessary to make the right to vote a reality for all Americans. If the Civil Rights Commission can make a finding requiring the President to appoint voting registrars. Federal judges such as Judge Cox will no longer be able to stand in the way of the fulfillment of the Constitution. This afternoon. Mr. Speaker.

The first amendment guarantees \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" This inalienable right. coupled with the 14th amendment. provides the basis for Federal jurisdiction. The 14th amendment is a prohibition against any State abridging the \"privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" and against denials by any State of \"life. liberty. or property without the due process of law.\" or \"the equal protection of the laws.\" These constitutional provisions are reinforced by sections 1981 and 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code. and by section 332 of title 10. under which the President is authorized to intervene \"whenever he considers that unlawful obstructions. combinations. or assemblages make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\" Mr. Speaker. the performance of police officials in Selma.

Drug. and Cosmetic Act. consider designing these drugs as \"depressant or stimulant drugs\" and that it would be inadvisable to single out these drugs while leaving out others having substantially similar abuse potentials. The committee expects the Secretary to take early action with respect to the consideration of the listing of these six drugs. Now. that is what the committee report says. I believe that is what the Secretary will do. I believe that within 6 months they will be considered and we will still stay within the principle of making this legislation applicable to classes of drugs in order that there might be a more effective administration of the legislation.",

No. 2. I want to say that there are a couple of other factors which contributed to the question of going to New York City by our task force. One is we had to pay for our task force to go there.

We had better wait until there was an opportunity to go up in a calmer atmosphere. We tried to be responsible about this.

I can assure the gentleman from New York that it is still my intention at an appropriate time to get up there to listen to the people most directly involved in this program or. in some cases. those who are not involved but who are poor. Unless we keep our ears open. it seems to me we will not make needed improvements in complex programs of this kind.

Sponsoring operation REVUP. or among those sponsoring it. were the president of the Board of Rabbis of Cincinnati. the secretary of the Council of Churches. the archbishop of Cincinnati. the Episcopal bishop of southern Ohio. the executive secretary of the YWCA. and the heads of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. and the PTAs of both the public and parochial schools. The Neighborhood Council people. working under the community action program. participated just as much as did these other citizen groups in an effort to have every American citizen exercise his privilege and his responsibility of voting. Lest this slur that these activities were conducted only in Democratic precincts be left unchallenged. I believe the proof of the pudding is in the eating. On last Sunday during the registration hours. 21.000 people went into the 1.300 polling places and were registered. 9.000 in the city of Cincinnati and 11.000 in the heavily Republican silk stocking suburban districts outside the city of Cincinnati.",

This has been a recurring problem in other counties. in Letcher County. Ky.. and a variety of other places. This points up the need for us to be very careful and very cautious when we get into voter registration and the use of poverty funds: In Syracuse.

As I read the Courts opinion. which I join. it does not hold that in any industry exhibiting a decided trend towards concentration. any merger between competing firms violates \ufffd 7 unless saved by the failing company doctrine. nor does it declare illegal each and every merger in such an industry where the resulting firm has as much as a 7.5% share of the relevant market. But here. before the merger in 1958. the largest firm had 8% of the sales. Vons was third with 4.7 % and Shopping Bag was sixth with 4.2 %. The four largest firms had 24.4% of the market. the top eight had 40.9% and the top 12 had 48.8% as compared with 25.9%. 33.7% and 38.8% in 1948. All but two of the top 10 firms in 1958 were very probably also among the top 10 in 1948 or had acquired a firm that was among the top 10. Further. all but three of the top 10 had increased their market share between 1948 and 1958 and those who gained gained more that the three lost. Also. although three companies declined in market share their total sales increased in substantial amounts. Given -a trend towards fewer and fewer sellers which promises to continue. it is clear to me that where the eight leading firms have over 40% of the markct. any merger between the leaders or between one of them and a lesser company is vulnerable under \ufffd7. absent some special proof to the contrary. Here Vons acquired Shopping Bag. Both were among the eight largest companies. both had grown substantially since 1948 and they were substantial competitors. After the merger the four largest firms had 28.8%. the eight largest had 44% and the 12 largest had 50%. The merger not only disposed of a substantial competitor but increased the concentration in the leading firms. In my view the Government made out a prima facie case that the effect of this merger may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the middle and late 1930s. I was active in a struggle to enact legislation to preserve and protect small business from the growing monopoly power of large national concerns. While that skirmish was won and legislation was enacted. there neither has been nor would I expect in our free society that there will be a final and complete victory. It is to be expected that contesting forces and interests will continue to struggle for supremacy in the marketplace. The shortrange goals of selfinterest for greater economic profits and economic and political power must be constantly gaged against the public interest of preserving our free society. One of the yardsticks we have found useful in making that test In this country has been the antitrust laws. The price of liberty. it has been said. is eternal vigilance. It is also an unceasing struggle of endless battles. Furthermore. liberty. like the nation itself. is indivisible. If we permit our economic freedom to be sacrificed. we place our political liberty in jeopardy. and political liberty itself can exist only where economic freedom prevails. In this regard. I take considerable heart from Justice Blacks recent opinion in the Vons Grocery Co. case. In that case. involving the acquisition of 36 grocery stores in the Los Angeles market. Justice Black states that: . . . [W]here concentration is gaining momentum in a market. we must be alert to carry out Congress intent to protect competition against ever increasing concentration through mergers. I trust that this decision will give courage and renewed determination to those entrusted with the vital task of antitrust enforcement to pursue with intensified vigor the preservation of those high ideals in their charge. I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the RECORD at this point the recent remarks of Commissioner Everette MacIntyre. of the Federal Trade Commission. before the business public relations seminar. at Hot Springs. Va. Commissioner Macintyre addresses himself to the question: \"Does antitrust still have a valid role to play in todays economy?\" His answer. as is the Supreme Courts in Justice Blacks opinion. is a resounding \"Yes.\" I commend them both to the attention of my colleagues.",

It is most significant in light of the fact that the head of the AFLCIO in Ohio is also a prominent State senator from Toledo. For many years people have wondered whether the Democrat Party is a shell within the labor movement or the labor movement is a shell within the Democrat Party. If they merge in the way indicated here it would not make any difference. Of course. we are not talking about the workingman. We are talking about the bosses. Just as in the days of Senator Bob Taft. we see the labor bosses going their own separate ways regardless of what the men in the ranks want. The bosses favor every form of Federal control. deficit spending. and continually promote socialism. The men in the ranks are looking for one handout. the Governments hand out of their pocket. The bosses cannot deliver the vote and this merger talk is a sign of the panic of the Democrats and liberals in general at the great disasters inherent in the failings of the Great Society.

This is indeed a happy and memorable occasion for the people of Tunisia and for their distinguished and courageous leader. Habib Bourguiba. who led the struggle for independence. This small country in Northern Africa has extended an influence of moderation and stability beyond her borders far beyond that which would have been expected from a land possessing so few natural resources and a relatively small but energetic population. Tunisia has made commendable progress during the past 10 years in her economic development. Thanks to the foresight of her leaders she has eschewed the burdens of a military buildup and. instead. has concentrated on economic development within her own borders and cooperation with her neighbors of North Africa. We are hopeful that other developing countries will emulate the outstanding example of Tunisia which has ably demonstrated what can be accomplished in newly independent countries in collaboration with assistance from the West. No conditions were imposed or strings attached to our assistance to Tunisia. We would like to salute the decade of progress Tunisia has just achieved. and also the decade of promise ahead. and to offer sincere best wishes and hearty congratulations on her Independence Day.",

If my recollection is correct. in 1960 this country accumulated about 1.500 million bushels of wheat and 85 million tons of feed grains. In that period of time now. in the last 6 years. we have been able to reduce this carryover of wheat from 1.500 million bushels of wheat up to the end of this marketing year which it appears may be down to 400 million bushels. The feed grain supplies are down to some 50 million tons. At the same time we have been able to make a modest increase in the net farm income. I would say. and I think the gentleman would agree. that this has been the accomplishment of the farm program.

If we did go back to the old uncontrolled chaos that we had. obviously we could not expect and there would be no way that we could get any more than the world price. The world price of wheat is about $1.35 or $1.40 and it is a good deal less than that at common points of delivery. If that is what the farmer was to receive for his wheat. I do not care how much he could grow. The more he grows. the worse off he would be. If we follow that policy. the world price of cotton which is today possibly on the order of 20 cents. or something like that. it would obviously drop somewhatno man knows exactly how much- 2 cents. 3 cents or 4 centsbut suppose it only dropped to 18 centswho can grow cotton for 18 cents? If you abandon our program. you put the American farmer in competition with the farmer in Egypt. with the farmer in Indonesia. with the farmer in Ghana. with the farmer in the Argentine and with the farmers all over the world. Their price level is far below our price level. Their wage levels are far below our wage levels. You cannot maintain the American price system In competition with these other systems.

Interama was established as a State of Florida agency in 1951 and the purpose of the agency is to do whatever may be necessary for the establishment. construction. maintenance. operation and financing of an InterAmerican Cultural and Trade Center in or near Miami. Fla.. as a permanent enterprise. The character and purpose of Interama were outlined *in 1951 by Dr. W. H. Walker. the first chairman of the organization. and a distinguished Floridian. who said: The worldwide Communist drive must be met by a stronger one for truth. freedom and democracy. If communism continues to ppread the next 5 years as it has the past 5. a majority of the worlds population will be under Kremlin control. greatly enhancing the possibility of eventual Russian military victory. The nations of this hemisphere constitute a strong and unconquerable group if they will stand solidly together and restrain communism within their own borders. Unless the United States can solidly cement its relations with the Latin American people. it Is in a poor position to do so in other faraway countries. Interama is to be a permanent reminder of our Nations interest in our hemispherea living reminder of our belief in representative government and freedom for all people. This lasting memorial to the Americas will stand as a strong example to other nations in our desire for a permanent peace and security for our area and of the world. I am hopeful the House will act favorably on this important project. which has had the backing of the last five Presidents of the United States. the Florida congressional delegation. the Governor and cabinet of Florida. the State legislature. and the citizens of our State. In these days of continuing crisis in Latin America we need this concrete display of the cultures of North and South America to stand not only as an example of our mutual desire for freedom. but also as a bulwark in our national defense effort. Participation by our Government will Insure the success of Interama and prove the purpose of the undertaking as outlined by Dr. Walker: meeting the Communist threat with truth. freedom and democracy through this hemispheric illustration of solidarity.",

It should be emphasized that this is an investment by the Federal Government in an exhibit that will attract an estimated 75 million visitors in the first 5 years. Thousands will be visiting Interama from countries throughout the world and it is here that the United States. through its exhibit. can proudly display the American way of life to the rest of the world. Mr. Chairman. in view of the fact that a total of $17 million was authorized for the New York Worlds Fair. the $11 million asked here today for Interamaconsidering its permanencyis not unreasonable. Nor is it unreasonable when one considers the laudable purpose of Interama. namely. the development of improved relations and increased trade with the Republics of Latin America. and indeed the rest of the free world. The theme of Interama is. appropriately. \"Progress Through Freedom.\" As such. Interama will start as a living monument to the great American way of life.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the bill proposing a 5year extension of the Sugar Act. reported by the Committee on Agriculture. is in direct conflict with avowed U.S. objectives in foreign trade. Acting under authority of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. U.S. negotiators at Geneva are striving for lower trade barriers so as to promote a freer movement of commerce among nations. The objective of the Trade Expansion Act was to eliminate or reduce quotas and other restrictive devices imposed by other nations which have the effect of discriminating against American products. We could examine more easily and accurately the mote in the eye of others if we would first remove the beam from our own. The Sugar Act is a good place to start. Of all American schemes to rig markets and control productionand we have them in embarrassing abundancethis one should qualify as the prototype for complexity. extent of Government power and absence of competitive conditions. It makes the Secretary of Agriculture the absolute czar of sugar. Not one pound can move legally without his authority. The act has several purposes: First. To protect domestic producers. The tropics are best suited to sugar production. and because of this. little or no sugar would be produced in the United States were it not for protection. Under the Sugar Act. approximately 60 percent of the sugar we use is produced domestically. Second. To assure dependable supplies. Foreign countries providing us with the other 40 percent of our requirements are guaranteed premium prices. Because U.S. prices are higher. dependable supplies are assured. Third. To stabilize prices at reasonable levels. Under successive Sugar Acts. prices have relatively remained stable. This should not be surprising. If Government controlled the supply of shoes the same as sugar. the American consumer could be assured stable shoe prices. But $15 shoes would probably be selling for $25. Prices which are pegged high and kept there by tight Government controls are naturally very stable. Whether these stable prices are reasonable is open to question. If the American homemaker were confronted with the choice between Canadapriced sugarcurrently about 8 cents a pound on the grocery shelfand U.S.-priced sugarabout 11 centsshe would quickly identify the Canadian item as reasonable and the U.S. item as not. As a practical matter she has no such choice.",

My remarks today have to do with an apparent policy by the Federal Aviation Agency denying commercial airlines the permission to fly jet equipment in or out of Washington National Airport. The Washington Post treated this subject in some detail in the Sunday. September 19 paper: JETS ARE BOUND To SWISH IF NATIONAL Is To SURVIVE (By Leonard Downie. Jr.) The pace of technology and the demands of competition have taken the \"whether\" out of the dispute over jet airplanes at National Airport and replaced It with a \"when.\" Either jets will be flying regularly In and out of National in a few years or the airport will have begun to shrink toward nonexistence. Small. shorthaul jets are arriving faster than anyone expected a few years ago and their planned use on short flights by one line has forced all other major carriers to prepare for the day when they will fly only jets and turboprop planes. Some airline officials expect that day to come by the end of 1967. The Federal Aviation Agency. of course. is conducting another in a long series of studies and will not change Its present opposition to jets at National at least until it is completed. But G. Ward Hobbs. director of the FAAs Bureau of National Airports. says \"Jets cant help but be an eventuality\" at National. The reason there were no jets allowed at National when they first went into general service In the mid1950s was. of course. that they were too big. too fast. too heavy and made too much noise. But jets are changing with the times. and the original arguments against their use at National no longer seem as pertinent.",

June 21. 1965. when the plans for Lincoln Park Urban Renewal Project 1 were approved. However. time was not allowed. The 1 hour allotted for hearing opposition to the plan was abused. Board members spoke. especially Father Wangler spoke and said loss of home or business will not be too bad and people will not suffer too much. What is too much? This attitude is not usually associated with the ministry. It was also stated by the board that a majority of the residents of the project approved the plans. The plans Were approved by paid membership associations. Total membership in these organizations is less than 5 percent of the population of the area. Attendance at meetings is less than 10 percent of membership. How could a majority of the residents have approved the plan? Our organization was formed 1 year ago in February. and we have accomplished much compared to the 10 years others had.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is lamentable that the Congress has not yet enacted legislation to protect borrowers of money from misleading and inadequate disclosure of credit terms. For several years now. I have been privileged to cosponsor the socalled truthinlending bill. pioneered by Senator PAUL DOUGLAS. of Illinois. This legislation is urgently needed to protect consumers against loan sharks and conscious or unwitting deception in credit transactions. The basic purpose is to require that anyone who lends money or extends credit must supply the consumer with two essential facts: a statement of the total finance charge in dollars and cents. and secondly. a statement of the true annual rate of interest on the unpaid balance of the loan. The object of the bill is to provide all borrowers. and all those who buy on an installment plan. with a full accounting of the terms of the obligation. in dollarandcents language. Too often. we find that buyers are confronted with confusing sets of finance charges which are all but impossible to comprehend. The Senate has collected volumes of testimony pointing to the need for accurate and intelligible disclosure of credit charges on time buying. The Department of Defense. in May of this year. issued a directive which. in effect. applies the bills disclosure requirements to all commercial credit enterprises located on military bases. The Department also stated that the military services would no longer be responsible in assisting in the collection of servicemens debts unless the loan companies concerned complied with the directive. Today interest rates have soared. to such an extent that the homebuilding industry is in acute distress. Interest rate policy inevitably affects the individual borrower eventually. as well as those who buy on credit. However. consumer debt continues to rise. July figures show that outstanding consumer credit rose to an alltime high of $90.7 billion. compared to $87 billion last April. The trend will continue upward. although money is very tight. and this situation underlines the urgency of providing effective safeguards against loan sharks and misleading installment terms. Certainly the House should move to consider this Important legislation. It is time that Congress acted to protect all consumers by insuring that they be supplied with a full accounting of all interest charges when borrowing money or buying on an installment plan.",

Va.. News Leader on \"Our Flag Goes Down.\" This editorial in turn quoted a public statement by Governor Robert J. Fleming. Jr.. of the Canal Zone published in the August 3 issue of the Panama. Republic of Panama. Star & Herald. The Governors public utterance was one of the most astonishing to come from a responsible official of our Government that I ever read. In it. he explains how he was appointed as Governor of the Canal Zone for the purpose of scuttling U.S. control and how he set about doing it. The occasion for his statement was the announcement by the executive branch of our Government that Governor Flemings appointment had been extended beyond the normal period of 4 years. apparently without the advice and consent of the Senate. In view of this Governors wellknown and documented record as a participant in undermining U.S. authority over the Panama Canal enterprise. many informed citizens of our country. including distinguished Members of the Congress. have wondered why he should have been continued in such an important position instead of being summarily removed. Now I have learned from sources believed to be authentic that his time was extended in an effort to prevent the appointment by the President of a civilian to head the civil agency known as the Canal Zone Government. who also serves as president of the Panama Canal Company. In the light of their legislative history. the Panama Canal Reorganization Act of 1950 as well as the basic Panama Canal Act of 1912 clearly authorize such civilian appointment and this has been increasingly recommended in recent years by Members of the Congress familiar with Panama Canal problems. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I reiterate the recommendation in my August 31 statement for a full and complete investigation by the Congress into what has occurred as regards the Panama Canal. This investigation should include consideration of whether the projected giveaway of the Canal Zone. which proposal is in line with resolutions of the 1966 TriContinental Conference of Communist Parties at Havana. can yield better protection for the United States and LatinAmerican nations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in previous addresses of mine dealing with Panama Canal and Caribbean policy questions. I have stressed the longrange Communist program for conquest of the strategic Caribbean basin through the processes of infiltration. subversion and revolutionary violence. This program is now far advanced with proved Cuban complicity in student riots. guerrilla operations. and political assassinations in Panama. Colombia. Guatemala. Venezuela. Honduras. and Nicaragua. In fact. one avowed aim of this organized terror is to create in Colombia and Venezuela a vast Vietnam in the Western Hemisphere. As a matter fact. we should expect such a development as a diversionary effort to force withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam. Lest there be any doubt as to its objectives. I shall quote the resolutions passed by the proCommunist TrContinental Conference of African. Asian. and Latin American Peoples in January 1966 at Havana in Castros Cuba. One is a general resolution emphasizing that the \"struggle Is to the death\" and \"with revolutionary violence.\" another concerns Puerto Rico. a third the Canal Zone. and a fourth Cuba in which our naval base at Guantanamo Is located. These three points. the Canal Zone. Guantanamo. and Puerto Rico. form what the resolutions describe as the Caribbean triangle. For those who may wish to have fuller information on the objectives of the Communist program for Caribbean and Latin American countries attention is invited to the staff study on \"The TriContinental Conference of African. Asian. and Latin American Peoples\" recently issued as a committee print by the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. From a reading of this alarming document. I can draw no other conclusion than that those in our Government who. whatever their purposes may be in advocating the retrocession to Panama of our treatybased sovereignty over the Canal Zone. are. in effect. actually aiding and abetting the spread of communistic terrorism and power throughout all countries of the Western Hemisphere. Section 5 of the indicated staff study. which summarizes the resolutions adopted by the TriContinental Conference. follows:",

The Schering Foundation is a philanthropic organization supported by the Schering Corp.. a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer with headquarters In my congressional district. in Bloomfield. N.J. The foundations chairman. Francis C. Brown. presented the gift. which he described as \"one of the most significant grants made by the foundation in its 10year history of support to higher education in the United States.\" Scherings gift marks a milestone in philanthropy in the field of pharmacology. for it is the first corporate sponsored foundation chair to a medical center in the United States. The Reverend Gerard J. Campbell. president of Georgetown. accepted for the university the gift which represents the first chair in Georgetowns 177year history. The chair will provide in perpetuity for the teaching services of a leading pharmacological scholar and staff assistants in a vital area of the health sciences. and it is expected to play an important role in expanding the curriculum of the universitys medicaldental center. Mr. Speaker. I am proud that this outstanding firm from my district has led the way in the effort to improve medical teaching facilities which are so increasingly needed throughout the country.

Under section 6015(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. farmers who elect to file their income tax in the early part of the year and to make at the same time a declaration of estimated tax. are required to file that document by February 15. As a practical matter many farmers find this date unduly restrictive. since many farm cooperative organizations meet after the first of the year to fix their returns for the preceding year. and in some cases they have not completed their determination in time for the Februal 15 deadline. My bill. therefore. postponed this deadline to March 15. This recommendation. incidentally. is in line with a recent recommendation of the American Bar Association.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit for appropriate reference a resolution urging the President to raise tariffs on papermaking machinery through procedures prescribed by Article XVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Ample justification for increasing the import duty on this product can be found in figures illustrating the impact of the first 2 years of the currently effective reduced tariff. From 1962 to 1965. U.S. imports of papermaking machinery rose 211 percent while exports dropped 20 percent. In this period. the Nations favorable trade balance in this item slumped by 42 percent and our share of the worlds export trade in it declined from 24 percent to 17 percent. Although domestic papermaking machinery manufacturers do not allege that the industry is in desperate straits. the figures I have cited represent a $22 million loss which cannot be sustained lightly. Furthermore. deeper inroads into the U.S. market and consequently greater economic distress for manufacturers and employees are inevitable if the threat posed by lowcost foreign competition is not blunted. The industry is seeking a restoration of the preGATT tariff on papermaking machinery. This is a moderate adjustment which would not appreciably affect other countries. whose volume of trade in this item is only a paperthin slice of their total export trade with the United States. In 1964. paper industry machinery exports to the United States from the principal foreign suppliers in no case equaled as much as onetenth of 1 percent of its total export trade. The United States can secure the proposed modification simply by exercising the prerogative of all GATT contracting parties to withdraw or revise a tariff concession at the expiration of its 3year assured life. Adjustments must be initiated by a notification to the other GATT contracting parties in the 6 months \"open season\" prior to the terminal date and they should be accompanied by efforts to preserve the overall balance of trade advantages. The terminal date for the current GATT concessions is December 31. 1966. However. if the action called for in the resolution I introduce today is not taken before the concessions lapse. they will automatically resume on January 1. 1967. I hope that the President will not ignore this opportunity to check a slipping trade balance and benefit U.S. production and employment.",

This should not prevent the antiriot amendment from becoming law. In view of the fact that the House has already approved this legislation by a vote of 389 to 25.

My bill would make it a criminal offense for any person to travel in Interstate commerce or to use the mail with the intent to incite or encourage a riot or other civil disturbance.

At a time when schools and colleges are hard pressed to find enough teachers to staff the classrooms the proposals of IRS are ironic indeed.

It has already been shown that a reduction of $1 in expenditures for agricultural programs results in a decline in farm income of $2. Any substantial decline in farm income must. of necessity. bring with it a decline in the buying power of the farmers. A1170 In the past several years. the President has recommended. and the Congress has passed. legislation to cut taxes as a device to stimulate the economic growth of this country. The fact that the farmers of this country buy an important part of all the goods and services produced in America seems to me to mean that we must protect the buying power of the American farmer. It makes anything but good sense to pass tax cuts on the one hand. and turn around and injure the economic health of one very important segment of the economy by curtailing farm programs when these programs produce so much in increased economic activity.

This is unfortunate because the recent increase in the export of domestic hides has been of value to the industry. These complaints come from livestock producers in my State. The imposition of these controls by the Department of Commerce seems to be inconsistent with the stated goals of our national policy. First of all. we have been encouraging freer movement in our international trade without restrictions. Also. we have been encouraging initiative and free enterprise in the livestock industry. a position which this segment of our economy supports with great gusto. What we have done with these new regulations is to establish trade barriers and to control initiative in an industry which has found an expanding market. The export market Is bringing new income to an industry which has had its ups and downs financially In recent years. This is a matter which must be reviewed carefully. Both my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Montana and I have expressed sentiments to both the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture suggesting a rescinding of these export controls. We were very pleased to receive the announcement yesterday from the Secretary of Commerce Indicating that he had recognized the situation.

In this year. 1966. which has been designated as the \"Year of the Bible.\" it would be fitting that the President of the United States proclaim a National Day of Prayer. This country is in need of prayer. as are its leaders. its fighting men. and its people. Prayer and Biblereading are companions that complement and supplement one another. This year. special attention is being given to the printed Word of God which can be obtained in any one of 1.232 languages and dialects. Hundreds of millions of copies of the Bible are printed each year and distributed to those seeking the truth. Truly. it is a great work. inspired by God. and sets forth the hope of the world. I am pleased that the Senate has adopted a resolution designating 1966 as the \"Year of the Bible.\" Every conceivable effort that our leaders can make to point our people back to the Bible and God must be made. Prayer is communication with God. We are to praise God for His goodness to us and the many blessings He has bestowed upon us. We are to ask the Lord for wisdom and guidance. and confess our dependence upon Him. We are to come to Him In the time of need and ask for His divine assistance and protection. Today. we see a nation founded on Christian principles. following trends of moral rot and decay. We see a nation that has been blessed and protected by the hand of God. turning away from God. We see a nation that has championed religious freedom and freedom of education and expression. echoing the chants of a few misguided souls who claim that God is dead. Mr. President. our people need to reaffirm their conviction and belief in God. Never before have we needed divine guidance and wisdom so desperatelyfrom the perils within as well as those on the outside. Prayer can bring that needed guidance. wisdom. strength. peace of mind. joy. confidence. and the courage to do the things we should do. Prayer is powerfuland this country needs that power. Mr. President. I introduce a joint resolution authorizing the President to issue a proclamation designating a \"National Day of Prayer.\" I ask that the resolution be printed In the RECORD. and lie on the table for 5 days for additional cosponsors.",

On March 21 of this yearmore than a month and a half agoI urged the Secretary of the Interior to seek the services of Peace Corps volunteers for Micronesia which the Interior Department administers. In my letter to Secretary Udall. I stated that it was \"not only proper but a matter of priority that the Micronesians receive urgent assistance from the Peace Corps.\" Specifically I referred to the need for improving education. medical and health services. economic development. and other activities. Secretary Udall responded to me at that time by saying that \"your proposal is indeed intriguing and we shall want to study it very carefully.\" It was my concern over the failure of the Interior Department to utilize Peace Corps volunteers long before now which prompted me to write to Secretary Udall. For it has been evident for some time that the Interior Department has not come to grips with the many problems of this far flung and underdeveloped area of the western Pacific. I am very pleased. therefore. that the Interior Department now agrees with my proposal to use Peace Corps volunteers in the Trust Territory. I am doubly happy that both the Interior Department and the Peace Corps are moving with unusual swiftness to carry out my proposal.

Hundreds of Peace Corps volunteers have been trained for service in various Asian countries at the Hilo campus of the University of Hawaii and at the Peace Corps camp in Waipo Valley operated by the university. both located on the big island of Hawaii. The experience already gained by the Peace Corps staffs in Hawaii will be of great value in training the prospective volunteers for the trust territory. The Peace Corps volunteers will give the Micronesians the kind of practical assistance they need and have asked forin education. community development. public health and public works. The volunteers will thereby help the trust territory people build the social. economic and political basis for selfgovernment. As the Micronesians progress. they will be better able to decide the type of political status they wish for themselves. Looking toward this eventuality. I introduced in the Senate. on August 18. 1965. a resolution which would open the way for the trust territory to be included in the State of Hawaii if the people of Hawaii and the trust territory are in favor of such inclusion. The assignment of Peace Corps volunteers to the trust territory will go a long way toward preparing the Micronesians to decide their future status.

Presently before the Congress is the Health Manpower Act designed to provide more medical technologists. biomedical engineers. dental hygienists. and other collegetrained specialists. Although these Federal programs are making a valuable contribution. there is a great need for complementary local action. I am. therefore. particularly pleased to note an outstanding example of such initiative in my own State directed at a solution to the critical shortage of trained nurses. Knowledge of this local effort came to me in the form of an editorial in the Journal of the Arkansas Medical Society. condensed and reprinted in the Arkansas Gazette.

Jr.. describes a plan originally conceived by Mrs. Mildred Armour. head of the Arkansas Baptist School of Nursing. and later adapted in the form of a proposal of the Pulaski County Medical Society.

They resigned in protest against U.S. domination. They need the United States of America. America needs them. They are close to home on this hemisphere. However. Americas military power must be maintained second to none. It is extremely useful and necessary In maintaining a balance of power still essential to preventing world war three. That does not mean that the worlds peace can be kept only by military force. It does mean that it is a great help In stabilizing situations. I am increasingly concerned about Americas position in the major developments that are taking place in a fermenting worldin which we seem to be getting every day closer to some irreversible positionand the fragmentation of the free nations blocas we have come seriously close in Vietnam. I believe that the worlds problems can be kept manageable for peace by sound pragmatic policies that are based neither on overreliance on military powernor the millennium claimed for the United Nationsnor the illusions of free elections in the midst of terror. Big spending in foreign aid programs is not a substitute for equity in a foreign policy.",

Hawaii has had many great friends. History will some day record that LEO OBRIEN was one of our greatest friends. When Congressman OBRIEN leaves Congress at the close of the 2d session of the 89th Congress. he will have completed nearly 14 years of faithful service to the people of New Yorks 29th Congressional District. to the people of the State of New York. and to his Nation. He will be remembered for all his good works by many countless thousands of people. and he will be forever remembered by the people of Hawaii as the stalwart defender and advocate of Hawaiis bid for statehood. LEO OBRIEN had the distinction of serving as the floor manager of the Alaska and Hawaii statehood bills. Therefore. Mr. President. may I. in behalf of the people of Hawaii. say mahalo to LEO OBRIEN. and to wish him the very best in the years to come. LEO OBRIEN is truly one of the finest men I have ever met along lifes pathway.

However. the facts and figures available from the various agencies of our Government indicate with complete clarity that American agriculture is actually the victim rather than the villain of the inflation which the reckless spending programs of this Johnson administration have stimulated.

Today we have altered the phrase. \"my flag.\" to \"the flag of the United States of America.\" and we have added the words \"under God.\" Otherwise. the pledge remains as Bellamy wrote it. and this pledge. and the spirit of loyalty which it inspires and expresses. stands today as a lasting memorial to the great soul and penetrating mind of Francis Bellamy.

Such a speech was one given recently at the Magazine Publishers Association by Edward Weeks. the editor who made the Atlantic Monthly important reading for all of us over many years. It concerns first the art of tombsmanship. a subject not recently discussed on the Senate floor but close to Mr. Weeks heart because of his recent retirement. I defy any one to read it without smiling. A hearty laugh will follow when one reads his account of \"naked diplomacy\" during the Teddy Roosevelt administration and his description of one man at one desk in the State Department in 1937 \"trying to cope with the riptide of Russian aggression.\" Editor Weeks gives us an idea to brood over when he quotes Sir Oliver Franks on the danger of a diplomat being away from Washington at the moment that this country \"wakes up and finds itself in agreement.\" He gives examples of the part magazines play in bringing the Nations readers to \"that instant of crystallization\" of sentiment. He shows us some of the ways \"our national confusion\" gets resolved. He closes with a sentence about the United States which I believe any Member of the Senateany official in a democracywill cherish: Gentlemen. if there is a more fearless and independent body of readers anywhere in the world. I would not know where to find it. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the speech be printed in the RECORD. I commend it to Senators.

I wish to call attention to the immediate and unfavorable reaction which resulted from the action of the House Appropriations Committee last week in disapproving funds for Project Mohole. Specifically. I refer to two editorials from responsible newspapers expressing concern over the future of the project. One editorial appeared in the Honolulu advertiser last Saturday. the other in the Washington Post this morning. Both make a strong case for continuing this scientific project as a matter of national interest. As one who has long supported Project Mohole. I take the view that the project should be continuedthat its potential for providing mankind with new and needed scientific information about the earths structure outweighs the costs involved. I quote from the Honolulu Advertisers editorial: It is possible to sympathize with the Representatives in their enormous task of trying to squeeze waste out of a $14 billion money bill for 23 Federal agencies. We wish them luck so long as the cutting and pruning are judiciously exercised and those projects tossed on the scrap heap are truly expendable. That is good Government. But we are budgeting billions for space exploration. It is deemed in the national interest to do so and to land a man on the moon by 1970. It makes no sense. therefore. to eliminate the one project afoot that may tell us what matter we will find out there and how to cope with it. A kill in funds now would kill the entire program-\"As if we had never started.\" said Dr. George P. Woollard. head of the Institute of Geophysics here at the university and spearhead of the Mohole projectS30 million would be down the drain. It seems at this moment when the spending of Federal funds is being examined so critically. we may find that we cannot afford not to go ahead with Mohole. If what the scientists say is true about its value to the space program. we shall have to come back to it eventuallybehind the Russians?-at a time when the cost could be billions. not millions. I commend the Honolulu Advertiser for stating the case for restoring funds for Project Mchole so clearly and cogently. The Washington Post editorial also advances convincing arguments against abandoning the project. I ask unanimous consent to have the Post editorial printed in the RECORD.",

Railroad commuter service in our metropolitan New JerseyNew York region is about to be reduced still further. By now everyone should know that you cannot help ailing railroads by lopping off a fewor manytrains. Invariably the effect is to accelerate the downhill slide by driving the evershrinking band of patrons to other. more convenient. more dependable means of transportation. Commuter passenger service will survive only if the commuter can be attracted back to the trains. But to do this will require providing frequent. reliable. ontime. comfortable trains and safe. clean. attractive terminals. This. in turn. will require. as I long have urged. the development of a unified. balanced transportation system to serve the whole region. not just a few parts of it.

At the end of the year if Senator X has $1.000 or $1.500 left over and he has spent up to that amount of money back in his State all he does is submit a voucher to the Disbursing Office showing expenditures for official business and collect. On telephone calls if we have calls back in the State. we itemize them as official calls and are reimbursed under the existing law. This amendment would use exactly the same formula. Now the only difference is that if a Senator does not use his telephone allowance. it automatically reverts to the Treasury. That is all that I am suggesting here for the stationery allowance. The difference between this amendment and the existing law is that a Senator would be reimbursed only for actual expenditures. This is on the premise that it does not belong to the Senator if he has not spent it for office supplies. It should automatically go back to the Treasury as in the case of every other allowance that is made available for a senatorial office.

I do not know whether this increased allowance affects the Senators State or not. I believe that the Federal Government should underwrite the official costs of our offices. All I am saying is that if there is some left over it should not go into the pocket of a Senator or Congressman. I agree with what the Senator has said. This would not change the use of this money for stationery and office supplies at all. It would not change that point one iota. Since I have been in the Senate. if I recall correctly. the first allowance was either $300 or $500. this was about 20 years ago. I am now allowed $2.400. When this allowance was raised from $1.800 to $2.400. I supported it. I said that I did not need it for my office. but those States that did need it could use it. I said that as to those offices that did not need it it would not cost any more money. it would merely increase the amount refunded to the Treasury.

I wonder if the Senator. by his amendment. means to preclude any of these activities being paid out of the stationery fund which. as I said in the beginning. has been interpreted as being designed to permit our communications. free and ample. between the offices of Senators in Washington and their constituents in the States they represent.",

Generals Lee and Grant. as well as the peace that was achieved that day 100 years ago. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant III. a grandson of General Grant. and Robert E.

This courageous action deserves tribute from all of us who have supported the cause of the State of Israel. These actionsthe recognition of Israel and the extension of the statute of limitationsare in stark contrast to the position taken by the Soviet puppet government in East Germany. That Government has done everything possible during the past 20 years to create chaos in Europe. From the Berlin airlift to the Berlin wall. East Germany has demonstrated the lack of interest of its Soviet masters in securing peace in Germany or for that matter anywhere in the world. Concomitantly. East Germany has done nothing whatever to atone for Germanys crimes during the Second World War. No Nazis are being tried or traced behind the Iron Curtain. Little or no cooperation in making records of the Nazis period available has been received from the Soviets or their satellites. No restitution has been made to the Jewish victims of nazism from them. No help has come to Israel from them. What has come from behind the Berlin wall? A pledge of $100 million to assist President Nasser of Egypt. Israel Is the only existing democracy in the Middle East.

In fact the only respite they enjoyed as a nation came with the dissolution of Russian power and at that time they declared their independence.

In recalling this anniversary date. perhaps we can accomplish two things: One. in some way let the Byelorussian people know that Americans do not for one moment believe that Byelorussian incorporation into the U.S.S.R. was a free and independent act on the part of the Byelorussian peoples. and two. to remind ourselves that our freedom and independence is a cherished goal denied to millions who live behind the iron curtain.A brief review of the history of the Byelorussian people may give a renewed meaning to our own freedoms. Although the Byelorussians were a defined cultural and social group as early as the 10th century. their subjugation to Russia began in the 15th century when their country was overrun by the \"barbaric Muscovite hordes.\" For more than the next 300 years. the Byelorussians were completely oppressed by czarist Russia. One would think that after 300 years the people would have lost all of their national feeling and unity. but this was not the case. for when czarist Russia fell to the Communists in the Russian Revolution of 1917. these people declared their independence March 25. 1918just 47 years ago. At the time the Byelorussian National Republic was proclaimed the country was occupied by the Germans. but when the Germans left. the Communists moved in. and early in 1921. just about 3 years after independence. the Red Army occupied the country and independence came to an end. Since the 15th century. except for 3 years. the Byelorussians have lived under Russian rule. Although we cannot give the Byelorussian people their independence. we can give them the best wishes of the American people as they remember a happy date in their history47 years ago.",

It came to my attention that in publications of the Board of Foreign Scholarships. and the related U.S. Advisory Commission on International Education and Cultural Affairs. the true relationship of public programs to private programs was not presented. Public programs of educational exchange. which represent at most an estimated 10 percent of all such programs. are presented as the crucial element without which private programs would either be impossible or ineffective. Public educational exchange programs must be considered supplementary to private programs. The role of the public program must be to coordinate private programs. and provide additional services when needed. Their ultimate effect must be to stimulate and enrich private activity. rather than to smother it. We have all become aware of the extensive efforts of private educational. missionary and other private institutions in the field of international educational and cultural exchange--efforts which have in some cases existed for over 100 years. I was heartened by Mr. Stalnakers fundamental agreement with my views. and particularly by his statement in his February 8 letter to me that he hoped \"the Board will use the theme of public and private programs for one oi its future reports.\" I strongly endorse his suggestion.

On what levels do the two programs operatesecondary. college level. or both? What are the requirements for a student taking part in the Government program as opposed to the private programs?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill which I have long felt has been needed. The bill is designed to take all postmaster appointments of the first. second. and third classes out of politics and place them under the civil service merit system. The Postmaster General. rather than the President. would make the appointments of postmasters on the basis of competitive examinations. Under the bill I have introduced. Senate confirmation would not be required. in fact. no political test or qualification would be permitted. It is my strong belief that the present method of using postmasterships as political patronage severely weakens the postal system. For example. a clerk with long and efficient experience and genuine ability does not have an opportunity for promotion to postmaster unless he has the proper political clout. I am aware of situations in some States whereby postmasters are regularly appointed and soon fired because of the changing political picture in these States. In other cases. postmasters have been serving for years under \"temporary\" or \"acting\" status. This is so because the politicians cannot come to agreement on a permanent appointment. In places where this kind of a situation takes place. the morale of employees is low and service is often correspondingly low. If the civil service merit system has value. and I believe that it has. I see no reason why it cannot be applied in the case of postmaster appointments. The adoption of this system will enable us to attract the most able persons into postal service and will introduce a certain professionalism into the service. These definite plus factors. combined with others. more than justify legislation of the kind I suggest.",

The bill also considers educational costs of parttime students and makes adjustments for scholarships and educational allowances. This kind of legislation is much more meaningful than much of the talk we hear today about tax cuts. An allowed deduction for educational expenses should serve as a stimulus to higher learning. too. This kind of legislation is of special importance to lower income families. as it provides for greater percentage deductions for those with lesser gross incomes.

A mark of a great organization is its steadfastness toward the purposes for which it is established. The United States is such a society. and the Disabled American Veterans is such an organization. Since the Revolutionary War and the founding of the Republic. it has been a cardinal principle of our laws that disabled soldiers be compensated for their sacrifices on the battlefield and that care be taken of the widows and children of those who never returned to their homes. This policy is not only in keeping with principles of humanity and justice but it has given our soldiers the feeling that their society cared. Over the centuries. the American soldier has fought and prevailed in battles all over the globe because he knew that he was fighting for a country which was concerned with his welfare and that of his family. This is good social policy. This is good military policy. Soldiers from Bunker Hill to Vietnam have fought better and harder because America cared. Our survival as a nation has. in large part. been based on this simple principle. The DAys important task is to make sure that we do not forget our obligations to our citizen soldiers. In this it has been successful. Today. which represents the 34th anniversary of the charter by Congress. affirms our responsibility to those who have fallen in the service of their country. The record of the DAV since its founding in 1919 has shown a single mindedness in serving the disabled veteran. It has carried on during periods of national indifference. The DAV continues to sponsor legislation to aid the disabled veteran and it sees to it that the veteran gets proper representation so that his rights on paper are rights in fact. Mr. Speaker.

Over the years. the Disabled American Veterans have not only aimed for this goal of assisting in every possible way the wounded. the injured and the disabled veteran and his dependents. but the DAV has succeeded in hitting its target time after time. Certainly. a great many of the laws pertaining to the disabled veteran and his special problems very likely would not be law today if it had not been for the efforts of the DAV to acquaint the Congress and the American public of the need for such assistance to those who gave so much for their country. Certainly. many of the hospitals and much of the treatment for the wounded veteran would not have come into being if it had not been for the activities of the DAV in pointing out the need for such adequate facilities. Certainly. many veterans would not have received benefits or been afforded treatment to which they were entitled if it had not been for the DAV and its excellent staff of highly trained service officers who have given free assistance to more than 1.500.000 disabled veterans and their families over the years. It is this kind of assistance. it Is these kinds of help which have earned for the DAV the respect of Congress. the American public and the veteran. It is a pleasure to pay tribute to the Disabled American Veterans as an organization and to its individual members for their energies. their competence. their compassion and their proven patriotism.

These men. like Judge Marx. carried grim reminders of warbattle scars. disabling injuries. gasseared lungs. and prolonged illness. Two years later. in 1921. the DAV held its first national convention and elected Judge Marx as its first national commander. From that beginning the DAV has grown to more than 231.000 members todayveterans of our two major wars. the Korean war and the war In Vietnam. National headquarters is still in Cincinnati. For years. we as the more fortunate Americans. have received the miniature license plates. which when registered by a return card assure the return of automobile keys or such valuables when lost.

DAV national service officers have given free assistance to more than 1.500.000 disabled veterans and their families in obtaining medical care. hospitalization. disability compensation. rehabilitation. job training. and employment.

From its birth in 1919. the Disabled American Veterans has unfailingly concerned itself with those courageous Americans who have suffered injury or disability from their participation in wartime activities In an effort to preserve American democracy and a kind of life that has always been Americas heritage. The Disabled American Veterans close identification with the disabled veterans of those wars in which Americans have taken part is clearly seen in its role as defender of the physical health and welfare of the disabled and their dependents. Pervading its history. its achievements. and its goals is the principle on which the Disabled American Veterans was foundedthe fulfillment of the needs of the wartime disabled by the institution of a rehabilitation program. The reliance and dedication of the Disabled American Veterans to this principle have resulted in the establishment of a sound and useful program of rehabilitation for the disabled. The Disabled American Veterans services and legislative programs have done a great deal for the disabled and their dependents. its manifold aims of the future can be even more successful if the organization is able to secure complete assistance from its own members. a vocal expression in the Halls of Congress. and increased distribution of its identotags. minature automobile license plates which serve as a valuable means of returning lost keys to their owners. The Disabled American Veterans has set up 14 major goals for the -next year to aid the disabled veterans and their dependents in areas of compensation. education. hospitalization. employment. and other vital matters that could hopefully and helpfully satisfy the needs of the disabled. The Disabled American Veterans have in many ways made life more worth living for the disabled. By the establishment of a good rehabilitation program. which it hopes to strengthen and expand continuously. it has designed a program to help the injured and disabled veterans of our Nations wars to help themselves. This is sure evidence that the obligations Inherent in obtaining a congressional charter 34 years ago have been pursued by the Disabled American Veterans seriously and sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to extend my warmest congratulations today to the Disabled American Veterans on its 34th anniversary as a national veterans organization. I am very proud of its record of achievement in serving Americas wartime disabled during these years. I am proud to commend the DAV for faithfully following its single purposea nonpartisan policy of advancing the cause of the disabled exserviceman. his widow. dependents. and orphans. Mr. Speaker. the problems and needs of those gallant Americans disabled in wartime require constant attention and immediate solutions. To effectively perform this service. the disabled formed their own organization. So. for nearly a half century the DAV has been seeing that the disabled veteran and his dependents get proper treatment through working in close liaison with the Veterans Administration. Some veterans would have scant knowledge of the law. so the DAV helps in many cases to initiate the proper action with the VA. To champion the cause of the disabled veteran requires considerable manpower. money. and facilities. and to financially maintain an organization of that size is itself a huge job. But the DAV doeswithout a cent of Federal money. While it utilizes the regional offices of the Veterans Administration. the DAV pays its own employees and officersfulltime counselors who offer their services to all disabled veterans whether they are members or not. Although the national headquarters is located in Cincinnati. the DAV operates an active legislative and national service headquarters here in Washington. Mr. Speaker. the DAV is unique as an independently sustained service organization in these days of an expanding Federal Government. Its operation is financed partially from membership dues. but private industry. long interested in rehabilitation of our veterans. also provides valuable assistance. To the members of DAV. and those helping this splendid organization financially or otherwise. I urge youkeep up your wonderful work In behalf of our veterans.",

Its sole. nonpartisan purpose Is to provide service and assistance to the wartime disabled. his widow. orphans. and dependents. To this end. the 1.834 local chapters and 231.000 DAV members employ a corps of 150 professionally trained national service officers. each a disabled veteran. in the Veterans Administration regional offices throughout the Nation to assist those needing help. Since the end of World War II. these DAV officers have given free assistance to more than 1.500.000 disabled veterans and their families in obtaining medical care. hospitalization. rehabilitation. job training. and so forth. To me. this Is an inspiring example which is very much in the American tradition. The war in Vietnam has placed fresh burdens on all the veterans organizations. including the Disabled American Veterans organization.

The DAV has throughout its lifetime helped those of our citizens who. by serving in the Armed Forces of our country. have suffered some injury or ailment which. in varying degrees. has had an adverse effect upon their physical wellbeing. It has guided these men so as to bear their crosses with patience and pride. and it has given the rest of us a chance to show our appreciation through the purchase of the famed DAV IdentoTags and other means.

Carl Sandburg. the great American writer. folksinger. and patriot. shared their belief in the goodness and righteousness of our country. It is a striking coincidence that not quite 34 years ago Carl Sandburg wrote \"The People Yes\" which he characterized as being \"several stories and psalms nobody would want to laugh at.\" Indeed. \"The People Yes\" is not a laughing matter but a sincere effort to paint a picture of that vital force who build. work. fight. and die for the dignity of man. Mr. Sandburg wrote about: -Tombs for the Unknown Soldier. The boy nobody knows the name of. The boy whose great fame is that of the masses. The millions of names too many to write on a tomb. The heroes. the cannonfodder. the living targets. The mutilated and sacred dead. The people. yes. We salute these people today who have fought to protect our precious form of government.

Born on the basis of a voluntary organization of disabled veterans in 1919. the DAV has faithfully directed itself toward solution of the problems and needs of the wartime disabled. Serving as a clearinghouse for all matters concerning veterans with serviceconnected disabilities. the DAV has seen to it that Americas disabled veteran and his dependents are properly cared for. Nearly all beneficial legislation affecting disabled veterans since 1920 has been sponsored by the DAV. The success of the organizations efforts is reflected in membership growth from a handful to 231.000 members.

Here was a perfect example of how these three diverse elements can be brought together successfully and creatively. to achieve a result thousands of municipalities would have envied.

The dedication of the post office enlargement was a product of the efforts of men of the caliber of Charles Shapiro. chairman of the planning committee. H.

Even the inclement weather that threatened to mar the festivities could not dampen the spirits of these men nor their memorable program. Many came nonethelessall knew it was worth it when they left.

H.R. 9626. would be a major step toward eliminating the abuses uncovered by the Senate committee. My bill would amend sections 305 and 310 of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act by turning over administration of that act to the Comptroller General of the United States. At present. all lobbyists are required to file their reports with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. But there is a noticeable lack of any law to make an agency or official responsible for the administration or enforcement of the act. I feel that the Comptroller General is the proper authority in that he is not only an arm of Congress itself. but he has an investigative staff at his disposal. Thus the Comptroller General is admirably equipped to determine whether lobbyists reports are accurate or not and whether the statutes terms are being complied with fully. H.R. 9626 would authorize the Comptroller General to study and review the reports and then to determine whether they meet the standards of the act. Among the other powers provided for in the bill is the provision that the Comptroller General can ascertain whether all lobbyists have registered in compliance with the law. I think that the Senate report makes it abundantly clear that not all lobbyists have done so. When violations are discovered. the Comptroller General would report them to the appropriate law enforcement agencies of the Government. The Comptroller General would also be directed to. make studies of the lobbying problem and transmit his recommendations to Congress if the recommendations would further the objectives of my bill. The bill would require further that the Comptroller General send to Congress a copy of each lobbyists report where it would be on public record for 2 years. Mr. Speaker. there can be no doubt that the Senate committee has laid bare unethical practices by lobbyists to the publics critical eye. Such practices by lobbyists must be stopped if Congress is to deserve public confidence. Fallacious Intervention Position",

To me. this would be incredible. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 6400 is purported to be a bill to abolish discrimination. It is an antiSouth billpolitically inspired and contrived and aimed at the only section of the Nation which the administration did not carry in the last election and cannot control today. How can any man vote for a bill designed to prohibit voter discrimination in only 6 States and thus impliedly sanction discrimination in the other 44 States? The very bill the administration claims will end discrimination will. in fact. set up a form of discrimination against six States of the Union. Under the guise of voting rights. six Southern States are being punished for having voted wrong. H.R. 6400 is not a just bill. nor was it designed to be just. How can any bill creating two classes of people or States be considered just or fair? Are we in the South to become secondclass citizens? If we are to pass a bill. let us treat everyone alike and apply its provisions equally. The passage by the House of H.R. 6400 will be one more giant step toward a totalitarian government.

Mr. Turnbulls article clearly illustrates that we are moving from surpluses to scarcities. I believe the Members of Congress from agricultural areas. and others who regularly read the RECORD. will agree that this article accurately and timely describes the situation.",

The bill would authorize grants to States which establish parttime employment programs for senior citizens over the age of 60 in projects of value to the community. Small salaries of up to $125 a month could be paid. and these salaries would not interfere with social security benefits. Ideally. most of the participants would be volunteers who would need only outofpocket expenses. I can think of a million things that our senior citizens can do to brighten the lives of the people of their communities. They can work in handicraft centers. in hospitals. daycare centers. careercounseling centers. and other places where they would supplement and not displace regular members of the work force. Just as important as the aid that would be rendered to others is the selfrespect and sense of accomplishment that participation in this program would give our senior citizens. Perhaps this is really the most important aspect of this legislation. It would be a program of Federal investment in the ageold tradition of human selfrespect.

    "speech": "draft convention. largely following European practice. restricts the taxation of capital gains to the country of residence. except as to gains on real property and assets effectively connected with a permanent establishment. While this approach is at variance with some of our prior treaties. it often has been followed by us in the past. Moreover. the approach is based on the desirability of a free movement of capital and the difficulties of effectively taxing capital gains in the source country in an orderly way. Consequently. the German and Netherland protocols provide generally for the exemption at source of capital gains. The German protocol excepts from exemption shortterm gains. on assets held for 6 months or less. where the taxpayer has resided in the source country for 183 days or more. This exception in the case of a taxpayer with an extended presence. i.e.. 183 days. in the source country is likely to appear in our various treaties. A stay of that length seems to warrant a tax liability to the source country. especially where the gains are speculative in nature as in the case of assets held for a short period of time. Moreover. in many countries. such a stay will make a taxpayer a \"resident.\" and hence subject to tax on capital gains.

I would like to present some factual statistics concerning the program. The present aid program represents less than sixtenths of 1 percent of our gross national product. and less than 31/2 percent of the Federal budget. These percentages are the lowest since the program began in the 1940s. More than 80 percent of all aid dollars are spent for U.S. goods and services. Less than half was spent on U.S. goods 5 years ago. The programs impact on our balance of payments is thus a rather minor factor. It is far smaller. for example. than tourist expenditures or luxury imports. No fewer than 14 recipient countries are now in the process of transition from depending on aid to relying on more normal sources of lending and investment. So the program has not been without successes. Recently President Johnson has proposed several changes to further streamline and improve our foreign aid program.

The following article which reflects the consensus of todays youth and their high regard for law and order recently appeared in the Voice of Youth Column of the Chicago Tribune: ARE You A TRAITOR? (By Mark Slack. Dixon junior) According to the famous English philosopher. John Locke. everyone is born with certain Godgiven rights. among these are life. liberty. and property. He also believed that the Government should protect these rights. These beliefs are the ones around which our Government was formed. We still believe in this theory almost 200 years later. There are some persons. though. who do not seem to concern themselves with these rightspersons who are so prejudiced they have taken the lives of civil rights workers. persons who are so indolent. they have abused their liberty by not voting. and persons so blinded by intolerance they have destroyed anothers property. Who do people think they are that they can take away Godgiven rights? To me they are traitors to themselves. to God. and to the United States of America.

During the last fiscal year this program benefited more than 90.000 schools and child care institutions. The amount appropriated for the special milk program during the current fiscal year was $103 million. According to the Milk Industry Foundation. the school nMilk program and the national school lunch program accounted for the usage of nearly 3 billion pounds of milk. If the milk had not been used it would probably have been acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation where at present support prices it would have cost the taxpayers exactly the same amount of money as was required to finance this program which is so highly beneficial to the nourishment and health of American schoolchildren. Mr. Speaker. It makes very little sense to fund new expenditures and untried programs which cost many millions of dollars more and then penalize a tried and true program like the special milk program or the school lunch program. I am amazed that an administration which professes to be so interested in fighting the war against poverty and in doing something about school dropouts is so shortsighted in its approach to these problems. Furthermore. as a Representative from an area where dairying constitutes an important part of the farmers cash income. I am distressed that the Governments false economy will result in a curtailment of the consumption of milk.

I am sure. to the distinguished Senator from Vermont . to note the continually Increasing support for the Human Investment Act. This support is being expressed not only in Congress. but by individuals and organizations across the Nation who are concerned about our manpower problems. Looking beyond the latest official jobless rate of 4.4 percent we can discount. to a degree. that segment of these approximately 3 million Americans who may be idle of their own accord. or who are not breadwinners. or who are between jobs. Yet. there still remains what has come to be known as our hardcore unemployed. Recent in depth studies of our manpower problems indicate the existence of well over 2 million job openings going begging. The conclusion must be drawn. then. that our problem arises from the lack of skillsnot the lack of jobs. The jobless are not statistics. The jobless are men and women. each a human being with dignity and worth. Welfare rolls are not their goal In life. Many of the highly publicized Federal training programs are not supplying the proper and sufficient answers either. S. 2509 does provide a constructive approach toward meeting this skills shortage and thus alleviating the unemployment problem. This legislation would encourage the private sector of our economy to place increased emphasis on already existing jobtraining programs by providing a tax credit incentive. Certainly both labor and management have excellent records of long standing in the field of job training. Is It necessary for the Federal Government to go into this area in which it cannot possibly match the effectiveness of private programs? I think not. However. It is both just and necessary that the Federal Government encourage the private sector to increase Its efforts. We give tax credits for investments in machines and equipment. Can we do less for investments in human beings? It is a privilege. then. for me to join with the many who have commended Senator PROUTY here in the Senate and a number of Representatives in the House for this thoughtful approach to this area of concern and I would be honored if at the next printing.

On the inflation question. the Secretary cautioned against any price increases and urged continued cooperative effort of business. labor. and government. stating. however. that there is no sufficient evidence to justify higher interest rates because of any threat of inflation.

We who opposed the Dirksen amendment always believed that there was a better chance of beating the amendment in the House than in the Senat6. The original rotten borough amendment. Senate Joint Resolution 2. was defeated in the Senate last August 4. while its stepchild. Senate Joint Resolution 103. appears to have little chance of passage in the Senate next year. I find it heartening to know there is continued opposition in the House of Representatives. One dynamic and outspoken young Congressman.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Federal Reserve System holds in its open market account approximately $40 billion in interestbearing U.S. Government securities acquired over time pursuant to purchases in the bond market. These securities were acquired from private holders and resulted in a credit to the total reserves of the commercial banking system. The seller of the bonds would receive either a demand deposit in his favor upon the books of his bank or receive cash. In the event cash is desired. the commercial bank would make demand upon its Federal Reserve bank in an amount equal to the credit to its reserve account. Thus. upon issuance of the Federal Reserve notes in the amount of the bond purchase. the Federal Reserve is thus acquiring an interestbearing obligation of the Government in exchange for a noninterestbearing obligationcurrency in the form of Federal Reserve notes which are legal tender. Thus. at this point. the bonds have been paid for once and logically should be canceled. This was admitted to be true by Mr. William McChesney Martin. Jr.. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. on December 11. 1956. testifying before the Joint Economic Committee. The colloquy. appearing on pages 117118 of the printed hearings. proceeded as follows: Chairman PATMAN. In practice. it is a bookkeeping operation. But the truth Is. all the bonds that you haveand you have about $25 billion worth of bonds. do you not?",

This Congress. now at its halfway point. has been called variously the greatest in history and a mere rubber stamp on the road to socialism. I do not subscribe fully to either statement. Some good laws were passed. a few bad ones were defeated. and a large number of measures were enacted which will require skillful administration and may require revisions by Congress. The Congress appropriated more money than any other in peacetime historymore than $119 billion. The national debt increased sharply and $11.5 billion of the appropriations was to pay the yearly interest on these obligations.",

As a Member of Congress. and as a member of the Democratic majority which carried through this tremendous program. I am well aware of this record. and I am proud of it. Every American family will be affected and benefit directly from these legislative achievements. and Americans for many generations to come will continue to benefit from new programs now undertaken by the Congress. President Johnson has called this session of Congress the greatest in American history and described our work as \"the greatest outpouring of creative legislation in the history of this Nation.\" I should perhaps. be more restrained in my remarks. lest I be accused of immodesty. But it is difficult to restrain the enthusiasm I feel when I look back on our record. We have built the foundation to fulfill goals first sought more than 30 years ago by Franklin D.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce. for appropriate reference. a joint resolution to establish a Tercentenary Commission to commemorate the historic presence of Father Jacques Marquette in North America. The function of the Commission will be to develop and execute suitable plans for the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the arrival of Father Marquette at Quebec on September 20. 1666. In conJunction with these plans. the Commission. in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior. will investigate the desirability of establishing a permanent national monument or memorial. Mr. President. Michigan is proud to claim Father Marquette as one of her own. Two years after his arrival in North America. he established a mission at Sault Ste. Marie. Later. In 1671. he founded the Mission of St. Ignatius at the Straits of Mackinac. and this remained his home until his death. Returning from a missionary trip to Illinois in 1675. he died on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan near the present city of Ludington. He is buried- in our State. Michigan rivers. counties. townships. cities. and streets proudly bear his name. But Father Marquette is known in American history for what he accomplished beyond our boundaries. Two hundred and ninetytwo years ago. Father Marquette and the renowned explorer. Louis Joliet. set out to explore our continents greatest riverthe Mississippi. The histories say that on May 17. 1673. Father Marquette and Joliet left St. Ignace with two bark canoes. five French guides. and a little smoked meat and Indian corn. In 4 months they descended the Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansas. satisfied themselves that the river emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. and returned to St. Ignacea journey of 3.000 miles. They brought back with them knowledge of Americas greatest river and richest wilderness. Today as we puzzle the complex problems of science. space. economic growth. and human relations. I believe it not inappropriate that we give thought to those early pioneersamong them Father Marquettewho met with determination and courage the basic and compelling challenges of their daythe exploration of a vast uncharted continent. and the planting in its rich soil of the tender shoots of civilization. Mr. President. I hope Congress will act to make possible an appropriate anniversary observance in commemoration of Father Marquettes contributions to our country.",

And we cant tell what Russia would do in the case of a war with China. Anyway. the risks are incalculable of widening the war. and the President. of course. is doing his best to avoid that. The other dilemma is to negotiate a truce in Vietnam. Were not sure that we can because the interior situation in South Vietnam is breaking up. crumbling. and that is what the victory of the Vietcong is feeding upon. Were not sure that the Chinese or the North Vietnamese. who think theyre winning and have good reason to think that theyre winning. would be willing to negotiate something that. that stopped them short of complete victory. Complete victory would be a collapse of the Vietnamese Government. and a setting up of a new government which would invite the United States to go out. to leave. The reason that dilemma is so bad is not only that it would be embarrassing and humiliating. but because we have. in the course of these years weve been in there. whether we ought to have been there In the first place is another question. but having got in there. a great many Vietnamese have become dependent on us. and the chances for their future if we leave is very slim. I dont know that theyd all be liquidated. some of them would have to flee the country. but we have a debt of honor to those Vietnamese who have thrown themselves on our side in this civil war.

About 2 years ago. livestock farmers of this country were seeing their markets glutted by a wideopen import policy in which billions of pounds of beef were brought into this country. causing ruinously low beef prices and resulting in the loss of more than $170 million to the American farmer.

The Oklahoma Cattlemens Association telegraphed all cf us in the Oklahoma delegation to the same effect. namely. that this is going to mean a considerable blow to the income of cattlemen in our State. I might add further that it is creating a considerable hardship for people who have been in the hide business and have had customers in Mexico. I say that because I know of a person who was caught with a considerable amount of hide accumulated for shipment to Mexico and really with no notice whatsoever of this export control being placed in effect.",

I heard during the early part of the week that they were going to have licensing. but I had thought at that timeand it was my understandingthat was all they were going to do. Therefore. I was very much surprised In view of the fact that a couple of years ago they imposed quotas on walnut logs. Secretary Connors predecessor did that. Within 3 weeks after Secretary Connor came into office those controls were lifted. I thought Secretary Connor had the viewpoint that Is being expressed here today. that is. we should not have quotas on exports unless there is a very. very good reason for them. Mr. Speaker. Secretary Connor also was responsible for stepping up the attempt to get more export business for this country. So I was very surprised to find these export quotas imposed. Yesterday. Mr. Speaker. I made some statements on the floor of the House objecting to this imposition of quotas. and I also stated that I had received from the Department of Commerce an explanation of these quotas in justification of their action. Mr. Speaker. several Members have asked to see these. Therefore I would like at this point in the RECORD to insert the comments from the Department of Commerce so that others may see their side of the story with which I certainly do not agree. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to insert these documents into the RECORo at this point.",

I thank the gentleman from North Dakota very much for yielding. and I certainly do hope that other Members will try to get something done so that these quotas will be lifted. Mr. Speaker. one other point I would like to make is this: The quota does not just affect farmers. We do not know for sure where this 25 cents per hundredweight on cattle is going to come from. Some of these people who are particularly interested in the consumers might be concerned with this question also. because we have a different situation in the meat industry than we had a few years ago. Some of the retail merchants are able to sell at a price that has little relationship with the price which they paid for the meat. We find the packing industry is operating on about a cent per pound. They pay whatever they have to pay for the live weight. If. therefore. they cannot get as much out of the hides. they are are going to have add something onto the cost of the meat. So. Mr. Speaker. we are not sure just where this 25 cents per hundred will be imposed in the price structure. Some of the consumers might be interested in this question.",

In this area of prices. in the justification which was mentioned by the Secretary of Commerce. he referred to the fact that there has been a 43percent upsurge in prices over 1965which is a realistic fact. But one thing he did not mention was that the average over 10 years had been at an alltime low and that the increase of 43 percent in one year still just brought it to the point where. in fact. it was profitable. Now I think we are left with the opinion by some that this great rise was what he was trying to stop. Have you seen any justification in the order. I ask the gentleman. why Canada can still receive the exports of our hide but no other nation in the world has that same benefit? Are they to be reshipped from Canada? I do not understand.

Certainly. as he suggests. if the Great Society had been deliberately trying to create as much havoc as possible in an export industry. they could not have done a better job of it than to have this all of a sudden \"kill em quick\" decision made when hides were in transit. sitting on docks. and commitments were made to deliver to European purchasers. It just could not have been done in a manner more calculated to disrupt normal business channels developed only after a lot of hard work. I would like to make one addition to that. along the line of what the Secretary of Commerce said earlier. It follows in line with what my good friend the gentleman from Missouri pointed out. The Secretary. on September 22 of last year. wrote to Senator MAGNUSON. chairman of the other bodys Commerce Committee and I quote: The shortsupply control authority in the Export Control Act should. in my opinion. be used to protect the overall welfare of the domestic economy and not be used as a price control device to benefit one or two segments of an industry to the detriment of other segments In that industry. I wonder what has prompted the Secretary to change his mind? My friend from Missouri has brought up several things that we should consider. But. Mr. Speaker. perhaps the strange action by the Secretary of Commerce could be the beginning of a backdoor attempt to impose price controls by Government. to stop the runaway inflation that it will not quite admit is here. If this is true. why does the White House not admit it. instead of singling out agriculture to take the reduction?",

We are supposed to be increasing our exports in order to meet our balanceofpayments deficit. This is certainly a shortsighted policy in that respect. This is probably the most crucial matter facing this country. Inflation is bad enough. but we lost $1.7 billion of gold in the year 1965. the greatest outflow since 1958. We are now in a position where we do not have the reserve metals available. The one way we are going to beat that is through exports.

I cannot. for the life of me. understand how President Johnson can. on the one hand. urge businessmen of this country to export more In order to try to overcome the deficit in the balance of trade and then engage in an action of this kind. Perhaps it is proposed to recoup what they lose in deals of this kind through Secretary of Defense McNamara and others going over to the Swiss Alps on a skiing vacation. Perhaps McNamara and others will spend enough to take care of the loss that is sustained in this business. And this despite the fact that the President urged all Americans to spend their vacations in this country and cut down on the outflow of dollars. At any rate. to me it is totally inexplicable. I do not understand exactly what the Secretary of Commerce is up to. I agree with the gentleman from North Dakota and commend him for bringing this subject to the floor of the House this afternoon. I want to join him in any invitation that is extended to get the Secretary of Commerce before interested Members of Congress to explain this action. If he has a valid explanation. At the same time I would like to question him or someone in the executive branch as to why the British. having bought the molasses crop of Communist Cuba. are now allowed to dump molasses in this country. injuring the market of the sugarbeet producers of this country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am happy to associate myself with the most pertinent remarks by my colleague and friend from North Dakota. He has rightfully alerted us to another effort by the Federal Government to control prices on an agricultural commodity that results in a loss of needed income to our farmers. It certainly Is no secret that the market for cattle hides has been depressed for a long time. Then. recently. prices rose somewhat. But those prices still are below what they should be. However. the Department of Commerce has seen fit to set export quotas on cattle hides with the purpose of curtailing exports. The result. of course. is a lowering of the price of hides. There are serious questions to be asked over the Commerce Deptrtment claims of an Inadequate supply of leather for the domestic Industries. For instance. there is a considerable supply of processed leather accumulated in surplus which could be worked into the market while we have foreign customers. And there are an abundance of substitutes to cover any shortages that may temporarily exist either domestically or overseas. Actually those synthetic substitutes for leather caused the domestic hide market to become depressed. These substitutes have gained wide acceptance in the United States and forced the domestic hide industry to look elsewhere for their markets. The industry. with cooperation from the Department of Agriculture. sought the development of markets in hide deficit areas of the world. Now. with those markets a reality. the Government wants to shut the door by curtailing our hide exports. The loss to our farmers and to our meat processors is very real. estimated by some to approach $4 a head. This loss must either be assumed by the farmer and processor. or be passed on to the consumer through higher meat prices because the amount derived from the hide is still a part of the total money realized from each animal. Such a loss comes at a time when the domestic beef industry attempts to stabilize Its income. We should also note that hide exports accounted for a quarter of a billion dollars last year. which had a beneficial effect on our balance of payments. Mr. Speaker. I join with our colleagues who believe that this further manipulation of a U.S. agricultural market is unwarranted. I urge that the recently imposed export quotas on cattle hides be rescinded.",

For the last two weeks I have been sitting in hearings on the budget for that Department. In agency after agency of the Department of Commerce they are requesting new employees for the purpose of beefing upand I suppose that might be a proper wordthe Departments. so that they can induce businessmen to export more. In their field offices throughout the country they want to have new employees. and in other areas of the Department of Commerce. for the specific purpose of trying to do something to alleviate what we call the balanceofpayments problem. Certainly. Mr. Speaker. this is completely inconsistent. Also I want to join my colleague. the gentleman from Iowa . in expressing concern regarding the trading in molasses where the British. as I understand It. purchased the total output of Cuba. and it is finding its way back into the United States. This is something that ought to be looked into. Mr. Speaker. just this afternoon we have been listening to the Maritime Commission and to a task force of the Maritime Commission. who have recommended that we ought to give consideration to building maritime ships in foreign countries. We are subsidizing construction now. . Mr. Speaker. these policies are completely inconsistent. Certainly the administration should somehow review its ideas because there are so many conflicting policies within the administration on this very important subject. With reference to this export control order. in my opinion it Is completely inconsistent with what they claim they have been trying to do in other areas in the Department of Commerce.",

In 1963. it was up another 20 percent. and many of our cattle feeders went to the wall because of this action. Eleven percent of the beef consumed in this country was imported beef. Now. Mr. Speaker. we find we have controls put on the export even of hides off domestically grown animals. I might also point out that on the floor of the House last week our minority leader. the gentleman from Michigan . made comment about the dumping of corn on the market and thereby breaking the market. I joined the gentleman from Michigan in his comments. The Secretary of Agriculture. in a speech in MinneapolisI believe on March 10said my comments were political noise. and corn was worth $1.29 a bushel. which was a pretty good price. But I also call attention to the fact that on the same day a year ago it was $1.32. Mr. Speaker. also I want to point out that the farmers costs were up 11 points while the price of corn went down.

Many of these are inspired by communications from the St. Labre Mission soliciting contributions for the operation of the St. Labre Mission school. The St. Labre Mission does excellent work and the school provides the religious education for those children whose parents do not desire to send them to public schools. Excellent public schools are available. however. and as in other impacted areas the public school districts receive direct financial payments from the Federal Government for the Indian children In attendance who reside on taxexempt land. Inasmuch as I have received several inquiries about the Northern Cheyennes in recent weeks. I would like to call my colleagues attention to an excellent article that appeared last year in the Billings Gazette.

It was understandably a festive occasion. for they not only have an excellent new building for their fire trucks. but space was provided for an excellent community hall as well. What is truly commendable about this new structure however is the way it came into being. Every cent for the construction of the building was donated by local peoplenone came from taxes of any variety. In addition the townsmen contributed their labor for the construction. so that the money collected went primarily for the building materials. For many years the town of Ellettsville has been known as a wonderful community. exemplifying the best in Hoosier smalltown life. This latest achievement fits very well with the record of Ellettsville. It is also refreshing. in this age when most cities and towns anxiously pursue every possible grant and each type of assistance. that this community provides for itself without even considering seeking State or Federal aid.

I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a group of fine young men from my district who recently reached the finals of the national American Legion baseball championships. Among the many worthwhile projects conducted by members of the American Legion. their baseball program stands high on the list. It provides healthy. wholesome activity for young men at a very critical period in their lives. As a byproduct. many have graduated from American Legion baseball to fame in the major leagues. Recently. the BarringerWalker Post 139 team from Lyndhurst. N.J.. made a determined bid for national honors and came very close to reaching that goal. Lyndhurst. incidentally. is a sportsminded community and always has produced outstanding teams and athletes. As an example. on three previous occasions Lyndhurst teams went as far as the State finals in the American Legion tournament. This year. the team won even higher laurels. After winning the Bergen County district and State championships. they swept past three other State champions to become eastern champions. They finally faltered upon reaching the national finals at Aberdeen. S. Dak.. but it is to their credit that team members did not bemoan the loss of their best pitcher and an outstanding infielder when they returned home. They arrived home not victorious. but nevertheless welcomed by a large crowd of friends and neighbors delighted with their accomplishments. I take this opportunity to congratulate these fine boys. their coach. Lyndhurst Patrolman Bob Muhleisen. and John Hartigan. wellknown Legionnaire and team manager. for a job that has made New Jersey quite proud. We cannot emphasize too much the value of the fine adult leadership given these young men and feel that their accomplishments should be noted before this distinguished Congress.

The purpose of the bill is to implement an agreement with the University of California. made by the Secretary of the Interior. under which the United States acquired title to 2.4 acres of land for the construction of a FisheryOceanography Center. In 1962 the University of California conveyed this land to the Department of Interior. more particularly to the Bureau of Fisheries. At that time an effort was made to put a reversionary clause in. That was not acceptable to the Department of Justice. and then consideration was given to a 99year lease. Again. that was not acceptable. so there was an agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and the regents of the University of California. to the effect that if the property were conveyedand it was conveyed to the Federal Government for this purposethe Congress would be called upon to enact legislation which would permit the Secretary of the Interior to reconvey the property to the regents of the University of California if and when the property was used for a purpose different from the purpose for which it was originally deeded to the Secretary of the Interior.",

As a matter of fact. the hearing record will reflect that the University of California was solicited by the Secretary of the Interior for land on the campus. The University of California. through its board of regents. was quite acceptable to the Idea of deeding the property to the Federal Government with a reversionary clause. but the Department of Justice Intervened and said it would not accept it under those conditions. Then the question of a 99year lease was considered. and that was not acceptable. either. So the full import of this legislation. sir. is that the Secretary of the Interior and the regents of the university then agreed to go ahead with the transaction with the understanding that Congress would enact legislation that would give the Secretary of the Interior the legal authority to reconvey the property at some subsequent or future date. which I frankly do not believe will happen. in the event that the property is not used for the specific purposes for which it was deeded.",

Hurricane Betsy was one of the most erratic and damaging of all the hurricanes which have visited their wrath upon the coastal lines of the States of Florida. Louisiana. and Mississippi. It even exceeded the damage wrought by the 1947 hurricane which caused much damage to my own beautiful coast of Mississippi. Betsy. after an erratic course in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. was aimed directly at the Mississippi gulf coast. Fortunately for my people. its course again was changed and its full fury hit the city of New Orleans and the adjoining areas of Louisiana. Even so. my own area along the Mississippi coast did not escape unscathed. Much damage was done to that area. While the damage there was not comparable to the New CXI1714 Orleans area some 50 miles to the west. the damage was nevertheless substantial. The seawalls constructed at a cost to the taxpayers of the Mississippi coast were substantially damaged. The fishing industry which means so much to the economy of that section also suffered substantial damage. Likewise. many private homes and property felt the fury with resultant damage of this hurricane. The purpose of the bill. Mr. Speaker. is to assist the people and the local governments of these three States to rehabilitate themselves and assist in the recovery from the losses substalned in this severe storm. This is a humanitarian effort which I am sure will receive the support of the people of all of the States of the Union and. therefore. I am glad to have a small part in relieving the suffering and the losses incurred by this hurricane.",

That is. that an official committee be appointed to investigate the situation in Selma and in Dallas County and to ascertain the facts. so that the truth might be known to the Congress and be made known to the American people. In lieu of such an official committee a group of Members of the House went unofficially to Selma. without authority from. or acting as agents of the House of Representatives or of the U.S. Government. to conduct their own investigation of the situation there. Mr. Speaker. every American citizen has a right to travel anywhere in these United States. I further recognize the right of Members of this body to go to Selma. Ala.. or anywhere else. for legislative purposes. I believe. as they have testified. they were received with due respect. While there. they met with pertinent public officials who gave them their time. answered their questions. and treated them with all courtesy. along with members of the Alabama delegation to the Congress. These gentlemen went in good faith to Selma. but I want to correct here an impression that has been created in cases by the press that this was some kind of official committee of this House. which it was not. These Members went there for their own enlightenment and for their own purposes. The official committee has not yet been appointed. I urge that it be so appointed to conduct an impartial investigation of the situation there. I think we can only understand the situation in Selma when we look at all of the facts. I came back with certain impressions. Mr. Speaker. that I would like to share with the Members of the House.",

Mr. Speaker. the city of Selma is a stage and now its public officials have been and are being used as props by people from the outside. outside agitators who have come to the city to organize and lead demonstrations. in certain cases demanding of public officials that they act in direct violation of the laws of our State. This was the case on the Friday we were there. A group demanded of registration officials that they open the office and register citizens on a day in which they were forbidden by State law to do so. demanding that which according to law could not be done. Mr. Speaker. the leaders of certain organizations now active in Selma are not working toward a solution of problems there or toward registering people to vote in Dallas County. They are instead creating a stage. a drama in which they are casting themselves as the central characters. and using the people as their props. Mr. Speaker.

In my judgment this a minimal first step in any effective campaign to wipe out this scourge. Mr. President. the District of Columbia has far and away the highest venereal disease rates of any jurisdiction in the country. The U.S. Public Health Service reports that in fiscal year 1962 some 260 cases of syphilis. 1.114 cases of gonorrhea and 36 cases of other venereal disease per 100.000 District of Columbia residents. At this rate. Mr. President. over 10.500 persons in the District of Columbia are infected with venereal disease. I need not detail the consequences of venereal disease. It takes its toll in blindness. cardiovascular. deterioration. insanity. and death. But venereal disease is not only a personal tragedy. it is an acute social extravagance. The cure for syphilis is widely known. easy to administer. and Inexpensive. Yet we continue to endure the social costs of venereal disease without recognizing the full financial implications. The Public Health Service has estimated that in 1960 it cost us as a nation $55 million to provide institutional care to patients with syphilic psychosis and syphilic blindness. In 1960 we as a nation lost another $50 million in loss of income as a result of disability of our adult population prior to age 65. We speak of waste. Mr. President. What greater waste can there be than to lose $100 million each year to a disease for which we have a cheap and easy cure. Venereal disease rates are rising. Mr. President. in the District of Columbia and elsewhere in the Nation. It is high time that the District of Columbia joined 45 of the 50 States to require a simple blood test to detect venereal disease prior to marriage. I note that a similar bill passed the other body earlier this week. I trust this matter will receive the prompt attention of the Senate.",

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill to permit Federal employees to have withheld from their pay for retirement purposes their appropriate share of compensation for overtime. night. holiday. and similar work. Under the present Civil Service Retirement Act. only an employees basic salary is subject to the 61/2 percent payroll deduction. only the basic salary is used as a basis for retirement computations. Current law does not provide retirement credit for work In excess of the normal 40hour tour of duty. The bill I introduce today will expand the statutory definition of basic salary to include overtime and holiday pay. Such pay is a regular component of many Federal employees salaries. since retirement pay should be related to the income received before retirement. this change is needed to prevent too wide a gap between the income received before and after retirement. Over the years of an employees career. this change would mean a slightly higher annuity based upon the additional contributions he makes resulting from work in these categories. The individual who is required to spend hours over and above the normal work cycle or who must perform service on a less desirable shift is certainly performing work. just as he would under normal circumstances. Yet. under existing law. he may not add the value of his work to his retirement account. Fundamentally. a staff retirement program is designed to permit employees to cease working after the required years of service and at the required age with a reasonable expectation of continuing income to maintain them during the later years of life. This bill is simply an extension of that principle to allow workers to acquire retirement credit for certain periods of work upon payment of their normal share of the retirement cost.",

Cyril and Methodius to what is now Slovakia. since they are apostles of the Slavs In general and the Slovaks in particular. it is most appropriate for us Americans to evaluate their apostolate in this country. which has some 35 million descendants and adherents of their Slavonic Christian heritage. There are over 30 Slovak churches dedicated to them in this country. starting from Minneapolis. Minn.. to Slovaktown. near Stuttgart. Ark. All these churches. including one in .Brookside. Ala.. were founded seven decades ago and the recent one. dedicated in 1963 at Deer Park. Long Island. N.Y. The Poles. whom I wish to single out first. established a SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary at Orchard Lake. Mich.. also six decades ago. where not only the Polish. but all Slavonic students are admitted to study for the priesthood. A century ago a great SS. Cyril and Methodius millennium received the blessing of Pope Pius IX. who summoned the first Vatican Council and founded a Slavonic Institute in Rome. Pope Pius IX. elevated two Slovaks to the Sacred College of Cardinals: namely. Alexander Cardinal Rudnay and George Cardinal Haulik. first archbishop of Zagreb. Croatia. presently Yugoslavia. and also its Governor and founder of many institutions. including the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences. A century ago. 80 million Slavs observed the millennium of SS. Cyril and Methodius. whose teachings reached the New World first. no doubt. with the sailors of Christopher Columbus. for the famous discoverer had Slav Dalmatians. then famous seafarers. on his voyage. And the first Poles. who came here In 1607. no doubt. held them in great admiration. The Poles have large numbers of adherents and according to Johns Hopkins studies. there were Polish Catholics in Virginia even before 1770.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. our colleague. the distinguished gentleman from Missouri . is acknowledged to be one of the most brilliant Members in either Chamber. He is one of the leading financial and economic experts in the country. He is also one of the most diligent and hardworking men I know. He has evolved a theory of economics which he himself has dubbed \"CURTIS Corollary to Greshams Law.\" . He presented it to the House last month during the debate on H.R. 45. the InterAmerican Development Bank bill. Greshams law is simply that bad money will drive out good and the Curtis corollary is that Government money drives out private capital. The formulation of this law has been noted by the St. Louis PostDispatch which recently carried an excellent editorial on the subject. I heartily endorse the editorial and its conclusion and recommend it to the consideration of my colleagues: In 1558 Sir Thomas Gresham. financial agent of the Crown. painstakingly explained to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth that when two or more kinds of money of equal denominationbut unequal intrinsic valueare in circulation. the one with the greater value is hoarded and exported. Basically. the good knight explained to the Virgin Queen. bad money drives out good money. Some 299 years later the economic principle was given the name of Greshams law. Now more than a century later on the floor of Congress there has been appended CURTIS corollary--Government money drives out private capital. While the news has yet to be hailed on the fields of academe. Representative THOMAS B. CURTIS corollary certainly seems to hold true for the Alliance for Progress. which program is in need of reevaluation. As envisioned under the Alliance. $20 billion in investment moneys would go south of the Rio Grande. half of it from private sources. But Mr. CURTIS charges that. as the Government dollars are being sent into Latin America. not only has the private sector not caught up. but it has actually declined during those years. Nor is it just American private capital that is being withdrawn. Latin capital is likewise being pulled out.",

Willard Wirtz went to California to see for himself the farm labor camps where fruit is supposed to be rotting for lack of peons to pick it. Yesterday morning Secretary Wirtz made a surprise early morning visit to one and the conditions he was able to observe were so bad that he was provoked to express his shock and disgust. After viewing the miserable conditions that farm laborers are forced to work in. he said: It makes me ashamed that anything of this kind exists in this country. And later he said: The place is filthy. As for the foodit was a wonder that anyone would eat it. These sorry conditions. which Mr. Wirtz has now seen with his own eyes. underline what I have been saying about the need to terminate the bracero program for more than 2 years: Americans are perfectly willing to do socalled stoop labor but they do not want to do it for stoop wages and under stoop conditions. Americans should not have to be treated like serfs. Americans have a right to decent wages and decent working conditions. With unanimous consent I am inserting a story from todays Washington Post by Frank C. Porter describing Mr. Wirtzs visit to a large farm labor camp in California. This labor camp. in which about 200 men work. is one of 55 operated in California and Arizona by the same plantation owner:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. In an address before the Bankers Association. Secretary Dillon has proposed an additional cut in income taxes. with the stated purpose of favoring people in the low tax brackets. His proposal can be put into effect by a simple measure which I have been advocating for some time. Return the personal exemption figure from $600 to $1.000. where it was before the war. The $600 exemption was adopted as a purely temporary measure to meet war needs. The wax is over. Put the exemption back where it belongs. This simple change would benefit most of all the people the Secretary wants to help. It would mean an immediate tax cut of approximately $56 for each dependent on the taxpayers list. The cut would remove thousands of lowincome families from the taxpaying lists entirely. Internal Revenue would benefit by saving the work needed to check out returns which bring in only a few dollars revenue each. The simplicity and commonsense of this way of carrying out the Secretarys proposal should commend itself to the committees of the House responsible for tax legislation. I urge its serious consideration by all Members. A byproduct of this form of tax cut might well be the retention of lowwage earners on payrolls. and off relief rolls. The lowincome worker sees a considerable portion of his wages swallowed up by taxes. He is discouraged and tempted to give up the struggle and go on relief. The cut may be just the incentive needed to keep him on the job. instead of becoming a burden to society. I am placing my suggestion before the Ways and Means Committee. and bringing it to the attention of the administration.",

In the Nations 10th largest school system. serving approximately 160.000 children of our military abroad. almost 7.000 oversea educators remain grossly underpaid. The lamentable fact is that these teachers who. in order to qualify for the job. were required to have 2 years of previous teaching experience and a college diploma are paid about the same as a civil service grade 4 stenographer who must have only a high school education. Since 1959. when oversea teachers were removed from the GS scale by the Defense Department Oversea Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act. they have received a pay increase averaging only 6 percent. During the same period of time. Federal classified employees salaries have been increased an average of 17 percent. To be sure. our oversea teachers have been the subjects of a blatant injustice. Since it has refused to raise the teachers pay while boosting everyone elses salaries. Congress is to blame for this inequity. And it is the Congress that must correct it. The needs of American employees abroad must not be overlooked. and the oversea teachers need our help and support. I I call on my colleagues to support me in passing this needed legislation.",

This tyrant of the Near Eastthis Castro of the Nileis a master of deceit. of intimidation and blackmail. While he is winkIng at us with the one eye. he Is carrying on a flirtation with Chou of Red China with whom he is soon to join in a parley. The fact that he is offering compensation for the J.F.K. Library is all well and good. This Is the least we can expect when his subjects. fanned by Nassers antiU.S. statements. destroyed the library. But do we have to pay him back manifold for this measly remuneration?. Should we give him $37 million worth of food supplies in return? Our assistance program is intended to help the undernourished of the world. to assist underdeveloped nationsnot to subsidize. as in Nassers instance. in the building of an offensive arms machinepurchased from Russia at that. What makes the State Department feel that aid will win Nassers support? We have already given the United Arab Republic over a billion dollars. and. in turn. Nasser flaunts our assistance and tells us \"to take it and jump In the Mediterranean.\" This makes a mockery of our program. Yet what do we do now but offer him continued aid. supposedly because it is in our national selfinterest. Where is our national selfrespect? I think this clearly emphasizes the need for mandatory. rather than discretionary. measures by the Congress to sever aid to Nasser. Also. it seems anomalous to me that we should even consider giving this food to the United Arab Republic. when the United Arab Republic is busy shipping rice to Communist China and Cuba. Let Nasser announce his intentions to further peace in the Middle East. Let him sit at the peace table with Israel to negotiate a lasting peace. Let him get out of Yemen. which reportedly is costing himand in turn usa million dollars a day. Then and then alone is the time to talk about renewing our aid program.",

It is important for the President to express the support and faith we Americans have in the United Nations at this crucial time.

This international organization. through its various agencies. has done much in its 20year history toward furthering the cause of peace and improving the material and social wellbeing of the worlds peoples. To further world peace the U.N. undertook in 1950 the job of repelling Communist aggressors from the Republic of Korea. The success of this operation is attested to by the fact that South Korea exists today as a free and independent nation. Other U.N. peacekeeping efforts have included the halting of hostilities during the Suez crisis. the ending of anarchy and mass bloodletting in the Congo. and the stoppage of shooting between rival factions on Cyprus. While such operations. it is true. have not settled the underlying problems in each of these areas. they have prevented these local conflicts from escalating Into worldwide holocausts. And for this. we must all be grateful. Such peacekeeping operations are but one part of the U.N.s job. equally important part is the betterment of the world. To achieve this aim. the U.N. provides invaluable assistance to the worlds underdeveloped countries. Such aid programs teach these nations to improve their educational systems. to Introduce modem scientific methods of farming. to conserve and manage their natural resources. and to solve their food. health. and population problems. In addition. the U.N. runs various refugee. programs and also provides aid to homeless and impoverished children all over the world. The U.N. is an extremely worthwhile organization. Its peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts are a blessing to all mankind. This organization deserves and. I hope. will continue to receive our solid and everlasting support.",

I was deeply disturbed to read in the press this week that President Johnson apparently has decided that it would be in the national interest to send the United Arab Republic $37 million in surplus farm products. He evidently is basing this decision on a State Department judgment that our relations with the United Arab Republic have markedly improved in the past 6 months. In my opinion. this is mere wishful thinking. President Nasser has repeatedly interfered to thwart U.S. foreign policy all over the world. In the last 2 2 years. Egypt has wasted more than $2 billion in fighting an aggressive war In Yemen. Congress has written into law a provision requesting the President to cut off foreign aid to any country found to be an aggressor. Egypt has clearly been the aggressor in Yemen. Finally. Nasser tells us to \"go jump in the lake\" with our aid and proceeds to sell 40 percent of his nations rice crop to Communist China and Cuba. Is our State Department unaware of the rice sale? Is our State Department unaware that Nasser has asked the people of Egypt to tighten their belts to support his aggression in Yemen? Is our State Department unaware of .the .reports that Nasser is now looking to Argentina and Australia to purchase food? Mr. Speaker. last year $175 million worth of shipments were sent to the United Arab Republic. There is no in*dication that this was in the national interest. On the contrary.

I will support the excise tax reduction bill. which will follow President Johnsons message on this subject. The reductions called for by the President are long overdue. and President Johnson has my full support for his request. Nevertheless. both the Presidents message and the bill to be reported in the House are greviously deficient in one respect. Under both the message and the bill. the Treasury will still continue to levy the single most unfair. most unreasonable excise tax ever devised. namely. the tax on receipts of the State of New Hampshires program to raise public school assistance funds by the New Hampshire Sweepstakes. To the best of my knowledge. no other State in the Union is forced to pay taxes on the money which it raises for Its public schools. What makes this tax especially objectionable is the fact that it was not imposed by Congress as a tax on State efforts to raise funds for education. but as a tax on private wagering operations. Furthermore. the wagering tax imposed by chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply to wagering at parimutuel races. lotteries held in private gambling casinos. or lotteries held by many taxexempt corporations. Nevertheless. the Treasury claims that it does apply to the State of New Hampshire in the operation of the sweepstakes designed to provide funds for the operation of public schools. Mr. President.

The resolution provides an open rule. waiving points of order. with 2 hours of general debate. As originally submitted to Congress. the Atomic Energy Commissions request called for a total authorization of $2.592.035.000 for fiscal year 1966.

In addition. the bill would authorize the AEC to enter into two new cooperative arrangements with organizations outside the Federal Government for construction and operation of nuclear powerplants embodying advanced concepts. Included within the total amount. this bill would authorize to be appropriated to the AEC is the sum of $132.363.000. which the AEC could utilize for these cooperative arrangements. The bill would also authorize AEC to waive use charges on leased special nuclear material for one project in an amount estimated to be $6.443.000. and to purchase uranium enriched in the isotope 233 produced under the arrangement.

In the first place the Senators amendment proposes as a subsection (b). \"If a man is a member of any organization designated as a subversive organization by the Attorney General of the United States.\" That. in my opinion. would be utterly impossible to administer in a case of this kind where we are trying to get funds to people who so desperately need them and all that goes with it. If we include that statement in the bill. we will be making it impossible to administer this section of the law on a practical basis. Mr. President. I bring out the second point. which is that the House bill. which does not include that subparagraph about the member of any organization. states: No part of the funds authorized to be appropriated shall be used to provide * * * That is in the House bill. It will be in conference. and if we do not pass this amendment. the conferees can change the \"shall\" to a \"may.\" if it is important to the conferees to include that section in the bill. But if we include that subparagraph (b) now. it will be utterly impossible. in my opinion to administer it. The battle will be fought in the conference. so why pass this amendment now in this form?",

Chavez has refused to attend meetings to which the Di Giorgio Corp. has invited him and has broten off preliminary negotiations to concentrate on a boycott. His excuse is that Di Giorgio has asked for a nostrike provision during harvest time in any union contract. Chavez will not accept this. Furthermore. he says that he could not submit to an election whereby the existing Independent Farm Workers Association is placed upon the ballot. Chavez claims this is a company union. Without a nostrike provision the union would have an unfair advantage and in fact a decisive \"club.\" Steel which goes into automobiles does not spoil and a double shift tomorrow can make up for no production at all today. But. the farmer does not have a second chance with his crop and would obviously be required to concede. Yet. the supporters of Chavez argue that the nostrike provision is unfair to the union and pay no attention at all to the unfair advantage he asks for himself. Insofar as Chavez other objections. why should he be afraid of a democratic election? Is this not the American way? Why should groups which take his word above all others feel that he alone has the right to be anointed as the representative of farmworkers without an election? In the eastern Press and publications printed by the backers of Chavez the full truth has not been told. I bear no particular brief for either Di Giorgio or Chavez but when it comes to a point where a nationally known brand is boycotted in order to anoint one labor leader who represents very few workers with instant power. then I think the full truth and not just part of it should be told. Fortunately the California Farmer does print the truth. I believe those who have a devotion to truth and want both sides of the grape strike story in Delano should read the following article by Don Razee from the May 21 issue of the California Farmer:",

I would like to suggest that what the dairy farmer needs is not an essentially meaningless increase in the support level for milk but some indication that the Johnson administration is for him instead of against him. If Increased milk production is the need. we will not obtain it by government actions which have caused some dairy farmers in Wisconsin. for example. to auction off their herds. More than an increase in the support level. the dairy farmer. if he is to be persuaded to stay in business. needs assurance that: First. the Johnson administration will not try to drastically reduce the school lunch and milk programs. Second. the Johnson administration will not cut back purchases of dairy products for the Armed Forces. Third. the President himself will not urge less consumption of dairy products. and most important. that Fourth. the Johnson administration will call off its campaign to bring more foreign cheese into the United States to compete with the American product. If the Johnson administration continues to kill markets for dairy products. it is going to drive the dairy farmer out of business. and a sop in the form of an increase in support level is not going to help. What will help is concrete evidence of a reversal of the current antidairyfarmer attitude of the Johnson administration. Dairy Month should be an excellent time to start producing that evidence.",

REA. land grant colleges. and conservation programs: Third. why Secretary Freeman stated in New York recently that he was \"pleased to report\" farm prices had moderated. Fourth. why this administration imposed export quotas on hides. Fifth. why dairy supports are less than the prevailing market price. while at the same time more foreign cheese Is imported and margarine is substituted for butter in the Army and Air Force. Sixth. why cuts were attempted in farm research funds at the very time we face a world food shortage. Seventh. why an administration order cut armed services pork servings in half and why such order was kept secret while hog prices dropped abruptly. and. Eighth. why the USDA has dumped millions of tons of grain on the domestic market to depress wheat and feed grain prices. In my opinion. the State ASCS committeemen and directors should have this information. particularly in view of a wire story yesterday which indicated that prices farmers receive for crops and livestock fell threefourths of 1 percent during the month ending May 15 and that prices received by farmers last month were only 79 percent of parity.

Included in the House allowances were the following increases. among others. in excess of the budget estimates: $232.800.000 for payments to school districts in providing education in federally impacted schools. under Public Law 874. enacted in 1950 as a successor to the Lanham Act enacted early in World War II. $11.950.000 for instruction in agriculture. the mechanic arts and related fields in the 68 landgrant colleges. the basic authorization for which was approved by President Lincoln in 1862. $157.813.000 for student loan funds under the National Defense Education Act of 1958. to allow the full authorization of $190 million. and $21 million to allow the full authorization for student loans to medical and nurse students. The total increases for these items is $423.563.000. Had the President made adequate provision for these items. the bill before us today would be $33 million under the budget requests.

I hope that by giving flexibility to the Federal Reserve and the President. we could avoid gross and unfair discrimination. What I have in mind specifically is this. There is now outstanding insurance on bank deposits and savings and loan shares up to $10.000. I hope that will shortly be increased to $20.000. incidentally. for each account. It would certainly seem to me not unfair to ask people who are insured in their deposits to accept a slightly slower rate than people who do not have the benefit of that insurance. I therefore want to get away from a statutorily inflexible discrimination. I hope. if there needs to be any discrimination at all. it will be held to a minimum and follow some rational pattern. At any rate. I do not want Congress to do it.",

If we pass this bill. the committees bill. that will be assurance to the country that interest rates will not go higher. The people fear interest rates will go higher and higher. Passage of H.R. 14026 will let the people know that Congress is on record and directing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The ExportImport Bank today raised Its rates from 51/2 to 6 percent. which is terrible. Of course. they apologized and said they hated to do it. The student loan applications are being turned down by the banks and are being refused. The homebuilding industry is in a depression. It is terrible that we are going to have only 1 million housing starts this year. The President said that we ought to have 2 million starts a year. So we have to do something to revive the housing industry. If this bill is not enough. then we shall be compelled to do more. We should think something about the people who have their savings invested in the stock market and also in bonds and other securities. A lot of people have been led to believe they are good investments. If we just let the market keep on going down on account of the high interest rates. that is wrong. We have to stop it. and if we do nothing more than stop it in its tracks. there will be great stability for our economy. It will help in the market. it will help stocks and bonds. and help home building and everything. It will help the United States of America. Mr. Chairman. I hope this bill can be passed tomorrow. A vote for H.R. 14026. the committee bill. will place the Members on record as being in favor of lower and lower interest rates. A vote against H.R. 14026. the committee bill. by the Members will indicate they are in favor of higher and higher interest rates.",

This was a most significant reminder of the praiseworthy degree of economic and social progress which has been realized in this African nation in recent years. and is just cause for our sincere commendation. It was just 9 years ago. in 1956. that Tunisia achieved her independence after a long struggle of several decades. A year later the Republic was established and Habib Bourguiba was named President by the Assembly. Finally on June 1. 1959. the Constitution drawn by the Assembly was promulgated. Though this Republic is comparatively new. the area in which it lies is rich in culture and tradition. Originally the site of Carthage. a Phoenician trading center and rival of the Roman Empire. the nations history provides a fascinating study of the determined efforts of these people to achieve a stature of independence and progress. Under President Bourguiba the Republic of Tunisia has taken great strides toward the fulfillment of these goals. Imaginative and dynamic programs have been initiated resulting in economic growth and a greater measure of political stability. As a recipient of U.S. foreign aid. Tunisia typifies a desirable example of the proper use of our assistance by a nation which is willing to. at the same time. help itself. In the brief period of its independence. Tunisia has made substantial progress in the areas of agriculture. education. technology. and industrial development. President Bourguiba has proven himself a true leader of his people and a remarkable political figure. The people of the United States are pleased to be associated with the development we have seen to date. and we congratulate the leaders and people of Tunisia for their notable progress. On this important occasion we offer our very best wishes for continued success to President Habib Bourguiba. Ambassador to the United States Rachid Driss. and the people of Tunisia.",

I can assure you. Congressman CURTIS. from personal experience that the President exercises continuing vigilance not just in connection with the Defense Department. but in all the departments. . I think you may have seen something in the press the other day. He walked across the street and paid a visit to my Department the other day for the express purpose of congratulating the Assistant Secretary for Administration. the career man who carries the ball In our Department on management utilization techniques. to congratulate him and the Department on having achieved a reduction of about $33 million through these devices in the departmental budget of last year. so there will be no lacking on the Presidents part and certainly not on the part of the Secretary of the Treasury of a continued emphasis on the importance of restraining expenditures and accompanying the kind of fiscal action that is recommended here today to this committee with a positive policy of controlling expenditures. I just cannot give you quantitative estimates on how that policy can be reflected in fiscal 1967 or fiscal 1968. I think I would be just guessing and I dont like to guess to the committee. but certainly as far as fiscal 1966 is concerned I see no reason today to think that the expenditure figures for fiscal 1966 are going to be substantially more than they are set forth in the January budget estimate.",

They say that local control should be retained. and will be retained despite expanded programs of Federal assistance. The fallacy of these assurances is clearly demonstrated in the recent order of the U.S. Office of Education laying down certain requirements which local school districts must meet in order to be eligible for U.S. aid. In a recent discussion on this subject with the Commissioner of Education. Mr. Francis Keppel. I asked him how his office could have information about each school district around the country sufficient on which to base a blanket requirement basic to the administration of local schools. He acknowledged that he could not have that much information. \"But we have to have some rules.\" he said. This gives rise to a problem which I believe merits the attention of all Americans concerned with public education. We have today a clear and unmistakable trend to centralized Washington control over the decisions of local school boards. Who is to say where the trend may stop?

One thing that our action would do would be to tell Mr. Nasser and the people of Egypt. \"At long last. we are deeply displeased with what you are doing.\" We can take the one method which is open to us to let them know in unmistakable terms that they are not to tempt the United States any farther than they already have.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I make this statement to the Senator from New York. whose opinion I respect. I sat as a member of this committee. I heard the Secretary of State testify in the Committee on Foreign Relations. I heard Mr. Ball and others testify in the Appropriations Committee. The point that appeals to me the most in the whole problem which faces us in connection with their appropriation measure is that the President. and the Department of State under the President. have responsibility for initiating foreign policy and for carrying out that policy with respect to other countries. If Congress flatfootedly refuses to permit the President to exercise the initiative he thinks he ought to exercise. we have taken all opportunities to negotiate away from the President and from the Department of State. I invite the attention of the Senator from New York to two paragraphs on page 3 of the committee report. This was considered by the committee with very great care. I shall read the two paragraphs. because I would like to have them in the RECORD. They read as follows: It is further the policy of Congress that most careful consideration should be given by the responsible agencies of our Government concerning the continued provision of assistance under this act to countries that are. directly or indirectly. hostile to the United States or that are providing assistance to groups or countries that are acting against the best interests of the United States. In exercising said provisions of assistance. the Congress emphasizes that said assistance is contributed by the people of the United States of America out of taxes paid by them. it is not reasonable to expect them to want to renew said assistance to countries which permit the property of the United States of America to be destroyed and whose leaders make statements derogatory to our country. That is a statement that the committee unanimously agreed to in adopting the recommendations of the committee. That is in the joint resolution. We feel that it is the initiative of the President of the United States. We expressed our opinion. We still gave him the initiative that he should have. But we made it perfectly clear that we did not like what was going on.",

I point out to the Senator that we have been making this same kind of request for years and incorporating it in foreign aid bill after foreign aid bill. There have been recitals that the country involved should respect the peace and other people. respect transit through the Suez Canal. and respect the property of the United States. Mr. Nasser has treated such recitals like pieces of paper. And so has the State Department. Nonetheless. I would not have initiated this proposal. I doubt if I would have voted for the measure if it had come up as an original measure in the Senate. I voted against the Indonesia measure. as I stated earlier. This action seems to be so spontaneous. and would represent so little in the way of substantive breach. or break. or stoppage. that it would not be like showing all of our authority.

I believe that Congress has that permission. I believe that Congress has the last word with respect to foreign relations insofar as Public Law 480 is concerned. and Insofar as the appropriations thereunder are concerned. Congress itself enacted Public Law 480. If Congress can extend authority under Public Law 480. it can also withdraw authority in whole or in part. That is all my amendment does. It would withdraw authority with respect to only a very small but a very important part. Therefore. I hope that this debate will not go off into a constitutional argument.

I said at that time that such an activity was nothing more than a shakedown of American industry and should be stopped. The Treasury supported that amendment. but asked that I withhold my second proposal until the President could make his own recommendation. I agreed to do so and stated in the RECORD at that time that it would be offered later. at the first convenient opportunity after the President had made his statement.

All through those harrowing war years. Hawaii gave morale as well as logistical support to the mighty fieet and its brilliant leader who led them to victory with his now historic defensive and offensive tactics against the Japanese Navy. Hawaii shared with the commander of the Pacific Fleet his moments of anxiety as well as his moments of victory. Admiral Nimitz was aware of the loyal. unwavering support that the people of the then Territory of Hawaii gave him. for in March 1947 he testified before the House Public Lands Committee as a stanch and important supporter of statehood for the Hawaiian Islands. In doing so. he helped immeasurably to erase the doubts which still remained in the minds of some who feared the large number of Americans of Japanese ancestry. A grateful Hawaii immortalized our wartime naval leader by naming an elementary school. a high school. a highway. and the main gate at Pearl Harbor after him. And as a living. growing memorial to the admiral. 75 trees have been planted on both sides of Nimitz Highway to form a colonnade leading to Nimitz Gate.

Those of us who come from communities where steel and its allied industries have a vital economic role have long been aware of some of the problems about which Mr. Worthington speaks.

Certainly the turnabout that has America paying considerably more money for imports than it receives from its exports is of grave concern to every Member of Congress.

First. it would put an end to the present practice whereby naturalized citizens who refuse to testify before congressional committees could have their citizenship revoked. which would again seem to indicate that naturalized citizens are a different kind of citizens from those born in the United States. To my mind. it seems unfaircitizens by choice rather than citizens by the accident of birth should be given the favored spot and not the unfavored spot. Second. my bill would seek to rectify what has been already cleared up by the Supreme Court in the Schneider case. This was the case which decided that individuals born in a foreign country and naturalized in the United States. and then. through no fault of their own. spent more than 3 years residence in the country of their birth. would lose their citizenship. This is on the statute books but declared by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. It should be repealed. Thus. the third portion of my bill would provide for cleaning up the statute by removing those points which have already been rendered inoperative because of the Supreme Courts decision. My hope is that at the same time the bill of the Senator from Oregon is considered by the Judiciary Committee. my bill. S. 2364. might also be considered. covering these other two points. I would ask the Senator in charge of the bill whether that will be agreeable to him. I thank both him and the Senator from North Carolina for their willingness to consider the basic problem of this question on deportation. and I am wondering whether these other points in my bill might be considered at that time.",

So far as I am concerned. I am quite content to have the Senate authorize the expenditure of well over $4.800 million for this program. The purpose of my comments and many of the comments made by the Senator from Wisconsin is merely to call the attention of the Senate to the problem of priority. We also wish to call the attention of the press to the problem. However. I note that the press gallery is practically empty at this time. We have now arrived at a stage in our development where we have a potential in our Federal Governments ability to do what it is we would like to see done. We are straining our Federal resources quite substantially when we run our administrative budget up to around $100 billion. . There are those. of whom the Senator from Texas is one. who would like to see that budget substantially reduced. Personally. I would like to see it increased by 10 percent. I know in this regard I am not in agreement either with my friends. the Senator from Texas or the Senator from Wisconsin. so I say we have to determine among priorities. We cannot do everything we must do. We have to pick and choose. We have to decide how much of our money goes for space money. how much to our States for education. We get help in these matters from State and local governments. but we are looking for authorities from all sorts. local. State. and Federal. For instance. we are engaged in missions on earth now because some persons have not received a \"fair shake.\" where opportunity has been blighted. where a person may not have health because he is not getting adequate medical care. I honor the views of the Senator from Texas. I suggest to him that we could move a little more in the direction of bettering the welfare of the people.",

That was done because it was necessary to provide some money for the space agency. But each was treated separately. If we have not provided enough for certain programsand perhaps we have not. in some instancesthat is because we tried to consider each program on its merits. I do not believe that because we have decided it is necessary to spend the amount of money we have provided for the space agency. other programs have suffered. Let us be a little practical. too. When contracts to do the work are let to companies A. B. and C. 40 percent of the money will be returned to the Treasury. We should consider the amount of corporate taxes and income taxes that will be paid by keeping people at work. All the work will be done in this country. and employment will be furnished in a great. new. excitirig field in a new era. I hope we shall bear with the space agency.

I idmit. frankly. that in an area such as this no one can be exactly correct. We are working far into the future with many imponderables. But the committee considered this subject in great detail. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico and other Senators were present. We studied the matter in great depth. I merely cite three figures which I think have not been set forth. The proposed NASA appropriation is now $60 million under the NASA appropriation for fiscal 1965. It is $70 million under the budget estimate. The additions made by the Senate Committee on Appropriations are only $30 million over the House figure. I have great respect for the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. but I say to him that having heard the testimony on this subject for many years. I do not know how a 5percent cut could be applied to the whole bill. as his amendment would require. A few minutes ago. the chairman of the subcommittee stated that if a 5percent cut were made in one area we might find later that it would be necessary to add 15 or 20 percent in another area. We have tried diligently to balance these items as well as we could. While there might be a reasonable area of difference as between individuals as to the cutting of a particular item in the budget or the cutting of a particular program. I feel that a slash cut such as the Senator proposes can- only hurt the program and perhaps result in the spending of more dollars in the long run.",

The amendment would except from that provision assistance to institutions of higher education. which is already - an exception to the present absolute veto in the law. My reason for offering the amendmentand I hope very much that it will be accepted by the Senators in charge of the billis that. although we have had a great deal of debate concerning the veto power. as the bill would now leave the Senate there is no veto provision in it. and there is no mention of a veto power of any sort. The only provision with relation to this subject concerns continuous consultation with State antipoverty agencies. On the other hand. in the bill passed by the other body. there is a provision permitting the Governors veto but adding that his veto can be overridden by the Director of OEO. It is felt. in deference to the strong feelings of so many of our colleagues as to a veto. that the entire subject should be before us in conference. By adding this relatively innocuous provision for a public hearing to the particular section which in the House bill deals with the veto question. the matter would be before us in conference. I deeply feeland I am joined in this feeling by so ardent a proponent of the noveto position as the Senator from Texas -that we can come back with a provision which would be reasonable and would not be harmful. but which would lend dignity and respect to deeply held objections to denying the Governors the veto power.

He pointed out that a total of $16.109.752 of Federal funds have been provided to the State. in a wide range of programs including Job Corps camps. Neighborhood Youth Corps. workstudy programs. community action programs. project Head Start. programs to combat poverty on Indian reservations. and progress in the other areas open under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. One of the brightest areas of our efforts in the State of Minnesota has been that undertaken by the citizens and leaders in Hennepin County. and in the city of Minneapolis. To date. Minneapolis has received $749.653 from the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity to help break the cycle of poverty in which poor children find themselves. having an inadequate diet. poor housing. poor education. little job training. and limited outlook. The Community Health and Welfare Council of Hennepin County is waging an impressive array of programs on all the fronts of the povertystricken child. These programs involve a summer school program for over 3.000 children. a Neighborhood Youth Corps program for jobs for potential and real high school dropouts. vocational and educational counseling assistance for unemployed dropouts and graduates of high schools. and a summer work camp. a project Head Start grant for prekindergarten pupils. and the Project Motivation. in which University of Minnesota students tutor elementary schoolchildren and try to boost their interest in education. The actions by Hennepin County and the city of Minneapolis are notable for their efforts to fulfill the pledge made by President Johnson. \"to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this Nation by opening to everyone the opportunity for education and training. the opportunity to work. and the opportunity to live in decency and dignity.\" As an example of what these programs are doing. and the public acceptance of their fine efforts. I ask unanimous consent that the following articles from the Minneapolis Star of July 19. 1965. be this point. as well as a letter from the capable and distinguished president of the Community Health and Welfare Council.

    "speech": "Mr. President. there are now pending before the Federal Communications Commission several applications by socalled class IA clearchannel stations to Increase their power from the present 50.000 watts output to 750.000 watts. There are several reasons why the Federal Communications Commission should not authorize such a great increase in power for these stations. For example. the United States has treaties with such countries as Canada and Mexico to protect their radio channels from interference by U.S. stations. If the FCC should increase certain stations to 750.000 watts. it would not be possible. I am told. to protect these foreign channels from interference. and thus we would be unable to honor our treaties with neighboring countries. Additionally. and most importantly. authorization of higher power by the FCC would result in an undesirable concentration of economic control in the hands of a few stations. These superpower stations would be in a position to attract national advertisers away from the smaller radio stations around the country. As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee. I am seriously concerned about the very likely adverse economic impact that would be felt by the smaller stations. On November 14. 1964. the Florida Association of Broadcasters adopted a resolution which reads. in part. and I quote: Resolved. That the Florida Association of Broadcasters joins many other State associations. independent industry groups (the Association of Broadcasting Standards. Daytime Broadcasters Association. etc.) in registering unconditional opposition to this proposed granting of \"superpower\" by FCC. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Florida Association of Broadcasters resolution dated November 14. 1964. be inserted at this point in the RECORD.",

Personally. I cannot arrive at any conclusion that it is wrong for Americans to travel abroad and spend money they have saved for trips overseas for recreational and cultural purposes. Americans spend on foreign travel more than $1 billion a year more than foreigners spend in this country. The Congress appropriates money to promote tourism in the United States. Railroad and bus lines cooperate by offering special rates for foreign visitors. We simplified visa application forms. but one of the forms infuriated foreigners. It was a requirement that an alien state that he or she was not coming to our country for immoral purposes. This was insulting. Now some dimwit in the State Department. apparently seeking to close the gap on what Americans spend abroad and what foreigners spend here. proposes a direct tax of $100 a trip on Americans leaving our country for a foreign destination. Whether or not Canada. Mexico. and the Bahamas would be excluded. no one knows. I do not take this too seriously. Of all shortsighted. harebrained schemes. this one is fantastically outrageous. Perhaps this is a trial balloon. If so. the person who inflated it should deflate that brain child or brainless child without delay. We should do everything we may properly do to encourage foreigners to visit us. It would be ruinous to us throughout the world were we to restrict travel of our citizens at a time when we are sending Peace Corps representatives the world over. and when more and more Americans are saving money looking forward to vacations in foreign lands. Let us instead ask railroad and bus line officials to favor American vacationers with the same low rates they offer foreigners.",

How often do we hear the Senator in charge of the bill say that we cannot do this by way of amendment because the Government departments say it is impractical? This is a case where the Senate committee is going in exactly the other direction. I believe that the argument against the position which is taken in the Senate version of the bill is so persuasive that we just have no business allowing the provision to go uncorrected. The first point made by the Treasury Department is that tip income represents remuneration of the employee as wages. and that when the employer of a tipped employee arranges for that employees wages. he invariably considers and includes the fact that the employee will be receiving tips as a part of the reason for setting a certain wage. The best proof of that is in the recent survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor. which has been filed with Congress. dated January 1964. It is clear that the hourly wages of tipped employees as compared with the hourly wages of nontipped employees are set after taking tips into consideration. The hourly wagesand I refer to the report at page 25the average hourly wage paid to nontipped employees in the same establishment where other employees are tipped is $1.34 per hour. The wage for employees in the very same establishments who customarily receive tips is 81 cents an hourin other words. onethird less. Mr. President. this makes crystal clear what the Treasury Department has stoutly maintained. namely. that tip income is wage income and is allowed for as wage income when wages in these industries are fixed. It seems to me that is a conclusive reason for retaining the House language. If any other were needed. I point out that there are some 13 States which take into consideration the tips that employees receive when determining the minimum wage. so that an employer is deemed to be paying an employee the minimum wage when that employee receives both the amount the employer pays him and tips. This is a critically important fact. because this is the practice. not the theory.",

The Office of Education also reports that two out of every three public elementary schools have no libraries. We do little to enhance the knowledge of our children if wehowiever unintentionallydeprive them of the wonderful adventures so easily found in the world of books. Books are quiet. knowledgeable friends that demand only to be opened and occasionally dusted. With a minimum of upkeep. books can provide the maximum in knowledge. Title III authorizes $100 million for supplementary educational centers and services. Alaskas share would be $318.293.

The provisions of this title would allow local educational agencies to support educational radio and television programs.

No matter how difficult the war on poverty has become. it would be a grave mistake to retreat to the jungles of divided leadership and disjointed programs that prevailed prior to the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964. It was precisely because of clouded leadership in providing services related to juvenile delinquency that the Kennedy administration created the coordinated approach under the Presidents Commission on Juvenile Delinquency which formed the basis for title II. Federal programs to help the poor have been in operation for a long time but they were uncoordinated. administered by different agencies with different standards and objectives. often competing with each other and quarreling over jurisdiction. Also. at the local level. all across this country of ours. there existed thousands of community programs to break the cycle of poverty and expand opportunity. These were created locally by both public and private initiative. All of these programsFederal and localwere. however. limited in resources and programs. and provided only a limited solution for only a part of the problem: only a block of housing improvement in a wide slum area. too few day care centers for the children of mothers who also needed training perhaps. or preschooling for children whose parents were unemployed. and so on. The simple fact is: the causes of poverty are complex. Therefore. the solutions must be comprehensive.",

There has been reference on the other side to the fact that there is need for the Poverty Act as a coordinating agency. We must recognize that the President at any time can establish coordinating agencies to provide coordination among the various departments. I believe we must recognize that the Poverty Act started as a kind of experimental approach to a large problem. and really in this manner bypassed many of the ongoing agencies. This in turn is now causing confusion. because by that bypassing and superimposing of other programs on these agencies. confusion has been rampant. I might cite as an example the adult basic education provision. whereby the program of adult basic education is farmed out to the educational department. What the OEO is doing in this case Is merely acting as a referral agency. or as a funnel agency. This causes additional confusion. For example. in June of 1965 there was proposed an amount which was to be given to adult education in California. the sum of $1.8 million. The California State educational organizations planned for this and started making preparations. Then in November of 1965 there came another notification that this would be cut to $1.6 million. Finally. they allocated $819.000 to the adult basic education program sometime in February 1966. This naturally threw the adult basic education program into confusion. After pressure brought by some Congressmen. the OEO finally added $802.000 to the sum of $819.000. The same type of result occurs in many other areas of the poverty program. As a coordinating effort. I believe we have to recognize that the Poverty Act in many areas has been a complete failure and in many cases is attempting to do things which could be done by ongoing agencies already in effect. I support the Quie amendment because I believe it will place these programs where they belong. in the agencies already set up to fight poverty.",

I recall at one time the President suggested to the housewife that she should seek that cheaper cut of meat and in that way she could combat the rising cost of living and the rising cost of food. I suggest that in line with this argument. we have a real bargain offered in the Opportunity Crusade because here we not only have a cheaper cut of meat pricewise. but we have a better quality meat. We can save some $300 million and at the same time acquire better administration for the overall war on poverty. Time and again the majority have suggested that we would be fragmenting the program if. for instance. we put the education of children in the Office of Education. It seems to me that we presently have a fragmented program. It is suggested by the majority that we need to coordinate the war on poverty.

The alternative before us is a major amendment. In my opinion. it is a constructive one. Yet. the limitations of debate make it impossible for us to go into the details that really are needed if we are to come up with a sound logical explanation of this as a reasonable alternative. In my opinion. the justifications for continuing OEO as it is now set up do not add up to very much. Proponents of the bill argue that we need a new bureaucracy. The assertion has been made that one of the reasons OEO was establishedand I believe it can be put quite baldlyis that we cannot trust the old bureaucracy. The gentleman from New York who preceded me said that in almost so many words. The original idea was that we must set up OEO as a competitor with the various Federal agencies which have had this broad responsibility. this vital responsibility to alleviate poverty. for which we are currently spending over $30 billion a year because the established agencies. it is claimed. have not been doing much of a job. One of the proponents of the committee bill described the clouded bureaucracy which has been attempting to fight poverty in a variety of fields. In my opinionI recognize my opinion is not going to be worth very much in the atmosphere which prevails now at the end of a sessionit is no answer to set up a new bureaucracy which shows all the elements of weakness of the old bureaucracy and a lot more weaknesses besides.

There was no secrecy about the plans of our task force. A list was published of cities in which we hoped to hold hearings during the summer. For a variety of reasons a curtailment was necessary. It was necessary. for a variety of reasons. to modify that schedule in substantial ways. This was necessary. for one reason. because of the protracted airlines strike. We had hoped to get out to Denver. for example. but we could not. We had hearings set up in San Diego. but we were obliged to postpone them a month. On top of that. we have had some difficulty because of the necessity for campaigning only on weekends when. if the leadership had seen fit. we might have finished our legislative duties by Labor Day. What has developed with the Republican task force is a beginning of something which needs far more attention than it has had. I might say. there was no decision to go to Philadelphia. as an example. for political reasons. We had. as one of the key witnesses in Philadelphia. the chairman of Americans for Democratic Action. If our motivation had been political. presumably we would have been interested only in hearing Republicans. and we Republicans would not have wanted to hear what Democrats had to say. Admittedly a good many of the people who testified were very critical of the political motivations behind the poverty program. as established in Philadelphia. That was no reason for us to keep away. In my opinion. the Democrats have as much obligation as we to look. for example. at the way the Daley organization in Chicago has perverted what should be done with the OEO programs. and what is being done with the poverty programs in Philadelphia. It does no good simply to ignore these problems and to argue that Republicans are indulging in partisan maneuvering because we go to these cities. We had full cooperation.

Regardless of how we may have felt about the necessity for building a rapid transit system. no matter how we felt about the method of financing. Congress by an overwhelming majority decided in favor of a rapid transit system in the District of Columbia. Occasionally the Committee on Appropriations of the House has been criticized for legislating. To deny this appropriation and not appropriate any money could be construed as a form of legislation. and that is not within the spirit of the law. I agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin we should have complete knowledge of the facts involved. and we do not have that yet. Information on soil content is something we need very badly. This is one area where the agency has done considerable work and study. The Commission employed an engineering firm which collected soil information from the District Highway Commission. the General Services Administration and other local government bodies. They also drilled some 116 sampling holes. It is extremely important to have the contents of the soil analyzed. That will represent a total cost of $1.6 million. The gentleman from Kentucky said he did not think the transit system could be built for $431 million. Mr. McCarter says it can. A great many engineering experts agree with him. We have these conflicting views because we do not have engineering data on all details at this time. This bill provides a million dollars for preliminary plans to determine where the line is going. design and specifications of the stations et cetera. Practically all the funds in the bill is for engineering. design and planning. There have not been sufficient surveys on passenger load and fare income.

I am advised that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. the agency responsible for security clearance of all Cuban refugees entering the United States. already is doing and will continue to do what the amendment of the gentleman from Florida proposes to accomplish. I requested the Immigration and Naturalization Service to furnish me the steps involved in the screening of Cuban refugees for security reasons and have just received the following statement this afternoon: 1. Prior to departure from Cuba to the United States. identity of refugee will be checked against U.S. Government indices to see if derogatory information is contained concerning individual. Similar checks will be made by State Department of similar Visa Office records. 2. Where no derogatory information appears. primary selection will be confirmed and refugee will be examined comprehensively by immigration officer. 3. Upon arrival in United States. refugee will again be examined by immigration inspector to determine eligibility for admission under U.S. laws. 4. Refugee will be fingerprinted and photographed and detailed biographical data taken. These will be furnished to U.S. intelligence agencies for possible further identification in relation to any derogatory information. In event possible suspicion. matter will be referred to appropriate Government agencies for further interrogation. In any case where even remote doubt of eligibility exists for admission. refugee will be held in detention pending final determination. So. Mr. Chairman. the amendment seems to me wholly unnecessary. The Clerk will read.",

We also know that we have created a Department of Urban and Housing Affairs which is a Cabinetlevel Department. We now have an agency with Cabinetlevel status. Mr. Chairman. this program is to be administered by the Federal Housing Administration. This program was authorized in the new basic Housing Act and the sum of $150 million was authorized for the first year for the rent supplement program. The Bureau of the Budget recommended $30 million for the first year. We passed this law with a $150 million authorization. The Budget. as I stated. recommended $30 million. and our committee has proposed only a very modest start of $6 million this first year. They recommended $900.000 for payments. We have cut this figure to $180.000 for the first year. So we have proposed a very minimum start for the program. Mr. Chairman. the funds here proposed will not represent a galloping program. It is. I repeat. a very minimum program. The decision on this issue has been made. The House has voted on this matter. as well as the Senate. and the President of the United States has signed it into law. We cannot go up the hill one day and down the hill the next. Mr. Chairman. authority is given in the basic act for the making of contracts to private builders and private contractors. This was done for the purpose of bringing private enterprise into the housing program. It is tied in with the lowincome and public housing program under the Public Housing Act. Mr. Chairman. here is what the law provides. This rent supplement will only go under the law to those who are eligiblethose who are physically handicapped. those who have been displaced by governmental action. those who live in substandard housing or those who have been removed by some natural disaster such as the hurricane that occurred down in Louisiana recently. So it is tied down under law. to the lowincome groups. the handicapped. those who are disabled or have been displaced by the Government and those who have been affected by a natural disaster.",

I am very much concerned over the proposed reduction in funds in the 1967 budget for the national school lunch program. particularly in funds for the purchase of milk for school lunches. The national school lunch program has been one of the most popular and successful projects ever undertaken by the Federal Government. Millions of children throughout the country enjoy better health today by reason of the wholesome lunches they receive through the school lunch program. In North Carolina more than 900.000 children each day receive nutritious but inexpensive lunches through the school lunch program. I have always supported the program as I have felt that it has been one of the most effective means of improving the health of our country. In addition to our schoolchildren. our dairy farmers have a very important interest in the program. In North Carolina sales of dairy products for use in the school lunch program amount to approximately $6 million a year. The most important factor. however. is the health of present and future generations of Americans. No food has been discovered which can take the place of milk. I am hopeful. Mr. Speaker. that the appropriate committees of the Congress will study very carefully the budget recommendations for the 1967 fiscal year school lunch program and that as a result adequate funds will be made available to continue the program at least at the fiscal year 1966 level.",

Time and time again the public business has been set aside while we have engaged in the obsolete and ancient practice of filibustering. Two years ago I objected to a unanimousconsent request to allow the Appropriations Committee to sit during Senate sessions. hoping that this would force a reconsideration of this ridiculous rule. I did not make that request again last year. nor did I make it this year. because it seemed to me that the Senate was in no mood to change its absurd procedure in this regard. However. I put the Senate on notice now that starting with the next time we come into session. there will be no unanimous consent for the Appropriations Committee to sit while the Senate is in session unless other committees. and particularly the Committee on Foreign Relations. are permitted to meet also. We are now in a very critical international situation. There are some of us who believe that we are approaching the point of no return on our way to world war III. It is therefore vital to the national interest that the Committee on Foreign Relations be permitted to meet. and that the Committee on Armed Services should also be permitted to meet. and that the Committee on Appropriations should not have a monopoly on the right to meet. I know what my dear colleague. the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. the Senator from Arkansas is about to propound.

I joined the distinguished majority leader on cloture on the literacy test. We were roundly defeated. So I am no stranger to clotures. There were 45 yeas and 47 nays. Then the motion to take up was withdrawn. Now we are in the second battle on 14(b). I do not think we are being obdurate. I do not think we have been obstructing. If one looks at the Gallup polls he sees that 64 percent of the people of this country have indicated that they do not want section 14(b) repealed. Fortyfour percent of the cardcarrying members of the unions have expressed the same opinion. The union members wives have even been stronger in their expressions. because 51 percent. in the latest Princeton poll. have indicated they do not want section 14(b) repealed. So we have our convictions there. even as the majority leader has his convictions-",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment would cut from the bill the funds for the controversial. unproved rent supplement program. It is time for us to make and implement decisions where inflation is concerned. There are many things we might like to spend money for. but inflation will no longer permit the fiscal and deficit luxuries of the past. Inflation demands of us that we set priorities and fund only the most necessary and proven projects. Consumer prices are at the highest point in our Nations history. The dollar is at its lowest value in our Nations history. Interest rates are at their highest in 36 years. Loan money is critically tight. And. in the face of these ominous trends we are running another deficit Federal budget. Instead of a sham war against inflation. let us do something meaningful to cut Government spending. And. if we must cut. let us cut first those new projects which might be nice but are not necessary. Commerce Secretary John T. Connor. in a recent letter to corporation heads. enjoined them to \"exercise reasoned restraint in purchasing. inventories. pricing and in deferring capital expenditures wherever possible.\" In an address before the National Legislative Conference of Cities. the President of the United States announced recently that he has requested every executive department and agency to review and carefully examine how we can defer. stretch out or postpone any expenditures. Mr. President. I support the President of the United States. and I submit that this is not a necessary expenditure. It is a new start. and at this time we should carefully scrutinize any new starts. It is an unproven program. and I honestly believe that we in Congress must be selective. It is necessary that we act as shrewd managers of the purse strings in this time of inflation. We should strike from this bill this unproven rent supplement program. We can reconsider it at a future date when our monetary situation has stabilized.

The people who really suffer are the poor. I think that we should look closely at these unproven programs and not engage in new starts. not just in this program. but in other programs as well. and take a constructive step toward changing a fiscal policy which causes inflation and tight money and is the source of most of our economic problems now.

I have supported this amendment. first in the subcommittee of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island . in the full committee. then on the floor of the Senate. in the Subcommittee on Independent Offices. and in the full committee. On these occasions. I have voiced essentially the same thoughts voiced by the distinguished Senator from Texas . I. like he. would like to see our housing problems solved. My basic objection to the rent supplement is that while it may help a few. we are committing ourselves to a 40year program for which the authorization is $100 million a year with the carryover. This is not a substitute for anything else. and herein lies the nub of the problem. We are now putting into the budget. and in this bill for public housing programs. a total of $351 million. A part of that is for the elderly. but we are putting $250 million into public housing. per se. In addition to that. we discovered at the hearings this year that the Department of Housing and Urban Development also has another program going. for which they have an annual subsidy of $754 per unit per year. in which they lease premises. sublease them to tenants. and then pick up the rental differential. which amounted in fiscal year 1966 to $1.743.750. So we have all of these programs going. If there were any attempt to bring order out of that chaos. I might look at the rent subsidy in a different manner today than I do. It Is only for this reason that I rise to support the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Texas . This rent supplement might be the best way to handle our public housing problems. but we are not going to handle them by simply piling one program on top of another. That is what we are doing because we are keeping all of the old moneys in the bill and we have this rather modest amount. I must admit. but this is not what it is going to be in a year or 2 years from now. It is going to be a significant amount. I support the amendment of the Senator from Texas .",

Realizing that certain elements of it are more expensive. perhaps we should yield in some instances insofar as the size needed for the situation.

The Labor Department matter involves only the building of a foundation and not a superstructure. It is considered necessary to proceed with initial construction because of a new highway going through that area which must be accommodated. That is the reason it is not included. The distinguished Senator from Washington says that after they have waited all of these years. the expenditure of these few dollars will not shatter the economy. There is no suggestion that the economy will be shattered by this. However. after they have waited all of these years. it will not be a catastrophe if they are required to wait 1 more year. at a time when we have an escalating war that is costing more and more each day. Bear in mind that $11.320.000 would be appropriated for the FBI Building. The building would ultimately cost $45 million. Even if funds were provided. they would not be able to move into and start to use the building next year. The building would just be started. Therefore. it would not relieve the pressure now. It certainly seems that after waiting all this time. it would not be disastrous to wait a little longer in a time of war. It also should be borne in mind that in the very next paragraph of the bill there is provision that these appropriations can be exceeded this year. to the extent of not more than 10 percent of savings effected in other projects. Remember that the President of the United States has been calling on private industry not to expand at this time. He has been asking that private industry refrain from building new plants and making other capital expenditures while we are under this pressure. because it is Inflationary. If it is inflationary for private industry. which pays taxes into the public till. to expand. it is more inflationary to start constructing new superstructures in Washington. buildings which pay no taxes but simply contribute to the expenditure of money.

It would be very difficult for Hanoi to continue any protracted campaign except on the Isolated guerrilla basis. And this is the real issue at stake here.

I refer to the hearings recently held on the proposed amendments to the Economic Opportunity Act: Congressman QuiE. the figures that were given to you * * * were inaccurate. Thus. in testimony on March 23. Bernard L. Boutin. of the Office of Economic Opportunity. began a pointbypoint denial of facts presented by ALBERT H. QUIE. Republican of Minnesota. 4 days earlier with reference to the Charleston. W. Va.. Womens Job Corps Center. The same day Congressman SAM GIBBONS. of Florida. took the floor defending OEO and declaring that Congressman QUIE. inadvertently. was wrong. Further investigation in Charleston not only showed that Congressman QuIE was right but that he conservatively understated the established facts that add up to scandalous poverty profits to a leading Democrat officeholder in West Virginia. Congressman QuiE said the Hotel Kanawha was owned by a corporation whose president was Angus Peyton. a prominent Democrat and the present commerce commissioner in West Virginia. This is undenied. Congressman Quiz said that the Kanawha Hotel lease provides for payment of $94.800 a year net profit. after the Federal Government reimburses for taxes. insurance. utilities. and repairs. Mr. Boutin said the rent was $90.000. The fact Is that the rent is $94.800 and the Federal Government pays. in addition. $4.800 a year for the storage of old hotel property. Congressman Quis said assessments in West Virgina were by law 50 percent of market value. Mr. Boutin said they were 40 percent. Chapter 18. article 9(a). section 4 of the West Virginia Code provides that assessed valuation shall not be less than 50 percent nor more than 100 percent of appraised valuation.",

Mr. Boutin claimed it was worth $438.000 in 1965 and $508.250 in 1966perhaps slyly including In its value $345.000 worth of renovations at taxpayers expense. The fact is that reliable real estate brokers in Charleston indicated the Hotel Kanawha was worth about $250.000 prior to renovation. A somewhat older but comparable hotel in Charleston. the MilnerRuffner. with more land and a more valuable location. sold on February 1 this year for $200.000. Mr. Boutin defended the Kanawha Hotel expenditures with the claim that annual square foot rental cost is less than $1. The figure must have been computed by dividing the erroneous $90.000 per year rental by 100.000 square feet. This becomes an entirely meaningless computation when It is -understood that it ignores $4.800 being paid annually for storage of the old hotel furniture. $7.500 paid annually for taxesincluding taxes on the furniture in storage and the hotels accounts receivable-$5.740 paid annually for insurance and $4.800 paid annually for rent in addition to the $90.000 reported by OEO. Certainly a meaningful annual squarefoot cost figure should include all annual expenditures. not to mention $16.000 to settle leases of former tenants and some annual amortizing of the $345.549.51 renovations. Who does Mr. Boutin think he fools by citing such glib and misleading figures? In summary. the poverty program has spent $345.549.51 renovating a rundown hotel worth about $250.000. A corporation. whose then president is a leading West Virginia Democrat. receives $94.800 per year profit on property worth $250.000. That is a poverty profit of 38 percent a year. An OEO official described the Charleston Womens Job Corps arrangement as \"the very best deal that could be gotten.\" The taxpayers might be justified in asking \"the best deal for whom?\"",

Everyone in fields of business and labor as well as the housewife are blamed. cautioned. cajoled. and intimidated but the real culprit. Federal spending. is overlooked. The Wall Street Journal. a national organ. said in a recent editorial: Hardworking Americans dont deserve to be slapped with a tax boost Just because their Government refuses to prune its political extravagances. At the local level. one of the 17th Districts leading newspapers. the Mansfield NewsJournal. carried an editorial entitled \"Its Not Soap Flakes That Cause Inflation.\" The editor summed up the situation by saying: If you want to root out inflation. right in Washington is the place to start digging. One of our fine weekly newspapers. the Loudonville Times. hit the same theme in an editorial letter by writing \"Dear Mr. President\" and saying among other things: We are tired of supporting the professional bum or \"Job dodger\" and we are fed up with the flood of money (ours) that you are pouring into other countries with glee. Many times. these countries are Communist controlled and after they receive our money they say \"Yankee. go home.\" or burn down our embassies. This spirit Is reflected everywhere. After 10 days with the people back home. I can tell you Mr. President. that the old Lincoln statement of \"you can fool some of the people some of the time\" and so forth. is beginning to apply.

As should be well understood by those who have read my addresses. these subversive activities include the Republic of Panama. During January 315. 1966. in Havana. there was held what was designated as the \"First Conference of the Solidarity of Peoples of Asia. Africa. and Latin America\" of some 600 delegates and observers from 82 countries in 3 continents. popularly known as the \"TriContinental Conference.\" One of the main purposes of this Conference was to accelerate the pace of terror and subversion in Latin America. which program has grave implications for those charged with heavy responsibilities in the maintenance. operation. sanitation. and protection of the Panama Canal.

Saxon. the soundness Of the banking business. and the possibility that the the criminal element has infiltrated our national banks. The following excerpts from the Monday. April 18. 1966. editorial in the Washihgton Post seems to pinpoint this issue with particular clarity: To be sure. James J. Saxon. the Comptroller of the Currency. is one of the more controversial luminaries of the Federal firmament. He is a stubborn. proud man and his aggressive thrusts on more than one occasion have outraged sensibilities by disturbing the equilibrium within the bureaucracy that regulates the banking industry. But compatibility. with .the establishment Is not the sole criterion by which a civil servant should be judged. By urging innovations and pointing to new opportunities for profit and growth. Mr. Saxon has shaken the federally chartered national banks out of a lethargy that was induced by the trauma of the 1929 crash and the stagnation of the 1930s. Since 1961. Mr. Saxon has chartered 500 new national banks and acquired many enemies in the process. In some localities his new institutions are a threat to local banking monopolies. In others hackles were raised because charters were granted to groups which by virtue of religion. color. or national origin have seldom enjoyed the privilege of creating credit. The fact is that only one of the new national banks has failed. and a very small one at that. Moreover. if there is in fact a drive by racketeers to enter the banking industry. they are more likely to succeed by takihg over existing Statechartered institutions than by applying for new national bank charters which are granted only after exhaustive investigations. There is no place in banking for unscrupulous men. But concern for the depositoractually they are amply protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationmust not be used as a mask to perpetuate privilege.",

It is expected that the project will not only not further aggravate the surplus production problem but it will reduce crop surpluses in this area. So much has been said about the relationship between the agriculture surpluses problem and the reclamation program you may be interested in the fact that agricultural production on lands reclaimed or protected by the Corps of Engineers has exceeded the production on reclamation projects and the crops on Corpsprotected lands are those which contribute more to the surplus problem than crops grown on reclamation projects. A few weeks ago. the House passed legislation authorizing some $263 million for continuing the construction program of the Corps of Engineers in 10 river basins. In one of these areas alone. the Corps program provides for development and use of about 726.000 acres of rich agricultural land which in the past has been practically unused. This brings into cultivation almost 3 times as much land as the Garrison unit and this is only one area. I fully support the program of the Corps of Engineers but I just want my colleagues to know that if the agricultural surpluses problem is going to be an issue in the consideration of water resources development projects and programsand I do not believe it should bethen the reclamation program is not the greatest offender..",

A comprehensive plan to finance longrange solutions to the water needs of the Southwest. this legislation will probably be the next major reclamation proposal to come before the Congress.

It is but another shocking example of police brutality in that State. another link in a long chain of attempts to deprive free citizens of their constitutional rights. Every day seems to bring another. Americans want an end to this reign of terror. When one constitutional right is denied. all rights are in danger. Mr. Speaker. the latest brutalities show the need for Federal legislation to help protect these peaceful demonstratorsand all other citizens. Brutality by police officials should not be countenanced in our land. In this session I reintroduced my bill to protect civil rights by providing civil and criminal remedies for unlawful official violence. It would enact strict penalties for subjecting any person to unnecessary force during the course of an arrest or while the person is being held in custody. It would also provide punishments for other acts of misconduct so prevalent in Mississippi. such as official aid to private persons in carrying out acts of unlawful violence. and unnecessary force used in eliciting confessions. These vital measures are needed now. I urge the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on this important measure and to report it out favorably. Clearly. if some are unsafe. none are safe. We must enact this bill to protect the constitutional rights so basic to our American way of life.",

When I introduced H.R. 8635 following the ClayListon match I indicated that the Congress of the United States should find some way of restoring integrity to these exhibitions which are of such great interest to so many people in this country. About 15 years ago our committee dealt with a somewhat similar problem. namely. rigged quiz shows. At that time. millions of Americans who had watched these programs with great interest thought they saw a bona fide contest. Actually our investigation showed that these contests were rigged.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the agriculture appropriations bill debate we had assurances from the Department of Agriculture that we would not release the $37 million worth of surplus commodities due to Egypt under Public Law 480. This agreement is due to expire on June 30. Press reports have been coming out of Cairo. claiming that President Johnson has decided in spite of these assurances. to release the $37 million of surplus commodities. I hope that these reports are rumor and not fact. The Department of Agriculture has said that it has no knowledge of such a decision from the White House. The importance of discontinuing this aid has again been reemphasized by the exposure of Egypts bad faith in keeping within the rice crop export quota as established by the present aid agreement between Egypt and the United States. Under terms of the 3year trade agreement that expires June 30. Egypt is restricted as to the amount of rice it can sell abroad. The agreement specifies that if Egypts total rice crop in a marketing yearNovember 1 to October 31is as high as 1.4 million metric tons. it can export up to 455.000 metric tons. Any amount produced over 1.4 million tons may also be exported under this agreement. In the 1964 marketing year the rice crop was 1.465 million tons. This means that Egypt could have exported an additional 65.000 tons. plus the 455.000 tons. or 520.000 metric tons of rice. The Department of Agriculture has informed me that Egypt actually exported 589.000 tons. or in other words has exceeded the agreement by selling in excess of 69.000 metric tons. This should help reinforce the Presidents previous apparent resolve to stop any further shipment of our surplus commodities to Egypt. We have filled many pages of the RECORD with debate on this issue. It is my hope that the President will honor his pledge with the American people and stop this futile attempt to bribe the Egyptian Government to restrain itself from interfering in the affairs of the emerging governments on the African Continent.",

We are commemorating the voyage of that intrepid Norseman who followed his star across the northern seas on a journey never before. to our knowledge. made by any man. History attests to the fact that in about the year 1000. a company of Norse adventurers. led by their captain. Leif Erikson. set sail westward in the Sea Mew. from the colony of Greenlandestablished by Leifs father. Eric the Redand eventually landed at a place they found to be so bountiful they named it \"Vinland the Good.\" We now know it as the Cape Cod area of Massachusetts. This discovery and the tales brought home by the sailors prompted others to seek the new land. What sort of man was this Leif Erikson? A man In whom the fires of adventure burned. surely. but also a man of responsibility. The Icelandic sagas record instances of his dutiful attitude. both with regard to his own family and as a community leader whose counsel was sought and respecteda man of Christian conviction. In a country where the Vikings worshipped their mythical pagan gods. Leif Erikson was instrumental in converting many to Christianityand without doubt a courageous man. outstanding even in a world of courageous men. I am proud to pause to pay tribute to this fellow Scandinavian on this occasion. Other brave and dauntless men in other ships in the next few centuries followed whatever star led them to the shores of what we call America. The cost was great to the small bands of men and women whose courage was so indomitable that they were able to face. even with eager anticipation. the future in an unknown and often hostile land. But they came--century after centuryuntil the land yielded to the sacrifice and toil that built it into our America of today. Frontiers are still there.

This was especially so in the late 18th century when their freedom and independence was in jeopardy. In 1772 they had already lost a third of their country to Austria. Prussia. and Russia. In order to forestall the repetition of such a .disaster. Polands leaders aimed at strengthening the Government of Poland by reforming and overhauling its governing machinery. In 1788. a committee of the Dietthe assemblybegan to draw up a constitution. In the course of 3 years this was completed. and the resulting document. the Constitution of May 3. 1791. was promulgated on that day. For the Poles that date became memorable and the Constitution a historic document. This Constitution introduced many radical changes in the Government of the country. Poland became a constitutional monarchy. with a responsible cabinet type of government. The powers of the lower chamber were enhanced and those of the upper chamber drastically reduced. The barriers separating the nobility from other classes were practically eliminated. The authority of landlords over the peasantry was reduced. and religious toleration was guaranteed. These liberal provisions made the constitution a truly democratic document. Its promulgation was hailed both by. Poles and by their friends in many lands. From then on the date of its promulgation became a Polish national holiday. Unfortunately. the Poles did not have the chance to put their new Consitution into force and reap its benefits. but today all Poles take just pride in the fact that their leaders were the first among other national leaders in Eastern Europe to draft and promulgate such a liberal and democratic constitution. That historic document testifies to their genuine democratic aspirations. In the celebration of the 174th anniversary of Polish Constitution Day I gladly join hands with all libertyloving Poles.

The calculated and systematic destruction of countries. races. and nationalities passes all understanding of peaceloving people. We have resolved that never again shall such destruction be brought upon the face of this earth and to this end have created the United Nations. The U.N. alone cannot prevent mans barbarious acts to each other. Each of us must in our own way fight hatred. injustice. and prejudice wherever possible. To do this people have joined together in organizations to foster brotherhood. The National Conference of Christians and Jews is one such organization. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to set before this assembly remarks of the Vice President of the United States honoring two great citizens of Nebraska. Gov. Frank Morrison and Dr. Abe Greenberg. for their tireless efforts in fositering brotherhood among the citizens of Nebraska and this Nation. My hope is that the timely remarks of Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY will inspire us to labor for a better understanding among people of this Nation and the peoples of this world.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. great historic documents are the expression of lofty ideals conceived and formulated by men of vision and foresight. often becoming landmarks in national histories and leaving their permanent impression on national character. The Polish Constitution of May 1791. is such a document and reflects the liberal and progressive character of Polands leaders In the late 18th century. This memorable and historic Constitution embodied many democratic ideas. and represented a decisive advance over anything previously attempted in Poland. By its provisions Poland abandoned its antiquated. medieval system of government and adopted one with many modern features. Autocratic Poland became a constitutional monarchy. The most startling innovation was the abolition of the liberum veto by which any one member in the Dietthe national assemblycould veto any measure. preventing the enactment of any legislation. The new Constitution did away with this obstructive feature. and thereby paved the way for new legislation. The powers of the upper house were reduced and those of the popularly elected lower house were increased. Freedom of conscience and of free speech were guaranteed. These democratic features made the Constitution of May a model progressive instrument. and as such it was widely hailed both in Poland and Polands friends everywhere. Through such a drastic overhauling of Polands Government. its valiant and liberal leaders hoped to save their fatherland from eventual dismemberment. Unfortunately that in itself was not sufficient to save Poland. Soon after the proclamation of this Constitution Polands foes attacked her. and brought her independent existence to an end for more than a century. Unhappily the Poles did not have the good fortune to live at peace under their new Constitution. but they have looked upon it as a memorable. almost sacred. document embodying their unrealized dreams and longcherished hopes. The ideals embodied In that Constitution. Mr. Speaker. are as alive in the hearts of the Polish People on this 174th anniversary celebration of its promulgation as they were in 1791. A2127 Monday.

However. the bill provides that 5 years after its enactment section 303(b) of the act would be repealed. The bill contains provisions which will completely remove any Federal money in the Capital Bank. The authorized capital of the Bank would be $150 million. Of this amount $50 million would be preferred stock and $100 million would be common stock. Under the bill. the Treasury would purchase $50 million of preferred stock of the Bank. Also. the SBA revolving fund for the use of the SBIC program would be reduced by $50 million. The preferred stock of the bank purchased by the Treasury would be retired by the Bank as soon as possible from the earnings of the Bank.

These may be made. among other things. for improving farms and for refinancing existing indebtedness. These are 5percent loans. Subchapter II provides for operating loans to farmers and ranchers. These may be. among other things. for purchase of livestock. farm equipment. feed. and seed. They are also 5percent loans. In addition. FHA administers section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949. under which a farmer may be able to finance his home on a 4percent basis. Or. under section 307 of the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act. it may be possible for the farmer to secure a loan on other property. again at 5 percent. At the same time. Mr.-President. under the emergency loans subchapter. on designation of the Secretary that the need for credit is the result of natural disaster. loans not in excess of 3 percent per annum may be made for any of the purposes authorized for loans under the previous two subchapters. It would seem that the intent is to provide disaster loans through FHA in these various categories at a uniform 3 percent. However. this is not the interpretation apparently placed on the statutes by the Secretary. Last Sunday. at a meeting in Russiaville. Ind.. which was all but totally destroyed by the Palm Sunday tornadoes. I listened to a representative of the Farmers Home Administration as he attempted to explain the 5-. .4-. and 3percent loans which are available. It was an exercise in confusion. Mr. President. a natural disaster is a natural disaster to all of a farmers affected property. whether his loss is in buildings. livestock. tractors. or washedout planted fields whose seed and fertilizer have gone down the river. I see no reason why one class of loan under emergency conditions should bear a 3percent rate. a second 4 percent. and a third 5 percent. It is for that reason. in order to clarify the procedures and make the rate uniform. that I am introducing my bill today for amendment of the act.

I have long supported legislation that Is intended to expedite the assimilation of the American Indian into the mainstream of our society. Transfer of title for this land to the Mescalero Apache Tribe will be. in my estimation. another step forward in this direction. The purpose of H.R. 12265 is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to declare that the United States holds in trust for the New Mexico pueblos of Acoma. Sandia. Santa Ana. and Zia certain lands and improvements now owned by the United States if and when they are no longer needed by the Government. The approximate total of acreage involved here is some 435 acres of land previously set aside by the Government for school and administrative use. The total value of the land and improvements thereon is approximately $31.000. In my considered opinion the aforementioned New Mexico pueblos will be able to make good use of this land by erecting community centers or for agricultural and grazing purposes. Passage of H.R. 12265 will relieve the Federal Government of responsibility for maintaining the buildings on the land and the Indians will assume the responsibility for maintaining both the lands and the buildings.

The report of this same group of lawyers noted that while 605.000 Amercans have died in all wars from the Revolution to Vietnam. road deaths in the United States have totaled 1.500.000 in only 25 years. The study revealed that the number of persons injured in highway accidents in 1964 is the same number as the total beds in all hospitals in the United States-.700.000. These are shocking figures. I have thought for some time that we should take steps at the national level to standardize highway signs. speeds. and so forth. in an effort to cut this needless death. injury. and destruction on our highways. Although the Federal Government has spent millions building interstate highways. we have done little or nothing at the national level to prescribe and enforce safety standards. Several years ago. when we became alarmed at the increase in accidents involving airliners. we established the Federal Aviation Agency to coordinate and improve safety in the air. Now we should establish an agency to improve safety on the groundfor automobile drivers and passengers. as well as trucks and buses. Our colleague. the gentleman from Georgia . a member of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. has gone into this problem very thoroughly and has proposed legislation to establish a National Traffic Safety Agency to provide national leadership to reduce traffic accident losses. I am introducing a similar bill. The National Traffic Safety Agency. which would be headed by an Administrator comparable to the Federal Aviation Administrator. would do the following: Establish a National Safety Research and Testing Center. Provide leadership to achieve a more uniform traffic environment. including more uniform rules of the road. more adequate standards of safety in the manufacture of new vehicles and inspection of vehicles in use. better definition of fitness to drive. and a more uniform physical driving environment. The proposed new Agency should not seek to supplant existing public and private agencies. but it should provide aggressive leadership to achieve a concert of action. It is my hope that the legislation will be enacted promptly so we can begin a real effort to reduce wanton destruction on our highways.",

I am referring particularly to the work that he has done in bringing out some of the facts about this recent Havana Conference. because such a meeting and the attitude and identity of the participants have great significance for us in determining the path that we should follow in the pursuit of our foreign policy. I believe that the gentleman from Alabama will agree that a study of the Conference proceedings show that this was a Russianorganized meeting. that the facade of universal action was pretty thin. At the same time there was one significant result of this heavyhanded Conference that I should like to mention. and that was the reaction to its subversive activities and pronouncements of the countries of Latin America themselves. When the members of the Organization of American States heard of the action which had taken place. without any dissenting vote. they proceeded to take prompt action to deplore the revolutionary policies that were set forth and the stated interventionist objectives of this conference. Mr. Speaker. it is noteworthy that subsequent to this Latin American action. whether for publicity purposes or otherwise. there was a very prompt verbal backtracking on the part of the Russians themselves perhaps because they did not appreciate completely the depth of the reaction in the Latin American countries to this conference. At any rate. the avowed sponsorship of subversion and intervention accords ill with the oftstated Soviet objective of building bridges to the Western world. Mr. Speaker. I feel that the gentleman from Alabama should be complimented and commended for the work that he and the committee have done on this subject.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the interest of keeping the record straight. I call attention to the following: Under the heading \"Stewarts Ploy.\" an editorial in the Washington Post states as follows: Although J. George Stewart. the Architect of the Capitol. did not ask for funds to construct an extension on the West Front. there is no reason to think the project has been postponed. Mr. Stewart has never favored asking for separate appropriations for his building schemes. At this stage in a session Congressmen are tempted to ask questions and demand explanations before approving expenditures. Mr. Stewart prefers to stick his requests among the supplemental appropriations items that come in the last hectic days before adjournment. He funded the East Front extension in this manner. He funded the Rayburn House Office Building in this manner. The statements that the extension of the east front and the Rayburn Building were funded through supplemental appropriations are essentially false. A review of the records. which could be made with great ease by anyone interested. shows the following: Extension of the east front: $24 million was appropriated for this project and associated items. Of this amount. $19.700.000 was obtained through the regular annual appropriation acts and $4.300.000 through supplemental appropriations. It is significant that the first two appropriations made for this project. totaling $17 million. were carried in the regular acts This was more than enough to cover the total cost-$12 millionof the extension of the east front itself. Additional House office building project: $134.500.000 was appropriated under this heading. which includes the construction of the Rayburn Building at a cost of approximately $89 million. Of the total of $134.500.000 appropriated. $124.500.000 came by the regular annual appropriations acts and $10 million by supplementals. Of the $10 million from supplementals. $5 million was earmarked for purchase of land east of the Cannon House Office Building which the Congress has now decided will be used for the Madison MemorialLibrary of Congress Building. So. in fact. only $5 million from supplemental appropriations went toward payment for the Rayburn Building. remodeling of the other buildings. construction of garages and subways. and other items carried on under this project.",

The gentleman from Missouri should have read the entire speech and not just the part on exports. In that speech. Secretary Connor also said: If the longterm arrangement is not extended in its present form. exporters abroad should not assume that uncontrolled cotton textile trade in the U.S. market would result. It is an Indisputable fact that the U.S. cotton textile industry is in a much better position now than it was before the longterm arrangement went into operation. It is also indisputable that the longterm arrangements operation has played a major role in this improved situation. If the United States were to permit the present substantial increases already taking place to be intensified by those which would occur in the phasing out of the longterm arrangement. the favorable condition of the industry would soon vanish. especially if a drop in demand would occur. Eric Wyndham White. the Director General of GATT. recognizing the useful purpose the longterm arrangement serves for both importing and exporting nations. and wishing to achieve the maximum benefits of the Kennedy round. has proposed a package plan for the cotton sector talks. Under this plan. the exporting nations would agree to a further extension of the longterm arrangement in return for the importing nations agreeing to an increase in the orderly access of their markets and to tariff reductions. The United States has already discussed this package plan with a number of exporting countries and has achieved a meeting of minds with some of them. Talks are continuing with other nations.

The various agencies of the Government presented requests of $131 billion. as I recall. the President reduced these requests to about $113 billion.

It is Congress that has dofie this. not the administration. So if we are seeking to place the blame. let us not place it where it does not belong. let us give Congress its fair share. too.

In this connection. I read from an Associated Press dispatch of this morning: LONDON. July 10.-There was speculation in Britain today that the bank rate. prime discount rate on which the countrys interest structure rests. might go as high as 9 per cent before the end of the year. * * * * * The rate is currently 6 per cent. But many financial experts believe it will have to go up to the traditional crisis level of 7 per cent very soonpossibly Thursday. This will be long before autumnthe season when sterling usually comes under pressure.

I do think we should bear in mind the remarks made today by all of the Senators on both sides of the aisle. because this is a serious problem. And may I say that while I can find fault with the Congress for so far. either through appropriations or authorizations. raising the amounts involved between $3 billion and $4 billion above the Presidents January budget requests. I am not blameless. I am not any Galahad. because I have voted for practically every one of those increases. As a matter of fact I do not see any on my list that I did not vote for. But that does not make me any better or any worse than anyone else. It is something which Congress should consider collectively. It is something for which we all bear a share of responsibility. I commend the distinguished minority leader and other Senators who have spoken this afternoon. and most especially the Senator from Kansas . the Senator from Vermont . who has documented everything about which he speaks. the Senator from New York . who knows the financial field very well. and the Senator from Delaware . who is always interested in economy in government. as well as the Senator from Ohio . who is on his feet at all times trying to bring about a reduction in appropriations and authorizations.

They have not been raised in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. and this is where the business is being done. It is time now that we take stock of where we are. When Lincoln became the candidate of his party for the Senate in 1858 he used one sentence that I thought covered the entire waterfront. He began by saying: \"If we can but know where we are and whither we are tending. we shall the better know what to do and how to do it.\" Four questions are contained in that short sentence. However. that sentence states the casewhere are we. what is the direction. what do we do. and how do we do it? Those are the questions to which we should find answers before grief and distress overtake us. I am grateful to all who have participated in the discussion this afternoon.

The term. as so defined. includes any committee. association. or organization which accepts contributions or makes expenditures for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the election of candidates or presidential and vice presidential electors In two or more States.

We learned. at A1635 the same time. that jobs were going begging for lack of qualified applicants.

Our Republican study group in 1961 endorsed the need for such legislation as the Manpower Development and Training Act. which was passed the following year. My colleagues will recall that on the House floor we substituted for the bill reported by the Committee on Education and Labor a bill embracing the Republican study groups recommendation and largely written by the gentleman from New York . The role of the opposition party in our form of government is an important one. It has been correctly said that we should support the administration when it is right. criticize it when it is wrong. and be ready to offer constructive alternatives to bills we agree with in principle but disagree with in detail. The constructive alternative offered by Republicans in 1962 resulted in the successful manpower development and training program. The bill before us would strengthen and extend this program and. therefore. has my wholehearted support. Sister Mary Jeanine Gave Witness to Her Faith at Selma",

Major testimony was given on this bill that we had to do something for nursing as one of the allied health professions which had the greatest difficulty. The effects of the nursing shortage are unbelievable. At this point. I should like to refer to my amendment. originally introduced on September 1 as amendment No. 787. which has been incorporated into H.R. 13196 as section 8 of that measure. This provision is designed to help relieve the critical shortage of nurses which is seriously threatening patient care throughout the Nation. This nursing shortage is widespread and universal. striking both affluent and nonaffluent communities. the cities. the suburbs. and rural areas alike. As the hearings demonstrate. the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare estimates the nursing shortage at 125.000. In New York City. for example. 25 percent of the registered nursing positions in 150 private hospitals are unfilled. For the citys 21 municipal hospitals. the situation is more drastic60 percent of the positions are unfilled. Just last week. the New York Times carried the revelation that at the Queens Hospital Center in New York City. State health officials found 15 staff nurses on duty for 1.039 patients one afternoon. Due to the nurse shortage. the centers recovery room is closed on weekends and patients are transferred directly from the operating room to understaffed wards.

The scholarship program is one of the few remaining unfilled recommendations of the Surgeon Generals Consultant Group on Nursing which issued its report. \"Toward Quality in NursingNeeds and Goals.\" in February 1963. .Other principal recommendations in the report were brought to fruition in the Nurses Training Act of 1964. But. important as the Nurses Training Act and these new amendments are. legislation alone is insufficient to relieve the nursing shortage. As Mrs. Judith G. Whitaker. executive director of the American Nurses Association. recently wrote me: Low salaries have had in the past. and continue to have. adverse influence on the ability of health care facilities to recruit and retain adequate numbers of registered nurses. Immediate and substantial economic improvements must be made if nursing services of the quality and quantity required in modern medical care are to be provided. The House of Delegates of the American Nurses Association this summer adopted a national annual salary goal of $6.500 for registered nurses beginning their practice. It has been estimated that achieving such a goal would add approximately 85 cents to the daily costs per patient. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point the statement of the American Nurses Association in support of the resolution of a national salary goal for entrance into nursing.",

    "speech": "Permit me another observation with respect to the nursing shortage. Too often. we speak only In terms of recruiting women into the profession. However. there is a place for men and they can be attracted to the field. For example. while only 1 percent of all persons entering into nursing training programs are men. on a national basis. the Rockland Community College of Suffern. N.Y.. which conducts an associate degree program in nursing. boasts of 15 percent men students. I hope that more men will consider entering this important service. The opportunity grants for nursing education contained in my amendment. section 8. of the bill is patterned after the educational opportunity grant program contained in title IV. part A. of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as Is the provision designed to encourage recruitment of young people into the nursing profession. Both of these provisions will be especially useful in helping young people from lowerincome and from minority groups. For example. although 11 percent of the population. Negroes comprise less than 5 percent of the nursing profession. Nursing offers an excellent opportunity for these young people to expand their horizons and to fill a national need. A final word. I am aware that my amendment. as approved by the committee. does not meet all needs. As originally introduced. it included an increase in funds for nursing school construction grants and teaching improvement grants. The scholarship provision. while having all the virtues of the educational opportunity grant program of the Higher Education Act. also has its defects. But all in all. section 8 of H.R. 13196 is a significant and vital step forward in meeting a pressing national need. Let us take that step now.",

This concern is centered on the shortage of professional nurses. now estimated at 125.000 throughout the United States. Efforts are being made in all sectorsprivate and publicto attempt to alleviate this shortage. Longrange efforts must be directed toward the education of nurses and the recruitment of greater numbers of young people. The amendment will provide muchneeded scholarships for nursing students. Eligible young people would be awarded scholarships of $800 annually. and those who prove themselves by ranking in the upper half of their nursing class would be awarded an additional $200. In addition. the amendment provides funds for a program to encourage young people to go into nursing. A very useful portion of the amendment concerns transferability of funds. This would permit funds authorized for associate degree and diploma programs to be interchangeable with funds for baccalaureate and higher degree programs in Instances where one program has insufficient applications and the other is underfunded. All of the provisions in this bill should assist in recruiting more able young people into the nursing profession and to serve in a capacity they know will benefit the entire Nation in its efforts to improve health care. It is unfortunate that salaries for nurses are not commensurate with the degree of preparation nor the tasks which they perform. Salaries. of course. are not a matter for Congress. But it should be noted that public concern and consideration must be given to this vital factor which militates against recruiting more young women into nursing.

Its overwhelming passage owes much to the fruitful efforts on its behalf by its original sponsor. the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. JOHN PASTORE. Halting the spread of nuclear weapons must be a central priority of American policy. We need a sense of urgency about this problem. Unlike the war in Vietnam. the threatened spread of nuclear weapons rarely captures newspaper headlines. But this does not lessen its status as a grave threat to world security and peace. Five nations now have the proven capacity to produce and explode nuclear weapons. At least 10 nations. perhaps more. have the technical capability to develop such weapons within the next few years. The cost and complexity of nuclear development are no longer decisive deterrents to the spread of nuclear weapons. Soon an investment of a few million dollars is all that will be needed to produce such weapons. and it Is well known that the needed technical skill is already widespread. Even more chilling is the claim made by experts that nuclear capability will soon be within the reach even of private organizations. Delay in confronting this problem responsibly and effectively increases the chances that more nations will make irreversible decisions to develop nuclear weapons. and that such decisions will encourage still others to follow suit. If nothing further is done. nations of all types. of all degrees of stability. of all degrees of responsibility. will have in their hands the power of life and death over the whole planet. Security for all will then be gravely diminished. and the chances of nuclear catastrophe immeasurably increased. Constructive steps to meet the problem of nuclear proliferation need to be taken now. I therefore commend the Senate for passing Senate Resolution 179. and join the overwhelming majority of my colleagues who voted for the resolution in commending current efforts to negotiate international agreements limiting the spread of nuclear weapons and supporting future efforts to bring about solutions to nuclear proliferation problems.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. public Interest in the issue of protecting research animals has been increasing steadily during the present session of Congress. If the hundreds of letters I have received during the last few weeks can be taken as any indication. the vast majority of the American people fervently hope that strong protective legislation in this field will be passed this year. Mr. President. I believe that I echo the public sentiment accurately when I state that what we need Is a law that will apply to animal dealers and research facilities alike. Any legislation that fails to include this twopronged approach to regulation will be sadly inadequate. The measure passed by the House of Representatives--H.R. 13881is fine so far as it goes. but. in exempting research facilities from Federal standards. it regrettably only goes halfway. S. 2322. the bill I cosponsored. if passed with the proposed Monroney amendments. would go the whole way. The Senate Commerce Committee has held hearings specifically on the Monroney amendments in order to explore further the controversial issue of covering the research facilities. The issue of laboratory coverage has provoked much editorial comment in past weeks. but two editorials especially have caught my attention. One was published in the Louisville CourierJournal of May 16. 1966. the other in the New York Times of May 23. 1966. Both represent the considered opinions of two of the Nations most distinguished newspapers. Both strongly support S. 2322 or other legislation that would cover both animal dealers and research laboratories. The New York Times editorial brings up one point that is especially important at this time. This is the issue of whether S. 2322 would hamper research. The Times reiterates what the bills suppotters have been saying all along: absolutely not. Anyone who reads the bill carefully will see that nothing in it refers to the laboratory experiments themselves. The bill is simply not concerned with the period of time during which an animal is undergoing experimentation. Unfortunately. this important point has been overlooked by the many respected doctors and scientists who vehemently oppose Federal supervision of animal facilities in laboratories: I am hopeful that the Commerce Committee hearings. together with responsible comment like the Times and CourierJournal editorials. will dispel this harmful confusion. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Times and CourierJournal editorials cited above be printed in the RECORD.",

Either the Russians have decided that the Chinese might be close to winning and cant afford to let China go away with that victory--or vice versa. the Russians have decided that the commitment may become far bigger and rather than be dragged into a war on Chinas side. step in to facilitate perhaps a meeting between the Communist side and the U.S. side.",

Passage of H.R. 12410 provides a permanent program of educational assistance for veterans to include collegelevel and belowcollegelevel training in trade. vocational. and technical schools. It also includes guaranteed and direct home loans. medical care to veterans with provisions for presumption of service connection of certain chronic and tropical diseases. veterans preference in Federal employment. and job counseling and job placement assistance. In reporting this bill to the House. the Committee on Veterans Affairs emphasized that a major purpose of the legislation is to provide assistance to the veteran which would help him to follow the educational plan that he might have adopted had he never entered the Armed Forces.

This legislation insures that our Nation will be able to utilize the highest skills and abilities of the veterans who benefit from it. This is extremely important today when the number of young men available to fill the technical and professional vacancies is at the lowest ratio to our population in our Nations history. In addition to educational assistance this legislation provides that the Veterans Administration may guarantee loans made by private lenders for a veterans home. Direct loans up to $17.500 are authorized by the Veterans Administration where private financing is not available. Medical care for nonserviceconnected illnesses will also be provided by the VA hospitals for these veterans. Job counseling and placement is authorized the same as for veterans of prior wars. and they will receive a preference in Federal Employment. The same economics problems are faced today by the thousands of cold war servicemen. They have been compelled to disrupt their lives and careers to serve in the protection of freedom throughout the world. This legislation will balance the inequities of this situation and give these deserving young men an opportunity to catch up with their nonveteran friends.

I share the view of many of my colleagues that those young men who have been asked to devote years of their lives to the defense of the free world merit their Nations assistance in completing their education and in making economic adjustments. I am pleased to support this measure not only because it constitutes a wellmerited compensation to the veterans but also because it is another step in the effort to expand the ranks of youngsters who will secure further training. both academically and in those technical fields where there will be employment opportunities in the future. I have introduced legislation which is close to what we are adopting today. One difference between the measure I introduced and H.R. 12410 concerns the chances for integration of the education assistance with the Manpower Development and Training Act program. Under my proposal. it is explicitly provided that a veteran could elect to participate in a Manpower Development and Training Act training course and still get the subsistence benefits under the GI bill. As written. H.R. 12410 could be construed to require the returning veteran to enroll either in an academic institution or in a technical school in order to secure subsistence benefits. I hope that the bill which is finally enacted will permit veterans to participate in the Manpower Development and Training Act programs with no loss of benefits. Such participation would strengthen both the Manpower Development and Training Act and the GI bill. In many instances. it would permit the veteran to get the type of specialized vocational training to enable him to secure permanent employment in a reasonably short time. Mr. Speaker. I applaud President Johnson for including this proposal in his state of the Union message and the committee for its prompt action.",

Many of these young men have gone and are going into the military service directly from high school and some before they have even finished their high school educations. They will return to civilian life after absences of several years. many of them to find they are unskilled. uneducated. and unprepared for a civilian occupation. The Vietnamese veteran. Mr. Speaker. needs a chance to compete for his future with those who are deferred from active military duty while he is serving and who are utilizing this time to further their own careers.

The rates for fulltime training set at $100 per month for a single veteran. $125 per month for a veteran with one dependent. and $150 for a veteran with more than one dependent and proportionate rates for less than full time. The education provisions are effective June 1. 1966. and education must be completed within 8 years of the date of discharge. The measure also provides for guaranteed and direct loans. with the VA guaranteeing as much as a maximum of $8.500 of any loan by private lenders. and authorizes direct loans where private financing is not available to a maximum of $17.500.

Surely there can be no arguments on the merits of this purpose. It is buttressed by the general awareness that previous GI bills have benefited not only returning veterans but all of society. The contributions in education. medicine. and technology made by those who were trained and educated under these programs have more than repaid their costs. The United States of America is today reaping the skills and knowledge gained by the aid we extended to those earlier veterans. Todays generation of young men and women are making the same sacrifices of their lives and plans on fronts that are not always \"cold.\" Today we are recognizing and acting on two realities: First. the benefits we seek to extend to cold war veterans have been earned. and second. those benefits are an investment in the continuing stability and enrichment of our Nation.

While he served in the other branch in many important positions. he loved the entire Congress. the Senate and the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker. Les Biflle wielded a powerful and constructive Influence. as we know one who occupies these various positions could do. in calling to the attention of the Members matters and information of vital importance which would be not only of great interest to them. but guidance to them. Mr. Speaker. the passing of Les Biffle takes from me a very close and valued friend. and leaves a feeling of keen regret in the minds of the countless thousands of persons. friends and others. who knew Les and who benefited from his beautiful outlook upon life.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it was with sadness that I learned this morning of the passing last evening of one of my fellow Arkansans who gave a lifetime of service as an official in the Capitol of the United States. the Honorable Leslie Biffle. late Secretary to the U.S. Senate. Les Bille was a friendly man. an affable and popular man. who enjoyed people and who labored long and hard in the political vineyard. giving a lifetime of service as a valuable and trusted employee and adviser on both sides of the U.S. Capitol. A number of years ago. a prominent columnist. in reviewing Les Billes accomplishments. reported that Les once said of his first yearning to become a part of the machinery of government: In the front of my geography book. there was a beautiful picture of the U.S. Capitol. I used to sit in class and look at those steps leading up to the entrance and wonder if I would ever get a chance to walk up the Capitol myself. Les did get that chance In the form of an opportunuity to become the secretary of Congressman Macon. of Helena. Ark.. in 1908. From that time until his retirement several years ago. Les served in many different capacities as employee and adviser to Representatives. Senators. and prominent Government officials including no less than the President of the United States. At one time. he was secretary to Senator James P. Clarke. later became Superintendent of the Senate Folding Room. then secretary to the majority of the Senate and. finally Secretary of the Senate upon return from service in the Army in 1945. His luncheons in the private dining room of the Senate were frequent and included a broad variety of officials of both high and lesser ranks. from the President of the United States to employees in the House. the Senate and the departments. A reporter once remarked that the guest book of Les Biles office probably contained the worlds most valuable current autographs. Les Biflie will be missed by his friends across the Nation and particularly those who had the opportunity to know him well and to benefit from his friendly personality and his sage political wisdom. Mr. Speaker. I deeply regret his passing. and I know all others who knew him do and join me in extending sympathy to Mrs. Biffle.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill providing for the establishment of a national food reserve. In the past our abundance of food and fiber frequently has been considered more a problem than a blessing. This has resulted in a neglect to understand fully how important our success In the production of food has been. With a growing recognition of the vital role that our agricultural production and knowhow must play in building a peaceful world through the elimination of hunger and starvation. we are forced to recognize that our agricultural abundance has not been accidental. We cannot afford to leave adequate supplies of food for ourselves and for food for freedom uses to chance in the future. This Congress has In the past established reserves of materials termed \"strategic\" which were not subject to the hazards that are present in the production of food. We are reminded of these hazards most vividly by the food shortages now facing India. The crisis they find themselves in this year Is largely the result of the lack of rain during a single growing season. Fortunately. our supplies of wheat are still greater than what is considered a normal carryover and we are able to offer some assistance to India. However. our food and fiber reserves are being reduced and demand is increasing. making It an absolute necessity that we establish a food reserve before we find ourselves facing another crisis at home or abroad without the food reserve to do anything about it. Mr. Speaker. my reserve bill would call for the setting aside of reserves without the disruptive influences that have identified reserves termed \"surplus\" in the past. This is accomplished In my bill through Government cooperation with producers of the commodities involved by offering them assistance identical to that now offered through the Commodity Credit Corporation in return for agreement of the producers to store an essential reserve of strategic food commodities. I urge my colleagues to join me in the establishment of a strategic food reserve. It would be a tragic experience to find ourselves suffering a shortage of fooda commodity we cannot do withoutfor even a little while.",

This is a problem which affects every American. young or old. rich or poorand we must do something about it. Today I introduce. for appropriate reference. a House resolution to create a sevenmember bipartisan committee to investigate the reasons for the rapid rise in the retail prices of food.

The retail price of a loaf of bread also rose by 3 cents during the same time. And I am told that the retail prices of these basic commodities and certain others have risen by the same amount in New York City and other areas.

With sirens screeming. courageous Cleveland firemen rushed to the scene. Within minutes. they were in the building. performing their professional duty to protect lives and property at great personal risk. A sudden explosion of aluminum dust showered the firefighters with flames and debris. Four firemen were killed and eight injured. On behalf of all the people of the 20th Congressional District of Ohio. all the people of the city of Cleveland. and all the people of the United States. I wish to thank these men and their families for their devoted. heroic public service. The four firemen who made the supreme sacrifice in line of duty were. Charles G. Doehner. John A. Petz. Ralph E. Simon. and Joseph G. Toolis. All of us owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be paid. In Cleveland. publicspirited businessmen have organized a group called Bluecoats. Inc.. which has undertaken to provide educational and other benefits for the wives and children of police and firemen killed In line of duty. Before sunset on the day of tragedy. representatives of Bluecoats. Inc.. had called on the families of the fallen heroes. presenting each with a check for $1.000 and assuring them that further assistance would be forthcoming. The members of Bluecoats. Inc.. were speaking for the entire community. and assuming the obligation of the entire community. I commend them. and urge that similar organizations be established throughout the Nation to provide similar benefits for the families of police and firemen who sacrifice their lives performing a vital public service. At the same time. I urge the people of all communities--including my home city of Clevelandto take a look at the pay scales and working conditions of their firemen and police officers. It seems to me that these men are entitled to better consideration for the daily risks they run in serving the public.",

The project envisages an expenditure of millions of dollars in materials and wages over a period of many years. This massive dose of money will do wonders for all of western Montana. The plans for the dam have caused many economic disruptions of the present facilities In the area. but the Federal Government has adopted the policy of compensating all private economic losses caused by the construction of the dam. Private land to be covered by the water has been purchased by the Government. State highways will be relocated at Federal expense. Bridges will be rebuilt and an entire town will be moved from the reservoir area. In addition. miles of railroad track will be rebuilt above the water level. The Government has done a fine job in compensating the economic losses of the propertied interests. but it has overlooked and ignored a vital nonpropertied economic interestthis is the wage loss incurred by the railroad employee of the area. As you know. the wages earned by the railroad worker are determined by the number of miles he travels each day. The new route of relocated track will shorten the trip by some 15 miles. and this will result in a loss of $3 in wages each day to each worker. This sum is minimal for 1 day. but when it is multiplied by the length of a railroad career. the loss to the individual worker. and to the economy in the area. is significant. To the individual worker. it can mean the difference of a car payment. or a house payment at the end of the month. In view of the Government policy of compensating all private economic losses caused by the dam. it is clear that this wage loss deserves equal treatment.",

I have just checked with the Senate Finance Committee and have verified the fact in the newspaper articles that amendment No. 418 has been offered to H.R. 7502. the disaster relief tax bill which passed the House on August 3. The chairman of the committee has ordered public hearings to be held next Tuesday and Wednesday on amendment No. 418. I certainly hope that these public hearings will bring about clarification of the meaning and import of this amendment. The newspaper revelations by Drew Pearson yesterday and the Washington Post today indicate that the real purpose of the amendment Is to give the big gas transmission line corporations a tax break so they can apply to the Federal Power Commission for a rate increase. This. in effect. would amount to a further picking of the pockets and pocketbooks of consumers in my area who were glibly promised low monthly rates when natural gas was introduced into New England 14 years ago. I hope that the entire issue will be clarified in the Senate Finance Committee. But. If it is not. I want to serve notice now that I intend to vigorously fight against such an amendment when the bill comes back to the House for further consideration.

There are several reasons. including the citys historic elements. its scenic beauty. good yeararound climate. and excellent facilities. For example. the city has recently completed one of the finest civic facilities in the Nation: a municipal auditorium and theater adjacent to one another costing more than $12 million to build. The auditorium Is circular in shape and is designed according to the most modern principles and standards. The main arena accommodates more than 10.000 persons for almost any kind of indoor activity such as trade shows. conventions. exhibitions. and pageants. The same building also contains meeting rooms for groups ranging in size up to 750 persons. The catering facilities can serve up to 3.000 persons. The theater building is separate and adjoins the auditorium. It accommodates concerts of the Mobile Symphony Orchestra and the Civic Music Association as well as stage shows. ballets. and other cultural events.

The drum and bugle corps have become very much a valuable part of the American scene. They not only provide color. excitement. and entertainment to our pageants and parades. but these organizations also give the youth of our Nation the opportunity to participate in an activity that is enjoyable. fulfilling. and constructive. These participating youths are taught the value of cooperation. discipline. and the sense of an effective group spirit. For this these organizations well deserve the honor and best wishes which our Nation is extending to them this week. I sincerely hope that the activities of this week will inspire and encourage those youths who have as yet found no worthwhile activity in which to participate as responsible and socially accepted Individuals. But. here in these drum and bugle corps organizations they have a valuable example to consider and folow as constructive and conscientious roung Americans. Therefore. let us iope that this week does achieve its deired goal to influence and alert our routh to the benefits and satisfaction of .uch activities.

Time is almost as much a part of our lives as breathing. Yet how do we stand. timewise? This Nation is again in the midst of another season of needless and widespread confusion resulting from the scramble involving standard time and daylight saving time. Indeed. this time situation has reached such a chaotic stage that the United States has been described as the \"worst timekeeper in the world.\" In some States. standard time Is required for official State business while the local communities observe daylight saving time for all other purposes. Many counties of some States observe daylight saving time while others do not. In some areas. unauthorized \"wildcat\" observance of daylight saving time has created special pockets of confusion. And a great deal of the difficulty can be traced directly to the wide variations in the starting and closing dates for daylight time. Nor is my own State of Michigan any stranger to these frustrating mixups. Certainly there is much that can be said on the merits of daylight saving time. But it is a case of a good principle leading to a bad result as it stands right now. Americans treasure local option in all things. but when it comes to time. this is one of those matters in which uniformity is far more important than local whims. No one wants to force daylight saving time on communities which do not desire it. but at least those that do could and should agree on uniform starting and ending dates. These dates. in my opinion. should be the last Sunday of April and the last Sunday of Octoberand I accordingly urge that the necessary steps be taken to bring this about promptly. A Reminder",

One of the real handicaps we face in the Appropriation Committee is the fact that Congress has authorized these new programs. We are not a legislative committee. We do not have the power. unless it is exercised arbitrarily. to kill programs or to change the law. We are somewhat limited. at least. by the authorizing legislation. The first place to start economizing is when the authorizing bills are on the. floor. The argument is always made to us. \"Congress authorized this program. we have to implement it.\" Then we must implement it.\" Then we must decide whether to accept their word as to how much it will cost to implement. or to cut down. That would be a job which another task force might well consider and on which it might well spend some timetime that would prove of value to the House in giving careful scrutiny and study of the funds authorized to be appropriated at a subsequent date. The pipeline I have been talking about is not money simply authorized but money which has been appropriated. It requires no further action on the part of the Congress before it can be spent. The only action required is for the Treasury to go out and borrow the money and pay the bills. that part of the money we do not fund from receipts. We have been operating on a deficit basis so long it has come to be a habit. which should be discontinued in my opinion. That is one reason why the task force was createdto see if we could not strike a blow in the interest of cutting down spending which is beyond our means. in the hope of getting our fiscal affairs in better condition.",

However. then having made this promise in successive weeks. we voted to continue our delivery of wheat to Nasser and appropriated an additional threequarters of a billion dollars for the InterAmerican Development Bank. as worthy as that might be. and $1.2 billion for the Appalachia bill and then took up the Supreme Court Justices raise. which did not pass the House but was presented to us. I am speaking of the lack of veracity in carrying out the promised economy.

It would seem to me a very advantageous thing for the Congress if the legislative committees would spend a little more time with agencies which come before them for legislation. delving into the question as to what the cost of the program is going to be. We have a very classic example in the subcommittee that I sit on of the Committee on Appropriations where the legislative committee was told that the cost would be somewhere around $7.500 for a particular item. There is now a request before us for around $250.000 for that $7.500 item. I think if we had more time and effort devoted to the detail of the authorizing legislation. then we in the Committee on Appropriations could follow through on it and it would be helpful. because it is very apparent when you read the record that the agencies who come before the committees of Congress come to the authorizing committees with the lowest figure and then come to the Committee on Appropriations with the highest figure.

It is the solemn duty of every Democratic Member of this body to uphold the platform pledge so that this country will have an adequate money supply to meet the needs of a growing economy. The low interest rate platform is not new to the Democratic Party. In 1960 we promised to put an end to the present high interest. tight money policy. It is our job to follow through with our promises. Last Thursday the distinguished chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. the gentleman from Texas . addressed this body concerning the formation of a Democratic steering committee to resist high interest rates. Because of the length of the session that day. only a small portion of his address was given orally. I would like to refresh the memories of my Democratic colleagues with regard to the steering committee. The committee has no function except to resist high interest rates that would saddle the American people with a severe economic hardship. By joining the committee you commit yourself to nothing more than upholding a promise we have made in our platforms. I ask that you read copies of platform for 1964 and 1960 and then contact Chairman PATMAN asking that your name be added to the list of those who want to make good on a promise to the people of this Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have recently had called to my attention what seems to be a trend in the design of Government buildings here in the Nations Capital and throughout the United States and what seems to be a trend in the directed use of specified materials for construction under Federal contracts. As a member of the Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds of the Committee on Public Works. the subcommittee which has jurisdiction ovex the authorization of construction of public buildings. I am sincerely concerned that the Federal Government. in the interests of new architectural vogues. may be employing inferior materials in the construction of new Government buildings. This would unquestionably result in higher building maintenance cost. I refer specifically to the substitution of concrete for the timetested stone exteriors of our new Federal Government buildings. Four structures which would have concrete exteriors have recently been authorized for construction in Washington. at a total cost of $120 million. These four buildings are the Federal Office Building No. 5. the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. the Federal Bureau of Investigation Building. and a new headquarters for the Housing and Home Finance Agency. There are reports in Washington that architects submitting designs for new Federal buildings must specify concrete exteriors. if they hope to get approval from the Commission of Fine Arts. Mr. Speaker. this is not to criticize the use of concrete as an architectural expression. but rather to caution against its misuse in a manner thoroughly incompatible with the image of architectural beauty that Washington has presented for so many years to America and the world. Mr. Speaker. I represent one of the greatest natural stone producing areas in this Nation. The quality of New Hampshire granite is known throughout the world. My constituents are concerned about this trend. since they have understandable interest in the use of stone in building construction. The American people and the Members of this body are entitled to know what considerations dictated this change in our Federal architecture that has now been approved by the Commission of Fine Arts. Mr. Speaker. under unanimous consent. I would like to include in the RECORD at this point a brochure entitled \"Our Beautiful Capital. Will It Be Marred by the New Trend in Federal Building?\" and I commend it to every Member of this body for his careful consideration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz. deserves the praise and compliments of this House and the people for bringing forth the facts about farm labor in this country. He has now completed his 4day ontheground investigation of farm labor conditions in California and the evidence is conclusive that the shift in that State from Mexican braceros to domestic labor has been accomplished so far with minimal disruption of farming. despite the loud protests to the contrary by the large growers. Perhaps of even greater importance is the manner in which Mr. Wirtz trip dramatized the miserable conditions that farm workers are subjected. It is incredible that in the middle of the 20th century farmworkers in America are treated on many large farms no better than serfs and slaves were treated in the middle of the 18th century. In part. the Federal Government must share the responsibility for this. For the Government has in many ways encouraged or permitted these conditions to exist. Minimum wage protection has not been extended to farmworkers. Workmans compensation has not been extended to farmworkers. And. worst of all. through the bracero program the Government handed the growers a club with which to beat domestic workers over the heads and a crutch for themselves to lean upon. So long as the semislaves could be carted in from Mexico there could be no improvement in working conditions. Why should wages be negotiable with domestic workers when the Government guaranteed a foreign labor supply to the growers? During his trip. Secretary Wirtz while observing asparagus harvesting in northern California asked the ranch owner. \"Where are the toilets?\" The ranch owner replied in astonishment \"What toilets?\" He might also have replied. \"What decent housing? What decent food? What decent wages? What workmans compensation?\" With unanimous consent I am inserting in the RECORD an article from the Washington Star.

As the New York Times pointed out in an editorial on March 27: Every device short of outright refusal to accept domestic farmworkers has been used to discredit the Labor Departments recruitment efforts.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a tax reduction to a bare minimum to individuals with low Incomes as a substitute for Federal doles and subsidies is what would be accomplished by legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by me today. My bill would reduce the income tax to $5 for those citizens classed in the poverty status to eliminate the need for handouts from the Federal Government. This bill. amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 relating to income tax on individuals. including married persons filing joint returns. heads of households and single persons. is a technically drawn bill to halt the tendency of Government to tax those lowincome groups. while keeping them in the subsidy and welfare class. In drafting the legislation. the poverty class definition adopted by the administration which includes those persons making $3.000 or less annually was used. In taxing the person making $3.000 or less annually. the Federal Government is going to the source of a mans livelihood. and returning to him a dole or subsidy putting him squarely under the thumb of the \"Great White Father.\" Rather than pay his rent or give him a welfare check. why not eliminate his income tax? My bill would accomplish this and also keep the principle of having every American wage earner pay at least a minimum tax under the $5 feature of this legislation. The legislation would not cost the Federal Government a great deal of money. but would be offset by a decrease in welfare doles. There were 10.500.000 taxpayers in the poverty category who paid only $1.6 billion in taxes in 1962. about 3.6 percent of the total individual income tax collected for the year. This bill could take the place of a major new spending program. for example. the Appalachian bill or the proposed new housing program. and make the individual less dependent on a paternal Federal Government and more dependent on himself. Outgoing Secretary of the Treasury. Douglas Dillon. in his final public speech last Friday urged a further tax reduction for the Nations lowincome families. adding support to this legislation. I am hopeful that the bill will have very early hearings and departmental reports. because it is vitally needed. Byelorussian Independence Day",

These sturdy and stouthearted people. never numerous or strong enough to cope with their more powerful foes. the Russians in the east and the Poles in the west. had been overwhelmed by the Russians. For centuries they endured all sorts of hardships under the czarist regime. and when that regime was no more. they then saw their chance to attain their national goal early in 1918. On March 25 of that year Byelorussian leaders proclaimed Byelorussias independence of Russia and established the Byelorussian Republic. They formed their own democratic government. began rebuilding their wartorn country and were doing their utmost to rebuild the shattered fabric of their social. economic. and political life. At the outset they were faced with the numerous insurmountable difficulties. and the defenses of the country were in a sad state. wholly inadequate to protect it against its powerful foes. It became an easy prey for the Red army of Communist Russia late in 1918. and thus the Byelorussian people enjoyed their freedom for only a very brief period before they were robbed of it. But the idea of freedom has never deserted the Byelorussian people. and they still cling to it in the firm hope that some day they will attain It in their historic homeland. Nearly half a century of Soviet domination has not caused despair among the Byelorussians. they still feel that since theirs is a righteous and sacred cause. it will in the end win out against Communist totalitarianism. On the 47th anniversary of Byelorussian independence let us all hope and pray that their just cause will prevail against the forces of Communist oppression. Progressive Growers Association Survey",

There has not been a costofliving increase under the social secuity system before. and. as the Senator says. we have a social security bill before us every year.

He ran in the same year that Eisenhower ran. The story goes that one of his colleagues said. \"Harry. are you sure you wanted to vote that way?\" Senator Cain replied. \"Yes. I am going to be reelected on these terms.\" But Senator Cain was defeated in the year when Eisenhower carried the State of Washington by a landslide. Subsequently there was another social security bill. and. as I recall only one or two Senators voted against it. One of them was Senator Goldwater. He had a deep conviction against it. and he also was defeated for office. Two Senators voted against it. and he was one of the two. Senators find it to be almost a political death warrant to vote against a social security bill of major proportions. We tend to have a social security bill in every Congress. sometimes every year. This matter comes up time and again. and the cost of living is one factor that can be considered in connection with it. The Senator and I can wait and see who is the better prognosticator.

It is fair to give an increase to people who cannot roll with the punch of inflation. That is why there has been a socal security pension increase. The trouble lies in the timelag between one increase and the next one. During that time people who rely heavily on social security pensionsand most of them do. because it is the main source of their incomeare hurt. That is not fair. I agree 100 percent with the statement of the Senator from Louisiana that the best way to handle this is by Congress so handling itself that the purchasing power of the dollar will be maintained. I agree to that. But Congress has not been doing it. Meantime. people are being hurt. Some social security pensioners have no bargaining power except their votes. Their votes are important. I do not believe that social security pensioners want to overreach. I know many of them. They all want to have their purchasing power restored to where it was 3 years ago. What good would it do to give them a 7percent increase today if we do not put ourselves right from a monetary. fiscal standpoint. while they are asking for another 7percent Increase because of inflation? The adoption of this amendment would have a salutary impact on Congress itself. The Senator talks about triggering inflation.

I point out to the Senator from Rhode Island that this matter of study gives me a great deal of concern. I introduced a bill which is exactly like the pending amendment. on March 8 of this year. I then introduced. on May 3 of this year. an amendment to the Housepassed bill. I have great regard for the actuaries in the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare and for the Treasury people. I see no reason that there should be any need for more study of the matter. I believe that the Senator from Rhode Island said earlier this afternoon that there is a great deal of merit to the approach he uses for financing the increases under the amendment which he withdrew earlier. He said that whenever the Secretary determines that the applicable or foregoing provisions. namely. the 3percent increase. will result in an actuarial deficit to the trust funds. he shall report the matter to the Congress with his recommendations for changes either in the tax schedules or the wage base. or both. I believe that is a sensible approach. I have not used that approach. I have merely said that there is hereby authorized to be appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated. the money necessary to take care of these increases. I would guess. however. that at the rate we are going. it would probably be about another 2 or 3 years before there would be the increase envisioned by the amendment. Once that happened. Congress would be authorized to appropriate the money out of the general fund of the Treasury to cover the increase. However. there would be plenty of time between now and then to have the measure studied on an actuarial basis so that when that day arrived. we might have a change made in the law to cover an actuarial condition. Why wait for another 2 or 3 years to do that? Why not do it now? There would be plenty of time later to figure out whether we want a change in the social security structure itself to finance it or whether we want to go along on the financing out the Treasury.",

Illegal gambling bankrolls organized crime in Maine as elsewhere in the Nation. and the governments which have kept gambling illegal. and thus available as a mob revenueraising device. might as well be partners in the crime they are thus indirectly subsidizing.

Figures presented to the McClellan committee set offtrack betting in the Nation at $50 billion a year. which figure is only 42 percent or so of the national illegal gambling total. which would then approximate $120 billion a year. Maines share of this on a population basis would be $600 million a year. Ten percent of this stays in mob pockets as profit. so Maine is a lucrative potato patch for the syndicates.

We see how the complexion of international diplomacy has changed since the time when the German strategist von Clauswitz stated that war is but an extension of diplomacy. The United Nations has served a vital function during the years since it was set up at the Dumbarton Conference following World War II. It has sent peace forces into Korea. Yemen. the Congo (L~opoldville) and the Sinai Peninsula. Currently. the United Nations is maintaining a precarious peace in Cyprus between the Turkish and Greek communities.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the nature of government sometimes makes it difficult to attack urgent domestic problems with any degree of celerity. In fact. the complex times in which we live have taught us to have patience with public administration. If nothing else. I think. Mr. Speaker. that times are changing. Several months ago President Johnson announced a bold new plan to meet the mounting transportation problems of the socalled Northeast Corridor that runs from Washington to Boston. Although it might be expected that action on such a plan might be postponed in view of the many other exigencies of immediate concern to the administration. the Johnson administration is going on with this proj ect in characteristic fashionfull speed ahead. And according to the Regional Plan Association it is conceivable that alternate high speed transportation will be available to the populous area between New York and Washington as soon as Transportation in the densely populated regions of America is fast becoming a concern of the first magnitude. Ten years will be too late. Apparently the administration is aware of that. The obvious speed employed in approaching this problem evidences the seriousness of the problem and the deep concern of the President. I urge the close attention of my colleagues to this problem and offer the hope that the President will receive the full cooperation of the Congress in his great and timely efforts in this regard. Although the Presidents request for research funds will not directly benefit the New Haven Railroads commuter service. which is vital to Fairfield County. Conn.. I feel we have a responsibility to create a climate in which railroads will see that there is a possibility of profits in passenger transportation and will therefore take a greater interest in it. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I would like to include in the RECORD. for the interest of my colleagues. an editorial from the June 30 edition of the New York Times. commenting on the progress of the administration in this are.

There may be some confusion. in that the initials also designate the Federal Housing Administration. and the Farmers Home Administrationboth of which are Federal agencies which have made important contributions to the public welfare in rural areas and in the citiesbut what we have particularly in mind at this moment is another FHA. composed of young women who will become the wives and mothers of our Nation. within a few years. and many of whom also will undertake additional efforts as teachers. or workers in offices or industrial plants. It is important to recall. I think. Mr. Speaker. that the Future Homemakers of America was founded more than 20 years ago and now consists of more than 600.000 high school students enrolled in home economics courses in 11.000 chapters among the 50 States. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. and the Virgin Islands. Additionally. it is important that we recognize. in saluting these young women this week. that the programs in which they are participating have the official sponsorship of the U.S. Office of Education and of the American Home Economics Associations. With the growing importance. in recent years. of home economics as a serious concern of every homemaker. whether she might live in the city or in the country. it is worthwhile. I think. that we have this annual recognition of the program of the Future Homemakers of America. Even though I am sure all of these young ladies can make wonderful fudge. we have come to the realization. in recent years. that homemakingand training in home economicsmeans much more than learning how to make a good fudge. I am glad to have this opportunity to commend to the attention of the House the current observance of National Future Homemakers of America Week.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when we hail the anniversary of Byelorussian independence we do not have in mind a celebration for the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. a socalled constituent republic of the Soviet Union. We honor instead the tragically shortlived Byelorussian Democratic Republic as it was proclaimed on March 25. 1918. The loudly proclaimed independence of that area. insisted upon at the United Nations by the Soviet Union to gain support for what was to be a series of negative positions by the Soviets in that organization. is a travesty on the true independence of spirit of the Byelorussian people. That independence has been maintained not because of. but In spite of the Soviet Union. Overrun for centuries by the neighboring Russians. Byelorussia was never willingly a part of their territory or sympathetic with its neighbors to the east. Superior in development and culture. its civilization was much older than that of the Russia which sought to absorb it. Despite all efforts of its neighbors at domination. Byelorussia has remained separate in its allegiance and true to its own national traditions. It has remained an entity. preserving its identity and its independence of spirit against all efforts to Russify and to Sovietize it. Though its richer resources have been the envy of the rapacious on its boundaries. they have also been the basis for the higher degree of civilization which the Byelorussians enjoy. Superior as they have been in social. economic. and cultural development. their spirit of individual and national independence is also a product of this refinement. It was this true love of freedom and loyalty to ethnic origins and native characteristics which led to their brief but real independence. proclaimed 48 years ago. Despite outward political adversity. the spirit of liberty which manifested itself at that time is alive today. That is the true independence which we celebrate today.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the fate of the Byelorussian people and their history are so inextricably mixed with that of the Russian people that it is not easy for some to distinguish the -two peoples. Their difficulty stems from the unfortunate fact that for centuries the Byelorussians have been subjected to Russian rule. and the Russians have done their utmost to eradicate all Byelorussian national traits and traditions. But the Byelorussians have not forgotten their distinct identity. and they have always wanted to regain their freedom and independence. The year 1918 offered them the opportunity they had long awaited. In that year. when the despotic czarist regime of Russia was no more. the Byelorussians felt themselves free and proclaimed their national independence on March 25. Then they set up the Byelorussian National Republic. and the 10 million Byelorussians were happy under their own Government. But their independence was of very brief duration. Early in 1621 Soviet forces finally quelled a long and determined resistance. put an end to the independent Byelorussian Republic. and then incorporated the country into the Soviet Union. Fortunately. that did not mean the end of the spirit of freedom and independence among the Byelorussian people. Even though for more than 45 years they have been enduring the oppressive yoke of totalitarian tyranny. they still cling to their idea of freedom and carry on the struggle for the attainment of their national goal. Mr. Speaker. on the 48th anniversary celebration of their independence we all echo their genuine sentiment and hope that they will attain their objective. De Gaulle Back Is Arched",

Unfortunately. it is all too obvious that in todays mass consumer market commercial selling practices and appeals have grown. perhaps unwittingly. dangerously confounding. and even hazardous to the ordinary customer. In the field of staple purchasing comparative cost shopping is practically impossible because of the fractional weights. oddsized boxes. and doubletalk small print wordage on the product covers. In our modem socalled supermarkets one seldom. if ever. sees a weighing Instrument in evidence for the shoppers use even if she or he were so inclined. In the area of consumer credit only a very few experts understand the true interest charges projected. In the vital are of nonprescription drugs It is practically impossible for the ordinary person to tell what is helpful from what is harmful or harmless because of the continuous assault on his senses of exaggerated television advertisements and rival claims. As the President recently emphasized. the day and time has come for clear labeling. true descriptions. and commonsense rules to be applied in retailing merchandise to the American consumer. To enable him to protect his life and his health and his hardearned money it has become essential for the American consumer to be given what she and he are demanding. namely. lifeguarding controls on labeling and marketing of hazardous drugs and substances. reasonable and appropriate weight standards to facilitate comparative shopping. and clearer. more definite information about the cost of a loan to a borrower. Mr. Speaker. this moderngrown problem. essential to the basic interests of the American family. is one that shall have to be legislatively dealt with sooner or later and the sooner the better.

My acquaintance with Jim began in the days when I was helping my father with his congressional responsibilities some 15 or 20 years ago. Like most others. I was surprised to find a farm leader so well informed and so sympathetic to the problems of the urban workers. When I was elected to Congress 11 years ago. I found Jim a warm and knowledgeable friend. Jim Patton will be remembered for his distinguished leadership of the Farmers Union for more than a quarter of a century. But he will be remembered for far more than a militant farm leader. He has been a great leader and mover in a host of liberal causes. He will be remembered for his vision. his rare courage. and for his willingness to join in the battle for any just cause where the public interest was involved. Jim Patton was one of the stalwart leaders in the Roosevelt administration who helped organize the international Food and Agriculture Organization and the other specialized agencies of the United Nations. He was a leader in. and an early president of. the organization of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers. a federation of national farm organizations. He was a leader in the group which sponsored fullemployment legislation leading to the Employment Act of 1946 and the creation of the Council of Economic Advisers. His labors on behalf of medicare and the liberalization of the Social Security Act have earned him a secure place in the affection and gratitude of millions of Americans. He has always been a leader in the efforts to develop the natural resources of this great country of ours in the interests of all the people. And we all are aware of his leadership of international efforts to free the world from hunger. a campaign which led to President Johnsons recent declaration of a worldwide war on hunger. A1751 I join with other Members of Congress who have said. \"Voices which champion the cause of the farmer are sorely needed in the United States today and Jim Pattons voice has been heard.\" We will miss him speaking as the president of the Farmers Union. but I am sure we will continue to have his help on national and international welfare problems.

In remembering Byelorussian independence we are in fact remembering a great principle of political man. namely. selfdetermination. It is a principle and a goal of all democracies. whether actual or theoretical. it is the foundation of the American system of government. it is a thought that ennobles man. Simply. selfdetermination Is the exercise of a basic human right which speaks of organized men determining their own national destiny in dignity and honor. Selfdetermination is not a 20th century concept. rather it is as old as mans ability to think rationally about himself. his relations with other humans. and his relationship to his state. Through the centuries the great minds of political philosophy have worked the principle of government. selfdetermination found its shape in the 18th century enlightenment. which was based on the assumption that men were capable of making rational decisions affecting their personal and national lives. Here In this country our Colonial Fathers fought for this right in 1776 and the years following. and put the concept into practice with the establishment of a new kind of government in 1789.

Once again we are requested. through appropriations. to sanction activities of this House standing committee. for which we are responsible. I ask. as I have in the past. How long do we perpetuate the committees dialog without a serious and responsible interchange of views on its record and role? I protest the committees practice of .investigations which by their very nature are exercises in predestined futility aimed at exposure rather than legislation. This practice becomes even more shocking and unpalatable when the mere subpenaing of a witness before the committee brands him as suspect and an aura of guilt immediately surrounds himregardless of his possible innocence. American citizens under our free democratic system have a timehonored and constitutionally guaranteed privilege to petition their Government. Today we are faced with actual cases where our citizens are exercising this privilege in many areas of national concern. Marches against administration policy in Vietnam. civil rights demonstrations. labormanagement disputes. arms control and nuclear proliferation. and peace demonstrations are all areas where. as Americans. our citizens have a right to make known their views. Yet we are asked to sanctionno. supportthe Committee on UnAmerican Activities which could indict these same citizens as unAmerican. No one has yet defined in clear legal terms the words \"unAmerican.\" Voices raised offering alternatives to national actions in this time of national and international development and peril must not be silenced through fear of the \"unAmerican\" label. A belief in individual motives has been an important factor in the growth of our Nation. We should not lightly sanction any committee which through its repeated action would slur the motives of these individuals and groups by attaching an aura of guilt through mere congressional subpenaing. I ask my colleagues. Is to disagree to be unAmerican? The ability to disagree freely without fear is one of the characteristics which distinguishes this Nation from controlled societies. I protest any unwarranted intervention in my constituents right to plead a cause freely and without fear of defamation. For these reasons. I oppose the requested appropriation and ask that the Congress carefully review the mandate of the committee.",

Since that date the committee has conducted an investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. A number of members of the committee showed considerable courageboth political and personalin undertaking this investigation. I compliment them on their commitment. However. I believe that the benefits which may accrue from such an investigation would better have been found in the courts. Certainly if the police and the courts in the States in which the Klans are a powerful force had been as active. in controlling the illegal aspects of the Klans. as they could and should have been. then the recent investigations would have been unnecessary. In other words. an alteration of the judicial environment is clearly required in these States. As I stated a year ago. I believe that any necessary functions of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities should be within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I continue to hold that belief and. therefore. again will vote against the appropriations for this committee. Further.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the remarkable performance of our national economy in recent years was not an accident. It represents a victory for all Americans. It is a particular victory for the administration. and a wellearned reward for its faith in the productive capacity and flexibility of the American economic system. The Presidents strategy for invigorating the American economy received cheers from most Americans right from the start. 2 years ago. But skepticism and doubts were also heard. The fainthearted warned us that there was no room for expansion in an already prosperous economy. They saw bottlenecks in every industry. They saw the destruction of our price stability. They saw deterioration in our balance of payments. They were sure that the millions of unemployed were permanently unemployable. Now the Presidents Economic Report brings us ringing proof that the skeptics were wrong. Unemployment has fallen from 5% percent of the labor force in late 1963 to near 4 percent today. Millions who once spent their time on hiring lines are now contributing to progress on the production line. The gains in employment have been especially marked for the less skilled and the disadvantaged members of our labor force. Two hundred and seventy thousand nonwhites and 560.000 teenagers were added to the employed last year. Businessmen are using their ingenuity to train and hire labor. Bottlenecks are so rare as to be remarkable. Our workers are taking full advantage of new opportunities for training and better jobs. Industrial production has risen 15 percent in the past 2 years and is still not straining our productive capacity. As the Councils report makes clear. backlogs of orders have remained moderate. operating rates are generally staying within levels of peak efficiency. and businessmen now have the incentives and the funds to expand capacity to meet growing demand. Thus. we added $47 billion to our production last year while holding price increases below 2 percent. And we scored great gains in our balance of payments. The President is predicting a repeat performance of last years record gains in output and employment. and last years price moderation. There will be doubters again. But most Americans will share the Presidents judgment. which has proved so right in the past 2 years. There is no reason to expect a retreat from the brilliant record of 1964 and 1965.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. to those who say this bill does not do enough in the way of opening up the housing market. I just want to make a few concluding statements with regard to the great opportunities offered by the bill. The magnitude of its impact is clear when we consider estimates that we will need an area the size of the entire State of Indiana for the cities we will be building in the next 40 years. It has been predicted. too. that we will use more space for metropolitan growth in the next four decades than we have used in the entire time since the first settlement at Jamestown in 1607. And just as we can envision the scope of our future. we can also see the massive dimensions of our future difficulties if we fail to insure that all Americans. regardless of their race or nationality. will have equal chance to share in that growth. and to enjoy its fruits. Experience has shown. and many witnesses before our committee reminded us again. that the greatest value of previous civil rights legislation. far beyond the impact of specific provisions of law. has been as a spur to communication. public education. and mutual tolerance. We have seen tremendous progress where communication among men of all races has been maintainedeven in the most difficult conditions. as faced last weekend by Mayor Lindsay. of New York. We have also seen. in many troubled cities. the disastrous consequences of complete breakdowns in contact and peaceful efforts toward understanding. The work of this Congress in the whole vast field of human rights has been based on the proposition. central to our democracy. that there are alternatives to violence as avenues of social progress and individual advancement. We cannot afford to undermine that concept now. In the past decade. in many parts of our Nation. increased understanding and maturity have worked great and constructive changes in the minds and hearts of men. These changes can be attributed in large part to the moral leadership exerted by the Congress. In enacting H.R. 14765. we will again be setting forth clear moral standards. and reasserting the supremacy of human rights in our society. This years action will not end our taskbut it will make future progress not only possible. but far more probable.",

It was strengthened by the creation of the Fleet Marine Force in 1933 and the Navy Reserve Act of 1938 which authorized increased pay and disability pay to reservists. The Nation will never forget that volunteer reservists gave the Marine Corps a nucleus of men right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. and in 1950 the fastest mobilization of marine reserves in American history sparked the Inchon landing in Korea. Men in Wyoming are proud to be a part of the 100.000 Marine Ready Reservists. Some are in organized units. some are members of air or ground volunteer units who train regularly in their military speciality skills. Others participate in organized Marine Corps training at least 2 weeks each year. With the new reorganization plan of 1962. these Wyomingites are part of the Fourth Division Wing Team which has the capability to be deployed to any trouble spot in the world in record time. The officers and men of the Marine Corps Reserve. indeed the entire Nation. can take pride in this 50th anniversary. The organization of the Reserve is more efficient. the men better trained than ever before. contributing to the U.S. defense posture that is second to none.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday one of our great Americans. former President Harry Truman. issued a strong warning on the growing economic crisis created by high interest rates. This is a statement that should be read by every Member of Congress. Throughout his public life. and particularly in his years at the White House. President Truman fought to keep interest rates down and his success saved the American people billions of dollars over the years. Often. he was forced to fight against great odds and powerful forces to protect the public interest in this area. I well remember August of 1950 and the early part of 1951 when the Federal Reserve Board attempted to seize control of the monetary policies of the country and defy President Truman on interest rates. President Truman. however. called in the entire Federal Reserve Board and demanded that it maintain the 2/2percent interest on longterm Government securitiesa rate which had continued in effect since the 1930s. President Truman won that showdown and thus saved the American people billions and billions of dollars. In 1952. the last year of the Truman administration. the interest charges on the national debt stood at only $5.8 billion. Today. that figure Is more than $13 billion. If the interest rates had been kept at the Truman level. we would be paying only $6.6 billion annually on the national debt instead of the current $13 billion. As President Truman noted. he seldom makes public comment on issues today. But he regards the current interest rate crisis as too serious to remain silent. He has performed a great public service in speaking out against this growing menace to the countrys economic wellbeing. Later. in todays RECORD. I will insert the text of President Trumans remarks.",

Ill.. during the last 3 days. where rioting and disturbances have occurred which have resulted in great property damage and physical violence. I cannot think of any community where greater opportunity is presented to people of all races and creeds for job opportunities. for housing opportunities. educational advantages. and all the other things which ire are seeking to provide for people equally regardless of race and color. I would also like to point out that I have been a strong supporter of civil rights legislation in this Congress. but I cannot think of anything that does a greater disservice to the cause of civil rights than activities such as those that have occurred in Waukegan. Ill. I grieve for those who have been injured and hope that they will be restored to full and perfect health. I hope also that the serious property damagesome of which I witnessed over this weekendmay be repaired promptly. I trust that those who have flouted the law will be brought to speedy justice and that the tranquillity and continued constructive growth in cordial community relations and full opportunities for progress may be resumed. The struggle for better jobs and better housing will not be won easily. but with violence and rioting these objectives may not be won at all. I commend the city and county governments for their efforts and the many civil and spiritual leaders and organizations of the Waukegan community on their sincere efforts and accomplishments. At the same time I condemn every individual and organization that foments hate and violence. I hope earnestly that they will recognize their error and join with the constructive elements of Waukegan and of the State and Nation in helping to build a better community and a better America.",

It is exactly what some of us have been pointing out for many months. This indeed can lead to recession. I notice President Truman used the word \"depression.\" but the point is that people must go beyond just the surface appearance and ask the question: \"What causes high interest rates?\" Then we begin to observe it is because the administration has failed to follow proper fiscal policies in the matter of expenditures. If they are not going to follow proper expenditure policies. then they have to move forward and request tax increases. Indeed. the time is too late.

The Johnson administration is contributing to the tightmoney. highinterest situation by competing for the available credit. The U.S. Treasury last Thursday issued $1 billion worth of 12month treasury notes at 94.110 to yield 5.84 percent. the highest ever recorded on any Treasury bills. Unless the Government starts living within its means and discontinues this fatal policy of deficit financing. which means going out into the money market and competing with individuals and business enterprises for the available credit. we are going to see a continuation of this highinterest spiral. which will result in disaster. as former President Truman contends.",

Mr. Speaker. as Members will recall. it was not possible to enact all the regular annual appropriation bills Into law prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year 1967 on July 1. last. We have had a continuing resolution in force for July and August. but it will cease to be effective at the end of this month. Therefore. the pending resolution would make appropriations to continue beyond that time. those agencies and activities for which provision has not yet been made in the regular bills. The pending resolution would expire not later than September 30. it is for 1 month. I believe there is no real controversy in regard to the resolution. Of course we would hope that during the month of September all the remaining appropriation bills could be cleared. It is indicated that probably agreement will be reached on the authorizing bill for foreign aid this week. If it is. the Committee on Appropriations. which long ago completed hearings on the foreign aid request. will move rapidly toward bringing that appropriation bill to the House. Indications are that the military construction authorization bill will become law within the next several days. Then we will be able to bring in the military construction appropriation bill. The District of Columbia appropriation bill has been held in abeyance awaiting a conference agreement on a revenue bill for the District of Columbia. Apparently this action may not be taken in the near future. so the committee Is now planning to bring the District of Columbia appropriation bill before the House shortly for consideration. As Members know. the authorization bill for defense was not signed until the 13th of July. Very shortly thereafter the Defense appropriation bill was taken up here on the floor. It has also passed the other body. As you are aware. it is now In conference. The StateJusticeCommercejudiciary appropriation bill has been delayed but we hope to move on that soon. And we are soon to move forward on the Public Works appropriation bill.

Mr. Chairman. the distinguished gentleman from Virginia has offered this amendment in the hope. as he has expressed it. that it will reduce confusion. I suggest that in the House. in the press. and the country at large it might increase confusion. because as the result of the adoption of the Smith amendment Mrs. Murphy might no longer be Mrs. Murphy. she would probably become Mrs. Smith or at least be joined by Mrs. Smith. We would not know then to whom we were referring when we had a Mrs. Smith boardinghouse or a Mrs. Murphy boardinghouse. But there is an even greater reason for defeating the amendment. The amendment says that a person may rent a room or rooms in his home. The gentleman does not make it clear that his \"home\" is a dwelling which he or she occupies. August 5.. 1966 The amendment refers to the authorized agent or person who is doing the renting. I am not sure that the widow in Charlottesville. Va.. or the widow in Lexington. Va.. who is renting rooms to a college student is going to have an authorized agent. and I do not know what kind of agent she would have under any circumstances who is not already contemplated by the amendment already adopted. I believe it is perfectly clear from the language of the bill as it is before us that there is an absolute and total exemption for the owner who occupies a structure which has not more than four independent dwelling units in it. The owner who occupies such a limited structure may rent out any number of rooms he or she desires to college students or anyone else. on any kind of terms. and change the terms of tenancy or the tenant as often as he or she desires. because it is an absolute exemption to such owner who occupies a structure with four or less Independent dwelling units in it.

Every section of the bill is certainly obnoxious to me. as we people in this country will be completely without any freedom if we continue to pass legislation of this nature. I am very much in favor of the Government assisting in building all the necessary lowcost housing in the thickly populated areas of this country so that every person could have an opportunity to own or at least live in a decent home. However. I cannot vote for any proposed legislation that would tie the hands of the property owner to the extent we would be in the same position the people of Russia are existing under today. The suggested penalties to be imposed upon our free citizens when they even talk to a demonstrator. which is absolutely foreign to our way of life In this country. is entirely out of line. I personally would like to vote for legislation to outlaw demonstrations and picketing which was foreign to our country up until the last few years when it seems we imported this idea from South America and some of the other foreign countries. I hope the Congress will not close their eyes to what is going on in this country at the present time and get on with passing legislation which would curb the growing crime situation which is existing in the entire United States at the present time. We should not be wasting our time with a socalled civil rights bill when we are actually taking rights away from the people who this proposed legislation purports to assist.

The Committee on Rules had hardly a few hours to consider the confusing and misleading committee report before a 21day rule resolution was put in the hopper. Yesterday the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency took the floor of the House and pleaded with Members of the House to ask the Committee on Rules to grant a rule on H.R. 14026. Among other things. this bill would place an arbitrary 42percent interest rate ceiling on certain types of time deposits in commercial banks. as well as grant standby authority for the Home Loan Bank Board to set dividend ceilings on savings and loan share accounts. This bill was reported from our committee on July 28. Barely a few hours later that afternoon the chairman of our committee introduced House Resolution 941. a resolution to discharge the Committee on Rules after 21 days. After having reported the bill. it turns out that the Johnson administration itself is unalterably opposed to setting statutory interest rate ceilings. Yesterday the Treasury Department told a Senate committee that enactment of the House bill could have catastrophic results on the homebuilding industry. Mr. Speaker. once again we are witnessing a reckless abuse of the 21day rule. By the request for its invocation. the responsibility for calling this measure before the House no longer rests with the Committee on Rules but squarely on the shoulders of our beloved Speaker. For the sake of accuracy. If the Members of the House want to risk a financial crisis of monumental proportions by enacting this measure. they should address their appeal for quick action to the House leadershipnot the Committee on Rules.

I cannot think of more iresponsible action than If the Committee on Rules heeded the pleas of Chairman PATMAN and reported a rule on H.R. 14026 prior to expiration of the required 21day rule. Rather they might reappraise the minoritys request for hearing from Treasury officials. especially in light of their recent opposition. and send the bill back to committee for more judicious and responsible consideration.",

It is an appropriate time for all of us to think about the world situation. to think about what we in the United States are doing and what we should be doing to preserve freedom in the world. and to restore freedom to those once free. Just 25 years ago. the godless hordes of communism seized the Baltic countries of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia.

Since then. there has been brutality. suppression of freedoms. and oppressive forcing of Communist teachings on the people of these countries. Many have been moved to Soviet slave camps. Russians have moved in to take over their property. This is communism at work. It makes one wonder about the mental capacity of those who urge that we appease this atheistic. cancerous ideology and its ruthless practitioners.

On this 25th anniversary of perfidy and international dishonor. we as free Americans should renew our determination to meet our obligation to freedom. and pay no heed to those who advocate tolerance and acceptance of Communists as responsible world citizens. The record has shown that they have not earned the respect of mankind. As long as any people remain in servitude. the rest of the world is in danger. for the aim and the goal. the intent and purpose. the methods and means. will always remain the same for Communists. Deceit is a weapon that we cannot afford to give them the luxury of utilizing when dealing with the fate of millions of people. The present administration has accepted the dismemberment of the Balkans as an irreversible fact. It should not be so. The defeat of communism in Asia will serve to hasten the disintegration of communism in Europe. To that end. we should at this time rededicate our national purpose and individual resolve.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the three ethnic groups with a total population of about 5 million constitute the Baltic nationsthe Estonians. Latvians. and Lithuanians. All three had been subjected to Russias czarist regime since the late 1880s. and they all had retained their love of freedom and independence for more than a century. After the First World War they proclaimed their freedom and reconstituted themselves as independent. sovereign nations. Soon they were admitted into the family of nations. and for two decades they became progressive. democratic republics. a real force for peace in northeastern Europe. They worked hard at the risk of rebuilding and strengthening their respective countries and. considering the relatively short time and the difficult circumstances. they accomplished wonders. In every field of human activity they made startling advances. and in many ways they were regarded as model democratic states. During all that time their inveterate and implacable foe was watching their progress and prosperity with jealousy and envy. The powerhungry rulers in the Kremlin had their evil designs on these nations. They wanted to put an end to democracy there. annex these countries. and enslave their innocent but helpless inhabitants. The men of the Kremlin attained their goal very early in the last war. First the governments of these countries were forced to sign mutual defense agreements with the Soviet Union. Then Soviet forces were stationed in all strategic points of these countries. Then. under the flimsy pretext that the governments of these countries were hostile to the Soviet Government. the Red Army attacked Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. overran them. eliminated the democratic governments there. and instituted Soviettype governments. Finally. in mid1940. all three countries were annexed to the Soviet Union. and thenceforth ceased to be independent entities. Thus began the enslavement of these stouthearted but helpless Baltic peoples by the Soviet Government. Besides imposing Soviet communism upon these peoples. several hundreds of thousands were arrested and exiled to distant prisonlabor camps in the Soviet Union. To this day the fate of these unfortunate souls is unknown. Perhaps a few thousands of them still linger on. but it is not likely that many of these will ever see their once free homeland. On the 25th anniversary observance of Soviet Unions treacherous and illegal seizure of the Baltic countries. and the enslavement of the Baltic peoples. we ardently hope for the freedom of these peoples.",

The act is a blot on the conscience of the free world. which must be dedicated to the goal of eventually restoring freedom in the captive Baltic nations.

For the peoples of that distant region this was the death knell of their independence. For them the summer of 1940 was a time for national disaster and tragedy. And the rest of the world? It was on the edge of an abyss. France had fallen. Nazi forces enveloped Scandinavia. Britain was left alone to fend off for herself the enemy that was coming. In the Far East. Japan moved relentlessly from one aggression to another. And while all this turmoil beset this terribly troubled world. we in the United States--at least some of us. and happily the great majority--sought desperately to prepare ourselves for the test of arms that was loomIng on the horizons. Yes. Mr. Speaker. the summer of 1940 was. indeed. a summer of discontent for all of us. and who is there to tell us that this summer of 1965 will bring to humanity assurances that the world will ever be spared the turmoil and trouble we have beheld in these last 25 years. The world is consumed by crises that offer no solace to us. Yet. we Americans are men of hope and men of reason. we are creatures of the age of enlightenment. We cannot despair of mans condition. nor can we despair of mans capacity to resolve the problems that overwhelm him. And if ever there was a source of encouragement to us all. that source is the example of the Baltic peoples who. after 25 years of the most oppressive tyranny. still hold fast to their national values and hold fast to the expectation that one day in the future freedom will once again come to their land.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been 25 years now since the Soviet Union broke its treaties with the Baltic nations of Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia and seized them by force of arms. During this period the Communists have pursued a ruthless policy to destroy systematically the identity of these areas. At first the leaders of the countries were brutally murdered. and since then hundreds of thousands of the people have been deported to labor camps in Siberia and have been replaced by Russians sent into the Baltic areas. Accompanied by political deceit and deception. the Sovietizing of the Baltic States has been a classic example of the Communist pattern for annihilating another nation. The peoples of these little states have never accepted this conquest of their homelands. and exiles from the Baltic States have remained united behind efforts to restore their countries to freedom. To our credit. our Government has never recognized these seizures of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union and continues to maintain diplomatic relations with representatives for the former governments of these countries. But in an era when we have aided and urged freedom and independence for scores of small nations throughout the world. our Government should be doing more about the plight of the Baltic States. These are peoples of countries existing for 700 years. and their claims of selfdetermination are as strong and valid as any in the world. I have introduced a concurrent resolution in this Congress setting forth the steps we should take. The resolution declares \"the suppression of freedom is an invitation to violence and a threat to peace.\" and \"involuntary enslavement cannot be encouraged or sanctioned by the United States and other nations subscribing to principles of freedom.\" The resolution continues that it is the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the U.S. mission to the United Nations to bring up the Baltic States question before the United Nations and urge that the Soviets withdraw all Soviet troops. colonists. and controls from the Baltic States. return all Baltic exiles from Siberian prisons and slave labor camps. and agree to free elections in the Baltic States under superivsion of the United Nations. I believe this is an issue on which the Congress should urge the administration to act and I hope the Committee on Foreign Affairs will soon give consideration to this resolution.",

Twentyfive years ago Soviet armed forces moved across the frontiers of the Baltic States. conquered the area. staged Sovietstyle oneslate elections. and formally absorbed the Baltic States into the Soviet Union as constituent republics. All of these events took place within a few short weeks during the summer of 1940. The Baltic peoples were forced to submit to conquest. Many Baltic people were killed and many thousands more were deported to distant areas in the U.S.S.R. Once the conquest was complete. the process known as Sovietization took place. The Baltic nations were reshaped according to the model of the Soviet state itself. Private property was brought under the authority of the state. farmlands were collectivized. all aspects of economic life were socialized. The political life of the nation was reshaped along the lines of the classic Communist model. Freedom of dissent was denied. and all autonomous authority. except that permitted by the state. was dissolved. These were troubled days for the Baltic peoples. and the postwar era has brought no relief to this much disturbed land. The vital national life of the Baltic peoples is now even more seriously threatened by a declared nationality policy that seeks the fusion of all peoples. . On this 25th anniversary of the Soviet conquest of the Baltic States. let us. therefore. pay special tribute to a truly heroic people. a people who look forward to the day when freedom will once again reign in their land.",

The tragic fate of these courageous peoples who have been by force incorporated into the Soviet Union in spite of their efforts to overthrow the yoke of Soviet domination. is a constant and continuing challenge to the free world. It is not enough to sympathize with the peoples of the Baltic States in their enslavement by Soviet Russia. It is time that some concrete effort be made to restore national freedom to these countries and to return the right of selfdetermination to the peoples of the Baltic States. At the request of many of my constituents in Birmingham who join with me in the belief that the restoration of freedom to those nations now under the domination of communism must be accomplished by active national protest rather than passive words. I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 421 which asks that the President of the United States bring the Baltic States question before the United Nations to demand that the Soviet Union withdraw all Soviet troops. secret police. agents. colonists. and all controls from Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. and to return to their homes all Baltic exiles and deportees from Siberia. prisons. and slave labor camps in the Soviet Union. and to request that free elections be conducted in the Baltic States under international supervision to return the right of selfdetermination to the peoples of these states. The United States has continuously maintained diplomatic relations with the Governments of the free Baltic Republics of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia and has refused to recognize their seizure by force by the Soviet Union. By passage of a resolution as outlined. the Congress of the United States will again proclaim to the world that this Nation and its people are determined that all peoples everywhere who are seeking release from Communist oppression and tyranny must attain the right of selfdetermination. and that those nations which so desire must be given an opportunity to freely choose whether they will remain a part of the Soviet bloc. or become again a part of the free world.",

Latvia. and Estonia. who have endured the yoke of communism since it was imposed upon them by the Soviet Union just 25 years ago. Since those countries fell victim to illegal seizure by an alien power. we in the United States have ourselves come to understand better what communism means. We have had Korea. where the spread of communism is being held in check. we more recently have seen tiny Cuba on our Nations very doorstep taken over by this modern scourge of mankind. and now we are losing the lives of fellow Americans in the struggle to save South Vietnam. and. yes. even in the Dominican Republic and the rest of the Western Hemisphere we are striving to protect freemen from further Communist conquest and tyranny. So. as we recall what the Soviet Union did in 1940. seizing those three Baltic countries in flagrant violation of specific treaties and international law. our sympathies for the people of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania are greater than ever. It is entirely appropriate that we in this Congress should remind the world of how a nation can be forcibly occupied by another in postWorld War II days. and how thousands of persons can be deported from their own lands to Communist slave campsas has been the case of these brave and beleaguered. If those people had been fortunate enough to have had assistance from the United States such as we have since been able to give to others in widely separated parts of the world. they might still be free today. They and other captive peoples of many nations look to us for their ultimate deliverance and restoration to freedom. We must never allow them to lose hope. nor must we ever stand idly by when the Communist threat hovers over free peoples anywhere. May God continue to sustain our efforts to regain peace and freedom in this world. and may He give those who are oppressed like the Estonians. Lithuanians. and Latvians the strength and courage to withstand ruthless dominations so that one day they may again enjoy the privilege of selfdetermination and the more abundant things in life which they are now denied.",

Lithuania was overrun. on the 16th Latvia fell. on June 17 Estonia yielded to the barbarian aggressors. In 3 short days. 6 million people lost their cherished independence. Within a month the Soviet Union established puppet governments which still rule today. From that time terror and crime have been the watchword of the reign of the Soviet oppressors.

One hundred and forty thousand were deported to isolated regions of Russia. Some fortunately were able to flee to Western Europe and forge for themselves new lives in freedom.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in my short termas Congressman. numerous businesses have asked me to help in securing extension of Small Business Administration loans. Loans to individual concerns are made for 10 years. and experience has been that the Administration Is properly strict about granting extensions of these loans. However. for many of the business enterprises in my district. and particularly the small businesses that operate hotels. it Is clear from experience that the 10year term of the loan is working a hardship. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I last week introduced an amendment to the Small Business Act to increase the maximum maturity of regular business loans thereunder to 20 years. This will avoid the occasional necessity of ballooning payments at the end of 10 years. It will provide an orderly and even curve of repayment which would not be the case if there is uncertainty about the possibility of extension beyond 10 years. Under my amendment. no distinction Is made between loans to individuals and loans to groups of small business concerns in the term or period of a loan. This has been the case under the present law. However. groups will still enjoy the opportunity to borrow greater sums than individuals and at more flexible interest rates. The existing law does permit extensions beyond the present term of a loan. My bill would permit any loan to be made up to 20 years. plus construction time in the case of construction loans. Having in mind this generous provision. my bill is written so as not to permit extensions of loans having original maturity in excess of 10 years plus construction time in the case of construction loans. Mr. Speaker. I am certain that these provisions will simplify the administration of the Small Business Act and reduce the number of defaults by providing a more bearable amortization.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the vote of the House 7 years ago March 12 climaxed a half century of struggle for the admission of Americas last incorporated territory into the Union. jubilation marked the reaction of nearly all Americans. whether in the islands or in the States. Long acknowledged as one of natures loveliest gifts to man. Hawaii has proved in these last 7 years to be one of the most prosperous and progressive States in the American Union. This House is proud of its role in adding the 50th star and new glory to an ensign that for generations has symbolized the hope of the world. The Congress of the United States has been proud and fortunate to have persons like Senator DANIEL K. INOUYE. Senator HIRAM L. FONG. Representative SPARK M. MATSUNAGA. and Representative PATSY T. MINK representing the State of Hawaii. Their presence here has contributed much to the concept of democracy and the meaning of Americanism as a way of life for all people. There is nothing but brilliance ahead for Hawaii in terms of its progress as a State. With its economy booming. this Nation can look forward to great things from Hawaii. America can also indeed begin to look to this youngest State for leadership in many areas. I am happy indeed to be serving in this Congress and to have this opportunity to extend to our youngest State a warm and enthusiastic greeting on its seventh anniversary.",

When Hawaii became the 50th State of the Union. the boundaries of our Nation were extended westward into the Pacific to include the seven major inhabited islands which comprise Hawaii. The new State. though far removed from the mainland in distance of miles. has consistently demonstrated its oneness with the Union by rapid and constructive progress economically. socially. and politically since the achievement of statehood in 1959. The population of Hawaii since that date has increased by 20 percent. Local manufacturing has increased 4 percent. Hawaiis per capita income has increased from a rank of 22d to 14th in our Nation. As a vacationland. it is renowned throughout the world. Today its development as a commercial and cultural center of the Pacific is equaling its fame as an island paradise. The 50th State of our Union is a wondrous combination of the exotic and the jet age. the ancient and the world of tomorrow. It is meeting every challenge of statehood and is a credit to our country.",

A key provision of this legislation extends the special milk program for school children through fiscal 1970 and increases the programs level of funding. This legislation had been snarled in a jurisdictional dispute between the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. I am delighted that the Rules Committee was able to resolve this dispute and get the bill to the floor of the House. All indications are that the legislation .will be taken up .by the full House either this week or soon after the Labor Day weekend. However the bill language will then probably be substituted for the language of the Senate child nutrition bill. S. 3467. and the House passed version of S. 3467 taken to a conference between the two Houses. This mehns that no final action will be taken on the legislation until after the Nations schoolchildren return to their classes this fall. Mr. President. I hope that both the House and the conferees will act with dispatch so that the local and State administrators who manage the school milk program can plan ahead for the 1967 school year. Congress. by reiterating Its faith in the school milk program. will make the task of the school food service administrators much simpler. They can act with the certainty that the program will continue to advance and prosper next year as well as this year.",

This amendment would make the terms of the bill the same as the principal item in the regular AID billthat is. for 1 year. The AID bill which was recently passed was for 1 year for everything except the development loans and the Alliance for Progress. On yesterday. I gave the reasons why I think this should be 1 year. because it is sound that this kind of program should be considered by each Congress at least once. I think the first year of a Congress is preferable to the second. But. in any case. I think the whole problem of foreign aid should be considered closely next year. This bill is a radical departure from the old bill under Public Law 480that is. the old surplus agricultural commodities disposal program. The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry stated yesterday that there is no longer any appreciable surplus of food. The only substantial surplus in the field of agricultural commodities is in cotton. The reports which I have read indicate that there will be a substantial decrease even in that carryover. So it is quite a different bill. So far as I can see. it is an effort now by the Agriculture and Forestry Committee and the Department of Agriculture to institute a new aid bill. Maybe this is a good thing. I question it on several grounds. but. so far as I am concerned. I see no reason to engage in an extensive debate. I see present on the floor those who were present yesterday during the debate. If the Senator from Louisiana is prepared to vote. I am prepared to do so also. because we are just occupying time.

And too little has been said about what a long. tough. grueling. and painful war this is likely to be before it ends. This Vietnam war is going to last for years. It will cost the lives of thousands of Americans and billions of dollars. and that cannot be said often enough. The sooner the American people fully recognize the painful cost of this war. and the sooner the North Vietnamese know that they recognize it. and the necessity for this heavy sacrifice the more likely it will be that North Vietnam will agree to consider the beginning of negotiation. It is also necessary that the American people realize that we are not going to win any smashing American victory. Indeed the majority leader spoke wisely yesterday in insisting that the administration is not seeking any total military victory or unconditional surrender. At best. we will win an opportunity for the South Vietnamese to determine what kind of government they want. without alinement with this country. without an American base in Vietnam. and without any assurance that South Vietnam will not choose communism if hey desire it. Why. in view of the heavy sacrifice we will have to make and the apparently feeble benefit to this country. must we continue? The answer. Mr. President. was brilliantly expressed in last nights Washington Star by Howard K. Smith. Mr. Smith argues that America must not lose this war for two reasons: First. If we should lose or withdraw. wars of liberation would become a certainty throughout the world. not only in Asia. but also in Africa and South America. The collapse of American power at the hands of a guerrilla band. supplied primarily by a relatively primitive country of 16 million people. would signal a feeble and helpless United States. Second.

    "speech": "Mr. President. too little attention has been paid to the full consequences of restrictive monetary policy and high interest rates on the cost of living. The classical argument is that tight credit and high interest rates will discourage prospective home buyers. businessmen planning expansion. auto buyers. and others who want to spend money. from borrowing to spend. The tight credit is supposed to cut down on spending. And. of course. to some extent it does. It has. in fact. sharply depressed the homebuilding industry. It has probably discouraged some small businessmen from borrowing to meet big business competition. and it has persuaded municipalities contemplating school building. for example. to postpone their plans. In this sense. tight money may have contributed to reducing demand and kept this kind of pressure off prices. On the other hand. it has contributed directly to a high cost of living. I have just received from the Bureau of Labor Statistics an analysis which. for the first time. to my knowledge. separates out the rise in interest rates in determining the big cost of housing element. in the cost of living. Since the big cost of living rise began last February 1 until the latest available report on the cost of livingfor last monthhousing costs rose by 1.9 percent2.1 points. During this same period. however. mortgage interest rates by themselves rose a whopping 8 percent. The Bureau of Labor statisticians tell me that their analysis shows that if one takes the soaring 8percent rise of mortgage interest rates out of the increase in housing. one subtracts more than onethird of the full housing rise. In fact. of the 1.9percent rise. 0.7 percent was the result of higher mortgage interest rates. Without the rise in interest rates. the rise in housing costs would have been not 1.9 percent but 1.2 percent. Mr. President.

To those who would question the costs of this program we must ask them to consider the cost of not adopting this program. in terms of direct public assistance payments alone. which amount to $4 billion per year. In addition to these direct payments. the indirect costs of poverty to this country which show up in juvenile delinquency. crime. health hazards. and higher police and fire protection costs. totals billions more. Let us vividly realize that a teenage jobless rate of 16 percent has explosive possibilities that are of potential fearful and frightful consequences. It is not suggested here that a program of perpetual care is to be established. It is intended only that povertystricken people who need and will respond to help will be given such help so that they may help themselves and gradually the desperate need of such help will be reduced and the programs themselves will be accordingly restricted and eliminated.

Because of my belief I advocated and supported the original legislation. in 1953. that led to the establishment of the Small Business Administration. the first comprehensive agency of the Federal Government devoted wholly to small business problems. Before and since that time I have supported every sound legislative proposal projected for the particular benefit of small business in this country. and I shall continue to do so in order to preserve the vaunted traditions of our American free enterprise system.",

Through the enactment of this bill. veterans and military personnel of this socalled cold war period will be granted. besides educational training and home loan assistance. job counseling aid. entitlement to hospital care. wartime presumptions for serviceconnected disabilities from Chronic and tropical diseases. and certain other benefits. Mr. Speaker. on other occasions such as this I have expressed my very deep conviction that the best patriotic incentive and encouragement that we can provide for those who may be called to future military service is the example of the equitable treatment we demonstrate of those loyal veterans and their dependents of our past wars. Although this measure before us may not contain the full educational and dependency allowances that most of us might desire. and although it may contain greater restrictions than most of us might wish. it is still a substantial step in a just direction and I urge its prompt adoption.",

I think that most Members here will agree that the need to equitably revise our current immigration laws is one of the most vitally important subjects that today challenges our national moral conscience and the legislative prudence of the Congress. Even a very brief review of our present law reveals that the current national origins system. which determines a nations immigration quota by the proportion of the U.S. population of that national extraction in 1924. visits a most unfair and unpopular discrimination against the majority of the nations of the world. This persistent discrimination has increasingly weakened our position of world leadership and has unwittingly delivered into skillful antiAmerican hands an effective instrument for Communist propaganda against the United States as the proclaimed hope and asylum of the poor and the persecuted and the homeless. Mr. Chairman. surely the great majority of Americans would objectively judge this system and situation to be gravely unfair and it is. indeed. a matter which has seriously hurt the prestige and influence of the United States. both at home and abroad.

It has stripped it almost altogether of ceremonial and of meaningless and absurd forms. It has placed the public officer in a position of power. to be used for service. * * * Having surrounded him with none of the pomp which makes appeal to the thoughtless and ignorant. it must invest him with the higher honor which should be the reward of fidelity.

After all. open confession. as one knows. is good for a mans soul. but there is a little more involved here. The only testimony that I can find was by General Shuler. General Shuler is the Director of Installations for the Department of Defense. He speaks in the hearings about closing Frankfort. Anniston. Erie. Letterkenny.

I believe that economy is becoming a strange bird around these diggings. It depends on whether one can muster enough votes to save the installation.

In my judgment. voluntary compliance by investors in foreign bonds and voluntary compliance by American industrialists to the request that they do not establish plants in foreign countries will not work. Firm and severe action must be taken. I cannot agree with the argument \"extend the credit.\" We have had Appalachia. the war on poverty. area redevelopment. community facilities. and the Peace Corps. Domestically we have had program after program developed supposedly to expand the economy. Where will we stop?",

Completion of the drilling platform. now well underway. is less than a year and a half away. To suspend or abandon the project at this point would be most uneconomical.

That argument of national prestige has been raised on practically every controversial issue that has come before us on this bill. I am conscious of the need for maintaining national prestige. That transcends the esteem which people around the world will have for us because of our scientific accomplishments. But we have problems confronting us: The challenge of inflation. which is spoken about by the President and the Treasury Department practically every day. and the problem of taking care of those among our society who are in need. The query comes to me whether we are not acting vainly when in everything we do we are motivated by the goal of national prestige. Secondly. who is to have the benefits of these 15 patents that have already been granted? Are the benefits to come to the citizenry of the United States? Are they to go to those who drill into the earth to find materials that can be commercialized and sold? It looks to me as though the oil companies will benefit by the patents that will come out of this program of drilling: 15.000 feet down into the earth. beginning at the floor. and. of course. another 15.000 or 20.000 feet above. The Senator from Illinois has put the question whether the drilling was not to be at the lowest point of the ocean. That would be 32.000 feet.

The needs for additional development of our water resources demand prompt action because of the long \"leadtime\" between authorization by Congress and turning the taps to release the first water from a newly constructed dam. We face a crisis. in the next few years. of complete drought in our cities and on the farms of the West. I would prefer to spend our tax money on Federal activities such as the central Utah project. where the money will be repaid to the Treasury. before we appropriate funds for the race to the moon.

This is the result of this type of deceitful bookkeeping which has become the practice of the Johnson administration. The agencies that are provided for under this appropriation. bill that was acted upon here today actually get a little over $1 billion more than they received under last years appropriation. I make this statement notwithstanding the fact that the report shows that the amount has been reduced $2.25 billion. That difference is partly explained on pages 47 and 48 of the bill. where one will find that under the title \"Federal National Mortgage Association Participation Sales Authorizations\" the Farmers Home Administration of the Department of Agriculture gets $600 million. the Office of Education of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. $100 million. the Department of Housing and Urban Development. $1.420 million. the Veterans Administration. $260 million. the Small Business Administration. $850 million.

Once again Miss Porter has provided us with useful information and penetrating analysis of the current turmoil in the economy. Her careful consideration of the data provided by the Bowery Savings Bank of New York provides further evidence of the widespread effects of unwarranted interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board. The findings shatter once again the myth that raising the discount rate will provide a oneshot solution to inflationary trends in an expanding economy. The plight of savings and loan institutions is becoming increasingly well documented. It is not simply a matter of competition with the 5 percent interest currently allowed banks on certificates of deposit. As indicated by the Porter column. depositors are seeking to join the interest rate bandwagon in the bond and security market. As a result of the dollar drain. savings and loan institutions which finance nearly half of the outstanding home mortgages in the United States are severely tightening the home construction market. The magnitude of the withdrawals can only mean that the small saver is following the example of the highrate payers. The pattern of loyalty by small investors to their savings institutions. assumed by economists advocating high interest rates. appears to be unfounded. It is apparent that solutions other than the outmoded increase in interest rates must be sought if we are to continue the unprecedented success of our economy. I have suggested that the administration assume the initiative in dropping sales participation offerings from their current 5% percent rate. Further solutions must be investigated in the tax field. I submit to the House the following column in the hope that it will assist in the realization of what is necessary to restore our economic growth.",

It appraises the present U.S. coin situation. and makes recommendations which are designed to assure adequate supplies of coin to meet all future business needs. and to do so as economically as possible. Because of his keen interest in all legislative and administrative matters which pertain to banking and finance. one of the closest observers of the subcommittees work was Mr. Thomas W. Miles. a Washington financial writer and public affairs counsellor. Mr. Miles has had occasion to comment at various times on the committee reports which resulted from those studies. and in an article which he has written for the June 1966. issue of the Illinois Banker he presents an interesting r6sum6 of the countrys present coin situation. and of the prospects for future coin needs. His article also comments on the subcomittees work. In view of the coin problems that the Congress has had to deal with in the recent past. I believe that every Member will find Mr. Miles article to be of much interest: [From the Illinois Banker. June 1966]",

H.R. 2035 passed the House on July 12. 1965. and provided the procedure for an automatic costofliving adjustment in the contract price of certain star route contracts whenever. the Consumer Price Index reflects an increase of at least 1 percent in 1 year. Under the Housepassed bill. the Postmaster General. after January 1. 1965. was required to make the initial determination of any change in the annual average of the Consumer Price Index from 1963. On the basis of such determination. the star route contracts were to be adjusted effective July 1. 1965. if the Postmaster General determined that the annual average from 1963 to 1964 was equal to a rise of at least 1 percent. The Senate amendments. 1 through 8. are technical amendments inserting more current dates in the bill so that the first contract adjustment will be effective July 1. 1966. rather than July 1. 1965. as provided in the House bill. Senate Amendment No. 9 adds a new subsection (d) to confine the adjustments to contractors who operate not more than one contract. and to preclude any increase if. within the 12 months preceding the date of the costofliving adjustments. the contract has been increased by action of the Post Office Department under 39 U.S.C. 6423(a). This latter section authorizes the Postmaster General to adjust the contract price to reflect certain increases or decreases in the cost of operation of the star route contracts. I believe the Senate amendment is a reasonable amendment as there would be no justification for any particular star route contractors to be entitled to two adjustments .during any particular 12month period. .I have been advised that the representatives of the star route contractors support this amendment.",

President Johnsons description of him as \"one of the most imaginative. distinctive and effective Administrators\" that foreign aid has had is an apt one. for Mr. Bells record as Chief of our foreign aid program is truly outstanding. He is in large part responsible for the most noteworthy improvements of the aid program. such as increased emphasis on greater selectivity and choice of recipients. selfhelp measures and eradication of the root causes of proverty. such -as hunger. disease. and ignorance. Mr. Bell was born in Jamestown. N. Dak.. on January 20. 1919. He was graduated. with highest honors. and a Phi Beta Kappa key. from Pomona College in Claremont. Calif. In 1939. hewent on to Harvard University to earn a masters degree in 1941 and he passed the general examination for his Ph. D. that same year. During World War II. Mr. Bell began his career in Government service as a member of the War Organization Section of the Budget Bureau. leaving in 1943 to become an officer in the Marine Corps. From 1945 to 1947. Mr. Bell held the position of Associate Examiner of the Budget Bureaus Estimates Division. In 1948. he held the position of White House Assistant and then became Assistant Chief of the Fiscal Division of the Bureau of the Budget. In 1949. Mr. Bell was made a White House aid and President Truman appointed him as one of his administrative assistants in 1952. During the 1950s. Mr. Bell served in Pakistan as .an adviser to that countrys government on economic development. He returned to this country in 1957 to become a lecturer in economics and director of the graduate school of public administration at Harvard University. In 1961. President Kennedy made him the Director of the Bureau of the Budget and. in 1962. he was appointed Administrator of the Agency for International Development. a post he has held longer than any former Administrator. In this position. which certainly must be one of the most difficult jobs in government. Mr. Bell has made an outstanding record.

Lining the pockets of landlords with a 40year Government dole to build houses for sociological purposes is anything but private enterprise. The promise to these same landlords that they will retain private enterprise management over these federally financed properties in the light of section VI of the Civil Rights Act is a hoax and camouflage that cries out for exposure. Washington bureaucrats will -manage \"rent subsidy\" properties even though landlords retain title to these properties. From the time that man emerged from the caves to build his leantos and adobe huts. mans house has been his modest private enterprise masterpiece. Even a few years back our Government under FHA seemed favorably inclined to home ownership. Increasingly. however. Government has extended its mantle of public responsibility over housing and diluted the value and incentives of home ownership. Those who would undermine or destroy the most widely held and most cherished of private property by subjecting it to increasing public management are. in fact. enemies of private enterprise. Federal control is threatening the private sector of housing and the wolf \"rent subsidy\" is running around in the sheeps clothing of private enterprise.",

I have come to know the importance of many of these research activities. No one challenges the need for intensive programs of science. research. and technology.

No State. nor region of the country has a corner on the ability to produce brainpower. We must take steps to insure a more equitable distribution of the Federal funds for research and development. which have become an integral part of maintaining academic excellence.

But even that additional onequarter percent will mean an additional cost of $5 million annually for each $1 billion of the participation certificates sold not only for 1 year. but for all the years they are outstanding. So we are dealing with extra costs of at least $50 million a year for the next 10 or 15 years. This is wholly unnecessary because the loans can be financed at a lower cost.

In 1963 that award was made posthumously to our great former President. the late John F. Kennedy. in appreciation of the tremendous leadership he exhibited in bettering the working conditions and enhancing the dignity of all postal and Federal employees. Th 1964 award was made to our distinguished colleague. Representative JAMES H. MORRISON. of Louisiana. because he introduced the pay legislation in the 88th Congress and led the fight for its successful passage. It was my privilege to attend the award ceremonies in the National Association of Letter Carriers Building here in Washington. on January 11. Mr. Victor Uhalik. president of the Cleveland branch. NALC. and Mr. J. Joseph Vacca. of Cleveland. a national officer of the NALC. came to Washington specifically to make the presentation. The ceremony occurred at a delightful gathering of about 175 people invited by Mr. and Mrs. J. Don Kerlin. of this city. I think. Mr. Speaker. it is entirely fitting that our friend and colleague. JIMMY MORRISON. should have been singled out for this distinction. Certainly nobody has done more to be helpful to the letter carriers and the other postal and Federal employees. Nobody has worked harder or more effectively. Nobody could have deserved this tribute more. In passing. I would like to commend the Cleveland letter carriers for their thoughtfulness in making this award. The National Association of Letter Carriers has always been admired by Members of the Congress because they never forget to say \"thank you\" to those who have labored in their behalf. This was just another example of that ingratiating trait. We all like to be thanked when we feel we have deserved some measure of gratitude. JIMMY MORRISON certainly has deserved the thanks of the letter carriers. and all other postal and Federal employees. and this ceremony showed that the beneficiaries of his efforts remember and appreciate what he has done for them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I should like to consider the effects on American agriculture should price support and acreage diversion programs be discontinued. There would be two major developments in agriculture. First. farm income would drop drastically and. second. land values would decrease. A number of studies indicate that farm prices would probably have to drop about 20 percent in order for farm output to clear the market after from 3 to 5 years of adjustment after the discontinuance of the farm programs. Because of the high level of farm expenses per $100 of Income from farm marketings. a drop of more than 20 percent in farm prices would probably reduce net farm income by more than 50 percent. This means that. in the years 196163 for example. it Is expected that farm income would have averaged $6 billion instead of the $12.6 billion it actually averaged. This represents a drop of 52 percent. but during the 3 to 5 years of adjustment without transitory legislation. an even greater decline in pricesand therefore net incomewould occur because it would take that long to make the adjustment to free market conditions. No responsible individual advocates the sudden termination of all agricultural programs but the simple facts are that agriculture. as we know it today. could not exist after a drop in net income of 50 percent. In the last 4 years farm real estate values increased by about $21 billion. Should farm income decline to $6 billion. earnings available as a return on farm real estate investment would be about $1 billion a year. If the American farmers expected this $1 billion to represent a return of 4 percent on their investment. they could reasonably have only about $25 billion invested in land instead of the $151 billion at present. The losses in farm real estate values would be huge. not to mention the foreclosures which would take place where real estate debts are owned under installment contracts. The American farmer cannot afford to face ending farm programs. Injustice in Selma. Ala.",
