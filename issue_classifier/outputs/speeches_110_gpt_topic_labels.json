    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the House will take up H.R. 493. the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007. This legislation is sponsored by two of my distinguished colleagues. Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER. who has been waiting 10 years to debate this bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. and Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT. who has been a member of the committee which I chair. the Committee on Education and Labor. and I commend the sponsors for their hard work and for their perseverance. This bill is long overdue. The Human Genome Project started the revolution in science and medicine nearly 20 years ago by identifying the specific chromosomes within the genes that make up the human body. Once the scientists identified and understood these genetic building blocks. they developed tests that identified genetic markers for diseases that could. but may never. occur. We understand that this scientific revolution can and will save lives. It can save children from devastating illnesses. and once these tests and treatments become more widely available. they will help us live longer lives with less debilitating diseases. The key to unlocking this scientific revolution is to assure individuals of genetic privacy and nondiscrimination when they undergo genetic testing and counseling. Many Americans already forgo testing for fear of losing their jobs and their health insurance. In a 2003 National Institutes of Health study. 39 percent of the individuals surveyed cited fear of losing their health insurance as the most distressing issues related to genetic testing. E 1345 There is a clear need for us to pass this law to protect genetic information from discriminatory uses. We all suffer if fears of lost jobs or health insurance stifle these scientific advances. That is why 41 States have passed laws to prohibit discrimination in the individual health insurance market. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 3 minutes. Obviously I rise in strong support of H.R. 493. I think it has been an honor to work with the gentlewoman from New York and. I might add. work we did. When the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003. the House of Representatives recognized it as \"one of the most significant scientific accomplishments of the past 100 years.\" For the first time. individuals actually could know their genetic risk of developing disorders such as cancer. diabetes. heart disease. Parkinsons. Alzheimers. and they could take preventative measures to decrease their risks. It spawned a personalized medicine movement. focusing on catching diseases earlier. when they are cheaper and easier to treat or. even better. preventing the onset of the disease in the first place. But after investing more than $3.7 billion in taxpayer money to achieve this breakthrough. Congress walked away and left the job unfinished. We left people without any assurance that their genetic information would not be used against them. So. understandably. they avoided this great technology. never realizing the untold health benefits and savings. This concern even spilled over into NIH. where a fear of genetic discrimination is currently the most commonly cited reason for not participating in research on potentially lifesaving genetic testing for breast cancer and colon cancer. Fully onethird of those eligible to participate declined to do so for this reason. undermining the development of new treatments and cures. Mr. Speaker. today Congress is here to settle some unfinished business and provide Americans the protections against genetic discrimination in health care insurance and employment that they need to utilize genetic testing without fear. Besides the more than 200 health advocacy and business organizations that support this bill. recent surveys show 93 percent of Americans believe that employers and insurers should not be able to use genetic information to discriminate. With numbers like this. it should come as no surprise that this legislation enjoys overwhelmingly bipartisan support. And I want to take a moment to thank my good friend Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. WALDEN and Ms. ESHOO. It truly has been a pleasure working with all of them. I would also like to thank",

I dont think there is any feeling that beats coming to the floor and knowing that success awaits us and the American people. I think thats the case today as we gather to support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. known as GINA. Many times over the course of American history in this Chamber. discrimination has been struck down. I believe that is what we are doing here today with this bill. When the sequencing of the Human Genome Project was completed in April of 2003. it was a great. great victory in the scientific community. So many of us understood what the implications were for our constituents. for the people of our Nation. and people in the world. Researchers identified genetic markers for a variety of chronic health conditions. When they did. they threw open the doors to increase the potential for early treatment and prevention of numerous diseases. But there was something that stepped in the way. and that was the threat of discrimination against anyone that subjected themselves to the test. found that they had a gene that wasnt perfect. which I think is the potential of every single one of us. and as a result of that. that their job would be threatened. and that their health care insurance could be dropped. What this bill does today is to throw the doors open with a guarantee by making it illegal for health plans and health insurers to deny coverage to a healthy individual or charge a higher premium based solely on genetic predisposition to a specific disease. I could go on and on about the bill. but the fact of the matter is. it has well over 200 cosponsors. It is a real bipartisan bill. Thank you to Congresswoman LouisE SLAUGHTER for her tenacity and her belief in the effort. Twelve years. that is a long time. I would also like to say what a difference a new majority makes. because this bill was really blocked from coming to the floor for full consideration.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. its my feeling that this bill should have been brought to the floor under a rule to perhaps allow additional improvement and amendment. as pointed out by Mr. STEARNS. There is the opportunity. perhaps in conference. to further improve the bill. I dont think our work is quite done. One improvement that I was able to effect in our committee. the Committee on Energy and Commerce. is the exclusion of title II for covered entities already subject to regulation under HIPAA statutes. the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act statutes. Dual regulation of communications. uses. disclosures and other aspects and activities. subject to regulation. currently regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services. by GINA. would have had disastrous conseqdences for coordination of care. We need to make clear that providing health services Is not the same as hiring. firing or job promotion. Genetic information is medical information and is not restricted under the House bill for employersponsored services that are covered in entities under HIPAA. Also. nothing in this bill affects the practice of medicine. That is not the intention. and this is among the principles that I have sought to ensure. I would note that the current HIPAA regulations are extremely sophisticated. They are the result of over 5.000 communications and comments. We are not going to trump those regulations under title II. and that will prevent the possibility for enormous disruption and adverse consequences. Failure to address this issue would have been calamitous. for efforts of using health information. new efforts for using health information technology. Medical information systems cannot be burdened with legal requirements that would. in effect. force complicated segregation of genetic information from other medical information and health care. including those in employersponsored clinics. Still. with all of those caveats. I will be voting in favor of the bill today. I do look forward to making certain that these modifications survive in conference and perhaps there will be the opportunity to even make things a little bit better in that process.",

As science continues to make rapid advancement in the area of genetics. I cannot stress how important this bill is to every American citizen. Genetic testing has increasingly become an integral part of the American health care system. providing the possibility to develop better therapies that are more effective against disease and allow individuals to take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. However. as knowledge of the human genome expands. a greater proportion of the population will likely be identified as carriers of mutations associated with a greater risk of certain diseases. indicating that virtually all people are potentially victims of genetic discrimination in health insurance. Along with the increasing prevalence of genetic testing comes the growing fear of the potential misuse of this information by way of discrimination in health insurance and employment. Accordingly. we need to strengthen current laws at both the Federal and State level in order to protect against the possibility of genetic discrimination. This bill will go a long way in making sure that this highly private information cannot be misused or abused. In closing. I want to thank the primary sponsors of this legislation. particularly Ms. SLAUGHTER. I know how long she has worked on this. along with Ms. ESHoo and others.

Being able to identify risks for certain conditions holds such great promise for our ability to identify and practice greater preventive health care in this country. The importance of preventive care to our wellbeing and our optimum health can never be overemphasized. However. as with almost all great scientific advancements. we have also opened the door to a whole slew of unintended consequences. Preventive health care can be put at risk if patients decline genetic testing for fear of insurance or employment discrimination. We need to work together. and we will. on ways to promote ethical genetic testing. coupled with appropriate privacy protections and with measures such as we are doing today to prevent discrimination.

The Senate has twice passed earlier versions of this bill with unanimous votes. but the House has always blocked action. Its good to see that times have changed. Members from both sides of the aisleas well as the President support the bill before us. As I hope most of you know. this bill does something very simple. but something very important as well. It protects peoples genetic information and family history from being used by health plans or employers to discriminate against them. Enactment of this law is critical to protect patients and for genetic science to advance. Recent breakthroughs in medical science have made genetic testing available to more patients. but with these breakthroughs comes the fear that patients may be discriminated against by insurance companies and/or employers if they are predisposed to suffer from a disease or other condition. We are here today to make sure that patients can undergo genetic tests which could help with treatments or cures without tear that the results will keep them from affordable. reliable health care.

The objective of this bill is simple: preventing both health insurance companies and employers from using genetic information to discriminate against individuals. In the past decade. science has made remarkable advances on the human genome. Genetic tests are already available to measure an individuals likelihood of developing specific diseases. In fact. soon every individual will have a genetic profile available that predicts the diseases for which they are more at risk. and what side effects to which they are more susceptible. These genetic advances will make health care preemptive and ultimately save the health care systemand consumersmoney. While these advances hold amazing potential. they also hold potential for abuse. For example. health insurance companies could charge higher ratesor even deny coverageto individuals who are determined to be at higher risk for certain disease or illnesses. Similarly. employers could screen applicants for certain positions based on their genetic makeup to get the individuals least likely to develop diseases. Our laws need to keep pace with medical advancement. If Americans are afraid of retribution from their health insurance company or from their employer if they get genetic testing done. none of the medical advances that are possible will be achieved. We simply must move forward in this critical area of science. which is why I urge passage of this legislation.",

Climate change is one of the most urgent issues of our time and will affect the whole world. but the brunt of the climate burden will undoubtedly be taken by the poorest populations. Lowlying coastal areas and urban inner cities are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The construction of interstate highways has concentrated greenhouse gases in urban communities and increased the prevalence of asthma in those areas. 70 percent of AfricanAmerican people live near environmentally unfriendly industries like coal fired plants. These plants emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants that adversely affect the air quality in the communities around them. The issue of climate change is not only about AfricanAmericans. but a much broader Black community. The Black Diaspora and Africans are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of environmental inaction. It is estimated that 75250 million Africans can be affected by the stresses that climate change has on water supply and a rapidly changing ecosystem. The ingenuity of the people of the United States will allow our country to become a leader in curbing global warming by paving the way with wellplanned legislation and creating jobs that will boost the economy. Prompt. decisive action is critical. since global warming pollutants can persist in the atmosphere for more than a century. The most important thing to remember is that the most expensive policy is that of doing nothing. We cannot afford not to take action. The impact that climate change has on our ecosystems. health. and food and energy costs is irreversible.

I also recognize that it was with the support of their parents. teachers. and friends that these cheerleaders were able to win such a demanding competition. Those closest to this team were just as vital in its success as components in the motivation that allowed them to go so far. The devotion that family and friends offer is incredibly important and I am delighted with their involvement in this endeavor.

Just shy of 233 years. maybe on a day like today. the people of our Nation came together as volunteers to meet the demands of the American Revolutionary War. It was on that day. June 14th. 1775 that the United States Army was born. I believe that on that same day the spirit of democracy was defended and the birth of our freedom was realized. Since the birth of our Army. weve waged through 24 major engagements including the War of 1812. the MexicanAmerican War. the American Civil War. the Korean War. the Vietnam War. the Kosovo War and more recently Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. Armys Senior Leadership said it best in their birthday message to the force at large. They stated. \"Our sacrifices have preserved our way of life. built a better future for others. and led our Nation to victory over our enemies. We are the best in the world at what we do. and because of our values. our ethos. and our peopleespecially our people. Our Army is hugely resilient. professional. and battiehardened.\" I am reassured through the training that Ive personally watched in my travels to Iraq and at home that the U.S. Army is without doubt prepared. I think about the bravery of our men and women that serve. Not a day goes by when I havent thought about the priceless human investment our Nation bears through Americas Sons and Daughters. Though I continually pray for everyones safe return. I know that each citizen takes an oath that could mean giving the ultimate sacrifice. I am consistently reminded from faces I see almost daily of the special qualities of spirit. patriotism and courage that exude from the men and women in uniform today. just as they did in 1775.

Our responsibility is to protect the American people and ensure that our weapons programs operate in a responsible and secure manner. These important programs are our national deterrent against rogue nations who would threaten us with weapons of mass destruction. in addition. these cuts will erode our nonproliteration efforts worldwide. as our allies would have to consider expanding their own nuclear arsenals to make up for our reductions. The cuts proposed today will cut nearly 40 percent of the tunding for our Nuclear weapons programs operated at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I would ask the sponsors of these cuts if they believe that the threats from rogue states and aggressive dictators have reduced by 40 percent? It not. why are we cutting our ability to defend ourselves by 40 percent? These cuts will damage our ability to retain good scientists. preserve the knowledge base of our laboratory. and our preparedness to respond to our future nuclear needs. In addition. these cuts decimate the nations Stockpile Stewardship Program. Since we have stopped testing nuclear weapons. our country relies on Los Alamos to ensure that our strategic weapon capabilities are safe. reliable and secure. Failure do so abdicates our responsibility to the protect the American people. These programs are critical to the mission of Los Alamos and critical to America.

This commission is a perfect example of Ronald Reagans belief that the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this Earth is a government program. Established more than 40 years ago. this commission has evolved into an inequitable and duplicative Federal program. yet It receives $35 million in next years budget. Although most of ARC funding is spent building State roads. the agency also spends tax dollars on water programs. housing projects. business development. and health care. However. this funding is only available to 13 States. In other words. this is a bracketed bill. The ARC is a redundant layer of bureaucracy. Several other Federal agencies have similar missions as the ARC. For example. an Appalachian community applying for an economic development grant would be eligible to use 20 other programs across five other agencies and receive funding for the exact same purposes. For every ARC program. it is duplicated by another Federal program. According to the Department of Agricultures Web site. USDAs Rural Development Agency supports such essential public facilities and services as water and sewer systems. housing. health clinics and promotes economic development. In other words. under the current Department of Agriculture programs. these communities could apply for these grants instead of having a separate bracketed amount of money. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development. there is a rural housing and economic development program within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Departmenuts of Transportation and Commerce. for example. and even the Department of Defense. have programs whose mission is to help rural communities. Therefore. if we were to eliminate the ARC. applicants could still apply for countless other grants from other agencies that are already providing funding for rural communities. I represent a rural community. and so I understand the unique challenges facing rural America today. However. as we work to help communities overcome their challenges. we should do it in such a way that we are not wasting taxpayer dollars. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

But let me tell you. for all of the heartburn we have had over congressional earmarks and administration earmarks. I would point out that funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission basically provides earmarks designated by the Governors of 13 Appalachian States. If we are cutting our earmarks. then we should be reducing these as well. The one thing we should not do is delegate our decisionmaking to the authority of these Governors. no matter how well intended the purposes are. And I have to tell you. we have been throwing this money into these counties for all these years. and they are still at these levels. It doesnt do any good. It just goes down the tube. We should do programs that really help the quality of life in these regions and help them move out. rather than doing these little projects that keep them in the poverty level.

If we keep spending money the way we are spending money now. we are going to have to raise taxes. In fact. the Democratic budget passed what is going to be the largest tax increase in American history. The government doesnt have an Income problem. the government has a spending problem. When you look at the revenues over the last few years because we lowered taxes and let the American people keep their money and let the American people Invest and let small businesses create jobs all across America. what happened? Well. the economy got better. What happened to tax revenues? Tax revenues are increasing at a fairly substantial rate.

The Commission acts as a key tinancial partner in attracting private and nonprofit investment to the region. In Fiscal Year 2006. every dollar of ARC funding leveraged $3.14 in other public funding and $11.55 in private investment.

This amendment that I am offering. and plan to withdraw. is based on legislation I have introduced with Congressmen WILSON and SPACE. H.R. 2282. the Nuclear Waste Storage Prohibition Act. Currently. there are 11 sites around our Nation that are under consideration for hosting one or more facilities related to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. called GNEP. Its an initiative that is being studied as we speak. The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant located in my district in Piketon. Ohio. is one of the 11 sites. The other sites include locations in Tennessee. South Carolina. Kentucky. New Mexico. Illinois. Washington and Idaho. Everyone representing one of these sites or an area nearby has a strong interest in how this important initiative proceeds. The point of my amendment is to ensure that none of these GNEP sites that have been under consideration only become a de facto storage site for spent nuclear fuel. My amendment prohibits DOE from using funds to transfer spent nuclear fuel or highlevel radioactive waste to any site unless it is a site where the reprocessing facility for this material is either under construction or has been completed. In addition. my amendment also ensures the final end product after the fuel has been recycled is moved offsite as quickly as possible. either to the next stage in the nuclear fuel recycling process or to Yucca Mountain. which remains our Nations longterm and permanent storage facility. DOE has not made any statements to suggest that any of those 11 sites would ever become a de facto waste storage site. On the contrary. DOE and this Congress have made clear over the years that the final end product will be permanently stored at Yucca Mountain. However. based on feedback from my constituents. who generally speaking are very excited by the potential opportunities of this initiative. there are some concerns related to longterm storage.

I believe that we in Congress must take responsibility for this burden by establishing Federal spending priorities and setting spending caps for some programs and eliminating unnecessary spending for others. When you look at this amount of money. when you look at this huge amount that we are spending. I believe that it is very reasonable to ask for this modest cut. We owe it to the taxpayers whose money we are spending to make a serious commitment to fiscal responsibility and we need to exercise fiscal restraint.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it is with great pride and personal pleasure that I rise today to honor Bruce Baughman for his years of leadership and service to the state of Alabama as director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency (AEMA). Bruces tenure has endured devastating natural disasters across Alabama. including Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina as well as a deadly tornado that killed 10 people at Enterprise High School. In each of these circumstances. Bruces experience and guidance proved crucial to the entire region. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina. the recovery in south Alabama was much better than expected. and as a result of Bruces steady hand. AEMAs response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 received national praise. His list of accomplishments is long enough to fill an entire volume of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Among the highlights. Bruce was the Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) director of operations for response efforts at both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Bruce also served as director of FEMAs Office of National Preparedness. a department created at the request of the president and charged with planning and coordinating the agencys domestic terrorism preparedness. Bruce has served as director of FEMAs Planning and Readiness Division. coordinating the development and implementation of FEMA policies and procedures for use during presidentially declared emergencies. Prior to joining FEMA. Bruce served on the Mississippi EMA staff. Bruce is also a veteran. having served his country as an artillery officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. seeing service in Asia. Europe. and the Caribbean. Bruces lifetime of service has certainly not gone unnoticed. He has received numerous awards including FEMAs Distinguished Service Award and four FEMA Meritorious Service Awards. Madam Speaker. the faithful service of outstanding Americans like Bruce Baughman has contributed in an immeasurable way to the wellbeing of our state and our Nation. I would like to offer my congratulations to Bruce for his many personal and professional achievements and offer a heartfelt \"thank you\" for a job well done.

New Mexico lawyers had never used the phrase \"Madam Chief Justice.\" so they decided to inquire if they could call her \"Chief Justice Minzner.\" The Chief Justices reply speaks volumes about her personality. She told the shocked lawyers. \"just call me Pam.\" Pamela Minzner grew up with dreams of being a secretary. She believed the job would give her all the independence a woman could expect. But after interning at the Ohio Civil Rights Commission in the 1960s. Minzner decided to study law. In 1968 she graduated from Harvard Law School as 1 of 22 women in a class of 500. In 1994. she became just the second woman to serve on the New Mexico Supreme Court. and in 1999 she became the courts first female chief justice. Minzner will always be known for her integrity. She stood strong on principal when politics threatened to poison the court. She gave freely of her advice and compassion. and public officials across New Mexico regarded her as a mentor and a friend. Assistants remember leaving her chambers late at night with the judge still working. and her husband. Dick. recalls her commitment to the law and to her work. I served as New Mexicos Attorney General when Justice Minzner was on the Supreme Court. I remember her ability to inspire trust in the rule of law. Justice Minzner believed in the law as a force for progress and fairness. Through the respect she showed to every lawyer who entered her court. she showed New Mexico that the legal system can be fair and just to all sides. On behalf of New Mexico.

If he had been only a hard working and talented reporter. a reporter who was loved by his coworkers and revered by the many he mentored. he would deserve our respect. Had he been only a crusader for open government. a tireless advocate for freedom of the press and the people. he would deserve our appreciation. But Bob Johnson was all of these things: A nononsense former marine who kept people informed about their government and changed government to make it more responsive to the people. Bob Johnson wrote the Associated Press first bulletin on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. His coverage of that tragedy shaped the response of a mourning nation and quelled public panic with prompt information. As an editor. Johnson taught young reporters the ins and outs of the newspaper business. Those who worked with him remember a ball of energy who was never too busy to pass along a hardlearned lesson or counsel a colleague in need. He covered everything from the Apollo space flights to the taking of hostages at the 1972 Munich Olympics with the same diligence. precision and enthusiasm. In his \"retirement.\" Johnson founded and ran the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. With a reporters instinct for bringing public scrutiny to private places. Johnson has helped file more than 70 successful complaints under the Open Meetings Act. The organization he founded has helped the New Mexico Legislature craft laws to protect freedom of information and teach young people about their First Amendment rights. By educating and. empowering citizens around the state. the Foundation for Open Government has helped put government transparency on the public agenda in New Mexico. Thanks to Johnson. we know more about the decisions that affect our lives. Bob Johnsons life will always remind us that a commitment to truth is powerful. For his more than 60 years of dedicated work in the public interest. I wish to honor Robert H. Johnson.",

In November 2006. the New England Fishery Management Council imposed new regulations on groundfishing. known as Framework 42. Under these strict new rules. the number of days allowed to fish was effectively out in half. These hardworking fishermen dont catch twice as many fish. and they dont get paid twice as much. but they are only allowed to work half as much. This is not to suggest efforts to rebuild the fisheries are not necessary or important. they are. But we must also address the Impact of the regulations we impose. As a result of Framework 42. the States of Massachusetts. Maine. and New Hampshire are seeking the declaration of a commercial fisheries failure. The MagnusonStevens Act. which we worked so hard to reauthorize last year. allows the Secretary of Commerce to assist coastal communities hit by both natural disasters and regulatory burdens. Unfortunately. no funding has been provided in the past and there is no funding in the CJS bill for this purpose. This amendment. cosponsored by Senators GREGG. SNOWE. and COLLINS. would provide $15 million for fisheries disaster assistance. It does not dictate how or where this money would be spent. It does not interfere with the Secretarys ability to determine when fisheries failures are declared. It does ensure that fishermen and fishing communities that may be eligible for assistance under the MagnusonStevens Act have resources available. We sometimes romanticize life on a New England fishing boat. But in truth. it is a difficult and dangerous way to earn a living. The New England groundfishing industry has accepted strict limits as part of our effort to rebuild a fish population that has helped feed us for 500 years. When they shouldered this regulatory burden. Congress said that there would be help. This amendment provides the financial resources to meet this obligation.",

If we are going to submit on this bill to the Presidents figure. you can be sure there will be a motion to commit that bill. which is over the Presidents figure. and a motion to commit all of the bills which are over the Presidents figure. We might as well not even convene and act. These appropriations bills are the result of a lot of very careful thought and a lot of hard work by staff and by Senators. We have subcommittees. we have full committee work. and we present it to the body. If there are some motions to reduce it. those motions could have been made before the bill came to the floor of the Senate. We had a confrontation in 1995. where the Government was shut down. and I think a lesson was learned by both branches. I do not think that is going to recur. But at least lets try to compromise. to follow on this bill and other bills the same outline which the President has recommended. The Presidents view was we ought to negotiate and compromise on SCHIP. and that ought to be done here if we are to fulfill our constitutional responsibility for appropriations. I yield the floor.",

These Hoosiers have shown superior abilities. extraordinary work ethics. and unflappable determination in their quests to become Olympic athletes. The road to the pinnacle of athletic success has required thousands of hours of demanding training over years of preparation. yet these athletes show us that commitment to excellence truly has its rewards. For some. the spoils of their sacrifice may even come in the form of an Olympic medal. This Olympiad is the first for many of the Hoosier athletes. others have donned the colors of Team USA before. This year. Lloy Ball. a member of the U.S. mens volleyball team. will become the first male athlete from the United States to compete in four Olympic Games. Lloys incredible feat will forever be part of Indiana and Olympic sports history. and I know our entire state is immensely proud to count him among our own. As these eight athletes travel halfway around the globe to compete against the worlds finest. they will bring with them the unwavering support of their fellow Hoosiers. The people of Indiana are fortunate to have such an exceptional group representing us at the Olympic Games.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Small Marine Business and Fishing Guide Relief Act that Senator COLEMAN is introducing today. This legislation will provide muchneeded relief to charter boat captains and other operators of small marine businesses in Maine by exempting them from having to obtain a Transportation Worker Identification Credential. or TWIC. which costs $132.50 for each employee. Under current law. any individual who holds a Coast Guard license. as most charter boat captains do. must also obtain a TWIC. The purpose of the requirement was to ensure that port operators and the Coast Guard could inspect a tamperresistant identification document to verify the identity of those who have access to secure areas of ports and large vessels. Charter boat captains. however. do not have secure areas on their boats and usually do not need unescorted access to port facilities. Therefore. they have no need for a TWIC. For these small businesses. requiring them to obtain a TWIC essentially amounts to an unnecessary and costly government regulation. Many small businesses are struggling in these lean economic times. particularly with high marine fuel prices and tourists who have less to spend their discretionary income on charter tours in the Gulf of Maine. With these businesses declining profit margins. they cannot afford an additional $132 identification card for their employees. Even with this exemption. charter captains with a Coast Guard license will have undergone an extensive background check for the same crimes that are reviewed when an individual applies for a TWIC. So waiving the TWIC requirement for them would not reduce the background information available for review before these individuals are licensed as charter captains. To be sure. the Transportation Worker Identification Credential will play a critical role in our Nations maritime security by limiting access to secure areas of ports and large vessels. It must \"be implemented. however. in a manner that does not unnecessarily and unproductively impede legitimate business operations. By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. BINGAMAN):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. during the previous session I introduced legislation to address the funding of Indian water rights claims that are of utmost importance in the west. and in particular. within the State of New Mexico. Since that time many parties have met for countless hours in New Mexico and here in Washington to address how these claims could be resolved and finally settled. Rather than spend countless hours in litigation. these groups have sat down and worked through these issues in a very productive manner. As a result. today I am pleased to come before you to introduce. on behalf of myself and Senator BINGAMAN. the Aamodt and Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 2008. This legislation will resolve these longstanding Indian water rights claims within New Mexico and authorize a source of Federal funding to resolve them. The Aamodt litigation in New Mexico was filed in 1966 and is the longeststanding litigation in the Federal judiciary system. The hard work that each party put into the settlement process demonstrates that negotiated settlements. with multiple parties working together. can best determine how to allocate scarce water supplies among diverse parties in a way that does not curtail existing uses. This bill will result in additional economic development and improved health benefits within these communities. The resolution of these claims will not only improve the lives of many within these communities by providing a safe and reliable water supply. but will also improve the ability of New Mexico to effectively undertake water rights planning in the near and longterm future. As I have stated before. the costs of not settling these claims in New Mexico are dire. The legislation before us will ensure that our obligations to these communities are met and that they will have safe and reliable water systems. Mr. President.

Yet we understand that utilizing these physician hospitals. these new hospitals. saved the government money and are all about patient choice and are all about making sure that people who utilize these new hospitals dont get infections. dont get sick. dont check into a hospital to have surgery where other sick people are. It is a concept that keeps America not only the leading health care provider in the world. it is done in an efficient and costeffective way. I am surprised that we find out it is overutilization. Mr. .Speaker. rather than taking this opportunity to bring parity to our health care delivery system. the Democrat leadership today is using this legislation as a vehicle to restrict future health care choices for Medicare patients. That is what this is about. It is to further own the opportunity for Medicare patients to be able to get the choices that they want. and the Democrat leadership is taking that away. Instead of using this opportunity to focus on mental health parity. the Democrats have decided to pay for this bill by pushing patients and limiting their options that they can receive for their own care. Mr. Speaker. we will be real honest about this. According to HealthGrades. which is a nationwide study to look at hospitals and how efficient they are and how safe they are. three of the Nations top 10 cardiac programs and three of the Nations top 10 programs 54. Pt. 3 March 5. 2008 for joint replacement are at physicianowned hospitals. And despite the fact that these physicianowned hospitals make up only 3 percent of the Nations hospitals. they are among the most efficient and the safest hospitals for people. our seniors. to go in and receive care.

I submit for the RECORD the Statement of Administrative Policy on this issue and I will quote from that: \"First. the bill would place new restrictions on physicianowned hospitals. This administration opposes this provision. which is unnecessary and could restrict patient choice without decreasing Medicare costs.\" That is right. it is going to be more expensive to argue about overutilization.

It provided my constituents with a forum for important dialogue about an issue that affects millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker. anyone who has had a family member with a mental illness knows how difficult living with the disease can be for everyone involved. They also know one thing above all else: physical illness and mental illness are equally painful and equally challenging. In many ways. mental health patients suffer more because our insurance system discriminates against them. That is why this legislation is so important. because it is about people. people who struggle with mental illness every day and every night. people who suffer In silence without a doctors help because their insurance will not cover mental health or addiction treatments. This House has the chance to demonstrate its compassion and commitment to these people. Mr. Speaker. With one vote. we can put behind us the false conception that mental illness is not as serious as cancer or diabetes or many other diseases covered by health insurance plans. On the contrary. mental illnesses are some of the most serious health conditions we face. The battle against them has been enormously difficult for millions of families across our Nation. It has been tough. but this is a battle that we must win. Mr. Speaker. With mental health parity. it is a battle we can and will win. Again.

This would restrict the ability and capacity of physicianowned hospitals. It doesnt matter if the hospital is rural or in the inner city. big or small. It punishes these hospitals. In Houston. in the 18th Congressional District. it punishes St. Josephs. it punishes the Heights Hospital. and it does so without any reason.

Maintain a minimum number of physicians available at all times to provide service and provide charity care equal to at least 4 percent of its operating budget. We can put criteria on these hospitals.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been an honor for me to speak in support of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. I want to thank both Congressman KENNEDY and Congressman RAMSTAD for their dedication to ending the insurance discrimination and ensuring that all Americans have access to mental health and addiction services. As a Minnesotan. Im struck by the emotion of this day because the late Paul Wellstones tireless efforts to ensure mental health parity might finally be realized. Paul Wellstone knew it was wrong for health insurers to place discriminatory restrictions on treatments. and I am honored to be part of this effort to finally guarantee that millions of Americans who need mental health and addiction services can obtain the services they deserve. The urgent need for the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act is surely best expressed by those who have seen a loved one in need denied coverage. I think immediately of Kitty Westin. a Minnesotan whose daughter Anna suffered from anorexia. a deadly disease that affects approximately 8 million Americans and ultimately claimed Annas life. During her daughters battle with anorexia. Kitty took Anna to the hospital. Anna was refused care by the insurance company because it did not consider access to mental health treatment important enough to cover. Kitty knows this is completely unacceptable and has been fighting selflessly to make sure that no other family experiences the same frustration and pain. I commend her for carrying on Annas legacy so impressively through her advocacy efforts and community work. For Kitty and all of those who have encountered insurance discrimination. I carry Paul Wellstones message that access to mental health and addiction services is imperative and must take place now.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague from the State of Washington. and I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule. This rule gives the House no opportunity to engage in meaningful debate about this important issue. I am disappointed that the majority did not make in order a substitute amendment I cosponsored to consider the bipartisan legislation that was unanimously approved by the Senate last year. Let me be clear: I strongly support mental health parity. That is precisely why I am so concerned that the bill before us today could derail our efforts to pass mental health parity legislation altogether. While the House bill could reduce access to care for the mentally ill. decrease the affordability for health care coverage. and even close a hospital in my State. the Senate measure represents some of the very best that can come from bipartisan collaboration and compromise. It reflects the interests of mental health advocates and providers while also respecting the rights of States like Washington to enact mental health laws that go beyond the Federal standard. Mr. Speaker. I came to this House. this body. a little over 3 years ago. My previous profession was in law enforcement for 33 years. so I came here in a little bit different way than most Members of the House of Representatives. So today I make the statement not as a Republican but as a citizen of the United States of America. I am standing here today as an American saying that we need to stop the partisan bickering and we need to come together as Democrats and Republicans and we need to address this issue of not having opportunity. not having a voice. to share in the decisions that are being made in this House. It is time that we come together. The Senate bill that passed unanimously needs to be considered on the House floor.",

I am worried about what we call the payfor part of that because it would have a detrimental effect. as I mentioned. on doctorowned facilities. particularly in my district. but also in other parts of the country. Since this issue came up some 7 months ago. we discovered that there are very few doctorowned facilities that are unique in the sense of what I was talking about today. and I think my colleagues from Wisconsin and Texas talked about last night in the Rules Committee. and so I want to ask my friend from New Jersey who is the sponsor of this legislation. and I will be happy to yield to him. He talked about the issue of overutilization. Now. I simply have to bring this up because I doubt that the 150.000 patients of the Wenatchee Valley Clinic would say that they are overutilizing that clinic. I think they go there because they want to have their health needs taken care of. So I dont think that is applicable to that facility. and I mentioned that in my previous remarks. I want to ask my friend from New Jersey a question. As I mentioned. apparently there are just a few hospitals that fall in the category that I was describing. But there are bipartisan concerns about the effects of this bill on good hospitals providing quality care. I made that point. Will you work with me and other Members from both sides of the aisle to protect these hospitals and to exempt them totally from this ban on doctor ownership? I yield to my friend from New Jersey.",

The time is long past due for Congress to. once and for all. act to end discrimination against patients seeking treatment for mental illness and addiction. More than 57 million Americans suffer from mental illness and more than 26 million suffer from addiction. Unfortunately. our Nations investment in services for individuals with mental illness and addiction has not kept pace with the trend. Last year. untreated mental illness cost the U.S. economy over $150 billion. and untreated addiction cost over $400 billion. H.R. 1424 reverses this trend by guaranteeing that plans cover the same range of mental illnesses and addiction disorders offered by the Federal employee health plan that Members of Congress use. prohibiting insurers and group health plans from imposing treatment of financial limitations when they offer mental health benefits that are more restrictive from those applied to medical and surgical services. and creating medical management tools that are based on valid medical evidence and pertinent to the patients medical condition so that specific coverage is not arbitrary and is more transparent to the patient. This is a piece of legislation that is critically important to our Nation and to my constituents. Just the other day I received a letter from a Mr. Smith in my district. whose son. a 16yearold. was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Last spring Mr. Smiths son started using marijuana and used it increasingly as the months progressed in what was described as selfmedication. His grades dropped and he withdrew from his friends and showed other signs of substance abuse. When his parents placed him in an outpatient counseling facility. Mr. Smith learned. to his surprise. that the necessary treatment was not covered under his employerbased health insurance. After that counseling proved ineffective. he sent his son to a facility for inpatient treatment which cost approximately $25.000.

It is imperative we instill the need for environmental responsibility upon the next generation. and I cant think of a better place to foster a sense of environmental stewardship than in the classroom. Just this week. Congress finally debated a bill to begin reducing our dependence on foreign oil and encouraging alternative energy solutions. The repercussions of the debate we had this week will not be dealt with by us. but rather. by our children. By ignoring our environmental and energy crisis for so long. we have passed significant challenges on to the next generation to find solutions. The time to invigorate our youth to tackle these challenges is now. I have heard from teachers and school administrators throughout Connecticuts Fourth Congressional District. and from across the country. who have felt a narrowing of school curricula in the wake of No Child Left Behinds (NCLB) high stakes testing requirements. It seems to me this bill should have been considered in the context of a larger No Child Left Behind reauthorization. Unfortunately. the majority has yet to bring comprehensive reform to the floor for consideration. and I am hopeful these types of curricular enrichments remain a priority as we work towards reauthorizing this critical bill. In the absence of reauthorization efforts this Congress. I am pleased we are providing the resources school districts need to enrich their curricula and cultivate an awareness of environmental issues in our public schools. I support No Child Left Behind because it is forcing us to improve and deal with gaps in our public education. but I realize there are several improvements that need to be made in the reauthorization process. I look forward to a reauthorization of this bill that reevaluates priority curricula to ensure our students are not only achieving in the areas of math. reading. and science. but are wellprepared to engage in a 21st century. global society.",

Mr. Chairman. global warming is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing our Nation today. But. as the impact of global warming becomes more and more visible. our children are increasingly disconnected from nature and the world around them. Kids today spend less time playing outdoors than any previous generation. The Kaiser Family Foundation found kids ages 8 to 18 spend an average of 6/2 hours a day glued to the TV. playing video games. surfing the Internet. and talking on cell phones. leading to what has been called a \"nature deficit disorder\". The No Child Left Inside Act addresses critical environmental challenges by strengthening and expanding environmental education in the classroom. This bipartisan bill provides schools with more resources and teacher training for environmental education. Using environmental education in the classroom. we can transform playgrounds and parks into learning laboratories and recapture the interest and enthusiasm of students in the world around them. Not only has environmental education raised test scores in math and reading. but it has also inspired school age children to become future stewards of the Earth. Mr. Chairman.

Environmental education is so important for our students. especially with the growing crisis facing our climate. Yet across the country. these types of programs are facing cuts due to school budget woes. H.R. 3036 helps alleviate this problem by extending the National Environmental Education Act through 2009 and strengthening the Environmental Education Training program under current law. This legislation also establishes the National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program. which would authorize the Secretary of Education to award 13 year competitive grants to nonprofit organizations. state educational agencies. local education agencies. or institutions of higher education.

We also have a situation where this bill violated the paygo rules of the House and would violate the paygo rules of the Senate. to the extent they are ever enforced around here. if we had passed the Senate budget. The irony is that this bill comes to the floor before the budget. which was voted on and voted in favor of by the Democratic membership. That Democratic budget is violated in this bill. I have to tell my colleagues. if a Democratic budget. which spends a heck of a lot of money. is violated. then. obviously. the bill itself is spending a lot of money. In addition. it uses gimmicks such as custom users fees. It uses gimmicks such as this adjustment of paygo. It ends up. even using all those gimmicks. $18 billion worth of gimmicks. still with a budget point of order against it which is legitimate. The budget is violated. This bill spends money outside the budget. That budget point of order should not be waived.",

I am pleased to vote in favor of passage of the conference report. as this legislation includes a number of programs of paramount importance to the Commonwealth of Virginia. including the creation of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program to replenish the bay. Virginia. Maryland. and others in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed have worked diligently to implement programs to reduce nutrient runoff and other sources of pollution that enter the Bay. all in an effort to achieve a cleaner Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program will provide the Federal assistance necessary to support regional and State efforts to reach this important goal. In addition. this bill will enhance conservation across the United States. Its provisions. such as technical assistance and conservation easements. will help protect more land for preservation and environmental initiatives. Also. I note that provisions of this conference report provide greater research support and assistance for growers of specialty crops and significant changes to the nutrition title to promote better health for schoolchildren and increase support for our Nations food banks.

It is a good bill for Florida and I commend Chairman HARKIN. Senator CHAMBLISS. Chairman BAUCUS. Senator GRASSLEY. and the members of both committees for all of their tireless work to pass this bill. First and foremost. this bill provides a substantial increase in food assistance to our Nations lowincome families. Nearly threefourths of the total spending of the farm bill goes in fact to nutrition programs such as food stamps. now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Not only do we increase purchasing power of these benefits but we also change how a familys need may be calculated. it will take into account childcare costs and education and retirement savings. For the first time in history the farm bill also takes into account an agricultural sector that is of the utmost importance in Floridaspecialty crops. Florida is the leading producer of citrus. tomatoes. cucumbers. snap beans. bell peppers. squash and watermelon. and is the second leading producer of strawberries. sweet corn. and greenhouse and nursery products. This legislation recognizes the importance of crops such as these as an integral part of our Nations food supply. and provides nearly $3 billion in research. block grants to states. pest and disease control. farmers market promotion. and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. Of similar importance are the strides made in this bill for conservation and energy programs. Floridas natural resources stand to benefit tremendously from increased funding for conservation. which will allow the State to optimize participation in land preservation. environmentally friendly land management practices. and easement programs. Correspondingly. the bill notably encourages advancements in cellulosic energy. which will allow us to explore the production of ethanol from agricultural products that we dont otherwise eat.-products in which Florida is rich. There are many significant improvements for Florida in this conference report. It is not a perfect bill. but it increases funding and support for integral programs while also making reforms to a sometimes abused system. It is a good bill for Florida. and I encourage the President to support it.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I voted against the Senatepassed version of the farm bill because it lacked the fiscal discipline required of Congress during a time of deficit spending and exponential growth of the Federal Government. Unfortunately. the conference report is just as unacceptable as the Senatepassed version of the farm bill. As a result. I cannot support it. Congress first approved the Federal farm assistance policies in the early 1930s to help struggling farmers during times of economic hardship due to low commodity prices. Over the last six decades. however. the farm bill has swelled significantly. and now provides extensive subsidies for farmers and agricultural landowners who may not be in true financial need. The conference report continues this trend. spending approximately $730 billion over 10 years. And. as the administration correctly points out. it increases spending by approximately $20 billion over the current baseline. not $10 billion as claimed by the conferees. The roughly $10 billion difference is achieved through a number of gimmicks. including using timing shifts and funding cliffs. To make matters worse. at a time when the United States net farm income is projected to be $92.3 billion this year51 percent greater than the 10year averagethe conference report would increase subsidy rates. create additional subsidies for a number of crops. and continue direct payments regardless of crop prices. Now is not the time to maintain or increase subsidies. now is the time to reduce or eliminate them. The conference report would also continue to pay subsidies to millionaire farmers and nonfarmers. It would allow married couples who farm and have an adjusted gross income of $1.5 million to continue to receive subsidies. It would also allow married couples with an adjusted gross income of $1.000.000 who are not fulltime farmers to receive subsidies. Farm payments should go only to those who actually need them. not to some of the wealthiest individuals in the country. Congress could use the farm bill to make substantive reforms and cut federal spending. Instead. it appears that Congress will pass a bloated farm bill that is just another example of a broken and mismanaged Congress. Consequently. I cannot support it and urge my colleagues to also oppose the bill.",

I bought a $5 box of corn flakes. I think I had to pay a little bit more because I bought it on the Hill. But the family farmers share of that $5 box of corn flakesand it happened to be a little bigger box than normalwas about less than 10 cents. I think the real figure is about 8 cents. That is what the farmer gets out of a box of corn flakes. Yet the farmer is being blamed for the high price of food because we grow some corn to make ethanol because the American people. 30 years ago. were demanding that we go to a renewable. cleanburning fuel instead of depending upon dirtyburning petroleum. putting more CO2 into the air. The value of corn in a pound of beef or pork is about 20 or 30 cents. Yet some have suggested we should suspend our policies that promote the use of renewable fuels to help drive down food prices. If all the evidence suggests that biofuels have little. If any. impact on the rising cost of food. what good can come from lifting our biofuels policies? If people look at the facts. how can a public relations firm of former Clinton employees get a $300.000 contract from a very respectable organization such as the Grocery Manufacturers of America. whose Members need an excuse to raise the price of food? How do they get away with it? Well. they get away with it because nobody is looking at the facts. I was pleased to join 15 of my colleagues in signing a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency. expressing our opposition to this misguided idea. We had about that same number of Senators in this bodysome of them even voting for ethanol in the past yearssending a letter down to the same EPA. saying we have to stop ethanol. probably some of the very same people who are complaining about the dirty air we have or the global warming.

    "speech": "Madam President. 2 years ago. Democrats campaigned on tax relief for middleclass families. They called for fiscal restraint and lowering the national debt. But as we have seen over the last year. our good friends are more concerned with increasing taxation. increasing regulation. and increasing litigation. The budget they unveiled this year is the latest example. If we were to follow this budget. it would go a long way toward turning us into a country like France. at a time when even the French. as we all know. are trying to pull back and trying to get out of the ditch into which they have put themselves. This budget lifts the curtain on what they have in store for Americas already overburdened taxpayers. Instead of lowering taxes on Americas working families and small businesses. this budget contains the largest tax hike in U.S. history. It is not just the rich who would see their tax bills increase by an average of $2.300 a year. it is taxpayers making as little as $31.850. and couples earning $63.700. These are families the Democrats are calling rich and on whom they want to raise taxes. Under this budget. every American would see his or her share of the national debt rise by $6.440 as a result of dramatically higher spending requests. At a time when American families are tightening their belts and checking their own spending habits. Washington should be doing the same. Yet they are proposing the opposite. At a time of serious economic concern. they want to grow the Federal budget to over $1 trillion in nonemergency spending. We have heard a lot of talk over the last few months from the other side about how middleclass families are struggling to make ends meet. We even worked together to pass a stimulus package that puts money back in the wallets of middleclass families. But now our good friends on the other side want to take that money backand then someto fund their irresponsible spending hikes. Lets be clear about what this budget is: It is the Democrats way of saying yes to the failed taxandspend policies of the past. American families cannot afford this budget. American job creators cannot afford- this budget. and neither can our economy. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

During the 1940s he served as a union leader at the Studebaker Corporation which led him to a new career as advocate for the unemployed. the elderly and the underserved. He became director of Project ABLE in 1963 after the closing of the Studebaker plant. the largest employer in South Bend at the time. The experimental project developed and implemented a network of services for the many unemployed older workers left in the wake of this economic disaster. With the newly created \"War on Poverty\" in 1965. Fox established the Regional Office o Economic Opportunity in Atlanta. Georgia. implementing the Economic Opportunity Act in six southeastern states over a two year period. Fox returned to South Bend to become President and CEO of REAL Services. Inc.. an organization that assesses the status and needs of the older adult population in Saint Joseph County. The agencys role was broadened twice. once to include the area Agency on Aging in five North Central Indiana counties. administering the Older Americans Act and legislation related to the aged and disabled. and again in 1990. to manage the Community Action Agency serving lowincome families. Lester Fox has been awarded the Sagamore of the Wabash. the highest honor bestowed by governors of Indiana. on four separate occasions by four different govemors. In 1996. Les was inducted into the South Bend Community Hall of Fame. Fox has served on numerous boards. has been a member of the White House Conference on Aging. and was a Consultant to the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging. So. today. on behalf of the citizens of northern Indiana. I thank Les Fox for his years of unselfish dedication. As he retires from 40 years as President of REAL Services.

At the outset. it must be emphasized that there is unanimity that no preceptive action be taken by Congress to exercise our \"power of the purse\" to cut off funds that would in any way endanger our troops. In response to the majority leaders use of the Senate rule to \"fill the tree.\" which precludes any Republican alternative resolutions. I voted against cloture to cut off debate on the Levin amendment on February 5. The procedure to \"fill the tree\" is contrary to the basic Senate practice of allowing Senators to offer amendments or alternative resolutions. unlike the House of Representatives. which customarily precludes such latitude. On February 14. I introduced an amendment to rule XXII to stop the \"filling of the tree.\" citing vociferous objections by Senators REID. DURBIN and DODD to similar Republican action in the 109th Congress when Republicans held a majority. Although it is very important for the minority to exercise its rights to stop abusive majority practices. it is my judgment that this must yield to the dominant principle of debating and voting on the future of U.S. policy in Iraq. Lets move on. We Republicans can exercise our rights of retaliation in the immediate future on other majority action to reign in such majority abuse. In my view. it is most important that the Senate speak out on Iraq. If we continue to debate whether there should be a debate while the House of Representatives acts. the Senate will become irrelevant. To paraphrase the Roman adage: \"The Senate should not fiddle while Iraq Burns.\" The American people have a right to know the Senates judgment on this most important issue of the day. and our constituents have a right to know and evaluate the judgment of each Senator.

He outlined a new military strategy that was devised after consultation with military commanders. national security leaders. and Members of Congress from both parties. He told us he had committed more than 20.000 additional troops to Iraq to clear and secure the city of Baghdad and to protect its population. As we meet today. the first of five waves of soldiers are carrying out this plan on the streets and in the alleys of Baghdad. the second is preparing to leave. These reinforcements have already given us reasons for hope. Soon after the Presidents announcement. U.S. Iraqi forces began to route key elements of the Mahdi army. the militias leader fled his stronghold. and this week U.S. Iraqi forces have conducted sweeps through once violent Sunni neighborhoods with little resistance. It is too early to say whether the surge will achieve its objective. but",

We insist. however. on having the debate in the Senate in the way debates are always carried out in the Senate. in a fair and evenhanded way. Our good friends on the other side of the aisle initially supported the Biden proposal. which came out of the Foreign Relations Committee. When that appeared not to have enough support. they adopted the WarnerLevin proposal. When that appeared to be inconvenient. they switched again and now support. I guess. what best can be called the PelosiReid proposal. which they are attempting to get before the Senate today. All along the way. for the last few weeks. Senate Republicans have been 53. Pt. 4 February 17. 2007 consistent in asking for a fair debate. and a fair debate includes. at the very least. one alternative supported by a majority of Senate Republicans. The one alternative we settled on was Senator GREGGS proposal to guarantee that we support funding for the troops. This fundamental unfairness and unwillingness to allow the Senate to vote on arguably the most significant issue confronting the troop surge. which is whether it is going to be funded. is the reason this stalemate has occurred. I am optimistic. and I certainly hope that Senate Republicans will continue to insist on fair treatment in debating what is clearly. unambiguously. the most important issue confronting the country today.

There are challenges facing America today. but there is no greater challenge facing America today than finding a new direction in Iraq. Every Senator in this Chamber has a responsibility and an obligation to say whether they support or oppose the Presidents plan to escalate the war. Yesterday the House of Representatives acted. 246 to 180. no escalation. Now it is the turn of this body. the Senate. to give advice to the President that he is wrong in sending tens of thousands more American soldiers to a civil war in far away Iraq. In a few moments. a vote will occur on a straightforward resolution which simply states that we support our troops and oppose escalation of the intractable Iraq war. My colleagues on the other side of this Senate Chamber. colleagues who blocked an Iraq debate last week. have a choice to make. Do they intend to join the American people in opposing more of the same in Iraq or do they intend to continue to give the President a green light to escalate the war? Let the debate proceed. Let the Senate express its views on the issue of our time. This month. the Iraq war has cost the lives of three American soldiers every day. putting us on pace for the bloodiest February since the war began. It is threatening our Nations strategic interests and risking our Nations security. Today. America has lost 3.133 soldiers in the streets and highways of a place called Iraq.",

    "speech": "I want to take a minute to read a couple of statements in the letter. The PWG refers to the bill. talks a little bit about what it will do. and then it says: ... the PWG believes that [the] bill S. 3268. as introduced. would significantly harm U.S. energy markets without evidence that it would lower crude oil prices. It goes on to say: To date. the PWG has not found valid evidence to suggest that high crude oil prices over the long term are a direct result of speculation or systematic market manipulation by traders. Rather. prices appear to be reflecting tight global supplies and the growing world demand for oil. particularly in emerging economies. As a result. Congress should proceed cautiously before drastically changing the regulation of the energy markets. This mirrors exactly my concern about this particular piece of legislation. If we have a kneejerk reaction to the issue of speculation in the markets. and we are wrong. what we are going to do is we are not only going to destroy the energy markets in this country. but we are going to take those legitimate operators. those legitimate investors in the energy markets. and we are going to drive them overseas. We are going to have no control whatsoever over their buying and selling of contracts. whether it be oil. and the next thing we know it will be other food products that are dealt with in the commodity world on a daily basis. So I think we need to listen to the experts. We need to make sure we take the time to develop the right kind of policy. with the right kind of expert information. having input into the legislation. whatever it may be. At the right time. lets have a bill on the floor that encompasses not only the energy markets themselves and any type of additional restrictions or regulations we need to put there. particularly from a transparency standpoint. but also we need to deal with the overall issues of additional domestic exploration. We need to deal with the issue of conservation. whether it be through lessening the use of gasoline. diesel. or whatever.",

To conform to new government spelling regulations the name was changed to Churchs Ferry on November 30. 1894. Although its population is small. Churchs Ferry serves as a testament to hard work and determination. Even after a Federal buyout in 2000 relocated many residents of Churchs Ferry from the rising flood waters of Devils Lake. some residents remained. These 10 residents have persevered and worked extremely hard to keep Churchs Ferry alive. Paul Christenson is the mayor. mechanic. and mower of the communitys 30 acres of grass and takes great pride in keeping Churchs Ferry beautiful. Two new businesses have opened. including Gardendwellers Farm. which grows custom crops for wineries and restaurants and offers horticulture tours and workshops. and Waters Edge Dog Boarding kennel.

The Brower Palisade Designation Act renames the North Palisadea prominent peak in the Sierra Nevada\"Brower Palisade\" in his honor. David Brower dedicated his life to environmental advocacy and helped shape the conservation movement in California and across the Nation. His efforts raised public awareness about the environment and the need to preserve our resources for future generations. Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall once referred to David Brower as the \"giant of 20th Century conservation in the United States.\" In 1952. David Brower was named the first executive director of the Sierra Club. one of the most prominent environmental and conservation organizations in the U.S. He held this position for nearly 2 decades. David Browers leadership led to the creation of many units of the National Park System. including North Cascades National Park. Redwood National Park and Point Reyes National Seashore. He also played a significant role in helping to draft the Wilderness Act. which has preserved much of the Sierra Nevada. including his favorite group peaks. the Palisades. Renaming the North Palisade peak \"Brower Palisade\" will be a lasting reminder of David Browers leadership and invaluable contributions to the environmental community for generations to come.

The trade policies set in Washington. and negotiated across the globe. have a direct impact on places such as Lima and Steubenville and Cleveland and Hamilton. OH. That is why voters in my State and across the country sent a message loud and clear in November demanding a different trade policy. a new direction in our trade relations. A new report this month from the Center for Economic and Policy Research says jobs paying at least $17 an hourroughly $35.000 a yearand provide health insurance and provide some form of pension declined by 3.5 million people between 2000 and 2006. If that doesnt underscore and emphasize the decline of the middle class. no statistic does. Working men and women in Ohio know that job lossa job paying $35.000 or $40.000 or $45.000 or $50.000 a yeardoes not just affect the worker or the workers families. as tragic as that is. job lossespecially job losses in the thousandscan devastate communities. Peru and proposed deals with Colombia. Panama. and South Korea are based on the North American Free Trade Agreement. the socalled NAFTA model. NAFTAs proponents promised the agreement would create new jobs from exports and that U.S. exports to Mexico would exceed Mexican imports by some $10 billion. NAFTA supporters also promised it would end our immigration issue or problem. More on that at another time. Today. imports from Mexico exceed exports by about $70 billion. Instead of a multibillion dollar trade surplus with Mexico. as NAFTA supporters promised. it has gone the other way manyfold. with a $70 billion deficit. When I was elected to Congress in 1992. the U.S. trade deficit was $39 billion. Today. after NAFTA. CAFTA. the Central American Free Trade Agreement. and after inclusion in the World Trade Organization. our trade deficit has grown to over $800 billion. It went from $39 billion in 1992 to. a decade and a half later. $800 billion. which is an increase of twentyfold. What NAFTA is. and what that model of trade is. is simple: A mechanism providing a source of cheap labor for multinational firms.",

DC. there is a sign that says: \"No Farms. No Food.\" It is important for all of us in this Chamber to recognize the importance of the food security of the United States of America by moving forward with the passage of the 2007 farm bill. As the Presiding Officer well knows. the Agriculture Committee. under the leadership of Senator HARKIN and Senator CHAIMBLISS. worked very hardworked for weeks and weeks and months and monthsto come up with what is a very good farm bill. It is a very good farm bill that invests in the nutritional needs of our country. It is a very good farm bill that helps us unveil the clean energy future of America and helps us grow our way to energy independence. It is a very good farm bill that invests such as no other farm bill ever has in the conservation opportunities we need to protect our land and our water in America. It is a very good farm bill in all respects. and it is paid for. It is a farm bill that Is paid for. We have been on this farm bill now in the Senate for the last several weeks. since before Thanksgiving. and have not been able to move ahead. The majority leader. Senator REID. has propounded a proposal where we would move forward with a set of discrete amendments. giving the Republicans 10 amendments. having the Democrats have 5 amendments and 2 additional amendments would be considered. It seems to me that is a very eminently fair proposal. and I would ask my colleagues. both on the Democratic side and the Republican side. to stand behind that procedural framework so we can get onto the farm bill and get this farm bill across the finish line. It is my view the people of America deserve no less from this Senate. and I am very hopeful we will be able to come to that agreement very soon.",

I am supporting the Peru FTA because it is a new model for trade agreements that includes enforceable labor and environmental protections. For the first time. the U.S. will have the right to hold a trading partner accountable if labor or environmental issues become a problem. The Peru FTA benefits Wisconsin companies and workers. Wisconsin exports to Peru have increased from $9.3 million in 2002 to $43.5 million in 2006. This agreement will help trade between the U.S. and Peru flourish and keep businesses and jobs in Wisconsin. something I couldnt say about several previous trade agreements. Further. the Peru FTA eliminates the current 10 percent tariff on U.S. goods entering Peru. This will remove barriers to Wisconsin exports and make Wisconsin businesses even more competitive. The Peru FTA is the first step in a new direction for trade policy that will enforce labor and environmental standards and help U.S. businesses gain access to new markets.",

I opposed this agreement when it came before the Senate Finance Committee because it lacked enforceable labor standardsstandards that Perus President Alejandro Toledo indicated a willingness to support. What a difference a year makes. As a result of a landmark bipartisan agreement reached in May of this year. and for the first time ever in a free trade agreement. our agreement with Peru encompasses meaningful and enforceable labor and environmental protections. The labor chapter of the agreement requires both the United States and Peru to adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the five core standards incorporated in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work: (1) the right to organize. (2) the right to bargain collectively. (3) prohibitions on forced labor. (4) protections for child labor. and (5) freedom from employment discrimination. The environmental chapter requires both the United States and Peru to adopt and maintain domestic laws to implement the obligations in seven multilateral environmental agreements to which both the United States and Peru are parties. I have long championed the inclusion of enforceable labor and environmental standards in free trade agreements. and I supported the agreement today because of these chapters. It is imperative that our trading partners be held to high labor and environmental standards. and I would not stand in support of this agreement had these provisions not been included. The Peru Free Trade Agreement is a landmark achievement that makes these provisions fully enforceablesubjecting these provisions to the same dispute resolution system that applies to the commercial provisions of the agreement. I urge the President. along with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. to hold Perus government accountable to these provisions. By ensuring that these standards are fully enforced. the President can solidify this agreement with Peru as a model for dealing with future trading partners.",

I am going to present a unanimous consent agreement based on a very simple proposition: Our time is running short. therefore. we should start the debate with the areas of broadest agreement and work from there. So what can we all agree upon? We agree it is past time for Congress to act to ensure that 23 million American families do not face a major tax increase this year. While my side of the aisle believes we should permanently repeal the AMT. we are also prepared to ensure that middleincome Americans get tax relief this year. We agree tax extenders are important to small business. to parents paying college tuition for their children. to teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money. These issues are not controversial. and I believe a majority of the Senate supports them. However. there is an area of strong disagreement. We disagree with the proposition that taxes must be permanently raised in order to extend current tax policy. By patching the AMT and extending other expiring provisions. we are simply maintaining the status quo on tax policy. Why should some taxpayers be harmed when no single taxpayer will enjoy increased benefits? So I recommend that we begin where there is a consensusthe AMT patch and tax extenders. We should require the controversial provisions. those raising revenues. be subject to 60 votes. In addition. my side of the aisle would like an opportunity for votes on our vision for tax relief and AMT reform. all of which we understand would be subject to 60 votes. Anything left at the end of the process would also be subject to 60 votes. This would be a fair process for the short amount of time we have been given on this bill. Lets not tie up the Senate over disagreements. rather. we should build from areas of broadest consensus.

Due to these and other accomplishments. the school has experienced the most growth in National Institute ot Health funding o1 any institution. and the number of endowed chairs at the University has more than doubled.

The Universitys commitment to the betterment ot our community manifests itself in every facet o1 Louisville life. from its alliance .with Project Women to its work with Partnership for a Green City to the new Signature Partnership Initiative. which will provide resources to areas of the city that need them most. The landmark Cardinal Covenant program. which made UofL_ the first public higher learning institution in Kentucky to promise a debtfree education to students from lowincome tamilies. reaffirms a commitment that I share with the University: providing a worldclass education to all capable. hardworking students. Though the recent achievements are astounding. President James Ramsey continues to set goals for the future that are loftier still. Under the leadership of Dr. Ramsey. the pursuit of excellence can be seen each day in the students. faculty. administration. and alumni and the competence with which they chart the schools course guarantees many more milestones in the coming years.

This bill would invest in the research still necessary to determine the potential links between breast cancer and the environment. so that we can cure it and eventually eradicate this terrible disease. Currently. despite the efforts of numerous researchers. less than 30 percent of breast cancers are explained by known risk factors. Though studies have explored the effect of isolated environmental factors. including diet. pesticides. and electromagnetic fields. there is little conclusive evidence or consensus in the scientific community on how the environment impacts breast cancer. Scientists have also proposed a number of other potential factors which have yet to be formally studied. Though many experts accept that the environment plays some role in the development of breast cancer. the extent of that role has not been determined. More research is needed to determine the precise impact of the environment on this disease. This bill authorizes a research program at the National Institutes of Health to do just this. Madam Speaker. I am extremely proud to stand as one of well over 150 cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation. Because we dont know what causes breast cancer. or how to prevent it. as our Nations leaders we have a duty to the American public to support legislation that will aid in the fight to understand and combat this devastating disease. I thank all of my colleagues who have already signed on to this bill. and I urge those who have not to. in honor of Mothers Day. join me in addressing this vital womens health concern.",

It is therefore reassuring to see area youth stepping up to help each other avoid the mistakes too many have made. The members of the Upper Bucks Healthy Communities Healthy Youth Coalition have taken it upon themselves work against teen substance and alcohol abuse. The success of their marketing campaigns speaks for itself. Madam Speaker. they can claim credit for 15 percent reduction in tobacco use among high school seniors. a 5 percent decrease in alcohol use among high school sophomores and a 44 percent decline in tobacco use among eighthgraders. These numbers demonstrate the effectiveness of the teentoteen strategy that they have implemented to protect their peersour children. The students in the Coalition began the school year passing out thousands of small buttons with the letters 0MGa common teenage online abbreviation. Next. they distributed hundreds of fshirts and decals saying \"2oufta3.\" Finally. they handed out more than 1.100 fshirts and 5.000 wrist bands reading \"2outta3 dont drink.\" completing the message that twooutofthree Upper Bucks teenagers dont drink. The Coalition members have also enlisted local sports Coaches to train them to focus on the incorporation of youth development strategies into Coaching. Local businesses are also joining the fight. The area Burger King franchise and other local stores have raised millions of dollars in support of Project CARE. which trains adults working with young people and awards highereducation scholarships to students formerly with alcohol. drug. or mental health problems. I am not the first to recognize their great work. The White House National Drug Control Strategy cited the Coalition as an example for groups across the United States to follow. Madam Speaker. these students have demonstrated great initiative in working to help their peers. On behalf of the entire 8th District of Pennsylvania. I would like to congratulate them for their efforts and their success. and urge others to use these remarkable young people as an example for true community service.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2560. Mr. Speaker. I am a fervent supporter of the promise and optimism of embryonic stem cell research. As the father of a child who suffers from juvenile diabetes. I know full well the importance of stem cell research in developing a cure for life threatening diseases. For millions of Americans like my son. stem cell research represents promising hope of a cure within their lifetime. Unfortunately. many Americans confuse embryonic stem cell research as human cloning. a practice which I adamantly oppose. While technological advances continue to give scientists opportunities to explore beyond our horizons. we have an obligation to pursue our goals responsibly. The pursuit of science cannot go unchecked. occasionally. Congress must intervene. The artificial creation of human life through cloning challenges the ethical foundations of this Nation. The development o1 human life is a natural process that cannot be replaced by scientists in a laboratory. I cannot in good conscience support a world where the chance and wonder of the birth of a child is eliminated in favor of a cold. sterile process. Embryonic stem cell research differs trom cloning by developing embryos that might otherwise be destroyed for specific functions. The goal of this practice is not to create new human life. but rather to sustain existing human life by replacing failing parts of the human anatomy. I will always support saving an American life. I cannot support artificially engineering one. The importance of this distinction is critical. I hope that my colleagues in the House will join me in educating the public on the differences between these practices.",

It is because of the need to protect that right to life that I oppose this bill. Misnamed \"The Human Cloning and Prohibition Act.\" H.R. 2560 purports to ban human cloning. I wholeheartedly agree that human cloning should be outlawed. Yet the term \"cloning\" in this bill does not refer. as it normally does. to the simple act of creating a viable human embryo. Here the word cloning refers only to the implanting of a cloned embryo in a uterus and not to anything that precedes implantation. This bill is silent about and so condones the experimentation upon and destruction of human embryos prior to implantation. Even prior to implantation a human embryo has the entire genetic makeup of a new human being and is worthy of protection. Those of us who seek to defend life at all stages have long argued that embryonic research would initiate a downward spiral for the sanctity of human life in this country. The government of the greatest nation in the world cannot treat human life as an expendable resource and allow taking the life of its most vulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to support Representative WELDONs ethical and moral alternative. H.R. 2564. of which I am a cosponsor.",

I rise in support of H.R. 2560 the \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act.\" This legislation prohibits human cloning. and it makes it unlawful for any person to ship. mail. transport. or receive the product of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology knowing that it will be used for human cloning. H.R. 2650 also makes it illegal for any person to initiate a pregnancy to facilitate human cloning. Mr. Speaker. by a wide margin Americans believe that human cloning is wrong and immoral. It is also highly inefficient. More than 90% of cloning attempts fail to produce viable offspring. In addition to low success rates. cloned animals tend to have compromised immune system and higher rates of infections. tumors. and other disorders. Studies conducted in Japan show that cloned mice live in poor health and die early. About a third of the cloned calves bomn alive have died young. and many of them were abnormally large. The American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Association for the Advancement ot Science (AAAS) have issued formal public statements advising against human reproductive cloning. Mr. Speaker. I support H.R. 2560 because it reinforces the views and values of the American people. Human beings should be born. not cloned. Bringing a child into this world should be a consecrated act of grace. not a clinical or commercial enterprise. It is one thing to conduct research to find lifesaving cures. It is quite another to try and create life in the laboratory. I support the former and oppose the latter. For these reasons. I support H.R. 2560 and urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.",

We need to build upon a solid foundation that has been laid. and Id just like to briefly cite what I think the need for this legislation is. Others have alluded to it as well. but the fact is that remnants of the Taliban regime have regrouped and are using increasingly deadly tactics. including the introduction of suicide bombings against both U.S. and NATO troops. Afghan officials and civilians and international and Afghan assistance workers. Also. the poppy cultivation and opium production which directly support local warlords and sustain and finance insurgents. militias and terrorist organizations is increasing at a staggering rate. Indeed. the narcotics problem In Afghanistan threatens to overwhelm the entire country. More than 500.000 laborers and an unknown number of traffickers. warlords. insurgents and officials also participate in and benefit from the drug trade. The risk for Afghanistan to again devolve into a failed state is increasing. The ability of the Taliban and other insurgents to enjoy safe haven in Pakistancontrolled areas destabilizes the region and adds to the political tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Im very encouraged to see that this legislation establishes the means for developing a longoverdue and coherent interdepartmental counternarcotics strategy that addresses a deadly and neglected illicit drug trade and its links to radical Islamist terrorism. Mr. Chairman. for all of these reasons. I endorse this bill and encourage our Members to support it and pray that it may further strengthen our efforts to bring stability and peace to that vital region of the world.",

I was in Afghanistan with a congressional delegation from the Armed Services Committee and had the opportunity to see firsthand both the progress and challenges that face the people of Afghanistan. It is a land of contrasts. On the upside there is a healthy political life. President Karzai. who met with our delegation. is clearly a dynamic. moderate. engaged leader who has a national government which is clearly focused on trying to move the country forward. There are clear signs of economic life. The shops were open. There was traffic. Schools were being built. Roads are being constructed. 16 percent growth of GDP over the last couple of years and a clear commitment to strengthening and building the Afghan army and police. In fact. our delegation was present at a graduation ceremony for the Afghan national police and handed out the diplomas to the young cadets who were taking on these important critical duties to Afghanistans future. There clearly are challenges. however. The reappearance of the narcotics trade:. the resurgence of the Taliban. and the challenges in the border areas of Pakistan. which our military are fighting very bravely every day. Seven soldiers lost their lives the day that we were there because of the struggle that is still going on with the Taliban. What is clearly needed. and this bill addresses it. is a strong. longterm commitment by this country to continue the efforts that have been made with our international allies. NATO allies. who were present also during our trip. French Marines. Scandinavian troops. Germans who are taking responsibility for control of some of the PRTs in the different provinces. And. clearly. lastly. most importantly. is the economic aid that is so critical to defeating the rise of the narcotics trade and defeating the Talihan. As one of the generals stated to us. where the roads end. the Taliban begins in Afghanistan. Flying from Kabul to Jalalabad. we actually tracked a new road which was constructed by Chinese contractors that had heavy truck traffic and again showed that there were real opportunities in growth in that area which this bill will continue to build upon. and I applaud the chairman for his efforts and urge its unanimous passage.",

Reauthorization of this bill is crucial ensuring that Afghanistan continues to strengthen its government and that its people start to feel safe and secure in a nation that has been riddled with so much violence and terrorism. H.R. 2446 also makes some important enhancements to the original Act by dealing with a rising narcotics problem related to heroine and poppy production that is threatening to endanger Afghanistans security. H.R. 2446 also takes a strong step towards building international diplomacy and shared responsibility in the region with our allies. The Act expresses the sense of Congress that greater humanitarian assistance is needed in the country for civilians. that the United Nations should play a larger role in assisting the people of Afghanistan and also provides means to train military from foreign countries to share responsibility in Afghanistan. We also set strong benchmarks for accountability in the region by requiring more reporting. a better overall strategy for Afghanistan. and by pursuing policies that foster regional cooperation.

It must go through an exhaustive application process that determines if a gaming establishment on newly acquired land will be in the best interest of the tribe and its members. and not detrimental to the surrounding community. Additionally. the Department is cur.rently drafting regulations that will implement section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by articulating standards that the Department will follow in interpreting the various exceptions to the gaming prohibition on afteracquired trust lands. We need to let that process go forward. Even if the Department approves a tribes request. the Governor of the State must also agree. To interfere with this process circumvents the Gaming Regulatory Act. interferes with an established process in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and should not be included in an appropriations bill. And I want to say that again. This should be in an authorization bill. And if the gentleman is concerned. take it to the Natural Resources Committee or the committee of jurisdiction. Thats where this should be worked out. not here on this appropriations bill.",

Last session. we attempted to deal with this in a bill that would restrict offsite. Offreservation tribal gambling was defeated. I think we need to try this again. The regulations that were mentioned are simply weak and not meaningful enough. in my view. and I think we need the proposed regulations. I would strongly urge that Congress reassert itself and take control over this issue. I dont believe that the authors of the Indian Gaming Act of 1988 intended that we would have a situation in this country today where 29 States would now have casinos. 406 tribal casinos in 29 States. I dont think that was the intent. I havent met anybody who voted for that law who thought that was what they were voting for at the time. but that is what we have now. In my district. there has been great hardship. I mean. a 1737 land conveyance. a 1737 land conveyance. going back to William Penn and the Walking Purchase.

Yet with the economic anxiety gripping this country. it is just astounding to me that it took so long to bring a clean AMT bill to the floor.

I will vote for this bill today. without enthusiasm but with determination to continue working for greater fiscal responsibility when the House reconvenes next year.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise to urge the House to defeat the rule as well as the AMT fix bill. Legislation before us violates the promises we made to American people in January. We knew in January that complying with PAYGO would not be easy. but up until today. weve fulfilled our commitment. In passing this legislation. we are merely again borrowing from China to pay for a shortterm fix that needs a longterm solution. This administration has run up $5.6 trillion in debt over the last 6 years of irresponsible fiscal policy. How much debt passed on to our children is enough? Enough is enough. December 19. 2007 CONGRE PAYGO was to be one of the most important reforms we pledged. and today we are now becoming part of that problem by adding to the already $30.000 in federal debt for every man. woman and child in our country. For decades. Republicans have preached the gospel of fiscal discipline and balanced budgets. When and how has that notion gotten lost? We should stay here until New Years if we have to in order to find a way to offset the less revenue that will be going to the Treasury. I support fixing the AMT problem. both in the short run and long term. but the issue is whether we are responsible or irresponsible legislators.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally enacted in 1969 to ensure that the wealthiest Americans paid at least some income taxeslike everybody else. Before the AMT. the richest Americans could unfairly dodge their taxes by using deductions to sidestep their social obligations. However. what began at the end of the Johnson administration as an attempt to guarantee that the top few hundred Americans pay their fair share of taxeshas not been indexed for inflation and as a result has slowly morphed into a middleclass tax hike. More families in Central New Jersey are affected by the AMT than anywhere else in the country. Currently 33.292 of my constituents are hit by the AMT and this number will increase to 121.503 if we do not take action today. Madam Speaker. I believe that this bill should have been paid for. I voted twice now for appropriate offsets to ensure that we keep our promise to the American people that we will not continue to spend money that this Congress does not have. We can not continue to borrow money from China and other countries in order to pay for the choices we make today. It is our children and grandchildren that will be forced to pay this debt around the world. Unfortunately President Bush and the Republicans in the Senate refuse to worry about the costs of this bill and the effect it will have on the next generation. I will continue to support my colleagues in making sure increase in spending or cuts in taxes are paid for and that next year we find an offset so that we do not pass this debt to the future generations. However. with the prospect of having an additional 88.211 of my constituents pay the AMT. I believe we must move today to enact an AMT fix. We cannot make the middle class pay for the failures of the administration. I urge all my colleagues to support this important tax reform that will help middle class families from unfair tax burden.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of the Temporary Tax Relief Act . which will provide tax relief for hardworking. middleclass Americans. However. while I strongly support shielding these taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax. I am deeply disappointed that our efforts to pay for this fix now. rather than charging it to future generations. have been blocked. Congress first enacted the alternative minimum tax (AMT) in 1969 to ensure that 155 wealthy taxpayers paid their fair share of the federal income tax. But because the tax was not indexed for inflation. it has since become outdated and unfair. Without a fix. this year over 23 million Americansand 75.000 Rhode Islanderswould be forced to pay nearly $2.000 in additional taxes to which they were never intended to be subjected. Todays bill will provide a oneyear patch to prevent these middleclass Americans from being caught in the ever wideningnet of the AMT. While everyone agrees that AMT relief must be passed swiftly. I am concerned with the circumstances under which this bill is being considered. Just two months ago the House of Representatives passed a fiscally responsible measure that fully complied with payasyougo (PAYGO) rules. In fact. I was proud to vote twice for legislation that provided for the necessary AMT relief and was fully paid for. Unfortunately. Republican obstructionism has forced us to consider a measure that will add $50 billion to the national debt. Fixing the AMT is important. and taxpayers should not suffer the consequences of political games. What saddens me is that there was an easy way to accomplish this goal without adding to the deficit. and we chose to ignore it. I am also disappointed that this measure provides only temporary relief rather than presenting a longterm sustainable solution. We must develop a more permanent and fiscally responsible solution to the AMT. as it will continue to affect an increasing number of taxpayers in future years. I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL for his leadership in bringing this measure to the floor. and for his valiant efforts to follow a more fiscally responsible course. I am hopeful that as we continue to debate national tax policy. we will develop permanent solution to the AMT issue which does not place the burden of paying for it on our future generations.",

ME. on the occasion of its 20th anniversary and to recognize the tremendous talent and innovative environmental stewardship of its owners. awardwinning chefs Mark Gaier and Clark Frasier. Quite simply. Arrows is one of Americas great restaurants. It has received recognition from national publications such as Gourmet magazine. which ranked it 14th on its list of \"Americas Top 50 Restaurants in 2006.\" and Bon Appetit. which named Arrows \"one of the countrys 10 most romantic restaurants.\" Arrows has also received some of the highest and most consistent ratings in the annual Zagat survey. In addition. 54. Pt. 10 13611 Mr. Gaier and Mr. Frasier were nominated as Best Chefs in the Northeast by the James Beard Foundation. a national organization whose annual awards have been deemed the \"Oscars of the food world\" by Time magazine. Arrows has further distinguished itself by its extraordinary garden. which offers more than 300 varieties of herbs. flowers. fruits. and vegetables. It provides Mr. Gaier and Mr. Frasier with the source of most of the ingredients for their menu and serves as a wonderful illustration of how sensitive environmental stewardship and entrepreneurial spirit can go handinhand. It should come as no surprise that Arrows has been featured on television programs such as PBSs \"Victory Garden.\" and NBCs \"Today Show.\" Like the restaurant. the garden has received tremendous acclaim in the press. Bon App6tit noted that \"[Arrows] helped pioneer the idea of growing your own food and paying attention to whats seasonal in a place that is unforgiving in its climate.\" Earlier this year. the Daily Greena Web site that reports on the environmental concerns of everyday Americanspraised Mr. Gaier and Mr. Frasier as \" . . . stalwart forerunners of the sustainable movement.\" As ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I am eminently proud of all of Maines small firms. and am particularly impressed by Mr. Gaiers and Mr. Frasiers dedication to making Arrows the premier dining establishment that it has become. These two restaurateurs have helped transform American cuisine. and have brought the world to Maineas well as Maine to the world. They are truly deserving of our admiration and praise. and I wish them well in all that they do.*",

    "speech": "for their outstanding cooperation in this regard. Today is Constitution Day. Over 200 years ago. the Constitution of our country was ratified. As majestic a document as it is. it has been an imperfect delivery and realization of that document because. over time. people have been left out of its benefits and privileges. Throughout our history. people with a disability have been among those left out of the many privileges of governments and economy in our country. In 1990. the Congress. under the first President Bush. took a major step forward in remedying that injustice and discrimination. But sadly. since 1990. erroneous court decisions have stripped persons with a disability of the rights that they thought they had under that 1990 law. Today we are working together to remedy that problem and fix it. This is a victory for common sense and for merit over ignorance and obliviousness. More importantly. its a victory for human beings who will be very profoundly helped by this law. There was a man who got a job with a major retail corporation in this country. and hes diabetic. When he first started work. his supervisor understood that for this worker to be productive. he needed a special lunch break in the middle of his work day so he could deal with his blood sugar needs and stay healthy and be productive. So the man gets a new supervisor. The new supervisor comes in and doesnt understand that need. doesnt permit the lunch break. and the mans unable to do his work. So he files suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act. and the court says he doesnt win the case because hes not disabled. Diabetes is not enough of a disability to remedy this persons concern. Now thats just wrong. And the other body understands it. both parties in this body understand it. the American people understand it. What we have done in this Act is to restore the commonsense. meaningful definition of what \"disability\" means. not so that people with disabilities get special privileges. but so they get the same rights and opportunities that everybody else is guaranteed in this country under the law. Again. I congratulate Mr. HOYER and",

Passage of this bill will clear the way for the Presidents signature and finally renew our promise to the American people that discrimination in any form will never be tolerated. I would like to thank my good friend. Majority Leader STENY HOYER. who has been a real leader and champion on behalf of the disabilities community. I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman MILLER for his continued leadership on this critical issue. as well as Congressman JIM SENSENBRENNER. This has truly been a bipartisan effort. The ADA was groundbreaking civil rights legislation. And as someone who has lived with the challenges of a disability both before and after the ADAs enactment in 1990. I have experienced firsthand the profound changes that this law has effected within our society. The bill before us today reaffirms the protections of the ADA and upholds the ideals of equality and opportunity on which this country was founded. In July. we celebrated the 18th anniversary of the ADA. It was a day to reflect on our past accomplishments. our current challenges. and future opportunities. I can think of no better way to honor the spirit of this landmark bill and the spirit of all those who fought for its passage than by passing the ADA Amendments Act and restoring Congress intent to ensure the ADAs broad protections. Mr. Speaker. people with disabilities represent a tremendously valuable. and yet in many ways untapped. resource in this country. By fostering an environment of inclusion and empowerment. we can provide the means for every individual to fulfill his or her Godgiven potential. The ADA Amendments Act will help us realize this important goal. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill and send it to the President for his signature. Again. I thank all those who were part of making this day possible. particularly. again. our majority leader. STENY HOYER. for his great leadership.",

A number of their Members crossed the aisle to vote for the legislation because they recognize this was about taking us to a new energy future. a future that no longer continued year after year after year. as we have under Republican control. increased dependence upon international oil from nations that are hostile to us in so many ways. of nations who inflate our economy in so many ways.

This bipartisan legislation. which will restore the original intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act. ADA. is long overdue. The passage of the ADA in 1990 helped millions of Americans with disabilities succeed in life and the workplace by making essential services that most Americans take for granted more accessible to individuals with disabilities. It was truly a landmark civil rights law to ensure that people with disabilities have protection from discrimination in the same manner as individuals are protected from discrimination on the basis of race. gender. national origin. religion. or age. In recent years. the Federal courts have erroneously eroded the protections for individuals under the ADA. which has created a new set of barriers for those with disabilities. This bill rejects the courts narrow interpretation of the definition of disability. and makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability. It strikes a careful balance between the needs of individuals with disabilities and realities confronted by employers. Madam Speaker. the Congress is taking an important step towards restoring the original intent of the ADA. By doing so. we will help ensure that Americans with disabilities can lead independent and selfsufficient lives. I urge my colleagues to support this muchneeded legislation.",

The changes embodied by this Act. that restore the with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") to its original purpose. are long overdue. S. 3406. the \"ADA Restoration Act of 2007.\" amends the definition of \"disability\" in the ADA in response to the Supreme Courts narrow interpretation of the definition. which has made it extremely difficult for individuals with serious health conditionsepilepsy. diabetes. cancer. muscular dystrophy. multiple sclerosis and severe intellectual impairmentsto prove that they qualify for protection under the ADA. The Supreme Court has narrowed the definition in two ways: (1) by ruling that mitigating measures that help control an impairment like medicine. hearing aids. or any other treatment must be considered in determining whether an impairment is disabling enough to qualify as a disability. and (2) by ruling that the elements of the definition must be interpreted \"strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.\" The Courts treatment of the ADA is at odds with judicial treatment of other civil rights statutes. which usually are interpreted broadly to achieve their remedial purposes. It is also inconsistent with Congresss intent. The Committee will consider a substitute that represents the consensus view of disability rights groups and the business community. That substitute restores Congressional intent by. among other things: Disallowing consideration of mitigating measures other than corrective lenses (ordinary eyeglasses or contacts) when determining whether an impairment is sufficiently limiting to qualify as a disability. Maintaining the requirement that an individual qualifying as disabled under the first of the threeprong definition of \"disability\" show that an impairment \"substantially limits\" a major life activity but defining \"substantially limits\" as a less burdensome \"materially restricts\". Clarifying that anyone who is discriminated against because of an impairment. whether or not the impairment limits the performance of any major life activities. has been \"regarded as\" disabled and is entitled to the ADAs protection.",

But I also rise to express my disappointment in the opportunity that we had last night to pass a bipartisan energy bill that would in fact do all of the above. I am concerned that the bill that did pass last night will do none of the above in terms of moving us toward more energy security. Frankly. I dont think that the bill that passed last night has any chance of moving in the United States Senate. I do believe if we were to pass the bipartisan AbercrombiePeterson bill. that it was very likely the Senate could take the bill up and move it quickly. a bill that would create a million new jobs. that would lower gas prices and lower energy prices. But that didnt happen. But I rise today to say we are not going away. There is an awful lot of talk moving around here that later on this week we may have to take up a stimulus bill. a lot of wellintentioned. wellmeaning money. taxpayer money that we would be sending around the country. I cant think of any better stimulus bill than to pass a bipartisan energy bill that would in fact create 1 million new jobs. would in fact lower gas prices. lower energy prices. help our manufacturers all around the country. and a bill that the American people desperately want. While gas prices came down temporarily. we saw them shoot up in the midst of the hurricane because there is no additional supply. There is no relief valve. and if anybody sneezes around the world in the energy market. what happens? Our gas prices go up. And while oil prices were coming down in the shortterm. we all know how vulnerable we are. So taking a real honest step toward preserving Americas energy security I think is critically necessary.

Senator KENNEDY and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law. sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise. each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country. In the early morning hours of February 15. 2008. a young man and his friend were passing through Temple Universitys campus in Philadelphia. PA. when they found themselves in a physical fight with four Temple students. According to reports. the two nonTemple students were standing in front of a traditionally Jewish fraternity house when they were accosted by the four attackers. One of the four allegedly asked the two visitors if they were Jewish. When they replied that they were not. one of the Temple students evidently began to yell. \"We hate Jews! We hate Jews!\" According to police. one of the two victims was seriously injured and suffered a broken nose and fractured right eye socket. Temple released a letter characterizing the incident as a hate crime. The attackers have been suspended pending a University Disciplinary Committee hearing. while Philadelphia police are pursuing criminal charges and have issued warrants for the suspects arrest. I believe that the Governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well.",

Each year these courageous men and women embark on a 2 year journey to help develop the societies of 139 countries around the world. Almost 47 years ago. then Senator John F. Kennedy challenged students at the University of Michigan to serve their country by peaceably living and working to develop another country. Over the years. volunteers have made significant and lasting contributions around the world by educating people on basic health issues. performing youth outreach. developing businesses. and offering assistance to small farmers to increase food production. Today. over 8.000 volunteers are serving in the communities of 74 countries. Many Peace Corps volunteers from New Mexico are currently posted in Bolivia. Ecuador. and Honduras. Volunteers range in age from 25 to 80. with varying levels of education including individuals with undergraduate and graduate degrees. Additionally. the Peace Corps offers programs that support academic studies once a term of service has concluded. which allows many volunteers to further their education after their selfsacrificing service. The experience volunteers take back with them from their host countries helps shape the course of their lives. Lifelong connections and friendships span these gaps of distance. and volunteers have the satisfaction of not only a job well done. but also of the positive image they created for our Nation.

The purpose of this legislation is to update the tax treatment of cell phones and mobile communication devices. During the past 20 years. the use of cell phone and mobile communication devices has skyrocketed. Cell phones are no longer viewed as an executive perk or a luxury item. They no longer resemble suitcases or are hardwired to the floor of an automobile. Cell phone and mobile communication devices are now part of daily business practices at all levels. In 1989. Congress passed a law. which added cell phones to the definition of listed property under section 280F(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Treating cell phones as listed property requires substantial documentation in order for cell phones to benefit from accelerated depreciation and not be treated as taxable income to the employee. This documentation Is required to substantiate that the cell phone is used for business purposes more than 50 percent of the time. Generally. listed property is property that inherently lends itself to personal use. such as automobiles. Back in 1989. cell phone technology was an expensive technology worthy of detailed logsheets. At that time. it was difficult to envision cell phones that could be placed in a pocket or handbag. Congress was skeptical about the daily business use of cell phones. Technological advances have revolutionized the cell phone and mobile communication device Industries. Twenty years ago. no one could have imagined the role BlackBerries play in our daytoday communications. Cell phones and mobile communication devices are now widespread throughout all types of businesses. Employers provide their employees with these devices to enable them to remain connected 24 hours a day. seven days a week. The cost of the devices has been reduced. and most providers offer unlimited airtime for one monthly rate. Recently. the Internal Revenue Service reminded field examiners of the substantiation rules for cell phones as listed property. The current rule requires employers to maintain expensive and detailed logs. and employers caught without cell phone logs could face tax penalties.",

I supported a bill very similar to this. I have always supported transparency in these matters. My concern is in the fairness of passing this legislation today. When this legislation was introduced at the very beginning of this administrations tenure. I supported it because it would have provided sufficient notice to the new administration of a change in reporting requirements. However. this administrations final term is near an end. and I do not believe it is fair to change the rules on them. This administration has complied with the existing procedures. Changing them now would put a greater burden on them than any other past administration which already finished collecting the majority of donations for their libraries. Enacting this bill to apply only to future administrations would solve this problem. and put them on notice of the new reporting requirements and procedures. I have an amendment to this bill so that it will be enacted only to apply to administrations serving on or after January 21. 2009. If this amendment is accepted.

Focusing on these economic challenges. reining in entitlement spending. and curbing Congresss appetite for autopilot spending will take strong bipartisan commitment from both sides of the aisle. Our \"longterm\" spending crisis has arrived. and our children and grandchildren will bear the burden if Congress does not act. Dietrich Bonhoeffer. the German theologian who was at the heart of the German resistance against Nazism. said. \"The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children.\" This Congress is leaving the next generation saddled with $54 trillion in unfunded liabilities and $9 trillion in debt. $1 trillion of which is held by the Chinese. They also face potential loss of our countrys tripleA bond ratingas early as 2012. according to Standard & Poors. or by 2018. according to Moodys Investors Service. This is an economic issue. but also a moral and generational issue. Representative JIM COOPER and I have been working together with over 100 cosponsors on a solution that would put everythingentitlements and tax policy--on the table in order to turn things around. The CooperWolf SAFE Act would create a bipartisan entitlement review commission. culminating in a required up or down vote by Congress on a legislative proposal born from the commissions work. Mandating action is what makes the SAFE Commission unique. We had the opportunity in this years budget process to take the initial steps to get our financial house in order. But again this budget cycle. Congress is choosing to look the other way. I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize that the budget resolution makes little progress on this pressing issue and join our efforts with the SAFE Commission. When educating his colleagues in the British Parliament about the horrors of the slave trade in 1789. William Wilberforce said. \"Having heard all this you may choose to look the other way. but you can never again say that you did not know.\" Not one member of the 110th Congress can say they dont know about the category 5 storm off our shores. which former Comptroller General David Walker says could result in a \"tsunami of spending and debt that could swamp our ship of state.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I rise in support of the S. Con. Res. 70. the conference report to the FY 2009 Budget. Every day. new reports suggest our economy is slowing. It is imperative that the Congress help Americans during these tough economic times. I am supportive of the Democratic budget because it will expand health care for needy Americans. provide tax relief for the middle class. strengthen safety net programs. and reject the Presidents draconian funding cuts. In effect. S. Con. Res 70 will lead America in a new direction. The Bush budget slashes a half trillion dollars from Medicare and Medicaid over the next decade. The Democratic budget rejects the Presidents proposed cuts to health care. and instead provides program improvements to State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Last year. the President twice vetoed legislation that would have expanded this essential program. S. Con. Res. 70 will provide $50 billion for SCHIP. which significantly reduces the number of uninsured children. The Democratic budget further helps Americans with the skyrocketing cost of health care by investments in health information technology and research grants in medical technology. The Democratic budget provides tax breaks for low- and middleincome families. including an extension of the child tax credit. marriage penalty relief. extension of the 10% individual income tax bracket and an extension of the deduction for state and local sales taxes. S. Con. Res. 70 will also stop the Alternative Minimum Tax from raising taxes on more than 20 million middleclass tax payers. In this era of globalization. it is crucial that we give our youth the best possible. education without burdening them with insurmountable debt. The Bush budget would eliminate important educational programs such as the Thurgood Marshall Legal education. Perkins Loans Cancellations. Mental Health Integration and Reading is Fundamental. In contrast. the Democratic budget provides significant increases to vital programs in education. job training. and social service programs. Mr. Speaker. my home state of Michigan is facing serious economic challenges. in part due to the Presidents failed policies. The Democratic budget will offer working families a chance at the American dream. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

This legislation strongly reflects the values of Oregonians and Americans across our country and I urge my colleagues to pass the bill. Today I am especially proud to be a member of the Budget Committee. It is worth noting that this is the first budget passed in an election year since 1998. The new Democratic majority has shown that they are committed to passing a budget despite an uncooperative President. Todays budget agreement is a balanced budget with balanced priorities. We have rejected the Presidents misguided cuts to programs that serve as a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens. cuts to Medicare. Medicaid. the Lowincome Home Energy Assistance Program. and the Community Development Block Grants. This budget also recognizes that we must strengthen our middle class. a group that has suffered tremendously over the last 7 years. The budget provides fiscally responsible. deficitneutral middle income tax relief. including keeping 20 million middleincome households from being hit by the Altemative Minimum Tax. It also extends the child tax credit. marriage penalty relief. and the 10 percent individual income tax bracket. However. tax relief will do little without reinvestment in the priorities which strengthen our Nation and its citizens. Building our Nation must include a strong commitment to physical infrastructure. human capital. and innovation to keep us competitive globally. This budget does all these things. Recognizing that our current crumbling infrastructure is both structurally unsafe and hindering growth of our economy. the 2009 Budget includes an Infrastructure Reinvestment Reserve Fund to accommodate legislation that would provide robust Federal investment in projects such as rail. bridges. transit. ports. and more. The budget invests in our human capital both by creating a Higher Education Reserve Fund to make college more affordable for families. and by including funding for investment in renewable and energy efficient technologies to train workers in rapidly expanding \"green collar\" jobs. These investments. along with increased funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health keep our Nation on the cutting edge and maintain our position as a global leader. Todays budget reflects Americas priorities in a fiscally responsible way and brings our budget back into balance by 2012. while abiding by payasyou go rules. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting and passing the 2009 Budget Conference Agreement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to the FY2009 budget resolution. This budget includes nearly $179 billion to fund the war. Congress should not in good conscience vote to continue the Administrations illegal occupation of Iraq. The greatest tragedy of this war is the staggering loss of life. starting with the 4.091 brave men and women in U.S. military uniform. Tens of thousands more have been injured. Both of these numbers will continue to rise. The U.S. policies in Iraq have failed as is evidenced by the fact that close to half of the population is struggling in extreme poverty. Estimates are that 1.000.000 innocent Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion. A reported 70 percent of Iraqisnearly three quarters of the populationare without clean water. 80 percent lack effective sanitation. and 90 percent of hospitals lack essential surgical and medical supplies needed for Iraqi health and wellbeing. Iraqs ability to meet the basic needs of its people is in shambles and our beloved troops remain in harms way. This body should act on the mandate of the American public given last November and bring our troops home now. Instead we continue to forfeit the publics trust with this unrelenting commitment to keep the war going when we have the power to end it. All it requires is a refusal to consider any legislation that contains or implies continued funding for this war. The grand total for all defense related spending. including war funds and nuclear activities. is $607.8 billion. This is 56% of all discretionary spending in the budget for FY09. In other words. this budget continues the same failed policies that dedicate the majority of tax payer funds to defense spending while hard working Americans continue to struggle to afford basic necessities such as food. health care. homes and good schools for their kids. The money in this budget that will go to fund war could be used to provide 39.912.404 people with healthcare. it could be used to offer an additional 1.053.429 affordable housing units. it could be used to provide 20.937.104 college level scholarships to the young minds of America. The budget should be reflective of Americas priorities. but this budget falls far short of reflecting the priorities of the majority of Americans. so I oppose it.",

Henry Hyde will be remembered in many different waysas a skilled attorney who respected and defended the rule of law. as a stout champion of the rights of the unborn. and as a distinguished statesman who promoted peaceful and just international relations and agreements. As I remember the life and service of Henry Hyde. one personal experience stands out in my mind. In 1984. I was involved in a closely contested race for an open Michigan State Senate seat. A prominent prolife organization endorsed my opponent. based not on my record or his. but on unrelated reasons. This was done despite my own consistent prolife voting record and ardent prolife policy stance. The prolife endorsement carried considerable weight in the district and was a noteworthy point in the campaign. Henry Hyde found out about this development. and he was outraged. He traveled up from Illinois to campaign for me. to correct what he considered a grave injustice. Of course. given the passage of the \"Hyde amendment\" to prevent federal funds from being used for abortionsremarkably. passed during his first term in Congress in 1974Henry Hyde was a hero in the prolife movement. His public endorsement of my campaign was a significant factor in my close victory. Mr. Speaker. I consider it an honor to have known and worked closely with Henry Hyde.

These provisions on drug resistance. orphans and vulnerable children. and tracking the sale of drugs on the black market were ensured a place in the legislation largely because of Mr. Hydes support. I will also never forget the opportunity to travel with Mr. Hyde to Mexico. where it was evident that he was wellrespected by world leaders. One of the things I recall most clearly about Representative Hyde was his command of the English language and his oratorical skills. When Secretary Rice appeared before the International Affairs Committee. he so eloquently expressed his disappointment that the Bush Administration had failed to live up to its obligation to ensure security in Iraq. In addition to his many years as an elected leader. Mr. Hyde was a celebrated athlete in college. a veteran. and a lawyer. In recognition of his accomplishments. in October of this year. Congressman Hyde was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. our countrys highest civilian honor. On behalf of the families of Minnesotas Fourth Congressional District. we extend our prayers and sincerest condolences to his wife.",

President of the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 183. and letter carrier for the United States Postal Service. Alex has honorably served his community for 30 years. Mr. Mallonees career in public service began in 1977 when he became a letter carrier and was immediately active in the union. He ascended to the presidency of Branch 183 in 1980 and became known as a highly approachable. dedicated. and principled leader. In a position that can often lend itself to conflict and acrimony. Alex firmly stood up for the rights of his members while maintaining a strong. civil dialogue with management. According to his colleagues. Alex even educated management on many social justice issues. Mr. Mallonees stellar work with the Letter Carriers earned him the position of SecretaryTreasurer of the North Bay Labor Council. AFLCIO. representing member unions in Sonoma. Lake. Marin. and Mendocino counties. Under Alexs leadership. the Councils membership has grown to over 50 unions representing 30.000 working men and women in the North Bay. Mr. Mallonees coalitionbuilding skills were essential in his role as a founding member of the Coalition for a Better Sonoma County. an endeavor that sought to unify progressive environmental. labor. and community groups under the shared principles of smart growth. environmental protection. social justice. and affordable housing. Alexs gift for bringing people together has resulted in a vibrant progressive movement in Sonoma County. Mr. Mallonees legacy will be felt long after his retirement. He is a one of a kind leader who is wellrespected by the business community as well as the progressive community. He is leaving the labor movement markedly better than he found it. which is a testament to his strength of convictions and quality of character. Madam Speaker. it is my distinct pleasure to recognize Alexander Mallonee for his many years of public service to the Northern Bay area of California. and to thank him for his many contributions on behalf of working men and women everywhere.

Barbara Morgan. who has spent her distinguished career ensuring our children have the knowledge and experience to fulfill their dreams. I also rise today. Madam Speaker. to thank Barbara for visiting my district to share her inspiring story and experience with local students. This past August. Astronaut Barbara Morgan became the first teacher to complete a mission in space. While Barbara had to wait 21 years for her trip on the Endeavour. she completed the legacy of teacher Christa McAuliffe. who was tragically killed in the 1986 explosion of shuttle Challenger. by holding education sessions in orbit for students. As Christa McAuliffes backup for the NASA Teacher in Space Program. Barbara witnessed firsthand the tragic Challenger explosion. After the explosion. Barbara returned to teaching in Idaho. but in 1998 was drawn back to NASA and trained to become an astronaut and an integral part of shuttle missions. She has logged over 305 hours in space and completed her first space flight in August 2007 as a mission specialist on the crew of Endeavour. Holding the first inorbit classroom for students aboard Endeavour. Barbara said her 2 careers were very similar. saying in both roles. you \"explore. discover and share.\" In these roles. Barbara has not only made a significant impact on space exploration. but she also serves as a positive role model for students. Growing up in Fresno. California. Barbara graduated with distinction from Stanford University and started teaching on the Flathead Indian reservation at Arlee Elementary School in Arlee. Montana. Most recently. Barbara taught second. third. and fourth grades at McCallDonnelly Elementary School in Idaho. Throughout Barbaras life. she has set an example for others to follow. Her courage and dedication to education serves as an example for us all. especially our students. It is because of teachers like Barbara that our students have the inspiration to follow their dreams.

I would say to my friend I am operating with some concerns about the questions that are raised. But. again. I say. first of all. what happened in the Deficit Reduction Act is that the bill that was sent to the President. the provisions were never passed by the Senate. Every provision that was sent to the President was sent to the President after overwhelming votes from the House. overwhelming votes from the Senate in exactly the same position. Title III was passed by the Senate and the House. and inadvertently left out. In the Deficit Reduction Act. figures were changed in the bill subsequent to passing the Senate and never passed by the House. So I would suggest that the analogy between the two is not apt. In addition. there was no bipartisan discussion on that change. In this case. Mr. PETERSON and Mr. GOODLATTE are both on the floor. I didnt participate in those conversations. But I was informed by Mr. PETERSON. because I said. have you talked to Mr. GOODLATTE about this. He said he had. There had been significant discussions about that. There was concern about getting the farm bill passed because of the expiration of the existing authorization. As a result of those discussions. my personal thought was there was bipartisan agreement that we could proceed this way. We did proceed that way.

I would say in this case that my principal concern would be that the sections of the farm bill that have gone to the President. since they were not part of an entire bill. could be subject to all kinds of future litigation. I do know in the litigation that the minority initiated in February. 2006. 2 years and millions of taxpayer dollars later. we finally ended that litigation at the court of appeals level with the court of appeals deciding that if the Speaker and the President pro tempore certified that this is what both bodies passed. it was what both bodies passed. Here. were moving forward with both bodies admitting that what this President has seen is not what both bodies passed. This idea that just because a portion of the bill has passed in a bigger bill means that the House was for that portion of the bill. that the Senate was for that portion of the bill.

Iran continues to: expand its arsenal of short- and longerrange ballistic missiles. install advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium. and evade questions on past nuclear weapons research. Our NATO allies recognize this threat and. in April 2008. provided unanimous endorsement of the European missile defense proposal. In a few weeks. the Czech Republic plans to sign agreements with the U.S. to host the missile tracking radar. This is a critical time for the U.S. to continue its leadership. In addition to NATO. we have key allies such as Israel and Japan who are relying on U.S. commitments to missile defense. I am. therefore. disappointed that the committee would not accept my amendment to restore funding to this effort. particularly after significant progress is being made to meet the conditions outlined in last years legislation. As the Secretary General of NATO said at a speech on May 5. \"In tomorrows uncertain world. we cannot wait for threats to mature before deciding how to counter them.\" I also remain concerned about Chinas actions in space. According to the Pentagons annual China military report. its undeclared and unexplained January 2007 antisatellite test is only one part of a larger Chinese counterspace program to prevent the use of space. Thus. I was strongly disappointed and troubled that my amendment to direct an independent study to examine the feasibility of spacebased defense concepts was not supported in our committee markup.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to acknowledge the lifetime work of the artist George Tooker. Earlier this month. President Bush presented him with the National Medal of Arts. our Nations highest and most prestigious award for artistic excellence. George Tooker. born in New York City. is a resident of Hartland. VT. After studying English literature at Harvard and then studying painting at the Art Students League of New York. he found a world of modern possibilities in the medieval and Renaissance medium of egg tempera. helping to begin a revitalization of that technique. The choice of egg tempera gave his paintings an archaic and otherworldly feel. creating wonderfully rich juxtapositions as Tooker often used contemporary subjects and circumstances as the theme of his work. For instance. many of his paintings convey images of modernity and alienation while using colors. surface finishes. and techniques that hearken back to the long tradition of art history. But they do more. of course. the reference to that long tradition of culture foregrounds the current manifestations of that culture. which George Tooker addresses as his subject. Although some have seen elements of fantasy in his paintings. George Tooker has been explicit. he seeks not an escape into a dream world but. rather. the creation of a new approach to realism. \"I am after painting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream. but I am not after painting dreams as such. or fantasy.\" he once said. His haunting works often highlight the increased social isolation that has accompanied the pressures of modernization on everyday life. He deals with society and its very real consequences. although many of his paintings retain a magical and stylized feel. at their heart are images that have the capacity to reveal and reflect many of the deepest feelings each viewer of Tookers work encounters in his or her own life in the contemporary world. I commend Mr. George Tooker for his Important contributions to American art and congratulate him on receiving the National Medal of Arts. We in Vermont are proud of his accomplishment.*",

Bipartisan support is a key element of successful campaign finance reform efforts. and I am therefore delighted that the junior Senator from Maine. Sen. COLLINS. has agreed to be the principal cosponsor of the bill. The Presidential Funding Act of 2007 will ensure that this system will continue to fulfill its promise in the 21st century. The bill will take effect in January 2009. so it will first apply in the 2012 presidential election. The presidential public financing system was put into place in the wake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo. The system. of course. is voluntary. as the Supreme Court required in Buckley. Every major party nominee for President since 1976 has participated in the system for the general election and. prior to 2000. every major party nominee had participated in the system for the primary election as well. In the 2004 election. President Bush and two Democratic candidates. Howard Dean and the eventual nominee JOHN KERRY. opted out of the system for the presidential primaries. President Bush and Senator KERRY elected to take the taxpayerfunded grant in the general election. President Bush also opted out of the system for the Republican primaries in 2000 but accepted the general election grant.

I wish to notify the Senate of my intent to object to proceeding to S. 311. a bill to amend the Horse Protection Act to prohibit the shipping. transporting. moving. delivering. receiving. possessing. purchasing. selling. or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption. and for other purposes. The bill would prohibit the shipping. transporting. moving. delivering. receiving. possessing. purchasing. selling. or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption. In short. it would further limit the already limited options for disposal of unwanted horses. An unwanted horse is one that has reached the useful end of its economic or recreational life. There are numerous reasons for the existence of unwanted horses. not the least of which are economic reasons such as loss of job. price of feed or stabling. relocation. poor health of the horse or its owner. It must be recognized that no one has adequately addressed the fate of the estimated 90.000 unwanted horses that were formerly slaughtered on an annual basis. Animal welfare groups and rescue organizations can only do so much to shoulder the load of aiding the adoption or care of these horses. They are currently stretched to capacity. and we expect an increase in need. As a result. we are witnessing a significant increase in abandonment and neglect of horses in this country. Particularly in the West. growing numbers of unwanted horses are being dumped on public or private rangelands. I believe that we should take the time to examine this growing issue of the unwanted horse before passing legislation that ties the hands of horse owners. public and private land managers. and others.",

Nanotechnology is the art of manipulating materials on an atomic and molecular level. and Louisiana Tech University has risen to the top of this scientific threshold. This year a trade magazine. Small Times. ranked LA Tech third in micro and nanotechnology education. Small Times evaluated each college based on various criteria. and Louisiana Tech surfaced as one of the elite universities. Louisiana Tech also stands as one of the only universities in the country that offers a nanotechnology degree at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Their diversity within the program. and their excellence in both faculty innovation and curriculum ranks them among the best major scientific universities. Louisiana Tech University also ranked tenth in the Nation for commercializing nanotechnology inventions. or the capability to process patents and turn them into profitable ideas. The university alone applied for 24 patent applications in the last year. 20 of which involved micro and nanotechnology. proving Louisiana Techs dedication as a national contributor to the scientific spectrum. As Louisiana Tech blossoms. many profitable institutions have invested and settled within the university. such as Avoyelles Renewable Fuels. which is working to discover a way to convert biomass waste into a biofuel through a nanocatalyst. I would also like to take a moment to honor Joshua Michael Brown. At Louisiana Tech University. he became this first person in the entire world to graduate with a nanosystems engineering degree.

I rise today in support of H.R. 6003. the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 and urge swift passage on this measure. H.R. 6003 is long overdue. and it has been nearly 11 years since Congress has authorized funding for Amtrak. And without sufficient funds. Amtrak has been forced to operate with its hands tied. Maintenance and legacy projects have been delayed. and salaries have been frozen. and infrastructure has been deteriorating. Improving our passenger rail system is critical. It will mean better service reliability. reduced trip times. added capacity. and less congested highways. I am also pleased that this bill addresses highspeed rail. A number of us had the opportunity to travel with Chairman DEFAZIo and Chairwoman BROWN and Ranking Member MICA to Europe several months ago. where we saw the advancements that have been made in various modes of transportation. notably highspeed rail. I think it is unacceptable that this country is so far behind other countries in this area. We also saw how public and private partnerships work to be successful. Given the current budget constraints. we need to keep all funding options on the table. including these partnerships. H.R. 6003 is a good bill that will allow for necessary improvements to be made to our Nations transportation network. Hopefully. some day. we can have a highspeed rail system that will connect Denver to Grand Junction and all the ski areas in between. It will connect Fort Collins. the Pueblo. along the front range of Colorado. I carefully support this beautiful piece of bipartisan legislation. and Mr. Chairman.

I submitted an amendment on this bill earlier in the week related to security training for Amtrak frontline employees. I have been encouraged to withdraw the amendment in order to expedite consideration of this bill. which is very important and which I support. However. I remain troubled by one underlying issue. As evidenced by the terrorist attacks against rail systems in Madrid and in London and in Moscow and in Tokyo and Mumbai. and 3 days ago in Algeria. terrorists have demonstrated their intent to continue to target public transit systems as a favored tactic against civilian populations. In response to this continued threat. Congress in the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue comprehensive rail and transit worker training directives to prepare our rail workers and transit workers to prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks against our public transit systems. With respect to railroad employees. the law required the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and issue security training regulations by last February. 4 months ago. so that each carrier could develop a training program based on this guidance. Regrettably. however. and this gets to the Issue of my amendment. the Secretary has failed to comply with the 9/ 11 Acts rail worker training directives and has not issued a single mandated regulation. Worse yet. this missed deadline comes on the heels of yet another missed deadline by the Department on issuing interim training regulations for transit workers.",

ClevelandColumbus Cincinnati . . . is an idea beyond overdue at the station. This corridor is at the heart of a potentially vibrant passenger rail system in Ohio. a fact borne out by a number of studies dating back as far as the 1980s. Public demand is growing for transportation choices in Ohio. Significant anecdotal evidence around the United States suggests that even basic passenger rail service such as this would draw heavy ridership and grow the demand for more service. Today. the reality of everhigher gasoline prices and their impact on the everyday mobility of our fellow Ohioans and on Ohios economy makes the restoration of rail passenger service in Ohio a critical transportation need. We are hearing from our constituents increasingly that \"pain at the pump\" leaves them few or only expensive options to travel on business. and to access everything from education to jobs to medical care. Since January 2007 alone. the average price of unleaded gas in Cleveland has gone up 72 percent. In some cases. Ohioans are seeing more and more of their incomes going to feed their car and cutting into other life necessities A recent study by the Ohio Rail Association discussed the economic impact that highspeed rail would have on Ohio and the surrounding region. Here are just a few statistics: A seven corridor high speed rail systems in Ohio would save $9.4 million in fuel per year. There would be approximately 1.1 million annual riders just out of Cleveland alone by 2025. It would provide 16.700 permanent jobs as well as 6.100 temporary jobs to build the rail system. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of this bill to move Amtrak forward with high speed rail.",

It continues to produce almost 20.000 jobs. services more than 25.8 million passengers. and provides a significant transportation link for communities in my congressional district and throughout the Nation. In H.R. 6003. we authorize more than $14.4 billion for Amtrak capital and operating grants. state intercity passenger grants. and highspeed rail over the next five years. Further. we provide $1.75 billion for grants to states to finance construction and equipment for 11 authorized highspeed rail corridors. including the St. LouisChicago corridor. Finally. I want to thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairwoman BROWN for working with me to include a provision that allows previous State investments for capital and operating Amtrak to be used toward the required 20% local match. The bill allows for States to use half of what they put into Amtrak in operating and capital investments toward their local match.

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This bill includes development of new intercity passenger rail services. including $500 million per year to states to cover the capital costs of investing in new intercity passenger rail services. By investing in new rail infrastructure. this legislation creates jobs. increases tourism and spurs economic development in the communities impacted by new rail service. In Iowas First District. this bill will help fund two new routes that would both increase rail services and provide economic benefits. The routes between Chicago and the Quad Cities and Chicago to Dubuque. Iowa would encourage economic development in both Iowa and Illinois. while creating local jobs and decreasing traffic and congestion. Both of these routes would provide another piece to a new transportation corridor through the center of the country. which would be beneficial for business and recreation from coasttocoast. I am also glad to see Section 220 up for House passage today that includes the Study of the Use of Biobased Lubricants. This language instructs the Federal Railroad Administration to issue a report on the feasibility of using readily biodegradable lubricants by freight and passenger railroads. partly through comparisons of these lubricants with the petroleumbased lubricants traditionally used. The National AgBased Lubricants Center (NABL) at the University of Northern Iowa would be a perfect partner for the Federal Railroad Administration in this study. as NABLs expertise and resources in biobased lubricants is unmatched. and it is the only entity whose primary mission is the research and testing of agriculturalbased lubricants.

In the face of continually rising gas prices. overloaded highways and congested airports. many Americans are being forced to make difficult financial decisions regarding their modes of travel. Amtrak has become an ever more viable transportation option at such a time. and continues to be a practical option for many of those people searching for an efficient and economical travel alternative. Mr. Chairman. as you know. Amtrak carried almost 25.8 million passengers and posted approximately $1.5 billion in ticket revenue in 2007.

It is through a combination of increased profits and a reauthorization bill that proposes $14.4 billion dollars over the next five years that Amtrak will have an incredible opportunity to thrive and flourish. H.R. 6003 does much to aid in the continued growth and vitality of Amtrak. The bill authorizes $4.2 billion to Amtrak for capital grants and $3 billion for operating grants. It is no secret that inconsistent Federal support has hampered Amtraks ability to replace equipment necessary for it to provide service. These capital grants will help Amtrak make additional capital improvements and maintenance over its entire network. In addition. the operating grants authorized under the bill will help Amtrak pay salaries. health costs. overtime pay. fuel costs. facilities. and train maintenance and operations. These operating grants will also ensure that Amtrak can meet its obligations under its recently negotiated labor contract. The Amtrak reauthorization bill also does much for intercity and high speed passenger",

And I would like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman. as gas prices continue to rise and our highways become more congested. it becomes even more critical for us to support and encourage masstransit alternatives. Amtrak will surely continue to play a significant role as one of these alternatives. My home State of New Hampshire is served by the Amtrak Downeaster. connecting Portland. Maine to Boston. The Downeaster has truly been a success story from the beginning of its service in 2001. Ridership numbers have continued to increase year after year. highlighting the importance of Amtrak service to the region. In fact. so far this fiscal year. ridership of the Downeaster has reached nearly 300.000. Yet even a rail line as successful and as important to our region as the Downeaster has difficulties turning a profit. While there are improvements to be made at Amtrak overall. passenger rail service in general requires investment and dedication. As we have seen with the Downeaster. this dedication yields significant retums in tourism and business dollars that come as a result of improving access to the communities served. I look forward to voting in favor of H.R. 6003 and urge my colleagues to do the same.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it is a pleasure to be with you. On this occasion. we are addressing one more time a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. I must say that while it is very important that we get the House to seriously review those matters and see what next steps we should be taking. I feel pretty strongly that it is important that the two sides of the aisle work very closely together regarding this. This resolution would create a new panel of the Appropriations Committee that would. in part. duplicate work already performed by the Intelligence Committee. Unfortunately. this substantive change in committee jurisdiction is being proposed without benefit of the kind of bipartisan input that I personally appreciate and think causes the place to work an awful lot better. The present structure in intelligence oversight was developed following the recommendations of the Pike and Church committees in the 1970s. It took years to develop and execute a quality congressional restructure for intelligence oversight. Something of this importance and sensitivity requires more than just an hours consideration on the floor. It deserves a thorough review by the committees of the House and all of us who are concerned. from various jurisdictions. about these matters. I recognize that this is an oversight bill: and with tongue in cheek. I congratulate the new majority for that kind of oversight. drafting legislation without any input from the Republicans of the House. While I am grateful to Mr. OBEY for his efforts to reach out to me personally. I am deeply concerned that no substantive consultation occurred between the majority and the minority. particularly at a leadership level. Further. I am very concerned that we not jettison the oversight regime that is in place without knowing for certain that we are going to replace it with something that goes beyond just simply getting in the way of the oversight process. I am afraid that what we are doing here is talking about oversight. Instead. on the other hand. we are defusing effective oversight. It is important that we recognize that one more time we are putting out 53. Pt. 1 January 9. 2007 press releases and producing very little in terms of substantive results.

Madam Speaker. the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel will bridge the current divide between the oversight and the funding of our Nations intelligence community. and it will make a significant longterm contribution to the safety of the American people. The robust and lawful collection. analysis. and integration of intelligence on our enemys activities is one of the most powerful tools in the battle against terrorism. But over the last several years. this Congress has been reluctant to ensure that this powerful tool is. in fact. used to its fullest capability. It is time for Congress to fulfill its oversight responsibility by undertaking hardnosed assessments of the intelligence communitys operations. This oversight panel will be in the position to make these tough and needed assessments. and based on these conclusions. to make recommendations that will enable the intelligence community to deliver the highest level of performance. For example. our human intelligence assets must be able to infiltrate developing global terrorist networks. The exodus of longserving professional agents from the intelligence community must be reversed. and a new generation of analysts must be recruited. The Inspector General within the Directorate of National Intelligence must be empowered to identify waste. fraud. and abuse whenever it occurs throughout the intelligence community. Madam Speaker. Speaker PELOSIS proposed panel will. in fact. improve the operations of the Nations intelligence community and. in so doing. will advance the security of the American people.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. the conduct of oversight of our Nations intelligence community is one of the most sensitive and complex duties that we have as a Congress. Our committee and other committees took a very close look at recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. We implemented many of them. Some of them we did not implement. We recognized the need to coordinate the strategies of the authorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee. We recognized the need for additional oversight. As a matter of fact. in the last Congress we created subcommittees specifically focused on oversight and increased the number of committee staff that were dedicated to the work of oversight. We also recognized the importance of coordinating between authorizers and appropriators. In the last Congress. the appropriations bill closely mirrored the authorization bill that this House passed. We worked handinglove because we recognized the importance of putting that together and recognized the importance of what the 9/11 Commission recommended. This resolution today goes in exactly the wrong direction. The objective of the 9/11 Commission that was identified was to give the authorizing committee greater. if not sole. influence and control over appropriations. authorizations. and oversight. This resolution creates an additional committee between the authorizers and the appropriators that will add confusion. One of the things that we hear so often from the homeland security folks. from the intelligence folks. is we report to all of these different committees on the Hill. and there is a lack of clarity. It is exactly what is going to happen now. We are adding more confusion to the process. rather than adding and keeping clarity in this process. If you go back to when the committee was first established under the Church committee. there was one issue that was very important: there had to be clarity as to what committee was going to conduct oversight. l 1700",

You said you were going to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. and now you have to at least appear to make good on that promise even if it doesnt make any sense. So you have come up with a way to do so that really doesnt implement or address the real concerns of the 9/11 Commission. but is actually going to make things a whole lot worse around here in terms of intelligence oversight. The 9/11 Commission recommended streamlining and combining oversight functions and budgeting functions and giving a single committee the power of the purse and the power to oversee our intelligence community. Now. the 9/11 Commission. in my view. had some good ideas and we implemented them. particularly in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2005. which was the most comprehensive reorganization of the intelligence community since the creation of the CIA in 1948. But they also came up with some ideas. as commissions do. that werent such great ideas. They recommended putting the Director of National Intelligence inside the political ring of the White House. I think that is a terrible idea for independence of intelligence and keeping intelligence from being influenced by political considerations. They recommended that we reveal the size of the intelligence budget. which has always been secret. Both of those were bad ideas. I think there is also a danger in eliminating the checks and balances that are inherent in the fact that we separate appropriations from authorizing. particularly in a realm where almost everything is done in secret. The existence of those checks and balances within this institution is actually healthy with respect to oversight of the intelligence community. But they came up with a solution in this resolution that doesnt even do what the 9/11 Commission decided was the real problem. We have two boxes on the chart overseeing the intelligence community. so the resolution creates three. How does that streamline anything? And by adding these. when we add these boxes to the organization chart. we dont even in this resolution clarify who is responsible for what. So",

I wanted to raise one premise that no one has talked about. and that is this blind belief in everything the 9/11 committee says. and apparently individual Members as well. The 9/11 Commission was a bipartisan group of good people. some who served in the House. They are intelligent people who have been involved in public policy. but I am not aware that they were topnotch CIA or FBI or intelligence community members. I dont know of them having risen up through the ranks of the intelligence circles or the antiterrorism circles that makes them absolutely experts on everything on what is now a 22yearold report. 53. Pt. 1 January 9. 2007 I wanted to bring that up because I think it is important when you consider that when the 9/11 Commission came out. this Congress on a bipartisan basis implemented 39 out of the 41 recommendations. We did not implement all the recommendations. but we had hearings on them and they were bipartisan and there was a lot of discussion. unlike what we have here today. What we have here today is a recommendation. a recommendation not made by the 9/11 Commission but. from what I am hearing. one Member wandering around the Hall said. Yeah. this is a good idea. Now. that is hardly the way to make a major step in the way we approach intelligence in the House. It doesnt make sense at all. This bill today has not had a hearing. The Rules Committee did not hear of any amendments that could or would be offered or debated. I think. frankly. the thing that is ironic. and I have got to say as I see over there many of my very good friends. many institutionalists. people who have great respect for the institution. you know that on intelligence we have generally been bipartisan here in the Capitol. Certainly there are times when intelligence like everything else devolves into partisanship. but generally speaking we have conducted this body in the wake of 9/11 itself in a bipartisan manner. and yet today we dont have that. We do not have those amendments which people could come together on.

It is the wrong debate because it serves no useful purpose. We know this bill will never become law. If it passes. it will be vetoed. and that veto will be sustained. We are wasting the time and trying the patience of the American people for no useful purpose. It is the wrong place because it is what happens in Iraq. not here. that will determine the outcome of the current struggle. Our forces and those of the Iraqi Government are in a tough fight. We should reinforce them. not undercut them. and we should encourage the Iraqi Government. not abandon it. It is the wrong time because it is too early to debate the outcome of the current effort in Iraq. I have great respect for the author of this bill. but it is General Petraeuss report and assessment that should guide our deliberations in this body. He has asked us to wait until September before he offers us an assessment of the progress and prospects of the current effort. Having given him a tough job. we owe it to 53. Pt. 13 July 12. 2007 him to adhere to the timeline he has requested. It is the wrong message. most importantly. because it strengthens rather than weakens our enemies. They know they cannot defeat our forces. but they can and they do believe they can outlast this Congress. This debate and this bill will only strengthen them in that belief. By strengthening our enemies. we undercut the best efforts of our forces. the forces of Iraq and the Iraqi Government. The best way to undo the damage that this bill has already done is to defeat it. and I urge my colleagues to do so.",

What I cant understand is how anyone can still believe that our continued. openended military intervention there will lead to a stable nation. In fact. its doing the opposite. The Iraqi Parliament and ministries are in unprecedented disarray. The Presidents own report to Congress will say that we havent met any of our political benchmarks there. and an estimated 13.000 Iraqis are dead since the escalation began. The fact is. as someone much wiser than I said. the Iraqis today are paying wholesale rather than retail for their political decisions. So long as we are the military bodyguard for every major Iraqi political group. so long as we are subsidizing the political decisions of Iraqi political leaders. they will never make the difficult political concessions necessary to create a stable society there. I support this bill. Mr. Speaker. because not another American soldier should die for a strategy that is unfathomably making Iraq less safe and less stable.",

Like several other recent actions on the part of Democrats recently. this bill communicates to jihadist enemies that we are weakening and confirms their belief that they have a critical advantage over free people in the world because their will is far stronger than ours and they need only to persevere to break our resolve. Osama bin Laden himself has stated. \"The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. Its either victory and glory. or misery and humiliation.\" Mr. Speaker. if Democrats continue to insist that the war in Iraq has nothing to do with the war on terrorism. then I wish they would explain that to the terrorists because they still dont understand. and they are continuing to be fundamentally committed to the destruction of the Western world and to killing us wherever they find us. Mr. Speaker. the premise behind this bill is that we can have peace tomorrow so long as we are willing to surrender today. Unfortunately. with jibadist terrorism. just the opposite is true. If we surrender to terrorism today. it will only bring greater horror and suffering to all of humanity tomorrow. So vital questions arise to those who would continue to demand that we surrender Iraq to terrorists. Are they also willing to allow the citizens and families of this Nation to face jihad and what may become a nuclear jibad here at home? And what will we tell our children when that day comes?

I am proud to represent a district in Washington State that integrates our Nations leading technology innovators with a vibrant and highly productive small business community. Opening new global markets gives them the incentives to improve their products. produce more goods. and employ more American workers. I have seen these jobs created in Washington State firsthand. with trade accounting for one of every three jobs in the State of Washington. Free trade agreements with Peru. Colombia. Panama and South Korea are currently pending before Congress. We cannot allow these important agreements to languish in committee. I urge my colleagues in the majority to stop the delays. pass these free trade agreements and renew trade promotion authority. Lets advance the trade measures needed to grow our economy. create jobs and improve our relations with global partners.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will not oppose this amendment. I dont know that any Member of the House would or could. It is simply a restatement of current law. I strongly believe that every employer and every worker should comply with our Nations immigration laws. Indeed. I have long argued that our immigration laws need to be strengthened. that we need to get serious about reasserting control of our borders. enforcing the laws that are on the books and enhancing those laws which are failing if we truly want to secure our borders. No one is as committed to those goals as I am. That said. that is a debate for another day. and not the issue presented to us in this bill. We are not debating the question of immigration reform. but rather. whether we should adopt a trial lawyer bonanza under the guise of \"paycheck fairness.\" As I have said before. this bill does nothing to promote fairness in pay. and everything to invite costly. and often frivolous. litigation. Whether the gentlemans amendment is adopted today or not. that fact will not change. This is an illconceived bill. based on flawed and demonstrably false economic theories. and sure to lead to unintended consequences for workers and employers. The gentlemans amendment is inoffensive. but it is not particularly meaningful. I will not oppose the amendment. but it does not change my strong opposition to the underlying bill. nor my intention to vote \"no\" on final passage. I would like to address the gentlelady that spoke on the amendment just before. When she concluded her statement. she commented on her fact of having been a small businesswoman and running a family business. I had the same experience for many years before I came here to Congress. Its good to see other small businesspeople come to Congress. and I appreciate her amendment that she presented. And I also want to restate again the fact that. even though the Chamber did support her amendment. that were strongly opposed to the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time.",

They will be able to collect unlimited. unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. This serves no legitimate purpose and turns the Equal Pay Act into a lottery. Its why the second half of this motion is a simple. commonsense change that caps \"reasonable.\" as described in the bill. attorneys fees at $1.000 an hour. With a cap on attorneys fees. its the intent that lawyers would take cases based on actual discrimination and prevent lawsuit abuse. Todays litigation system. unfortunately. does little to restrain the filing of lawsuits. Its why lawsuits can result in millions of dollars in lawyers fees. yet plaintiffs end up with pennies on the dollar. Its why tort costs consume approximately 2 percent. 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product. and why 10 cents of every single dollar spent on health care is attributed to the costs of liability and defensive medicine. Over $200 billion a year. A cap on attorneys fees can ensure that victims of discrimination are protected. yet not without financial gain. Without a cap. trial lawyers will be able to interject. distort. and oversee how wages are determined through litigation. and all this will end up doing is increasing expenses for employers and harm current and prospective workers through lower wages and slower job creation. Lets adopt this motion to recommit. If its not adopted. the record will reflect that while this Congress stood by and did nothing to address the price of gasoline at the pump. we had ample time to reward trial lawyers. I yield back.",

But there isnt much time. The opportunity for positive change was crealed by the death late last month of Turkmenistans despotic dictator. President Saparmurat Niyazov. whose role model was Josef Stalin. The urgency for the United States to act is created by those who want to follow in his footsteps. The Turkmen people deserve the right to elect their leaders in free and fair elections. That seems highly unlikely because of the junta that has tried to consolidate power in the aftermath of Niyazovs sudden demise. Consisting of the remaining holdouts from Niyazovs government and controlled by his former bodyguards. the junta leaders have pledged to continue the \"dear leaders\" style of \"democracy.\" ordering yet another statue of him to be built. The constitution has been rewritten to allow the juntas candidate to run in the presidential electionsscheduled for February 11virtually unchallenged. The regimes most competent opponentsthe exiled community of business leaders and intellectualshave effectively been prevented from contesting the elections. For too long the United States has ignored Niyazovs abuses and we continue to fail to articulate our official position regarding relations with the \"interim government.\" I call on the Secretary of State to condemn the juntas unconstitutional actions and demand that it allow its opponents to participate in the February 11 election. Until that happens. the United States must refuse to recognize the govemment in Ashgabat as legitimate. and order federal agencies. including Treasury. State and Justice. to block all of its banking activities. Nurmuhammet Hanamov. the founding chairman of the Republican Party of Turkmenistan who was his countrys former ambassador to Turkey and Israel. has written an incisive article in the Washington Post calling on the West to take advantage of Niyazovs passing to help lead his country toward Democracy.

It is my understanding. once we move to the substitute. if cloture is invoked on that. there are about 24 amendments that are germane as of last night. There were a few other amendments filed. I dont know if they are germane. I have been told by staff that 30. 40 percent of those amendments Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN will agree to accept. The others we will take a look at and see if they are campaign finance related and try to work through them the best we can. I am also in contact with my distinguished colleague. the Republican leader. to see if he feels that there are other amendments we need to vote on. and we are working on that. Even if they are not germane. if the distinguished minority leader and I have some belief that they will help movement of this bill. I would be happy to work with him in that regard. We are going to be in recess today for our respective party conferences from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. If we need to use the whole 30 hours. it would be about 10:30 tonight before we could dispose of the amendmentsomething like that.",

I think it is one thing if the amendment is prospective and doesnt affect people. I think it is another thing when it is retroactive. I believe our side would accept the amendment if it were. in fact. prospective. The amendment has a complicating factor in addition to that. that is. there is a prohibition against any official contact with any spouse of a Member who is a registered lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. That is not any lobbying contact. it is official contact. Now. what is official contact? Does this mean the spouse. if he or she happens to have been a lobbyist for a substantial period of time. cannot attend the Supreme Court dinner which just took place? That could be interpreted as an official contact. Is it an official contact if the individual calls the scheduler of her husbands or his wifes office and asks for some information on the schedule? I am surprisedand I didnt know thisthat this amendment has the words \"official contact.\" You can be sure that even if it said: Well. it is not an official contact. that someone will make the argument: Oh yes. it is an official contact if you attend the Supreme Court dinner with your spouse. Again. I would repeat. this is retroactive legislation. We know it affects people in this body who have worked. helped support their families. I dont recall another time when we have enacted this kind of legislation. So it concerns me. and it concerns me if it is overly repressive. such as using the words \"official contact.\" I am puzzled as to why. when the majority leader offered that if it had a grandfather clause. we would accept it. it wasnt taken. unless the intent is essentially to sever people from their ability to have anything to do with this body. whether it is simply as a spouse or as a professional.

Ann Richards and I worked together when I served in Texas State Senate in 1991 and 1992 before I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993. At that time. she was serving as the Governor of Texas. During our tenure in the state house we worked together to support stronger environmental laws for our district and Texas. Governor Richards was a teacher who started out in politics as a volunteer on the campaigns of Sarah Weddington. Henry B. Gonzalez. and Ralph Yarborough. She began her own political career in 1976 when she was elected to serve as a County Commissioner in Travis County. Six years later in 1982. she was elected Texas State Treasurer and served two terms. Ann made history by becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in fifty years. . In 1990. Ann ran for govemor and promised to increase the role of minorities and women in state government as part of her plan for a \"New Texas.\" When Governor Richards was elected she made it a priority as governor to appoint more women and minorities to state boards and commissions and followed through on her promise. During her tenure. Governor Richards had many accomplishments including revitalizing the Texas economy. reforming the prison system. and instituting the state lottery. Once she left public office. Ann continued to be an inspiration to us all when she bravely battled osteoporosis and esophageal cancer. Ann wasnt only the govemor of one of the greatest states in America. but she was one of Americas greatest governors in terms of her personality. sense of humor. and trailblazing accomplishments. Govemor Richards was the First Lady of Texas politics and her extraordinary accomplishments make her not only a Texas hero. but also an American hero.",

Without Governor Richards direct insight and involvement in granting us a three year waiver in not requiring a taxing district. the creation of the school simply would not have been possible. Today. the college. with 17.000 students. is responsible for contributing to our local economy through workforce and job training programs. has directly contributed to the drop in the regions unemployment rate. and extends education opportunities for so many students. She also helped to streamline the states government and helped create programs and opportunities for Texas economy to flourish at a time when the countrys languished. It is incumbent upon all of US to continue the legacy started by Ann Richards decades ago. We need to lend voice to the disadvantaged and disenfranchised. give americans a legup. not a handout. and. create opportunities for all to participate in their government.

Ann Richards served not only as the Governor of Texas. but as an exemplary role model for young people across the United States. She lived her life with humor. tenacity. dedication and an indomitable spirit that will be missed. Time and time again. Ann Richards showed a true commitment to that great American ideal of equal opportunity for all. For example. nearly half of her 3.000 appointees were female. 15 percent of her appointees were African American. and 20 percent of her appointees were Latino. She was by every measure a Governor for all of the people of Texas. During her time in office Govemor Richards also developed a Robin Hood Plan for Texas schools. to ensure equitable financing for all school districts in our state. The Robin Hood Plan has substantially equalized funding for school districts across Texas and has helped those districts without high property values provide good education for their students. Govemor Richards should also. be recognized for developing an innovative and remarkably effective drug treatment program for Texas prison inmates. The Texas Initiative was launched in 1991 and quickly grew into the most ambitious and aggressive prisonbased drug and alcohol treatment program in the country. Under Govemor Richards watch only 7.2 percent of those who had undergone 53. Pt. 4 4715 at least 3 months of treatment were reincarcerated within 1 year of being released. compared to 18.5 percent of those who received no treatment. Ann Richards legacy goes well beyond the state of Texas. Her famous statement that \"wellbehaved women rarely make history\" exemplifies how she has helped inspire a generation of young women to aspire to hold the highest public offices in the land or to follow whatever their dreams may be. Governor Richards also became a leading international spokesperson for women battling osteoporosis. authoring the book Im Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis. which has been described as inspirational and eyeopening.

I rise in strong support of the Pell Grant Equity Act. which provides lowincome students the opportunity to go to college by eliminating the \"tuition sensitivity provision.\" This provision prohibits maximum Pell grant awards to students attending lowtuition institutions of higher education even if their income is low enough to otherwise qualify for the maximum award. As implemented by the U.S. Department of Education. \"tuition sensitivity\" is intended to reduce the Pell grant for lowincome students who attend very low tuition schools as a costsaving measure. Unfortunately. the students most negatively impacted by this policy are the poorest students who still cannot afford the lower tuition. As I have been saying throughout my district this past week. education is an investment not an expenditure. We must invest in our students now or be forced to pay more later.

This legislation is a simple measure to reduce the real and perceived barriers to a higher education for many lowincome families across the United States. Community colleges and other lowcost institutions offer lifechanging educational opportunities for motivated students. Pell grant recipients are by definition motivated. The Pell grant program works as a contract between the Federal Govemment and the individual. The Government says. \"we will provide you with the means to get a higher education if you desire to invest in yourself.\" Removing the tuition sensitivity provision of the Higher Education Act will help students cover the full cost of attending college. which is significantly higher than tuition alone. For over 30 years. Congress has consistently increased funding available to the Pell grant program and increased the maximum grant that each student can receive. Why? Because the program works. Pell grant recipients regularly go on to succeed in jobs with career potential and upward mobility. Increased access to higher education is an important goal for the Congress because having an educated workforce is essential to our countrys future. As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said to me. \"if our people are educated there isnt a problem we cant solve.

Current law prohibits maximum Pell grant awards to students attending lowtuition higher education institutions even if their income is low enough to otherwise qualify for the maximum award. As the husband of a retired highschool teacher. I have always been a strong advocate for education. Unfortunately. the high costs of a college education prohibit many lowincome students from receiving a higher degree. Pell grants provide lowincome students with their best opportunity to attend college. and we must support financial aid programs like this in order to help as many students as possible succeed and receive a college degree. Higher education is the best way to ensure our children and grandchildren have a promising future regardless of socioeconomic status. I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce an article written by George Gedda entitled \"Light in Liberia\" published in World View. This article is about President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who assumed the office of presidency in Liberia on January 2006 after a democratic election in a country which in recent years suffered under the dictatorial rule of Charles Taylor. First Lady Bush and Secretary of State Rice attended her inaugural ceremony on January 16. 2006. President Sirleaf is the first African woman to be elected president in Liberia. She is on a mission to lift her people from the dark political legacy of expresidents. Charles Taylor and Samuel Doe when fraud. corruption. human rights abuses. and ethnic conflict were rampant. From 1989 to 1996. a civil war in Liberia claimed the lives of more than 200.000 Liberians and displaced a million other people in refugee camps in neighboring countries. President Sirleaf herself endured torture as a military prisoner of Does rebel forces. During Taylor and Does administration over a 25 year period. the per capita income in Liberia dropped from $1000 to $120 according to the World Bank. President Sirleafs leadership brings hope to Liberia. Seven months after her presidency. the lights came on in Liberia for the first time in 14 years on July 26. 2006 and water was turned on in some areas of the country. During her first year in office. school enrollment increased by 40 percent. Additionally. service to 350 health facilities in Liberia was reported restored. President Sirleaf is also taking a stance against corruption and increased transparency in her country by requiring all senior level government officials to publicly declare their assets. I praise President Sirleaf for these accomplishments and for her determination in steering her country towards the right direction. One of the biggest challenges that Liberia faces is addressing its national debt which. without relief. will continue to consume an inordinate amount of resources and cripple development in the country. The United States is providing support to Liberia. Just earlier this year. Secretary Rice announced the cancellation of Liberias $391 million U.S. debt. President Sirleafs tenacity and contribution is inspiring. and I applaud her for her leadership.",

Taiwan is the only democracy in the world banned from U.N. membership. To rectify this abject inequity. on July 19. 2007. Taiwans democraticallyelected President. Chen Shuibian. appealed to U.N.

She looked all over the United States of America to pick a top prosecutor. somebody who had credibility. and judgment she could trust to undertake this difficult thing that the entire Nation was watching. and do you know who she selected? She selected Mr. Conrad of North Carolina. He was then an assistant U.S. attorney and he undertook this challenge. He investigated at some length. and all I recall about it was that he did not choose to indict anyone. I remember he testified before our committee and he was such a straight shooter.

I have also engaged in attempts to open the Pacific. Atlantic. and Gulf Coasts to drilling. While we were successful In opening a portion of the gulf. the Pacific and Atlantic coasts remain off limits. Instead of focusing my effort on all the offlimit portions of the OCS. I have concentrated over the last year on opening the coast of Virginia. for exploration of natural gas only. I think the history on this effort demonstrates a momentum shift in the minds of my colleagues. In June 2007. I offered an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2007 that would allow for the exploration of natural gas in Virginia only. Extraction of natural gas could only occur if the Governor and State legislature approve such a move. That vote lost by a vote of 44 nays and 43 yeas. Of those 44 nays. there are two Senators who are now cosponsors of the Gas Price Reduction Act. a bill that includes a drilling title. With the nonvoting Members. I think we could win this vote today. on an upordown vote.

Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the output of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it though a capandtrade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Discussion and debate is not enough. We need action now. One resource often overlooked is coal. Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies. America cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is an abundant. affordable. reliable. and secure energy source. It has the potential to become an even cleaner fuel. I believe another solution to protect our environment and our economy can be found in the GEAR Act. This bill takes a new look at climate change by tapping into human potential and the American spirit to develop the technological solutions we need to address climate change. Recently. there was a very thoughtful editorial written by Shawn Taylor which was printed in the \"Wyoming Livestock Roundup\" on July 12. 2008.

They have been in place permanently for almost a century now. tax incentives to produce oil and gas. By contrast. with wind and solar and renewable energy. we put them in place in 1992 short term incentives. We have extended them short term five times and have let them ex54.

Renewables. solar. wind. and so on need a clear signal for investment. You can count on these investments because this is where America is going. Is it not the case.

We tried to change that. tried to take some of those oil giveaways and put them in the handswe see record profits from the oil companiesput them in the hands of some of these renewables producers. We were one vote short. but we have another opportunity. That is what the Senator from North Dakota is talking about. extending the tax credits for wind energy. solar. geothermal. and other kinds of renewables. We did it in the last bill we passed through this Senate. We were able to. with some of the economic work we did with the mortgage crisis. extend that tax credit for 1 year. But we would like to do it for longer. Senator DORGAN has a bill for 10 years. I have a bipartisan bill with Senators SNOWE and CANTWELL expanding it for 5 years.. The problem is. it has been a game of red light. green light. It goes on again. off again. It is hard to follow that investment. to follow in the way that we would like and the way that happens in other countries because they never know. You can show. 8 months before these tax credits go off. that the investment decreases. This is no way to run a national energy policy. It is no way to run a national environmental policy.

The Senator even knows. on bills such as consumer product safety where special provisions were added for manufacturers in that bill. we had to slow the bill down in order to get those things taken out.

I thank him for his outstanding contribution to Mississippis progress in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Prior to his appointment. Bryan worked with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency as director of accounting Oversight. where he helped provide assistance to governmental and nonprofit applicants under the Stafford Act. Bryans extensive management experience as a CPA and auditor suited the State perfectly in our recovery efforts. Bryan established a team and a process which ensured FEMA public assistance dollars were accounted for and complied with Federal regulations. The system expedited reimbursements to State and local governments and resulted in over 99 percent of projects being obligated by FEMA. Considering the unprecedented magnitude of this disaster. this was truly a monumental task and one that had never before been undertaken. As director of the Office of Recovery and Renewal. Bryan again put the right people and processes in place to manage the Federal assistance entrusted to the State of Mississippi. Thousands of homeowners have received direct financial assistance through the homeowners assistance grant program. programs and policies have been implemented which will result in the development.of low income housing units in excess of what was available before the storm. and Katrina affected cities and counties have received the much needed Federal resources to rebuild and revitalize their communities. Bryan has worked to ensure that every Federal taxpayer dollar entrusted to Mississippi has been and continues to be spent efficiently and appropriately. The State of Mississippi and this country owe Bryan a debt of gratitude for taking a leave of absence from his private sector career to serve our great State. As we know. public service can be a strain on our families both financially and emotionally. I want to thank Bryans wife Michelle and his two children. Matt and Laura Beth. for their sacrifice and support while allowing Bryan to serve our State. Bryan has reflected great credit on the State of Mississippi and I appreciate his service.*",

Mrs. Browns foresight and pioneering spirit in establishing the Star required not only a dedicated amount of time and effort. but also courage and vigilance. Her efforts paid off. as the paper continues to educate and advocate. and Mrs. Brown was post54. Pt. 6 May 1. 2008 humously inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame this past year. In addition. the building housing the Omaha Star was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January. Mrs. Brown allowed the Star to provide a home for the De Porres Club. an active civil rights organization within the North Omaha community. The Star also kept its readership apprised of the civil rights movements successes and failures across the country by researching the issues and urging involvement. The Omaha Stars mission states that it is \"dedicated to the service of the people that no good cause shall lack a champion and that evil shall not go unopposed.\" My fellow Nebraskans and I take great pride in knowing that the Star has faithfully abided by this mission throughout its 70 years of existence. and we will continue to follow the Omaha Star on its spirited journey to provide a voice for civil rights and equality for all.*",

LTC John Lucas. an Arkansas native. will retire from the Air Force on August 1. 2008. Lieutenant Colonel Lucas attended the University of Arkansas. making me particularly proud because that is my alma mater. and his oldest son. John Lucas. is carrying on the tradition as a freshman at the university as well. Lieutenant Colonel Lucass wife. Coleen. wrote to me on the occasion of his retirement and asked that I write a note of thanks to their family and her husband in an effort to recognize their sacrifice and support over the last 24 year. She writes: While John served his country. his family and mine were both loving and supportive through times of crisis. war and peace. We had times of struggle but both of our families helped me and our children so that my husband could serve our country. Over the past 24 years. we have moved eight times. lived in 11 homes. uprooted the children from schools. moved them away from friends. and endured deployments. Through it all the one constant was family. Our men and women in uniform have a tremendous responsibility to protect our Nations freedoms and it is family support that helps them accomplish their mission. Sacrifice. selflessness and perseverance define the special role of a military family such as the Lucas family. Today. I thank John C. Lucas and his family for their service to our Nation. Our country is blessed to have you John. Coleen. Kevin. Bryan and Andrea Lucas.*",

Certainly with the vote we took today they can continue to have the same kind of access to our markets that theyve had for the last 17 years.

In our Constitution. there are certain legal requirements to run for President of the United States. One of those is to be a natural born citizen. The article in the morning paper I read raised legal questions about the definition of \"natural born citizen.\" Actually. it talked about an ambiguity that could be interpreted in a way that would mean a child of someone in the Active military. stationed somewhere around the world. could have a baby. and that baby could never be President of the United States. In fact. Senator McCAIN was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was ActiveDuty military in the Navy stationed in the Panama Canal Zone. Clearly. that is a notion that defies common sense and certainly offends all of our patriotism. I can envision someone actually being misguided and trying to bring some kind of legal action to determine whether Senator McCAIN should run for President. That would be a waste of public time and resources. We should quickly and without fanfare fix this ambiguity and make it clear that any child of anyone serving in the Active military should. in fact. be qualified to run for President. I will offer legislation I am confident everyone can agree on. How refreshing that notion is. It very simply defines \"natural born citizen\" to include any child born to a member of our military regardless of where in the world they may be serving. In America. so many parents say to their young children: If you work hard and play by the rules. in America someday you could be President. Our brave and respected military should never have to spend a minute worrying whether that saying is true for their child. I hope we can quickly. by unanimous consent. pass this into law so there is no question that those children of the men and women who give it all for us can someday grow up to lead this great Nation.",

People are being foreclosed on. and there are families sitting at the kitchen table to see how to save that precious piece of the American dream they havetheir home. We are trying to help in that regard as well. The stimulus package we did a few days ago was a bipartisan measure. What we should do now with the housing package is work that as a bipartisan idea as well. coming together as both Republicans and Democrats to make it better. The Senator from Georgia has a terrific idea. one I support and I think would make a lot of sense in the current situation in Florida in the housing market. and there are a number of other ideas. One has to do with whether mortgage brokersSenator FEINSTEIN and I bipartisanly have come together on thiswhether there ought to be a national registry for mortgage brokers. Senator CARPER and I have worked together on a number of things that would improve the housing passage. We cannot simply say or follow a pattern that seems to be the current pattern in the Senate. which is that it is put forward by the majority. which then forecloses the ability of the minority to have amendments. The minority leader proposed five amendments per side. and that was rejected. This bill will go down if all they want is a symbolic moment for the Senator from New York to tell the Republicans how they are heartless and dont care about the poor and dont understand that America has problems with housing. and then we will go about our business as usual.

Im not sure whether the center currently exists or whether this earmark creates the center. I would appreciate if the sponsor of this earmark would clear that up. All the bill says is that it funds $1 million for the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure in Pennsylvania. However. when you look at the certification letter that each Member now. according to our earmark rule. is required to submit. you see that the earmark is actually going to the Concurrent Technology Corporation based in Jonestown. Pennsylvania. This is a leading earmark recipient in multiple appropriation bills over the years. Currently in this year. I believe in the Intelligence authorization bill this same group.

    "speech": "We were told in this process early on by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that a different process was needed. that the earmarks should be added later in conference and not now because the Appropriations Committee simply couldnt vet or scrub these earmarks well enough. I would submit that this is a perfect example of that. Weve had another example. One earmark was actually withdrawn. one on the list that I was to offer. because it hadnt been adequately scrubbed. I would submit that this one should be as well. when the chairman of the relevant subcommittee cant tell us if this center even exists. We dont know if it even exists. if its created by this earmark. Concurrent Technology has been the recipient of millions upon millions of dollars over the years. The executives in Concurrent Technology contribute handsomely to Members of Congress. So it receives a lot of earmarks. It seems to be an earmark incubator of some type. an earmark that begets more earmarks. And yet we have the report that comes with the bill that doesnt even mention Concurrent Technology. It just mentions this center as if it already existed. We dont even know if it does. We cant even find any information on it. and apparently we cant even get that information from the Appropriations Committee. So I would submit that this is what this process is about. This is why we come to the floor. This is why we invite the sponsor of the earmark to defend the earmark. But I would say again. does this center exist? Do we even know if it exists? How do we know if its a good center or a bad center? Is this Concurrent Technology. which already receives millions and millions of dollars in other bills. worthy of another earmark to create another center? These are the questions that we have to ask.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to oppose the amendment by the gentleman from Texas. which would prohibit funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for the new Environmental Science Center at the University of Dubuque in Iowa. When opened. this Center will provide State. regional. and national benefit through educating undergraduate and graduate level students in the environmental sciences. and helping to create the next generation of science professionals. The need for greater science education has received a lot of attention in recent years. and is an integral component of ensuring Americas global competitiveness. As a Member of the Science. Technology. Engineering. and Math Caucus. I believe strongly in the need for investment in science education. and I recognize the direct role that the Environmental Science Center plays in keeping America competitive. The University of Dubuque has offered an interdisciplinary major in Environmental Science since 1980. with many graduates currently working in scientific fields. The environmental science program at the university is unique because of its handson focus and strict scientific training. In nearly every course. a field laboratory provides direct. applied experiences for all types of students. Furthermore. University of Dubuques tristate location affords students the opportunity to work with three State natural resource agenciesIowa. Illinois. and Wisconsin. Even as an undergraduate. students are able to receive a regionally based scientific education. The new Environmental Science Center will allow the university to expand on its proven record of educating national scientific leaders. The Center will specialize in handson. applied learning for current science teachers. environmental agency personnel. undergraduate environmental science majors. and education majors to teach the next generation of American scientists. A failure to fund the Environmental Science Center would be a step backward for Americas scientific proficiency. This funding is consistent with the Presidents goal to. \"encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our Nations children a firm grounding in math and science.\" [President George W. Bush. State of the Union Address. February 1. 2006] America needs facilities like the University of Dubuques Environmental Science Center to provide a grounding in science. and help move America forward. I strongly oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas. because it will set America back in terms of global competitiveness and will endanger programs that will educate the next generation and allow them to compete with the likes of China. Europe. Japan. and Asia.",

I personally thought I wasnt elected just to rubberstamp the Presidents desires or his administrations. I was elected to also exercise judgment. judgment on behalf of my constituents and judgment on behalf of the people of America. One of the things I think is important is to educate the children of America. This particular earmark goes to a private college that has entered into a private. private partnership with Merck to build a new science lab. to educate the children from. I would dare say. some of them might be from the Fifth District of Texas. This is a private university run by nuns. And. by the way. if Sister Janet ever called you and asked you for a favor. you would do it. too. if you had any brains. because I wouldnt say no to Sister Janet. So I dont know exactly what the debate is. This particular one is to educate our own children in an merging field of biotechnology and other sciences. Now. I know that some of the people that dont like this amendment also dont want us to bring people from overseas for those jobs. I question. where would they come from? Who will we hire? If we dont want people coming from overseas. which is a fair comment. and we dont want to educate our own children. where is the next generation of scientists coming from if we dont help?

They help young businesses survive and grow. They provide guidance. business tools. space. contacts. and the knowhow to run a company. Incubators can dramatically increase the success of new companies. Across the United States. incubators have already nurtured tens of thousands of new companies to great success. Their efforts have helped grow our economy and create both jobs and profit. In these challenging economic times. a good idea is often not enough to guarantee success. Many young companies need further business expertise in order to avoid failing. In my hometown of Sacramento. the CleanStart incubator is helping grow a whole suite of clean energy companies. These businesses are developing the cuttingedge technologies that will power our economy and protect our environment in the future. However. many businesses receiving SBIR grants devote most of their capital to research. This leaves little left over for business development. These are the type of businesses that can benefit most from the services provided by incubators. My amendment ensures that SBIR dollars will continue to work with incubators across the country to drive economic development. It will allow incubators to do what they do best. translate good research conducted by small businesses into commercial technologies that create jobs and economic growth.

The devastating state of this Nations crumbling infrastructure was demonstrated in dramatic fashion last August when the 135 bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River. And it is also demonstrated every day as people drive over potholes in their neighborhoods and sit in traffic jams on our crowded highways as they travel to and from work. Tackling the repair of our Nations infrastructure is not a glamorous task. but it is absolutely essential to our Nations longterm success. Investments in infrastructure are critical for public safety and boost local economies by providing more Americans with goodpaying jobs. Building our Nations infrastructure for a new economy and a new century is vital to revamping our work force and revitalizing our communities. It is also crucial that as we rebuild our roads and mass transit systems. we act as stewards of the environment and seek greener and cleaner technologies for fueling our economy.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. my amendment is very simple. It provides a voice to veteranowned small businessmen on the newly created Small Business Innovation Research Board. The advisory board will oversee the design and award process for SBIR grants. By including a veteranowned small businessman or -woman on the board. we will ensure that the criteria used towards small business grants will include areas for which our veterans specialize. areas such as weapons development and destruction. communications networking. and many more skills that have been uniquely acquired through their military service. When I was first elected last year. I formed a constituentbased Veterans Advisory Board in my district. Over the past year. I have worked very closely with these men and women to find new ways to better serve them and the veterans of our district throughout our Nation who have sacrificed so much for this great country. It is for this reason that I strongly believe that veterans need advice on the SBIR advisory board and why I have been working with the board to draft legislation to address the problems of homeless vets and to ease the transition from active duty to civilian life. When our soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines leave service after multiple deployments abroad and a tremendous sacrifice by them and their families. the least we can do is to ease their transition and help them get their businesses off the ground. I. therefore. urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The amendment requires that at least one veteran small business owner must serve on the SBIR Advisory Board that H.R. 5819 establishes in section 104.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize and applaud the special efforts of Lynne and Bernie Butcher to restore and revitalize the Tallman Hotel. one of the most historically significantbut long neglectedstructures in Lake County. California. The original Tallman Hotel was built in the 1870s as a stage stop in the town of Upper Lake by Lake County pioneers Rufus and Mary Tallman. The hotel was part of a fullservice facility consisting of hotel. livery stable and saloon designed to serve passengers traveling to Clear Lake and the nearby hot springs resorts. In 1895. the Hotel burned to the ground but was rebuilt by Tallman the next year. The Blue Wing Saloon next door was closed and torn down during Prohibition in the early 1920s. The economic fortunes of the Hotel declined and the building was essentially abandoned in 1962. The Butchers bought the derelict hotel in 2003 and were determined to authentically restore the building to its former glory. Using period photographs as a guide. they also rebuilt the Blue Wing Saloon and Cafe next door. Great care was taken to retain. recondition and reuse original materials and to maintain the essential soul of the old hotel building. In recognition of their success. the Butchers recently received an annual preservation award from the California Heritage Council. The hotel is now drawing tourists into the county and the cafe is a very popular spot for locals and visitors alike. The Butchers have not only beautifully restored a historically significant building. but the project has also acted as a catalyst in the economic revitalization of the Town of Upper Lake and the entire north shore region of Lake County. Madam Speaker and colleagues. at this time it is appropriate that we recognize and acknowledge the dynamic work of my friends Lynne and Bemie Butcher in restoring the historic Tallman Hotel. Their efforts have brought a wonderful building back into use. and in doing so they have provided new energy and excitement in northern Lake County.",

Church has a very storied past. It was first organized in a creek bottom on Abe Johnsons Farm in 1897 and has experienced many changes in more than a century of existence. Six months after its inception. the congregation constructed their first permanent structure. Oak planks nailed to blocks were used as benches and lighting was provided by kerosene lanterns. The Church would move to a new location on a nearby farm in 1915 and continue to meet in that location until 1926. In that year the congregation was forced to divide due to the threat of flooding as well as poorly constructed roads. which made travel to the church difficult. The remaining members stayed until 1938. when they moved to their present location. In 1944 and then again in 1968. the church was destroyed by inclement weather. however. after each misfortune the congregation was able to band together and rebuild. Today. the Johnson Chapel A.M.E. Church continues to worship and serve the community of Malakoff.

This legislation will expand research and training efforts for treatment and an eventual cure for pulmonary hypertension. while establishing a nationwide clinical research network. Pulmonary hypertension. more commonly referred to as PH. is a silent killer that increases the blood pressure in the lungs to dangerous levels. As the walls of the arteries that take blood from the right to the left side of the heart thicken and constrict. the heart must pump harder and harder. ultimately failing over time. Over the past 5 years the number of patients of this deadly disorder has increased from 3.000 in 2001 to as many as 30.000 diagnoses in 2006. Among them is my 22yearold granddaughter. Charity. who was diagnosed with PH in 2004. In following her treatment. I know all too well the need for increased education of medical professionals. With the growing number of patients. new and more effective treatments are becoming available for PH sufferers. but effective management of this condition remains complicated. It requires the close supervision of a highlytrained medical professional. and someone who is dedicated to remaining on the cuttingedge of treating this disease. I believe our bill would give the National Heart. Lung and Blood Institute the tools they need to improve collaboration among the top PH research centers and to reduce the incidents of misdiagnosis. I am hopeful that this legislation would create avenues for disseminating new and lifesaving knowledge among experts. Madam Speaker. the causes of pulmonary hypertension are still not fully understood. And it pains me to no end to note that there is no known cure. We can not waste anymore time.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of the Title V Abstinence Education program. and support its reauthorization. Without action by Congress. this important program will expire on September 30. 2007. This program provides the States that choose to accept these dollars with funding to implement abstinence education programs. In FY 2006. the State of South Carolina received over $750.000 in Title V funding. Abstinence education is working in South Carolina. A sharp decline in teen pregnancy began in 1996 after the South Carolina law established a policy that all the Title V. Section 510 dollars were to be used to implement a statewide strategy that stresses the importance of abstaining until marriage. Additionally. South Carolina set a goal to create a replicable plan with intense evaluation and feedback to be used statewide. Since the initiation of abstinence education in South Carolina. 9 years ago. South Carolina teen pregnancy rates have been reduced by 35 percent. falling from 53 (per 1.000) in 1996 to 34.3 in 2005 among 15- to 17yearolds. Parents nationwide prefer abstinence education over socalled \"comprehensive\" sex education by a 2 to 1 margin. regardless of political or religious affiliation. according to a recent Zogby poll. Abstinence education is defined by its exclusive purpose of teaching the social. psychological and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity until marriage. Abstinence education permits an ageappropriate discussion of contraception. but within the context of promoting abstinence as the healthiest choice. I am concerned that the program as reauthorized in the SCHIP bill contains new requirements for medical accuracy and proven effectiveness. These new requirements apply only to abstinence education. Placing accountability on all adolescent health programs funded by the Federal Government is an appropriate standard for the spending of Federal taxdollars and the protection of childrens health. These funds must be based on health outcomes and equally applied to all federally funded adolescent health programs. Reauthorization of the Title V Abstinence Education Program and funding is critical in supporting the majority of communities who wish to promote the optimal health message for our Nations youth. Title V Abstinence Education is working in South Carolina. and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a reauthorization of the program as it was originally designed.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor St. Dominics Parish in Breese. Illinois. For 150 years. St. Dominics has represented the spread of Catholicism in rural America and has also acted as one of its communitys cornestones. The first church building was used from 1858 to 1868 and measured 40 feet by 60 feet. In 1858 Father August Reineke was called to act as the first pastor of St. Dominics and served until 1909. A larger church was needed due to the growing number of settlers in the area. The parishioners donated the land as well as the stone and limestone for construction of the present church still in use today. The original parish began with 70 Catholic families and today has grown to 867 families. One of St. Dominics largest accomplishments was the establishment of Mater Dei High School. The man and women of St. Dominics help by reaching out to their community and world with the parishs volunteer efforts. St. Monicas Altar Sodality and St. Josephs Mens Sodality donate money to the parishs Vacation Bible School. food pantry and youth ministry. The ladies of the parish are currently sponsoring a child in Guatemala. while the men have donated over $20.000 to the new multipurpose room. I join with my fellow Representatives to congratulate St. Cominics on 150 years of faith and service.",

Chandler. former WWI and WWII veteran who has demonstrated an unyielding commitment to the service of others through 60 years of civilian service. Chandler enlisted in United States Army at Jefferson Barracks and was soon assigned to a special amphibious engineering unit activated for World War ithe 149th Engineer Combat Battalion. As a Demolition Specialist for the 149th. he joined the invasion of France on Omaha Beach in 1944. The 149th was responsible for destroying enemy bridges. probing and destroying mines and other obstacles. both on land and underwater. and for building Bailey Bridges. Following World War II.

His unit was deactivated in December of 1945 and he became part of the newly activated Organized Reserve Corps (Individual StandBy) until 1951. In 1951. Mr. Chandler entered the Civilian Service with the Missouri Military District (MMD). 11th Army Corps. St. Louis. and Missouri as a warehouseman. During this time the MMD was renamed the U.S. Army Support Center.

III. Mr. Chandler opposed relocating to Fort Sheridan and joined the staff at the U.S. Army Adjutant General Publications Center as a packer. for over 40 years. turning down General Schedule (GS) opportunities in favor of his Wage Grade (WG) packer position.

Mr. Chandlers civilian awards include the Achievement Medal for Civilian Service in September 1996. In addition. he currently has over 3300 hours of sick leave and usually forfeits almost all of his annual leave. except when he generously donates to other employees through the leave donation program. Madam Speaker. I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. Chandler. an American hero. for 60 years as a civil servant and for his noble sacrifice and courage to the United States Armed Services.

The Adult Day Services program has done visionary work serving the unique needs of the elderly. younger adults with mental and physical impairments. and those suffering from Alzheimers and other dementias. In 1979. Hospice of Napa Valley opened as a program of St. Helena Hospital. They became an independent nonprofit in 1997. and opened their acclaimed Adult Day Services program in 1998. ADS is the only program of its kind in Napa County and is one of 54 official Alzheimers Day Care Resource Centers in California. Since its inception 10 years ago. the Adult Day Services program has served more than 1.000 people. Last year alone. they served 80 people with Alzheimers or other dementia. gave family training to 129 people. provided 165 hours of support groups. 200 hours of counseling for 143 people. 30 hours of community education for 327 people. and 166 consultations for 133 people. These incredible achievements would not be possible without their dedicated staff. led by Executive Director Catherine Poliak and ADS Program Coordinator Celine Regalia. Catherine and Celine lead a team that is second to none in their creativity and enthusiasm. Madam Speaker. it is appropriate at this time that we thank everyone at Napa Valley Hospice and Adult Day Services for the remarkable work they have done for our community.

Pt. 18 St. Marys has represented Catholicism for 150 years in the community of Trenton. During the 1820s and 30s the local Catholics of Trenton gathered at the railroad station once a year to take the train to St. Louis to fulfill their Easter duty. In 1858 Fr. Peter Peters began holding mass with a small group of Catholic families in Trenton. The first church was built in 1864. Yet. it was not until 1868 that St. Marys Parish of Trenton had its first permanent pastor. Fr. Anthony Brefeld. Just two years after Fr. Brefeld took the position as pastor. St. Marys built a small school where the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ came to teach. By 1950 it was evident that a larger church was needed. In 1953 the new church was completed and by 1955. about 1.500 parishioners called St. Marys home. To help celebrate the 150th anniversary. the St. Marys family placed a \"time capsule\" into the ground at the parish. The capsule contains materials related to the parish celebration. The time capsule will be opened in 2058. 50 years from now. I join with my fellow Representatives to congratulate St. Marys on 150 years of faith and service.",

We all come from different backgrounds. but in millions of homes across the country. our celebrations look very much the same. We will gather around our dinner tables with family and friends giving thanks. This day is a reminder that we are all together in this American experiment. that we should celebrate our diversity. but also recognize our shared values. I commend to every family the publication called Americas Table: A Thanksgiving Reader. The pamphlet is short and simple. and it is meant to be read at the Thanksgiving meal or as people contemplate the meaning of Thanksgiving. This booklet tells the story of American people by sharing profiles of men and women of diverse backgrounds. I am honored to be one of the people profiled in this years publication. The American Jewish Committee began publishing Americas Table annually on the Thanksgiving after the 9/11 disaster. They partner with ten human relations organizations. including the NAACP. the National Urban League. and the National Council of La Raza to distribute this wonderful pamphlet. We all have our stories of how we came to this great land. We must use this opportunity to celebrate our differences and our oneness as Americans. I submit a copy of this years Americas Table for the RECORD. and I hope and pray that Americans will continue to use it as a way to help build the Beloved Community. a nation at peace with itself.",

The proponent of an item of appropriation carries the burden of persuasion on the question whether it is supported by an authorization in law.

The bill appropriates $45 million. and the amendment by the gentleman from Oregon appropriates another $50 million. Although the amendment would take the total for the fund to $95 million in the bill. and thus ostensibly within the authorized level. the committee report on page 112 states that an additional $55 million was appropriated by Public Law 11028. Those funds remain available until expended. Having reviewed this information. the Chair is unable to conclude that the item of appropriation in question is authorized in law.

As in any election. there were winners and losers. The opposition party won so many seats in that election that the ruling party immediately moved to limit the power of the parliament. stripping it of the power to craft a budget and allowing discussion exclusively on issues approved by the prime minister. When protests grew after several members refused to participate in the new government. violence ensued. and the opposition political leaders were arrested. Thousands of protesters were arrested since October 31. 2005. and. thankfully. most of them have been released. However. nearly 2 years later. 38 prisoners from the protest remain incarcerated.",

I rise today to speak for my constituent from Virginia Beach. Dr. Yacob HaileMariam. In 2005. Ethiopia held their national parliamentary elections. Dr. Yacob HaileMariam. a citizen of Ethiopia. resigned his position as professor at Norfolk State University and was elected to the parliament as a member of the opposition party. Soon after the election. Dr. HaileMariam was arrested. Last week. the Ethiopian tribunal. adjudicating this matter hastily and without notice. terminated the proceedings and found him guilty of the charges against him. Dr. HaileMariam faces sentencing. including the possibility of the death sentence. Mr. Chairman. the conviction of Dr. HaileMariam and other members of the opposition party is adverse to the principles of democracy. freedom and human rights that the United States promotes across the globe. More importantly. the conviction of these individuals is contrary to the commitment Ethiopia has made in recent years to engage in a civil society and establish a democratic government which respects the rule of law. due process and international principles of human rights. The injustice of Dr. HaileMariams imprisonment has been felt throughout Hampton Roads. most particularly by his loving and supportive family. I have been in contact with his brave wife. Tegist. and officials at the State Department since 2005 seeking a positive resolution to this unfortunate situation. While I do not believe decreasing funds from this particular account would expedite the release of Dr. HaileMariam.

Mr. Chairman. there is a security fence around Fort Benning. but I would not describe the home of the Infantry as a fortress by any stretch of the imagination. as my colleague just referred. Mr. Chairman. here we go again. Once more. my good friend. and he is my good friend. from Massachusetts has so confused the record that its really tough to know where to begin. But let me try. He argues that we need to shut down WHINSEC because nearly 30 years ago. several graduates of a different program. the School of the Americas. were found to have committed atrocities in their home countries. a tenuous conclusion indeed. I wonder if he would argue that we should shut down Harvard because the Unabomber actually took some classes there. Mr. Chairman. of course he wouldnt. Because my friend knows that when a student does something awful years after graduating. you cant reasonably hold the school accountable. And to do so would let one mans action deny thousands more the opportunity to grow and to learn. Essentially it would be throwing the baby out with the bath water. So lets set the record straight. Mr. Chairman. Over 60.000 members of Latin American security forces have trained at WHINSEC and its predecessor since the inception of the school. 99.99 percent have served their countries with honor and distinction. This is the fact. In order to ensure that known human rights offenders are not attending WHINSEC. potential participants undergo background checks by the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. the Bureau of Democracy. Human Rights and Labor and the Department of State. not vetted by WHINSEC. So I am proud to say. Mr. Chairman. that not one single credible accusation of human rights violations has been lodged against a graduate of WHINSEC. Not one. And I dont want the gentleman or my colleagues necessarily to take my word for this.

By prohibiting any funding in this bill from being used for the Westerni Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. formerly the infamous U.S. Army School of the Americas located at Fort Benning. Georgia. we can stand up for human rights. we can honor our principles and send a strong message to the world. The School of the Americas has been associated with human rights abuses. with many of its students linked to Latin American coups and vicious death squads. In 1989. graduates from the school killed six Jesuit priests. a housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador. And today they have a new name. but they have not changed the schools old patterns of abuse and conflict. The institute continues admitting and graduating known human rights abusers. Yes. Colonel Francisco del Cid Diaz. for example. who commanded a unit responsible for a notorious massacre of indigenous people in El Salvador in 1983. then attended the institute on our own soil as recently as 2003. And there are others just like him. It is clear that the institute continually fails not only to fully investigate the prior history of its students but also to track their activity after graduation. That is why nations like Costa Rica. Argentina and Uruguay have terminated their relationship with the institute. It is clear neither those nations nor this one have anything to gain by supporting an institution with such a marred. violent history. One hundred sixtyseven U.S. Catholic bishops agree. They have written Congress in support of this amendment and called for the institutes closure. recognizing that many of its graduates have consistently targeted Catholic clergy and lay workers across Latin America. As a Congresswoman. a Catholic and an American. I believe every action that we take sends the whole world a clear message about our priorities and values as a Nation. I urge my colleagues to support the McGovern amendment. make it clear we are serious about human rights and that the United States of America does not train murderers or killers and that we take the loss of human life seriously. 0I 2000",

Nobody has addressed the fact that. up until just now. we would have access. There was public access to the people who went to the WHINSEC.

We understand that unlike its predecessor. the School of the Americas. WHINSEC has a substantial human rights component that goes well beyond the training required by law. In fact. at a recent HASC hearing. Admiral Stavridis. the Commander of Southern Command. referred to WrHINSEC as the militarys crown jewel for human rights training. Mr. Chairman. as weve made clear. those who advocate cutting funding for WHINSEC do so in the absence of fact. WHINSEC has a spotless human rights record and a tremendous record of success in the Western Hemisphere. I urge all my colleagues. please vote \"no\" on the McGovern amendment.",

The State of New York asked for a waiver to cover those people under $83.000 of income. They were refused under the SCHIP program. but that refusal became a fact. The fact is that we have never enacted legislation that covers people above $41.000. $63.000. I think $60.000 will be the number now. But. look. this is about kids.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin. and I would like to talk a little bit about this. This issue we are discussing is a program which has proven to be highly successful. It was put in to understand and address the issue that if you do not treat children with preventive medical care. you will treat them with chronic care down the road. Or you will treat them in a setting that is much more expensive. like in the emergency room. This President is mischaracterizing what is going on here. The President is talking about some of the myths that he is putting out there to make this appear like this is some type of governmentrun health care program. Now I find it a bit ironic and a little bit disingenuous that there are Members who sit in this body tonight who would vote against SCHIP. yet receive governmentpaidfor health care coverage. These are children who do not have the choice. President Bush. using the $83.000 level. is simply doing it. and these are not my words. Take a look at this. This was USA Today talking about what they call the $83.000 question. \"Bushs claim is misleading at best. simply wrong at worst. The House would do well to look past the Presidents deceptive rhetoric and override this veto.\" October 17. 2007 CONGRE The President is misleading the public on exactly what this does. This is not the way to have this debate. This Nation needs to have an open. honest debate. Do we value our children to the point that we are willing to invest in basic preventive health care? And it is a question that stretches from Minnesota to Iowa to Wisconsin and across to our good friend out in California. I am glad to be joined tonight by Mr. McNERNEY who. coming from the most populous State. understands the issues that face this. and understands that when a program is administered in coordination with the State at a local level. that invests in preventive care. that is a very conservative notion. and it is one that this Nation would be well served to. as our friends at USA Today said. look past the rhetoric. I yield to the gentleman from California.",

    "speech": "I thank my friend from Minnesota. Madam Speaker. the President turned his back on about 10 million American children that he could have protected. I am actually appalled by this decision to veto funding for childrens health insurance. and his rejection of support from nearly every U.S. Governor and almost threequarters of the American people. The Childrens Health Insurance Program is a good program. It is worthy and efficient. It costs less than $3.50 per day per child. However. rather than protecting our children. this President put at risk nearly 45.000 of the children in my district and millions of children across the United States. As the cost of health care continues to rise. which it will. its reckless to oppose a plan that covers our countrys most needy children. Let me tell you what Im talking about in more personal terms. Its going to cost a family of four about $750 a month for health insurance. Thats about $9.000 a year. If youre earning $45.000. you have a family of four. $9.000 is completely out of reach. and this follows on my good friend from Wisconsin. You have to pay for gasoline. you have to pay for your car. for your transportation. about $1.000 to $2.000 for your mortgage. How on Earth are you going to be able to afford $9.000 a year for health insurance? Youre going to be forced to take your children to the emergency rooms when their situations are critical. So the Childrens Health Insurance Program is very important. Its needed. Our children need to have that.",

It goes to every State. and every State that we have in the Union fashions their own program. whether or not they choose to cover the mother of a child. Listen. as a doctor. I have to tell you. in 30 years of practicing medicine. I have never seen a child in my examination room without the mother or a caregiver that was responsible for the children. So we. in Wisconsin. cover the parent. the mother. as well in order to increase the enrollment in this program. This reauthorization of this SCHIP program. its primary intent is not just to retain the 3.8 million children who are covered. but to expand it to all the children in the country who are already eligible and to expand it from 200 percent of Federal poverty level up to 300 percent. So. if I understand the facts. the facts are these. Its a Staterun private program. Poorest working families are the focus. It costs $3.50 a day per child to keep them covered. and we hope to cover 10.4. 10.8 million children across the country. So these are the facts as I understand them. Covers kids up to age 19. is that right? And did you hear the same argument that I heard on this floor. that it might cover illegal aliens? Is that a fact?",

Id like my colleagues who are here tonight to take a walk down memory lane with me. because many of us got our motivation to run for office as a result of the 2004 Presidential elections. And if you remember back with me to September 2. 2004. at the Republican National Convention. this is what our President George Bush said about his commitment to childrens health care. He said. Americas children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term. we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible. but not signed up. for the governments health insurance programs. the very same programs were talking about here tonight. He begins again. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need. Thats what our President said as he stood on the brink of his second nomination. Now. I want to take you back to what was one of the most memorable nights of my life. my first State of the Union address. which took place right in this Chamber. January 23. 2007. I sat in here with all of my new colleagues listening to the direction from our President on what he was going to do to lead us in a new direction on health care. What did he say on this subject? When it comes to health care. government has an obligation to care for the elderly. the disabled and poor children. We will meet those responsibilities. Well. his words dont mesh with his actions in vetoing this important legislation. and that is why it is important for us. on behalf of those children.

Health care for the rich and those in government? The rest of us can just die or try and live with broken bones and illness. I think the American people are beginning to understand whose side were on and where we need to be going in this country. We cannot allow this veto to stand. Its morally unacceptable. Its bad for our business. Its bad for the health of our Nation.

Madam Speaker. and my colleagues in this House. of what this body does to represent the American people. And if my colleagues who are undecided as of now want to know where the American people are at. the latest poll just came out from CBS News. This is the largest one done to date on this. and here are the factors: Would you favor the Democratic version of expanding SCHIP? Eightyone percent of people in this country. in Iowa. in California. Minnesota. in Wisconsin. in Florida. in Georgia. across this Nation. agree. Now. here is the real kicker. This is the part I think for us to listen and to hear this. They look at that picture. They see that little baby. they see that mother. And this Nations heart is where it is at. They know exactly what we need to do. They even went so far as to ask them a tough question. Keep in mind. under this new House leadership over the last 9 months. we have to balance the budget. We have to go by PAYGO. It is no more paying and letting the children in the future pay for it. That is not happening on this. So under this piece of legislation. they even asked people in this poll: Would you be willing to pay more taxes to expand to this program? Seventyfour percent said yes. Seventyfour percent of the American public is willing to give their tax dollars to help fellow American children receive the health care that they know they so richly deserve. And the issue of that is. is this Nation knows it is morally right. it is fiscally right. and it invests in the future.

School districts will be able to provide these services without cutting into their general education budgets. And local property tax payers will get relief.

Let not the hatred be contagious or fester in our impurient nature. Free the news of gruesome details which only burn the imaginative memory. Instead.

Lord. help us to see part of ourselves. for we are united in You. now and forever. Amen.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. the Bush administration has gotten what they wished for. The Supreme Court has upheld a ban on a medical procedure for women without a health exception. thereby reversing four decades of rulings supporting a womans right to choose. Women who face serious health consequences have lost their right to the safest procedure available. Politicians have taken the place of doctors. Women have become a pawn in the hands of rightwing conservatives. On my Web site. I keep a listing of all the ways this administration has chipped away at a womans right to choose. but yesterday they used a sledgehammer. By upholding this ban and disregarding years of precedent. the Roberts court has shown not only its belief that women are secondclass citizens. but also its potential to completely overturn Roe. We need to stand up to rightwing. conservative. extremist efforts and protect the basic human rights of women.",

Just 3 months into this new Congress. the Democrats have shown their vision for America with a more than $400 billion budget increase. an increase which can only be paid for through a colossal scale of taxation that will reach nearly every American. The Federal Government has created a monster. Today. our Tax Code and regulations bulge at over 60.000 pages. I have yet to meet anyone who has read all of them. Americans pay billions of dollars to accountants and financial advisers just to comply with this labyrinth of rules. More than 50 percent of all taxpayers pay someone else to prepare their tax returns. Planning for the future is challenging enough without the added headache of complex taxes and confusing deductions. not to mention the uncertainty of how taxes may change from one year to the next. Congress has the moral responsibility to remove the obstacles it has created that punish Americans who are simply working hard to achieve their dreams. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to overhaul our cumbersome tax system.",

Today. more than 16 million Americans have joined the ranks of the new \"sandwich generation.\" those working Americans who provide care for both their own children and for their aging parents. Yesterday. I introduced legislation to provide more tax relief for working families who provide dependent care for their children or parents. My legislation does two things. First. it would extend the full benefit of the dependent care tax credit to allow more middleclass families to receive tax relief for the child and elder care expenses they must incur in order to work. Secondly. the bill expands the credit to include all older dependent parents. not just those who live with the taxpayer. This makes it easier for families to care for their loved ones. while providing the flexibility to maintain a living situation more suited to the familys unique needs. Mr. Speaker.

Approximately 600 people were killed in violent clashes across Kenya. following disputed presidential elections that took place on December 27. 2007. Violence erupted in Kenya after President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner of the election and opposition leader Raila Odinga disputed the results. European Union observers have said the presidential poll was flawed and the Government of Kenya has acknowledged that voting irregularities took place. Unfortunately. the effects of postelection violence in Kenya continue to echo throughout the country. An estimated 250.000 people have been forced from their homes and are in need of food. shelter. and medicine. Human rights activists and aid workers are concerned that families displaced by the conflict will be unable to return to their homesmany of which were burned downin the near future. Though the fighting has subsided from its peak immediately after the elections in late December. tension remains high between political opponents divided along ethnic lines. There continues to be incidences of violence. demonstrations. and looting in several neighborhoods of Nairobi and Mombasa and in large parts of the westernmost provinces. The time has come for both the government and the opposition to enter into a good faith dialog for the benefit and welfare of the Kenyan people. who deserve a political process that reflects their dedication to transparency. democracy and progress. Therefore. it is vital for President Kibaki and Raila Odinga to come together without preconditions to discuss how to end the postelectoral crisis in a way that reflects the will of the Kenyan people. Additionally. both leaders must take steps to end the violence and ensure respect for the rule of law and respect for human rights. The full restoration of freedom of the press and freedom of peaceful assembly is an integral part of this goal. Madam Speaker. our hearts go out to the people of Kenya who have suffered throughout the postelection ordeal and I urge the Kenyan Government and the opposition to resolve this crisis for the benefit of their people.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to celebrate the 35th Anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. Since 1973. women in this country have exercised choice over their health and the future of their lives. Celebration of this landmark decision is a celebration of Americas commitment to uphold freedom and liberty for all. According to the National Abortion Federation. abortion was actually legal. common. and publicly advertised until the mid 1880s. When abortions became illegal. many women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to selfinduce their abortions or by going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. Prior to this 1973 decision. women with economic means were able to access medical assistance. (however illegal) while poor women in desperation were forced to subject themselves to backalley abortions and the subsequent consequences to health. dignity. and privacy. According to the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide today are attributable to unsafe abortionbetween 68.000 and 78.000 deaths annually. Equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. It has been accurately stated. \"Where abortion is safe and legal. no one is forced to have one\"--Human Rights Watch. Having a choice and access to a safe abortion is an enormous concern. estimated to affect one in three American women by the age of 45National Abortion Federation. In many countries. the denial of reproductive choices makes women succumb to second rate citizenship. further perpetuating the feminization of poverty. Where women are able to exercise choice. they are in control of their opportunities without intrusion by their government. Any restriction on such a choice offends fundamental liberties. The social. economic and physical consequences of denying women choice are devastating. Because of our global position as a model of democracy and freedom. it is imperative that we stand to acknowledge this decision of the Supreme Court that affirms womens jurisdiction over their bodies and extends the message that the United States is a country which affirms reproductive choice. May we forever remain a Nation that does not corner its citizens. but rather respects their capacity to make decisions over their health and future pursuits. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 154. Pt. 1",

As Congress tackles climate change legislation and examines ways to promote energy efficiency. it is so important that the Federal Government set a proper example. taking the lead in commonsense conservation measures. Some would say this is an amendment that sets a shining example for the rest of the country. The Federal Government has to be the worlds largest consumer of light bulbs. and with this amendment. we will likely save American taxpayers probably as much as $100 million. Why Energy Star light bulbs? Well. current incandescent bulbs on store shelves are obsolete. and theyre highly inefficient. In fact. only 10 percent of the energy consumed by each bulb is for light. with 90 percent wasted on unnecessary heat. Energy Star light bulbs use about 75 percent less energy than the standard incandescent bulbs. as they last as much as 10 times longer. In fact. if every house in the Nation switched to Energy Star bulbs. we would have the potential to annually reduce the emissions equivalent of 80 coalburning plants each year. saving 65 billion kilowatts.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. the bill here at issue. the socalled RESTORE Act. undermines the existing structure that we put in place to reform FISA only 3 months ago. In the midst of a war. any changes to the way that our intelligence community operates should be understood as a somber and delicate undertaking that requires great care. Our national security hangs in the balance. We cannot afford to get this wrong. Mr. Speaker. My amendment aimed to deal with the seriously flawed provision of the RESTORE Act that will do great damage to the civil liberties of the protections of Americans. My amendment would have stricken section 11 of the bill that directs the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to jointly maintain a recordkeeping system of U.S. persons whose communications are intercepted. Mr. Speaker. this would amount to a big government database that would have individuals identity attached in every practical way. There is simply no way to have a database like this that does not attach individual identities to verify the process. The Democrats maintain that the identity is not attached. But this is an impractical rebuttal. Mr. Speaker. the proposals not only misguided. it attempts ostensibly to protect Americans civil liberties and only undermines them further. And we have to understand that these identities would be attached. even if they have no connection to spying or terrorism. And the bottom line is this. Mr. Speaker. this war on terrorism is ultimately fought in the area of intelligence. If we knew where every terrorist was tonight. in 60 days this war would be over. And if we tie those peoples hands who are fighting to protect this country with this RESTORE Act by the majority. I believe that we will some day revisit this issue. Mr. Speaker. because when a terrible tragedy comes on this country. it will transform this debate in the most profound way. and we need to be very. very careful.

I think it was Benjamin Franklin who once said that any country who gives up its liberty for its security deserves neither and will end up losing both. And I think clearly this bill takes that into consideration. This bill clearly provides for security for our country. It clearly provides our Intelligence Community with the ability to obtain information that it needs and use that and analyze it in a way that keeps America safe to prevent another 9/11 activity. At the same time. this bill also protects Americans rights and gives us the ability to prevent wiretapping of Americans here in this country. Were not talking about foreigntoforeign.

Second. and most important. we have to balance it with protecting the civil rights of our citizens. As we talk about protecting this country. we have to keep in mind that this country was founded on the principle of the rule of law. The rule of law protects its citizens. Under the Protect America Act. as we have seen over the course of the last few weeks. many. many concerns have been raised about the authorities that have been given to the government. authorities that would render our citizens not being able to protect and be secure in our homes and in our possessions. The Protect America Act has given so many authorities that people are not safe and secure in their own homes. The government can go in there and search their computers. search their residences. and search literally every possession that Americans have. This legislation corrects those deficiencies. This legislation is a careful balance in keeping our country safe. as well as securing the rights of Americans in their homes.",

As has been stated. this bill would designate a portion of Californias State Route 91 in Los Angeles County as the Juanita MillenderMcDonald Highway. This is a very fitting tribute to our former colleague Congresswoman MillenderMcDonald. Congresswoman MillenderMcDonald was a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for over 10 years. Beginning when she was first elected to Congress in April of 1996. she was a tireless advocate for transportation issues impacting her district. including projects related to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and the Alameda Corridor freight railroad project. She was also a leader on national transportation issues. She took her experience in dealing with freight mobility challenges in southern California and founded the Congressional Goods Movement Caucus. Through her position on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and in her role with the Congressional Goods Movement Caucus. Congresswoman MillenderMcDonald promoted transportation projects necessary to facilitate interstate commerce while protecting communities from the adverse effects associated with freight movement. She rose to the level of being a full committee chairwoman in this Congress. and she was respected and admired on both sides of the aisle. More importantly than all of this. than all of her work in Congress. Juanita MillenderMcDonald was just a good human being. She was a friend of mine. and I knew from discussions I had with her how much she loved her family and her friends. She was beautiful in appearance and was so dignified and professional in every way and set such a good example for all of us. She served the people of her district and this Nation well and with great honor and distinction. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill honoring a good friend.

I was ranking member. The word that comes to mind the second I think about her is \"elegance.\" She was a very elegant person. I mean that in a very positive sense. Im not talking just about elegance in dress. elegance in bearing. but to the core of her being she was an elegant. wonderful human being. I enjoyed working with her. We accomplished a lot together on the committee. We obviously had our differences now and then. but we always worked through them. And what always struck me as something really wonderful about her and about our Nation. and to show how far weve come. that a sharecroppers daughter could become the Chair of a major committee in the Congress of the United States. Thats amazing. but it speaks very well of her in the way she comported herself. the way she had taught herself. the accomplishments that she had made during her life. Just a very remarkable person in every way. The only regret I had was that she never shared with me anything about her illness or the seriousness of her illness. I believe she felt she had to carry that burden alone. And I would have been delighted and honored had she shared with me more of the details so that I could help her on this journey towards death. and that I could have been at her side praying with her and comforting her. But its just a great delight to see this honor bestowed upon her. I certainly hope this is an elegant highway that were dedicating to her. because it would be befitting of her and her accomplishments. and above all. her presence as a human being. that this highway reflect her greatness. her elegance. her ability. and her dedication to her people and to this Nation.

H.R. 2722. which passed the House by a vote of 4260 last year. and on S. 924. which passed the Senate by unanimous consent. The managers amendment amends the underlying bill by making it a crime to operate a submersible vehicle that is not registered in any country. Such vessels are often used to smuggle illegal drugs into the United States. In fact. just this month the Coast Guard worked with the United States Navy to seize two such submersibles. carrying a combined total of 14 tons of cocaine. As a representative of the City of Baltimore. I know that every gram of illegal drugs we keep off our Nations streets is a gram that cannot destroy a life or a community. Therefore. as smugglers develop new ways to bring drugs to our shores. our laws must be updated to enable law enforcement personnel to prosecute these new types of crimes. and this bill does precisely that.

The STB would be required to consider public impact on communities. including public safety. grade crossing safety. hazardous materials transportation. emergency response. noise pollution. socioeconomic impacts. and commuter rail. After review. if the adverse impacts on communities are significant or outweigh the potential benefits to commerce. then the STB would be required to disapprove or mitigate accordingly. This is not about a particular transaction. And contrary to concerns expressed by some. it should not have a chilling effect on the ability to increase necessary rail capacity across this country. It also shouldnt adversely affect traditional rail mergers or acquisitions which dont significantly change traffic levels or community impact and are only changing a parent company.

I am genuinely concerned that H.R. 6707 may actually have an adverse impact on our rail system. particularly as it relates to rural communities. In rural areas of our country. at one time we had strong railroad service which contributed a great deal to the economic development in rural America. I am very much concerned that this legislation. while it has every good intention of protecting local communities. will actually be a chill to continued rail service in a lot of small communities. The Rail Transportation Safety Board already is required to look. on rail mergers and acquisitions. to look at the public interest standard and must evaluate that. I am just concerned that this additional requirement will really be a chilling effect and will adversely impact rail service in rural America which will have an adverse impact on all of us. particularly at this time when energy prices. being as high as they are. we know that we can transport goods by rail cheaper which makes us more competitive in the global marketplace.

I believe the chairman would agree. that the industry has to continue to evolve. It has to continue to grow. But today. the industry is here and the people of the United States are here. What Mr. OBERSTAR. what the chairman is trying to do is to make sure as the industry evolves and becomes more efficient and more profitable. which we all want. that people are considered equally. Secondly. he mentions that this is simply a fight about one transaction and one community. the City of Chicago. He is incorrect in his assertion. The fact is there is a transaction pending. It highlights the need for this legislation. While he suggests the congestion of Chicago. I would point out that every one of those trains in Chicago happens to go through Lake and Porter counties. Indiana. which I represent. The gentleman also suggested that there might be some costs attached to the industry if this act passed. $25 million here. $40 million here. The fact is we voted in this Chamber to the auto industry $25 billion. We voted within the week to give the battery industry a couple of billion dollars. People are tripping over themselves in this place. tripping over themselves in this place. to give millions of brokers and bankers $700 billion. What about people? What about the people of this country? Thats what Mr. OBERSTAR is trying to say. instead of the railroads and the people. lets have some equity as far as these future considerations. I would simply point out this is somewhat personal to me. In 1977. my mother was hit by a train. She survived the experience. But more pertinent to this debate. the Surface Transportation Board indicated that railroads historically have not paid more than a small share for grade separation.",

Robert Kimball. founder and chairman of the board. As a military veteran and respected businessman. Mr. Kimball is the epitome of the American entrepreneur. His original twoperson civil engineering company. founded in 1953. has grown to a fullservice architecture. engineering. technology. and consulting firm of over 600 staff serving a wide variety of clients. including the Federal Government. Mr. Kimball served as a U.S. Army Air Corps Captain in World War II and as a Major in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Korean conflict. Among his World War II military decorations are the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. and the French Croix de Guerre. He is also a recipient of the Chapel of the Four Chaplains Legion of Honor Award. Following his military service. Mr. Kimball returned to his hometown of Ebensburg. Pennsylvania. and established the company known as \"L. Robert Kimball. Civil Engineer.\" In the 1960s. the firm began providing service to branches of the United States military. Today. Kimball provides professional services to. among others. the Department of Homeland Security. the Department of Defense. the Department of Justice. the Environmental Protection Agency. and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Those services include cuttingedge building. innovative modeling. laser terrain scanning. and telecommunication system modernization. The firms reputation for consistent delivery of highcaliber services is a direct result of the discipline and integrity that L. Robert Kimball instilled throughout the company. The example he sets of leadership and teamwork can be traced back to his military service to the United States of America as a lead navigator for the 100th Bomb Group. where he set the flight course. It was a matter of life and death to make the right decisions and to work as a team to look out for the others in the squadron. Those principles apply to the course he sets for staff. He encourages every employee to be a good professional and a good citizen. With that. Madam Speaker. I recognize and congratulate Mr. L. Robert Kimball.",

When Mr. Harrison is not in the classroom or on the campus of Waldron High School. he can be found at the Waldron First Baptist Church where he serves as Deacon and is actively involved in his churchs ministry. He is also a proud uncle. whose devotion to his family is second to none. Eddie Harrisons presence in the classroom will be greatly missed by the students. faculty and staff of Waldron High School. where his legacy of excellence will forever be remembered. I know that his heart will never drift far from Waldron. and that he will continue to be a fixture in the community and a role model for all that have the opportunity to know him.

Pt. 17 It is long past time for the United States to officially recognize the massacre of one and a half million Armenians early in the 20th century for what it undeniably was: Genocide. Year. after year. after year. Ive been proud to cosponsor the Armenian Genocide resolution. Last year. over 150 House members cosponsored this important legislation to properly recognize the Armenian Genocide. This year. the resolution has already received 226 cosponsorships. a majority of the Members of the House. This impressive number reflects the broad bipartisan support for an official recognition of the Armenian Genocide. Countries all around the world have adopted similar resolutions to ensure that the atrocities committed against the Armenian people are properly recognized as acts of Genocide. Canada. France. Switzerland. Greece. and Poland all have passed resolutions affirming the recognition of the Genocide. Properly recognizing the Armenian Genocide here in America is essential to ensure that all past genocides are never forgotten and all future atrocities are never permitted. The writer Milan Kundera once wrote that \"The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.\" There are those that would deny the Armenian Genocide. just as there are those that deny the reality of the Nazi Holocaust. In commemorating the Armenian Genocide as we will do with this Resolution. we collectively engage in that struggle of memory against forgetting. The dangers of forgetting are realas Adolph Hitler plotted the Holocaust. he was emboldened by the failure of the international community to note the first genocide of the 20th century. writing in 1939 \"Who still talks nowadays of the extermination of the Armenians?\" But this resolution is not just intended as a remembrance of a dark past. but as a way of animating future policies with a commitment to prevent such things from ever happening again. as well as a step towards building a better future for the Armenian people and for all people.

As of the end of August. 50 facilities had not received payments just in my State of Iowa. The payments not received cover 2.466 apartments. Twentytwo percent of those projects were designated as \"family projects.\" and 78 percent are elderly or disabled projects or a combination of the two. Some of those facilities were still waiting for their June and July payments when the August payments failed to arrive. As of yesterday. I understand that about 20 projects in Iowa which have reached their contract expiration date at the end of June. July. or August still have not seen the routine work to renew the contracts. and payments have not been received in Iowa. I expect that Iowa is typical of the Nation in this regard. The failure to make timely payments not only results in added costs to owners. it creates a chill on future investments in lowincome housing. With that chill. I fear that the number of lowincome housing units available to families and the elderly in need will be reduced. I urge that the committee work to provide for methods and requirements as well as financial resources so HUD will provide proper timely payments to all projectbased section 8 projects in the coming fiscal year.

Those projects totaled $1.35 million and were for economic development efforts in North Dakota. Montana. and Louisiana. This was a difficult decision for me. I believe that the earmarking process in the past decade has ballooned out of control at a cost of billions of dollars to taxpayers. I dont believe that all earmarks. per se. are bad. but that as a general policy. we need more transparency in this process. and I believe that competitive and formula grants are a better way to assure that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately. However. I am uncomfortable with cherrypicking which earmarks are worthy and which ones are wasteful. There were dozens and dozens of earmarks totaling tens of millions of dollars in this bill. Why pick on just three? I. however. did support an amendment to take money designated for all of the earmarked transportation projects in this bill and transfer it to fund national urgent priorities such as emergency bridge repairs. This will be a long process to cut down. and even eliminate. many congressional earmarks and other kinds of Government waste. Frankly. earmarks are just the easiest and most obvious target. Billions of dollars are spent every year by the Federal Government on nobid contracts. for example. And we are nowhere near preventing this wasteful pattern of spending. But progress is being made on the earmark front. Congress passed a comprehensive ethics bill that provides more transparency in the earmark process. Due to pressure from the American public demanding change. we have seen fewer earmarks in this years appropriations bill. According to the administrations Office of Management and Budget. this very TransportationHUD bill contains half the amount of earmarks compared to its last version from 2006. However. there is still much work to be done. and as a fiscal conservative and former auditor. I will continue my efforts to fight to change the way the Federal Government does business with taxpayers dollarswhether it is Congress or the administration.",

It would have been easy for the bright spotlight of fame to have drawn our good friend Garfield away from his humble Indiana roots.

Muncies favorite fat cat appears in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip character. appearing in around 2.580 publications each day. Madam Speaker. as we struggle with another Monday and find ourselves longing for a lasagna dinner. Americans have turned for thirty years to their friends Garfield. Jon. and Odie.

Garfield ate so much pasta that he threatened to put an Italian restaurant out of business. and was rescued to the relief of millions of Americans who have been touched through his inspiring blend of cynicism. complacency. and mediocrity. As Americans have gone from typewriters to BlackBerry and hatchbacks to SUVs. Garfield has remained a symbol of stability in an everchanging world. Despite the turbulence of the past 30 years.

I rise today in full support of H.R. 1372. which celebrates the University of Nebraska at Omahas 100 years of service and partnership between the City of Omaha and its citizens. Founded in 1908. Omaha. Nebraska and Bellevue citizens worked together to create a nonsectarian university where local high school residents could receive a college education. Starting with only 26 students in their first class. the University of Nebraska at Omaha has blossomed into an esteemed university. Today. the University enrolls almost 14.000 students and offers a diverse range of academic courses. With only 71 undergraduate majors. 45 masters degree programs. 17 graduate certificates and six doctoral programs. UNO possesses a wide array of courses for its students. The school makes a tremendous social and financial impact on its students and city. Students receive a quality college education. and the school generates $350 million per year for the community. UNOs unique history speaks to its accepting and inclusive culture. UNO started off as the University of Omaha. Due to financial difficulties and the high number of students who wanted to attend. in 1929 the board of trustees voted to establish a municipal university. The newly named Municipal University of Omaha prospered and relocated to its final location on 60th and Dodge Streets in the fall of 1936. Later the university regents agreed to merge with the University of Nebraska. As a result. University of Nebraska at Omaha was born. That merger created a more sustainable and affordable college education. a principle the school lives by today. Mr. Speaker. once again. I express my full support for the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This is the numbersixthratedintheNation University of Nebraska at Omaha Division II football. That is a distinction that. once made. garnered a lot more supporters. So when it comes to voting. I want to make that distinction. In October of 1908. 26 students gathered to form the first class at the University of Omaha. achieving the goal the city fathers decreed to create a nonsectarian university where local high school graduates could receive a college education. Over the tumultuous years ahead. the University of Omaha grew in size and reputation. outgrowing its original buildings and then relocating to its current home near Memorial Park in what was then the far west edge of the town and now known as \"Midtown.\" In time. the University of Omaha would be known as the Municipal University of Omaha and in 1968 would become part of the University of Nebraska system. developing doctoral programs in conjunction with the flagship campus in Lincoln. as well as a number of independent programs in the field of public administration and criminal justice. UNO. as it then would become to be known. would become known for its remarkable programs in engineering. IS&T. and technology fields that are housed in the Peter Kiewit Institute as well as the universitys renowned aviation program. Today the University of Nebraska at Omaha has a significant impact on eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. serving over 250 communities and contributing nearly $300 million in economic impact to that area. With a current enrollment of nearly 15.000 students. the University of Nebraska at Omaha has grown significantly and in measurable ways. It has bettered the lives of the citizens of Omaha and has taken its place among some of the finest public universities of its size in the region. Mr. Speaker. I urge my fellow Members to vote in favor of this resolution in recognition of a truly unique and outstanding educational institution as it celebrates its 100th anniversary in October of this year.

Of these. nearly 3 million. or 60 percent. will become lost from their families or loved ones or caretakers. If not found within 24 hours. up to half will become seriously injured or die. H.R. 6503. the Missing Alzheimers Disease Patient Alert Program. will increase the chance of locating missing persons suffering from this disease within the critical first 24 hours. H.R. 6503 authorizes funds for grants for nonprofit organizations to assist in paying for the costs of establishing and operating programs to protect and locate missing patients with Alzheimers disease. With police departments now being called upon to find missing elderly. these community organizations are critical in assisting law enforcement officials with their searches. Tips from family and people in the community often lead to the whereabouts of any missing person. including the elderly. Each year. thousands more Americans are being diagnosed with Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia. The symptoms of these diseases often leave their victims feeling disoriented. lost. and vulnerable. H.R. 6503. the Missing Alzheimers Disease Patient Alert Program. provides support to those local programs working everyday to offer these patients protection and their loved ones some peace of mind. I might add here that just this weekend I found out a dear friend of mine was recently diagnosed with Alzheimers. Hes been a longdistance runner for all of his adult life. and ironically enough. hes still able to go out and find trails and run on them. but it is something that his doctors are concerned about for him that one day will he. too. become one who is perhaps lost as he tries to negotiate his community and his neighborhood. Certainly for folks like my friend and others around the country who are suffering from dementia. early states or later. we have to recognize the value and importance of this bill.

As an artist. she was an inspiration. As a person. she was a beacon of life as she brought to life the features of great people. She often said that \"great people should have great monuments.\" Her work includes abolitionist Frederick Douglass at the African American Museum of Birmingham and featured in the movie. \"Akeelah and the Bee\". Rev. Martin Luther King in Las Vegas. Nevada. botanist George Washington Carver at the St. Louis Botanical Garden. Sojourner Truth. City Hall Park. Battle Creek. Michigan. and more recently. entertainer Sammy Davis. Jr. Tina worked on projects big and small. She was best known for her monumental statue of \"Roots\" author. Alex Haley. which was installed at Haleys Heritage Park in Knoxville. Tennessee in 1998. Her hands were able to create lifelike images from simple mounds of clay. As a result of her work. Tina was interviewed as a featured artist on the \"Best of CBS Sunday Morning.\" Ms. Allen was a child prodigy in sculpture and at age 11 was taken under the wing of internationally renowned abstract sculptor. William Zorach. After earning her BFA from the University of South Alabama in Mobile. she continued her studies in New York and also in Italy. To her family and friends.

Consumer product safety is not an area that we can afford to ignore. and this historic legislation that were passing today is a tremendous victory for consumers. This year dangerous toy and product recalls are happening at an unprecedented rate. I remember just a couple of months ago reading a story in my local paper about possible lead contamination and the paint on plastic Easter eggs. That is unacceptable. For far too long weve been reading story upon story about dangerous toys and contaminated food. Imports from foreign countries continue to grow. and many manufacturers from foreign countries fail to adhere to even basic safety standards. The American people should not have to worry about the safety of the products they use or the toys that they give their children to play with. Last year. more than 25 million toys were recalled in the U.S.. and 80 percent of all toys sold in the United States are imported from China. This relationship between the growing import safety crisis and American trade policy is notable and requires us to strengthen our oversight here at home. To do that. the Consumer Product Safety Commission needs to have the resources to help protect our families and then they need to do it. Our bill strengthens the CPSC and ensures American families are protected from dangerous toys. and this legislation bans lead beyond a minute amount in many products. creating the toughest lead standard in the world. Madam Speaker. my constituents deserve to know that their government is doing everything it can to keep their families safe. Today with passage of this bill. we are upholding that responsibility. I thank you again. Chairman DINGELL. and your committee for all of your hard work. and thanks to Speaker PELOSI for making this issue a priority.

In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves. only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape. lax enforcement. and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007. compared with only 5 million toys in 2006. and its the American consumer. especially children. who are suffering. Its become glaringly obvious that we cant rely on manufacturers to police themselves. we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country. This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way were operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commissions ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules. Im pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products. On the other hand. Im disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in childrens toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million. the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Its my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health. I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers. especially children. and ask my colleagues to support it as well.",

At the end of last year. as the country was awash in reports of unsafe levels of lead being found in childrens toys. I expressed the hope that this Congress final CPSC Reform bill would embrace the improved recall notice and strengthened enforcement authority in the Housepassed bill while going beyond the Housepassed legislation to broaden the scope of mandatory product testing. enhance a familys right to know about dangerous and defective products on the market. and provide robust whistleblower protections for those courageous enough to bring serious safety hazards to light. After months of negotiations. I am gratified that this conference report accomplishes all of these objectives. H.R. 4040 retains the House bills original focus on ensuring meaningful public notice for product recalls and empowering states Attorneys General to help enforce Federal law. Additionally. todays conference report requires mandatory premarket safety testing for lead and other safety standards in toys. cribs and other childrens productswithout preempting stronger State protocols like those we have in Maryland. It requires the CPSC to create a searchable and userfriendly public database on deaths and serious injuries resulting from consumer products so that parents have access to the information they need to protect themselves and their children. And it provides important whistleblower protections to private sector employees who report violations of CPSCenforced product safety requirements. Finally. this legislation takes the long overdue step of banning lead above truly minute amounts from products intended for children under twelve. and it outlaws a number of dangerous chemicals called phthalates from childrens toys and child care items. Madam Speaker. this conference report represents a vitally important bipartisan agreement on behalf of Americas families. I urge a \"yes\" vote.",

Unfortunately. this past year we learned the extent to which the CPSC had failed to protect the American consumer by the high volume of recalls. including childrens toys and cribs. To help get this agency back on track. H.R. 4040 provides a comprehensive response to the toy safety crisis by creating the toughest lead standard in the world for childrens products and helps ensure consumers know when products are recalled. This legislation also strengthens the currently underfunded and understaffed Consumer Product Safety Commission and significantly increases CPSC resources to hire additional staff and for laboratory renovations. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act also creates new authority for the CPSC to immediately share information about dangerous products with the public and ensures State public health agencies are kept informed. Finally. the bill requires manufacturers to place distinguishing marks on products and packaging to aid in recalls of products.

    "speech": "I thank the gentlewoman from California for her kind comments. and also the gentleman from Texas. both of them. for their very hard work on reaching this bipartisan consensus. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the bill to extend the basic pilot program. also known as EVerify. I wish to especially thank my friend. the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Social Security. SAM JOHNSON. for his longstanding service to the Nation and for his steadfast support of the effort to protect seniors. people with disabilities. and survivors. Together. we have worked since the start of this Congress to provide needed funding for the Social Security Administration to address unacceptable backlogs in disability hearings and the decline in the service to our constituents. Moreover. we must ensure that SSA Is ready for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. SSA has struggled to meet an increasing workload despite a decade of underfunding. Congress only recently increased funding to help address the backlog of disability claims. and we are working to continue that trend. It will take sustained adequate funding for SSA to meet the challenges of reducing its backlog while keeping pace with growing workloads. SSA plays a significant role in the EVerify pilot program. which is rapidly growing under DHSs direction. There is broad consensus that SSA must be paid for this work. The legislation before us provides essential protections for seniors. people with disabilities. and survivors who need Social Security benefits to meet their daily expenses. It does so by ensuring that DHS and SSA enter into annual agreements that require DHS to pay SSA in full and on a timely basis for its EVerify related expenses. I would like to thank our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who worked with us to include language in this bill to provide for full and timely payment to SSA for its role under the EVerify program. This is a bipartisan bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill to extend the \"basic pilot\" program. also known as \"EVerify.\" I wish to thank my friend. the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Social Security",

Mr. McNULTY and Mr. JOHNSON of my State. and all the others who are supporting this legislation. If you talk to businesses in your community. they want to do the right thing. and Americans want the right process to be in place. It is important that we hire Americans first. and I think we have been committed to that during the whole period of the discussion of immigration reform. But I also rise to say that it is important as we pass this legislation. giving it an extension. and I frankly believe it should not expire in November of 2008. we have to also understand that there are States where this is voluntary. I heard Mr. CALVERT say there are a number of States that will now put this in place through law. but there are a number of States that do not have it in place. and therefore It is confusing. We need to be able to ensure that there is a comprehensive approach to the border security question that all of us agree with. but also to recognize the hardworking tax paying individuals who are here. who really should be put in a process. a line. that eliminates this undercover workforce. that allows a pathway to citizenship with paying of fines. getting in line. not getting ahead of those who have been in line. and having a period of time that they are in this country.

I rise to pay my respects to those fallen heroes and to their families. The other day. when I heard the fire chief. Rusty Thomas. say he lost nine of his best friends. I know what he meant. So does every Senator in this Chamber because firefighters are the best things our communities have. They risk their lives every day we lay a heavy. heavy responsibility on them. But think of how many countless lives are saved because of their dedication. because they will find the people trapped inside a burning building. I remember when our former colleague from Charleston. Senator Hollings. had the terrible fire that burned his home. it was those same South Carolina firefighters who came to help one of our own. Whether they are in Charleston or the volunteers in Claymont. DE. where I come from. when they are done putting out a blaze. you can find them organizing the little league teams or grating the baseball diamonds or taking care of the boy and girl scouts. They are the grit that makes this country great. What happened in South Carolina reminds all of us just how important firefighters are to our communities. how brave these people are. and how dangerous their work is. We saw it during Hurricane Katrina. when 1.000 firefighters who themselves lost their homes and their cars. whose whole ]ives were turned upside down. spent day after day rescuing people from rooftops. We saw it on September 11. when that grizzled fireman came out of the debris of human flesh and cement and steel to become the face around the world of Americas determination. Three hundred fortythree firemen were lost on that terrible day. And the tragedy in Charleston is the single greatest loss of firefighters in the nation since then. Just as the spirit of those firefighters on September 11 helped lift America off our knees. I hope that the grief Charleston feels this week will be lifted by the legacy of their fallen heroes.",

Each crash might seem to us. in its immediacy. like an isolated tragedy. but when we step back. we see that each has its part in a global crisis that is deepening year by year. The day of remembranceset by the United Nations General Assembly for the third Sunday of Novemberis not just for the 40.000 people who die in road crashes each year in America. It is for the 1.2 million who die in crashes in every part of the world and for the staggering 20 to 50 million who are injured. In fact. the World Health Organization predicts that. by the year 2020. the death rate from crashes each year will surpass the death rate from AIDS. True. many of these crashes are unique disasters. but that leaves many more whose causes are systemic and preventable. Unsafe roads. poor medical facilities. and inadequate driver education all contribute their share to the death toll. Unsurprisingly. the toll is highest. and rising. in middle- and lowincome countries. Road safety. then. is an issue of economic justice. On the world day of remembrance. we will recall all of the victims of road crashes. we keep their families in our thoughts. and we pray for the full recovery of those still living. But our compassion for individuals must not obscure the bigger picture. \"We have to change the way we think about crashes.\" said Diza Gonzaga. the mother of a carcrash victim in Brazil. \"The majority of people think that crashes are due to fate. We have to think of a crash as a preventable event.\"",

Although it is a small town. Edinburg has the drive. dreams. and heart of cities ten times its size. The father of Edinburg was a Norwegian by the name of Christian Buck. He became the first postmaster of Edinburg when the post office was established in 1882. The town of Edinburg was named in honor of the university where Mr. Buck obtained his college education. The first establishments in Edinburg included a blacksmith shop and a drug store. Despite a significant fire that destroyed nearly all of the towns businesses in 1900. Edinburg has grown and flourished since its beginning. Known as the Bird Capital of North Dakota. Edinburg offers many opportunities for bird enthusiasts to observe nature at its finest. A city park offers the chance for family gatherings and picnics. The Edinburg Fire Department is boasted as one of the best in the area. The town of Edinburg is a beautiful place for people to live and visitors to visit.

Mr. Lynch was moved by the plight of Israeli schoolchildrenJewish. Muslim. Druze. Bedouin. Bahai and Christianwho do not have ready access to English language books because of limited financial resources and demands on the Israeli government in its ongoing war against terrorism. He read an article about the Jade BarShalom Books for Israel Project and knew immediately that this was his calling. This grandfather of three and great grandfather of four who will be 89 next month. founded the Idaho flagship of the international Books for Israel project. Between 2004 and 2006. Mr. Lynch gathered over 10.000 books from Idaho schools to send to Israel for the schoolchildren there. His goal is to have books donated from all the counties in Idaho. Mr. Lynch has enlisted supporters from the community including school officials. bookstore owners. a restaurant franchise. Office Depot. Boise State University. and even members of the criminal justice community in Boise. I commend Mr. Lynch on his outstanding efforts and thank him also for his esteemed service in the U.S. Navy before and during World War 11. Clearly.

Mr. Speaker. my friends on the other side are misrepresenting provisions in H.R. 1 that strengthen and reform the Proliferation Security Initiative. They are attempting to exhume an old tactic: Scare the American people with the specter of the allpowerful. irresistible military machine that is the United Nations. Of course. Mr. Speaker. this characterization is as absurd as ever and has about as much substance as Shakespeares Banquos Ghost. But it is part and parcel of the irrational opposition to all things multilateral even when multilateral and international institutions clearly benefit American interests. In fact. Mr. Speaker. our bill seeks to use international law to our benefit. Our bill seeks to broaden the Proliferation Security Initiatives authorities under international law to help us convince more nations to support U.S. efforts to stop and prevent the illicit trade in dangerous items of proliferation concern. It does not relinquish any responsibility to the United Nations. Current international law gives no basis for partners in the Proliferation Security Initiative to intercept shipments related to weapons of mass destruction. One cannot overcome this weakness by ad hoc assemblages of coalitions of the willing. Even the White House has admitted that international law is weak in this regard and needs to be strengthened. Mr. Speaker. the motion to recommit would in fact weaken U.S. counter proliferation efforts by undermining effective action at the United Nations to increase Proliferation Security Initiatives global legitimacy and authority. Mr. Speaker. we will never allow any other government or international organization to control what actions we take to safeguard U.S. national security. but we will use international tools that are available to us in the 3. Pt. 1 January 9. 2007 real world to protect America regardless of the purely ideological preferences of some on the other side. Mr. Speaker.

They were. however. 896 extraordinary days that President Ford used to guide the Nation through and out of the dark days of the Watergate scandal. When Ford took office on August 9. 1974. he declared: \"I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts ow hearts.\" Ford got his first exposure to national politics at Yale University. working as a volunteer in Wendell Willkies Republican campaign for President. After World War II service with the Navy in the Pacific. he went back to practicing law in Grand Rapids and became active in Republican reform politics. The rest is history. President Ford was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 as a Republican. Fords reputation for integrity and openness made him popular and well regarded among his peers during his 25 years in Congress. In 1965. he was elected minority leader. Mr. Ford was a devoted public servant who led his country with grace and bipartisanship during challenging times. The country is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication. Mr. Speaker.

It is a very early political memory. And it would have been so easy at the time for that indelible memory to remain with a young person and sour them and make them cynical toward the public process and toward government in general. But I was very lucky because the man who took the place of the disgraced Richard Nixon was a man from Michigan by the name of Gerald Ford. Living in Michigan at the time being a young person. to see someone from my home State filled me with pride and a sense of inspiration that one person could rise above it and help to heal the wounds of a Nation. So in many ways today in paying respect to Gerald Ford. it is not my ability to thank him for his service to our country in general. but to thank him personally for the inspiration that he provided me. to see what one good and decent man could do for his fellow Americans.",

He was a great American. and he was a man who left a great tradition as a Member of this body and as a member of the Appropriations Committee where he served with distinction. A curious event associated with him is that he always wanted to be Speaker. but never made the grade. By a curious set of circumstances. he was the only man who probably could have been confirmed as Vice President under the constitutional amendment. And by an even more curious circumstance. he was never elected either Vice President or President. and yet he served in both offices with real distinction. I will be praying for the repose of his soul. My wife. Deborah. and I knew Gerald Ford and admired him greatly. We extend our condolences to his wonderful wife. Betty. who was his loyal friend. supporter. counselor. and who served his country and him and all of us with distinction and who brought luster not just to her name but also to the name of her distinguished husband.

We heard this afternoon when we discussed this on the floor that he had been active in supporting the Civil Rights Act that passed this House and the Senate some years ago. But this was not an outoftheordinary thing for him. When he was a football player at the University of Michigan. and a very fine one. I might add. undoubtedly the finest athlete to ever occupy the White House. he was the captain of the football team. They were scheduled to play Georgia Tech. There was one African American football player on the Michigan football team. and Georgia Tech said we cannot allow a black player to play on the field at Georgia Tech. When Gerald Ford heard that. he said I will not play either. I am simply not going to play if they will not let my friend. Ward. play. That was the type of person he was. It was not until his African American friend begged him to play that he finally conceded that he would play. Another vignette is when he was elevated to the Presidency. we had a big party for him back in Grand Rapids. Michigan. and 5.000 people turned out for our little party. Person after person got up to the microphone and related experiences in their life where Jerry Ford had helped them. whether it was a matter of housing. of veterans benefits. getting medals for veterans. The list went on and on and on. That accords with another thing that was told me by one of my fellow legislators at the time. He had become a Member of Congress and he said. Sometimes I cursed Jerry Ford. Because of the high standard of constituent service he provided. he said. we worked endlessly in our office to do as well as Jerry Ford and his staff did in his office. Those are two examples. I have more. but I see that the majority leader has arrived. and I know he is anxious to speak on this issue.",

Gerald Ford. who is often referred to as \"Michigans Greatest Son.\" worked hard wherever his life led him and based his decisions upon what he felt was the right thing to do. A star football player with my alma mater. the University of Michigan. he tumed down offers to play in the National Football League to study law at Yale. He then volunteered to serve his country in the Navy during World War II before retuming to Michigan to put his law degree to work. He later defeated an incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his own partys primary. which from my own experience is an incredibly difficult endeavor. His colleagues later elected him to the highest leadership position among Republicans in the House. Gerald Ford admittedly did not seek the greatness of the U.S. presidency. but destiny determined that he would become the right man in the right place at the right time. President Ford allowed the country to move forward by pardoning Richard Nixon. although it likely contributed to him failing to win the 1976 election. He helped to unite a divided nation. even when he knew that if would likely result in a great personal cost. He made the decision because he knew that if he did not. our country would spend the months and years looking back and not ahead. For him it was simply the right thing to do. He conducted himself with integrity and character throughout every step of his distinguished career. He set a very high standard for those of us in West Michigan who would follow him to Washington.

Congress abolished the Bureau of Mines before I came to Congress. but a key component of that agency. the Minerals Information Team. was entrusted to the U.S. Geological Service. Unfortunately. USGS has not recognized the critical nature of this program or the importance of the information the MIT produces.

The MIT collects and disseminates data on virtually every commercially important nonfuel mineral commodity produced worldwide. information that is critical to businesses. the government. and importantly. the Department of Defense to help manage the National Defense Stockpile. Due to the importance of the data. the MIT should be an independent agency reporting to the Secretary of the Interior. This information from the MIT is critical to the effective use of the Nations natural resources and for accurate forecasting. Without a reliable source of worldwide commodity information. the U.S. would be blind to any impending supply shortages. One of the most fundamental functions of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. There is an undeniable nexus between our Nations minerals policy and national security policy. Currently. 24 strategic and critical military materials are imported at no less than 40 percent from our foreign trading partners. For example. the U.S. imports 54 percent of its magnesium. This mineral is vitally important in constructing airplanes and missiles. Requiring our military to import the strategic and critical minerals it needs from foreign nations. some of whom may be hostile. puts our military at a significant disadvantage and weakens our ability to adequately sustain our national defense. At a time when defense needs are determined in terms of capabilitiesbased planning instead of threatbased planning. an accurate assessment of our Nations minerals is vitally important.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. My amendment is very simple and straightforward. It encourages collaboration between Amtrak and local and regional commuter rail agencies on train schedules and routing in shared corridors. There are competing needs for some of these uses. and cooperation between Amtrak and others is critically important to take most advantage of our rail corridors. Across the Nation there are multiple commuter rail transit agencies that run on the same rails as Amtrak. Many of these public transportation services have made substantial investments in the tracks and signal capacity on a rail corridor to enhance commuter rail service. Currently. Amtrak has first right to schedule their services. which can often result in delays to commuter rail passengers and have negative impacts on the ontime performance of the commuter rails. Amtrak must work with commuter rail in a collaborative manner and in coordination with the host railroad to best facilitate an efficient flow of intercity Amtrak commuter rail passengers. In the Puget Sound region in particular. Sound Transit has worked closely with BNSF and made a tremendous investment in the rail corridor throughout the Puget Sound region. investing more than $1 billion of public funding in the freight corridor between Tacoma and Everett. Washington. These investments represent a high price that has been paid by the region to ensure that commuter rail did not impact the freight rail operations that drive our regions economy. These investments benefit light rail. Amtrak. and of course Sound Transits commuter rail passengers. as well as our freight rail. This amendment does not change Amtraks priority in setting these. it merely asks that they work cooperatively with the other parties that are interested in using these rail systems to maximize their capacity. There are a number of folks who want to make investments in improving those rail systems. and if Amtrak works cooperatively with them. those investments will work out better for all concerned.

The amendment offered by gentleman directs Amtrak to engage in goodfaith negotiations with commuter rail entities and public transportation authorities to move more efficiently the maximum number of intercity rail passengers. especially during peak commuter hours.

As a result. many commuter rail operators are seeking to expand their services while contending with other rail traffic. In response to these challenges. this amendment directs Amtrak to engage in goodfaith discussions with commuter rail entities and public transportation authorities operating on the same track to efficiently move the maximum number of commuter. intercity. and regional rail passengers. especially during peak commuter hours.

However. we have a number of provisions in this bill to improve Amtraks operations. to reform the way Amtrak conducts its business. to get at the lowestperforming routes. We specifically direct the Amtrak board of directors to implement a modern financial accounting system to save money. improve operations. and increase revenue. In section 204. we direct Amtrak to report on projected revenues. expenditures and ridership over a 5year period to promote Improved financial stability and how best to allocate the resources we provide to Amtrak. We direct Amtrak to work with the States to institute a nationwide methodology for allocating. operating and capital costs. to standardize financial support of Amtrak to the States and the Federal Government to ensure each is contributing their appropriate and fair amount. and to address specifically the performance of poorly performing routes. and they may be different from the one that the gentleman has in mind at this particular moment. We further direct the inspector general of DOT to evaluate performance. service quality of the five worst performing Amtrak routes and recommend a process for DOT to consider proposals by Amtrak and other operators to provide service both on underperforming Amtrak routes and routes not served by Amtrak. So the gentleman is proposing that Congress make a preemptive strike and direct dropping a route when we have in place with the enactment of this legislation a process by which we are going to improve these processes. It would be better to look and reexamine at the end of that process rather than at the beginning and prejudge the outcome of these sincere efforts that we are making to improve all of Amtraks operations.

Secondly. you can take a plane and it gets you there faster and cheaper than what you can do with Amtrak. And by the way. they operate without a Federal subsidy. both the bus system and the plane system in this particular case. The third thing I note. the gentleman has added a provision to his amendment which I think is very important. that the Secretary can transmit a waiver of this route or a portion of this route if the Secretary considers it to be critical to homeland security. So nobody is trying to take away routes that we may need to use in a critical situation. and we give the Secretary of Homeland Security the ultimate yes or no on this. But what is important about this is this route is the most heavily subsidized in the system. It is not utilized that much. And if we cant make some statement here and give Members some opportunity. I think. to voice their concerns about oversubsidization on certain routes. I dont know what were doing here. There are other provisions.

Let me tell you. Ive got some breaking news for you. There is something more important than profit.

Like many municipalities in the 6th District. the Borough of Mohnton has a rich and proud history that is the foundation for the strength and sense of community that its residents share today. Mohnton officially became a borough in 1907 when it separated from Cumru Township. The community was previously known as Mohns Store. or Mohnsville. in honor of founder Samuel K. Mohn. who opened a store and established a post office in 1857. Within the first year of the Boroughs existence. the Mohnton Fire Co. No. 1 was organized. which consisted of a handdrawn hose cart that was its only means of fighting fires. In 1909. the first Boroughs high school graduating class had just four students. Today. the Borough is a part of the Governor Mifflin School District. which proudly boasts over 1400 students in high school alone. Over the years. the Borough has grown into a thriving community that epitomizes good neighbors and civicmindedness. As a part of the festivities. the Borough has brought back another proud tradition that dates back a halfcentury. Back in the 1950s. Mohnton was the local hub of soapbox racing. with fans watching the races along Walnut Street. This tradition was rekindled by the Mohnton Lions Club this past summer and it was a great event for young and old alike. This weekends celebrations will include a Centennial Parade around the Northridge section of the community. followed by string bands. fireworks and other great musical performances.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the late Arthur Helton. perhaps our countrys greatest advocate for the rights of refugees. wrote: Refugees matter . . . for a wide variety of reasons. . . . Refugees are a product of humanitys worst instincts. the willingness of some persons to oppress others. as well as some of its best instincts. the willingness of many to assist and protect the helpless. . . . A year after he wrote those words. Arthur Helton was killed in Baghdad in 2003 when a bomb destroyed the U.N. headquarters in Iraq. His words still resonate today. especially when we consider the immense human cost of the war in Iraq and its tragic effect on the millions of Iraqismen. women. and childrenwho have fled their homes. their country. to escape the violence of a nation at war with itself. These brave and heroic Iraqis work with the American military. staff our embassy. and work with American organizations to support our mission in Iraq. They are among the 4 million Iraqi refugees who have been forced from their homes. They are the people we have an obligation to help. Instead of protection. we have offered them bureaucracy and doublespeak. false words and dubious hopes. Despite the overwhelming need. the U.S. has resettled less than 2.000 Iraqis this fiscal year. Last night. the Senate acted and stood up to help Iraqi refugees. I thank Senator LEVIN and Senator McCAIN for adopting our amendment. the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007. I thank Senator WARNER as well. This was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators: Senators SMITH. LEVIN.",

We have a great responsibility. particularly to those people in Iraq who have helped ustranslators. truck drivers. people who put their lives and the lives of their families on the line to help us. Whether you agree with American policy in Iraqand I dontwhether you feel we ought to have gone thereI thought it was a mistake and so votedwe are there. People are putting their lives on the line to help our troops and us. We surely owe them an opportunity to become refugees If they otherwise qualify. Instead they run into the hurdles. barricades. and bureaucracy Senator KENNEDY talked about. He has taken a very important lead on that issue. There has been a lot of bipartisan support on this effort. There is another group I have been particularly worried about. they are religious minorities In Iraq. including Caldeans and Assyrians. These are Christians caught in the crossfire. That group is also given a special preference in this legislation which was adopted last night. It is a modest beginning toward carrying out our responsibilityand we bear some real responsibility as well as obligationfor some of these folks. It is a very small step. I wish to say Senator KENNEDY has been relentless on this refugee issue. It was off the radar. Millions of people displaced inside Iraq. 2 million people outside Iraq who are refugees. 4 million Iraqis left their homes. half to other places in Iraq. half. roughly. to other countries in the region. These groups are so vulnerable. We must take action on it. We did last night. I thank and commend Senator KENNEDY and Senator BROWNBACK. who has been working with me particularly on these religious refugees. these minorities. and. of course. Senator WARNER and the Republicans who worked to put this package together last nightall are entitled to our thanks but mainly Senator KENNEDY.",

I mention this because I knew Admiral Roughead personally as he served in the Pacific Command. I can recall how he was a great leader in the role of taking relief to the tsunami victims in the southeast Asia area of the Pacific while he was Deputy Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. He was recently the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. I had the great fortune to work with Admiral Roughead during his tenure as deputy commander. U.S. Pacific Command. and commander. U.S. Pacific Fleet and was consistently impressed by his skills as commanding officer. dedication to duty and commitment to protecting and defending our Nation. Since his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy In 1973. Admiral Roughead has served this country with absolute distinction in a variety of positions including most recently commander. U.S. Fleet Forces. In particular. I want to note the leadership and compassion Admiral Roughead. as deputy commander. U.S. Pacific Command. displayed during the United States Navys participation in the international response to the destruction following the December 2004 tsunami in South and Southeast Asia. Similarly Admiral Roughead has demonstrated his deep understanding of the importance of honoring cultural diversity. In his capacity as representative of our U.S. naval forces. he has truly embodied the true spirit of aloha in his interactions with the many diverse communities in my home state of Hawaii. I look forward to continuing to work with Admiral Roughead in his new capacity and I am pleased to support his confirmation as chief of Naval Operations.",

Throughout three decades in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. millions of Armenians were systematically uprooted from their homeland of 3.000 years and deported or massacred. From 1894 through 1896. three hundred thousand Armenians were ruthlessly murdered. Again in 1909. thirty thousand Armenians were massacred in Cilicia. and their villages were destroyed. On April 24. 1915. two hundred Armenian religious. political. and intellectual leaders were arbitrarily arrested. taken to Turkey and murdered. This incident marks a dark and solemn period in the history of the Armenian people. From 1915 to 1923. the Ottoman Empire launched a systematic campaign to exterminate Armenians. In 8 short years. more than 1.5 million Armenians suffered through atrocities such as deportation. forced slavery and torture. Most were ultimately murdered. Many of our companions in the international community have already taken this final step. The European Parliament and the United Nations have recognized and reaffirmed the Armenian Genocide as historical fact. as have the Russian and Greek parliaments. the Canadian House of Commons. the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies and the French National Assembly. It is time for America to join the chorus and acknowledge the Armenians who suffered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. And let me stress that I am not speaking of the government of modern day Turkey. but rather its predecessor. which many of Turkeys present day leaders helped to remove from power. As I have in the past. as a member of the Congressional Armenian Caucus. I will continue to work with my colleagues and with the ArmenianAmericans in my district to promote investment and prosperity in Armenia. And. I sincerely hope that this year. the U.S. will have the opportunity and courage to speak in support of the millions of Armenians who suffered because of their heritage.",

Its goal is to foster awareness of minority health issues. and spur dialogue and solutions toward ensuring that minorities are not disproportionately vulnerable to illness. disease and premature death. In the U.S.. Hispanics. AfricanAmericans and Asian Pacific Islanders have significant healthcare needs. These groups suffer from high levels of poverty and disease. including diabetes. heart disease. tuberculosis. hepatitis. and cancer. Large numbers of minorities are also uninsured or underinsured. In a world where we have shortages of nurses. doctors. and other health practitioners. with respect to minority health in particular. there is no shortage of need. To meet these challenges. the health concerns of particular minority groups must be addressed. and this must be achieved as we better our healthcare system. I am a strong supporter of the healthcare providers and research institutions in my district of El Paso. TX. such as Texas Tech University. the University of Texas at El Paso. El Paso Community College. the Border Health Institute (BHI). Pan American Health Organization. La Fe. Project Vida. Project Arriba. Fort Bliss. area hospitals and clinics. and individual doctors. nurses. and other healthcare professionals. I believe we must make every effort to create solid foundations for healthcare in our communities. National Minority Health Month is a vitally important time for millions of Americans. In honor of National Minority Health Month. I urge my colleagues in Congress to support initiatives designed to effectively reduce minority health disparities. With respect to minority health. though there may be no shortage of need. we must assure there is also no shortage of resources to address the disparity. and eventually close the gap.

I had the opportunity to meet Boris Yeltsin. That is one of the privileges we have as Senatorswe get to meet important people from around the world. I cant pretend to know him at all.

He had his faults. He had his problems. But he played a pivotal role. and we should take a moment to recognize that fact. The one quote attributed to him that I enjoyed personally with respect to our life here has to do with the Library of Congress. When my constituents come to Washington. I tell them: You need to go see the Library of Congress. the Jefferson Building. Aside from the Capitol itself. it is the most beautiful building on Capitol Hill. and maybe in Washington. Boris Yeltsin is said to have gone into the Library of Congress and looked around at that magnificent lobby and then questioned: How did you get a building like this? You didnt have any czars.

I cant help but be shaped by my own life experience. and I remember as I came to America and was learning the ways of this country. and I admired so much this new land of mine. that I would marvel at the phrase: \"Politics ends at the waters edge.\" That used to be the standard. There were these towering giants of another day who occupied these very desks we now use as ours who seemed to find it within themselves to reach a little higher to work across party lines in those postwar years. in the Cold War years when it was so essential. I think what we need to adopt as a country is the understanding that this struggle against this enemy is long term. that we are going to be in this fight for a long time. probably the time of your service and mine. I hope not. but perhaps. If we are going to be successful in that endeavor. we have to set politics aside. We have to find a way that we can think of America first and whatever label we wear in a secondary way. I am not preaching to my colleague from Florida or anyone in particular. Frankly. the blame lies on both sides of the aisle. with Republicans as well as Democrats. We have to find a way we can move beyond the momentary gain we might make over a 24hour news cycle for the longer term good of the Nation and the longer term good of what America stands for to the world. Anyway. maybe the Senator and I began a rare moment here this morning in talking about Iraq where we are not yelling at each other and we are actually talking about how we can bridge our differences and find consensus as something that will help the American people.",

What we have is an approaching train wreck. because if the Congress passes this emergency funding bill for the war that has this language in it. if that passes this week. then the President is going to veto it next week and that is going to leave us right back where we are. with both sides making a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric. but that doesnt get us any closer to where we are going. So I say to my colleague. look over the horizon beyond this week and see where we can come together. I thought the most promising prospect was when Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton came down with the Traq Study Commission report. They showed. in a bipartisan way among very prominent people of both parties. how you should approach this Iraq situation. and yet. that was last November or December when it came out. and here we are 4 months later and still we have not come together in common ground.

I applaud Representative SUSAN DAVIS continued efforts to draw attention and support to this very important issue. and I appreciate her dedicated leadership in this area. Mentors give their time and energy to improve the lives of American young people who increasingly spend less time with concerned adult role models. According to the National Mentoring Institute. young people with mentors are roughly half as likely as those without mentors to begin using illegal drugs. 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol. and 50 percent less prone to absenteeism from school. The positive effects of mentoring also include the Improvement of academic achievement. a reduction in violent behavior. and a higher selfesteem. In December 2006. President Bush proclaimed January 2007 as National Mentoring Month. giving public recognition to mentors who serve as role models and provide quality involvement and interaction in the lives of Americas youth. As the President said. \"Through friendship and encouragement. mentors can help prepare young Americans for a hopeful future.\" By honoring mentors and mentoring programs. we recognize the importance of mentoring programs implemented in our local schools and communities. We also draw attention to the components of a quality program. including appropriate screening of potential mentors and careful matching of youth with adults who have a genuine interest in providing guidance and being exemplary role models. Mentoring programs are varied and unique. They can be schoolbased or faithbased. and they may be established through community organizations or corporate initiatives. I encourage people across the country to take the time to discover what mentoring programs exist in their communities and see what they can do to help. Many volunteers are needed to meet the growing demand for mentors. Again. I am pleased to recognize the important work of mentors and the quality mentoring programs. and I urge Members to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Mentors provide important guidance and friendship to students and they serve as positive role models in our community. Mentors listen and above all. they care. Mentors leave an indelible imprint on our minds and hearts. I. as well as many of my colleagues. had mentors that helped us shape our aspirations and achieve our goals. The confidence and support that they provide is something that every young person deserves. Unfortunately. there are not enough mentors for the millions ot children who want or need them.

As we celebrate National Mentoring Month. let us commit ourselves to raising awareness and to promoting the rewards of mentoring for mentors. our children. our communities and our country.

They are dedicated to not only educating their students academically. but to developing their moral. intellectual. physical and social values. January 28 through February 3. 2007. is Catholic Schools Week. an annual tradition in its 33rd year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The purpose of this resolution and Catholic Schools Week is to celebrate the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools play in providing a valuesadded education with high standards of quality and excellence to millions of children in America. As President George W. Bush has noted. Catholic educators share the basic conviction that every child can learn. which is the grounding principle behind the No Child Left Behind Act. Catholic schools have also played a vital role in the gulf coasts path to recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They worked as quickly as possible to reenroll their students. while also opening their doors to thousands of public school students displaced by the storm. Catholic schools continue to demonstrate their faith in every student and commitment to excellence with overwhelming results. According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Catholic schools have a greater than 99 percent graduation rate. and about 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to postsecondary training at 4year colleges. community colleges. or technical schools. I know firsthand of the significance of Catholic schools in that my new daughterinlaw. Jennifer Miskewicz Wilson of Fairfield. New Jersey. was influenced by a Catholic education. I appreciate the great work being done by Catholic schools. their administrators and teachers. as well as their parents and volunteers. Catholic schools carry out their servant mission by building the academic achievement. character and values of their students.

I commend Congressman LIPINSKI for sponsoring this bill which promotes and encourages education. Education is the pathway to a better future and an American ideal is for students of every background and race to have the opportunity to access equal education. Catholic schools have strived to maintain diversity with more than 27 percent of school children enrolled in Catholic schools from minority backgrounds. Supporting this bill sends a message that we care about the education of American students. Not only do Catholic schools educate Catholic youth. but 14 percent of those children who attend Catholic schools are nonCatholic. We must keep in mind that Catholic schools educate Americas young people and ensure that they have a brighter future.

As we get ready to celebrate Catholic Schools week. its important to highlight and celebrate the contributions of the nearly 8.000 Catholic schools that exist in our Nation. Catholic education has long been characterized by a commitment to high and appropriate standards in all aspects of its educational mission. The history of Catholic schooling embodies a constant effort to promote academic excellence for a diverse group of students in an environment permeated by religious values and beliefs. Aside from Americas Catholic schools being intemationally acclaimed for their academic excellence. catholic school students also learn responsibility. and how to become persons of character and integrity. Father William Davis of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said. \"High achievement rates. high retention rates. high moral values and high student and parent satisfaction are the distinctive marks of a Catholic school.\" In my district and the surrounding areas. Catholic education is rather prevalent. The San Bernardino diocese contains at least 32 Elementary schools and 2 High schools. A new Preparatory high school is also in the works for the Coachella Valley area. Catholic schools foster a sense of community. They encourage their students to be loving family members. and to be responsible adults within the workplace. as leaders of the world and as inhibitors of their communities. I commend Catholic schools for holding high educational standards. instilling good moral values. and community sentiments. Let us recognize and honor the valuable traits Catholic schools possess.

As my good friend knows. the Senate amendment to H.R. 6049 establishes in section 205 a new tax credit for plugin electric drive vehicles. The credit is for passenger vehicles and light trucks and varies in amount depending on the vehicles weight and battery capacity. Your leadership has been critical to securing this credit. which I strongly support because it will help reduce Americas dependence on foreign oil by giving people incentives to build and purchase advanced. fuelefficient vehicles. Indiana has consistently been a key contributor to innovation in vehicle manufacturing. We are proud that our auto manufacturers and suppliers are focused on building the next generation of fuelefficient vehicles and components. This plugin electric drive motor vehicle tax credit is essential to help consumers overcome any hesitation to purchase these vehicles and to provide investors with confidence that the Government is committed to the electrification of our Nations transportation sector. Section 205 of the Senatepassed amendment to H.R. 6049 describes the vehicles that would qualify for the tax credit. Eligible vehicles include. in part. motor vehicles with at least a 4 kilowatt hour battery used for propulsion. an offboard energy source to recharge the battery. and in the case of passenger vehicles or light trucks of no more than 8.500 pounds. a certificate of conformity under the Clean Air Act. The bill language does not expressly state whether a van would qualify. but many commercial and government fleets use vans. The relevant Environmental Protection Agency regulations referred to by the bill. such as 40 C.F.R. 86.0822. define a van as a \"lightduty truck.\" It would appear that the committee intends that a plugin electric drive van. meeting the appropriate weight and emission standards. would qualify for the new tax credit for plugin electric drive motor vehicles.

The credit crisis is having a significant impact on the hardworking men and women at GM in Michigan and throughout the country who proudly build Americanmade cars and trucks. the men and women who sell and finance Chrysler vehicles. and the individuals who service Ford vehicles in dealerships throughout the country. With the credit markets having largely frozen up. domestic automobile manufacturers and finance companies face the most difficult conditions they have faced in decades. They have been hit with a double whammy: high gasoline and diesel prices. coupled with evaporating credit. Considering the importance of the auto industry to our country I wanted to reiterate the points raised by my colleague. by clarifying that the Treasury has the authority to purchase auto loans and that auto financing companies could participate in the program if determined necessary by the Treasury. after consulting with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. to promote market stability.",

And the tragedy of the bridge collapse in Minnesota certainly did that and called our attention to the fact that we need to do a great deal of work on our bridges.

But this shows 589 bridges on the interstate system and 2.067 bridges overall on the national highway system that are in the structurally deficient category. eligible for replacement. and that is the standard by which we. in this legislation. determine whether a State qualifies for moving money out of its bridge account.

For example. currently. the National Bridge Inventory contains information on 594.101 bridges. Of the bridges in the inventory. 73.784 bridges were structurally deficient and over 80.000 were functionally obsolete. Those numbers are astounding and troublesome. We should not build our infrastructure and then walk away without maintaining it and modernizing it as it becomes antiquated. HR 3999 authorizes an additional $1 billion in FY09 for the Highway Bridge Program and requires updates and changes to be made to the inspection program.

I joined experts from the Delaware Department of Transportation for a tour of some of the most heavily traveled roads and bridges in Delaware. I have often heard Delaware referred to as \"The East Coasts Main Street\"-and it is true. In fact. during our tour. we visited construction sites where men and women were working diligently on important highway. infrastructure. and bridge projects that are utilized by an estimated 230.000 vehicles every day. Over the next 50 years. the United States is projected to add 150 million new residents. representing a 50 percent increase over our present population. This population surge will put a greater strain on our transportation systemparticularly at key chokepoints in dense areas like the northeast corridor. And last August. the tragic Minneapolis bridge collapse. which killed 13 and injured 145. underscored the serious safety implications of this dramatic increase in highway users when combined with severely aging infrastructure. Clearly. this situation will continue to deteriorate unless we act soon. For this reason. I support passage of H.R. 3999 and I believe it is vital that we identify and prioritize funding to repair structurally deficient bridges to ensure the safety of all travelers. I also feel strongly that the Federal Government must allow States the appropriate flexibility to allocate these resources as efficiently as possible. I am hopeful that we will make progress in improving these provisions and reducing burdensome spending requirements when this legislation goes to conference with the U.S. Senate.",

In my home state of North Carolina there are hundreds of bridges that have been rated structurally deficient. and in my district alone there are over 150 bridges that have been rated structurally deficient. This bill enhances our ability to address this critical need. H.R. 3999 will improve the safety of our nations bridges by ensuring that they are properly monitored for repairs. and by ensuring that the federal funding that is set aside for their maintenance and repair goes towards that specific purpose. This bill authorizes an additional $1 billion in fiscal year 2009. on top of the current $4.5 billion authorized in the Federal Highway Administrations Bridge Program. In addition to this funding. this legislation requires the Federal Highway Administration to conduct annual inspections on bridges that are rated deficient. and inspect all other bridges every two years. This additional funding. along with the mandated inspections. will go a long way towards insuring that the American public will have confidence in the bridges they traverse. without having to fear the disaster that occurred in Minnesota nearly one year ago.

I think it is important for us to adopt this amendment and to direct the Government Accountability Office to provide recommendations on how successful aspects of bridgerating systems can be incorporated into the bridgerating program and be a valuable asset for us next year as we go into the authorization process. Bridge rating is a very complex process. It will be very useful for us to have GAOs input on better ways of rating bridges. ensuring that the traveling public has a complete understanding of the condition of the bridges on which they are traveling. This does not mean that we can define away the condition of bridges. but rather that we better understand the condition of bridges. Under current Federal law. longstanding law. States are required to inspect all bridges longer than 20 feet at least once every 2 years and then to report those findings to the Federal Highway Administration. In the course of the inspection. conditions on various elements of the bridge are rated on a scale of zero. failure. to nine. excellent. \"Structurally deficient\" bridge means there are elements that need to be monitored or repaired or that the bridge entirely needs to be replaced. Now this current rating system. as the gentleman from Florida said. when a bridge is rated structurally deficient doesnt mean it is going to fall down tomorrow or the next day. but that under various conditions it could well be unsafe. And if it is ultimately determined to be unsafe. that structure should be closed. We should have a rating system. but that rating system has not been evaluated in probably 25 years. certainly not since I held those hearings in 1987. I think the amendment before us will put GAO on the course of doing that evaluation and giving us a better yardstick of measurement for determining various conditions of bridges.

With the Soviet bloc crumbling. the western world rejoiced as freedom spread to populations once thought hopelessly in the grip of Communist oppressors. There was reason to believe that the Soviets brutal form of tyranny was over forever. Unfortunately. recent actions seem to be giving new life to old Communist ghosts. Police squads crushing the Kremlins dissenters. advocates of freedom and transparency silenced. culturai figures detained. Mr. Speaker. the recent backsliding in Russia should be cause for alarm for all freedom loving people. As the Kremlins power expands. freedom for the Russian people shrinks. This was wrong during the Cold War and It is wrong now. It is time that the free nations of the world take a stand against this trend and start demanding more from Mr. Putin and Russias leaders.",

The other example. which is an actual positive benefit from this defense authorization bill is that when I was a college student during the Iranian hostage crisis. one of the bestknown hostages was a woman who grew up in my district in Bremer County. Kathryn Koob. For people like Kathryn Koob and other Iranian hostages. there will be an opportunity to get the compensation they deserve for what they went through that no American should have to put up with. But its also a reflection of this administrations foreign policy that we allow those claims to be pursued against a statesponsored terrorism act that occurred in Iran. but we have taken away the rights of U.S. prisoners of war to recover compensation from statesponsored terror in Iraq. Maybe that makes sense to some people. but it just doesnt pass the smell test in Iowa. With that. I would like to thank all of my colleagues. and I would also like to recognize my friend and roommate from Colorado. who I wasnt aware was with us. Mr. PERLMUTTER. we would like to have you close us out for the remaining time with your thoughts on this topic.",

I wish to take this opportunity. as a member of both those committees. to speak about two amendments I will offer when the time is appropriate. This is in morning business and. therefore. I cannot offer them at this time. The first amendment will deal with a new question. and that question is: court review of telecom immunity. Let me explain what that means. First. this amendment is submitted on behalf of Senators BILL NELSON. CARDIN. and myself. Senator NELSON is on the Intelligence Committee. Senator CARDIN is on the Judiciary Committee. I have also worked with Senator WHITEHOUSE on this. though I believe he is going in a slightly different direction. As Members know. the bill before us provides full retroactive immunity for electronic service providersthat is the legal languagethat are alleged to have provided assistance as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The amendment I am offering creates a judicial review by putting forth the issue of whether immunity should be granted before the FISA Court. There would be no immunity for any individual. private or public officialthat is in the underlying billor any other company other than electronic service providers. So the immunity provision in the Intelligence bill only relates to those providers of electronic surveillanceno one else and no other company. I hear talk this would apply to Blackwater. It does not.

I know he comes from a State that has a good number of Indian tribes and that he has toured those areas and is very concerned about this issue. Madam President. I want to. in just a couple minutes. show once again a photograph of a man I showed yesterday during this discussion. His name is Lyle Frechette. Lyle Frechette. shown in this photograph. was a member of the Menominee Tribe of Indians in Wisconsin. He came of age during a time when there was what was called the \"termination and relocation era of Indians.\" This picture of Lyle Frechette is a picture of a high school graduate who was newly entering the Marine Corps to proudly serve his country. I showed that photograph yesterday to describe that there is no group of Americans that has served their country in the military in larger numbers per capita than Native Americansthan American Indians and Native Alaskans. There is just no group that has enlisted in higher numbers to support their country in our military. This is a photograph of one of them. His experience. following his service in the Marines. was the experience of so many Indians. During the termination and relocation period. many of them were given oneway bus tickets and told: You need to mainstream. you need to go to a city someplace. They found they had limited opportunities in the cities. They lost their health care capability. It was a time that we are now not proud of in terms of public policy because it was the wrong thing to have done. particularly when we had promised a trust responsibility. providing health care for Native Americans.",

The Greek poet Sophocles wrote. \"One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.\" While the evening of Sharons life came much to soon. I hope that her family and friends will take solace in the fact that Sharon could look back on a life filled with love and laughter. a life filled with accomplishment. and a life filled with making a positive difference and say that \"the day has indeed been splendid.\" I will never visit Toledo without thinking of Sharon. and I am confident that her work will live on through the good work of all those who call Toledo home.*",

I want to thank Senator BINGAMAN. my colleague from New Mexico. for joining me as a cosponsor of the bill again this Congress. The Albuquerque Indian School Act seeks to take two parcels of Federal land into trust for the 19 PueblosAcoma. Cochiti. Isleta. Jemes. Laguna. Nambe. Ohkay Owingeh. Picuris. Pojoaque. San Felipe. San Ildefonso. Sandia. Santa Ana. Santa Clara. Santo Domingo. Taos. Tesuque. Zia and Zuni. I believe this property. if transferred. would receive greater utilization and would benefit the 19 New Mexico Pueblos. In 1981. the New Mexico Pueblos petitioned the United States for the transfer of approximately 44 acres from the Albuquerque Indian School site for the purpose of economic development. In 1984. the Assistant Secretary of the Interior conveyed 44 acres to the Pueblos. This land is currently under development by the 19 New Mexico pueblos. In 2003. the 19 Pueblos requested conveyance of the \"B\" and \"D\" tracts. which total approximately 18 acres. located near Interstate 40. This land contains various metal buildings which have deteriorated to the point that they have little to no usable value at this time. The return of these two properties to the 19 Pueblos is supported by the southwestern regional office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. With the addition of these two tracts. the 19 pueblos will be able to continue their successful economic development of the Albuquerque Indian School property. I believe the transfer will benefit the 19 New Mexico Pueblos. and their individual tribal members. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Nanotechnology will revolutionize manufacturing. energy. healthcare. national defense and many other sectors by improving the way things are designed and made. The potential benefits of nanotechnology are tremendous. especially for the nation that leads the world in nanotechnology research and development. Studies project that by 2014 nanotechnology will be incorporated into more than $2 trillion worth of manufactured goods. China. Japan. the European Union. India and other nations are fighting for global leadership. and the competition is getting stiffer all the time. For the United States to maintain and expand its leadership in the field of nanotechnology. we must train and educate more scientists and engineers who are capable of conducting research and development in this emerging technology. To reach this objective. students need to be taught the necessary skills beginning at the high school and college levels. According to the National Science Foundation. foreign students on temporary visas earned approximately onethird of all science and engineering doctorates awarded in the United States. By providing high school and college students with the tools to learn nanotechnology. a higher number of American students will enter this crucial field. The Nanotechnology in the Schools Act provides grants to American colleges and highperforming high schools to purchase the tools that will enable their students to learn nanotechnology. The Act also provides training for teachers and professors to use these tools in the classroom and the laboratory. The Nanotechnology in the Schools Act is an investment in Americas greatest asset. its students. and a key element of the nations strategy to maintain nanotechnology leadership worldwide.

I was struck by one portion of the bill and would make an inquiry to the bills sponsor. that you made a difference between the National Intelligence Estimate and the National Intelligence Assessment.

And I ask the question because I have to be honest. I am very disappointed with my friends this evening on an issue that I think is so important. You know. there is a reason. I think. that we have a 9 percent approval. the lowest this Congress has ever registered. And it is for issues exactly like this. We stood up in good faith last week. As a matter of fact. Mr. HOEKSTRA introduced this very bill word for word. and then we offered it. the same bill. in a motion to recommit. And this is policy. and we wont spend much time on it. but I have to note that I just think this is an awful way to do business here. and I think the 110th Congress has really sunk to new lows. There was no reason that you couldnt have picked up the phone and talked with Mr. HOEKSTRA about a bill that he introduced and pioneered to deal with a most serious issue. As a matter of fact. one of the speakers today actually voted against the bill In its form. but today there is a renewed enthusiasm that we are going to pass this bill.",

Mr. HOEKSTRA made a determination. very frankly from my perspective. that he was more Interested in trying to politically put some people on the hook for a vote on a proposition that he knew and we knew they were for but they did not want to kill the Intelligence bill in the process.

I am disappointed in the oil companies on behalf of the American people. I think you have talked about where we buy our oil. It seems to me that this administration has been in office for about 7h years. have set the oil policy. and now we are paying for it. And we are attempting to do whatever we can on this side of the aisle to resurrect it. And to come up with an issue of drill. drill. drill. We keep saying. and the facts are there. we have 83 million acres that the oil companies have under license. and they have not chosen to put money into the drilling of those 83 million acres. both onshore and offshore. That is number one. What really concerns me. and what I am upset about though is the fact that we. this Congress. when the Republicans were in the majority. that we gave oil companies billions of dollars of grants to do research. And yet I havent seen any of that money go to drilling or doing what you are suggesting that we should do now. What I see is what I read in that article in the Sun paper about the fact that the oil companies are making outstanding. the highest profits they have ever made in their history. And you know why? Because they are putting the money. the grants that we gave them. the American dollars. not in to drilling and trying to help bring the oil prices down. but to the bottom line of their stockholders and also to really having the American people suffer because of that strategy. So I would just say that this is an Issue we must move forward with. We are talking about drilling when this is an intelligence bill. and we should stand behind this bill. as Americans. as Republicans and as Democrats.

This bill would require the National Intelligence Director to submit to Congress a national intelligence assessment on the national security and energy security issues related to energy costs. Our national security is threatened by our dependence on foreign countries that do not share our views on democracy or our commitment to combat radical Islamist terrorists. By relying on oil from OPEC in the Middle East and countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. we place our national security in the hands of authoritarian governments. I believe our energy policy should be a bipartisan approach that reduces our demand by increasing conservation. including getting better mileage from cars. minivans. SUVs and trucks. and making electric appliances and lighting more energy efficient. increases the use of renewable fuels such as solar. wind. geothermal and biofuels. reduces speculation in the oil futures market. and increases our domestic supply of oil. natural gas and nuclear power. The national intelligence assessment required under this bill will show us the national security threats likely to increase should a long term. bipartisan plan not be implemented. It is critical we understand the consequences of our increasing energy demand and take strong action to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Well over half of our energy derived from oil and natural gas comes from foreign producers. Our energy consumption not only fuels our homes. our transportation and our industry. but also transfers our wealth to countries and foreign interests that would do us harm. Our national security requires us to be energy independent. and I urge support of H.R. 6545.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 6545. the National Energy Security Intelligence Act of 2008. introduced by my distinguished colleague from Louisiana. Representative DON CAZAYOUX. This legislation is an important step in ensuring that rising energy costs do not endanger American lives. It is obvious that the steep incline in energy prices that has been plaguing our citizens cannot be tolerated much longer. as it has led to rising food costs. transportation costs. and inflation. In addition to these economic issues. energy prices also negatively impact national security. One key step in managing this situation is assessing the future supply and demand for crude oil. natural gas. and alternative fuels. By doing so. we limit the unpredictability of the energy market and its impact on daily lives. This will prevent energy and food crises like the one we are currently experiencing from occurring in the future. Additionally. investigating the effects that rapidly escalating energy costs and extreme price fluctuations could have on national security is absolutely crucial. The possibility of energy sales being used to fund terrorist organizations or other adversaries of the United States. cannot be ignored. Americans cannot allow the money we spend on travelling to work or school everyday to end up in the hands of those who mean us harm. This is why we must know the implications of increasing funding through energy revenue to potential adversaries of the U.S.. and we must also understand the intentions of key energyproducing and exporting nations with respect to energy production and supply. This legislation will allow us to decide which countries are trustworthy business partners. and which countries we must limit our energy trade with. It is also necessary to examine the national security implications of Americas dependence on international energy supplies in order to further determine the benefits of exploring alternative energy supplies. By requiring the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress a national intelligence assessment on national security and energy security issues relating to rapidly escalating energy costs. H. Res. 6545 assures that these issues will be examined and addressed. As Members of Congress. and representatives of the people. it is our duty to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Americans. I urge my fellow Representatives to join me in support of H. Res. 6545. which is an essential step for national security.",

The Democratic majority says it will take years to produce oil from offshore drilling and that it wont affect energy prices. If Congress lifts the ban on offshore drilling. we will continue to see oil prices fall. Energy traders do take government policies into account. Deciding to develop our American energy resources can immediately lower the cost per barrel of oil and can provide relief at the gas pump.

Director Mueller has now indicated that he should have provided adequate training. experience and oversight. He is right. But it also ignores what may have been one of the underlying contributors to the ultimate problem now revealed. Director Mueller has for some time now changed personnel policies at the FBI that he knew would drive out some of his best agents with the most and best experience to handle such very sensitive PATRIOT Act powers. When a director decides that his policies are far wiser than others. even as he sees that he is driving many of his best. most experienced agents and employees out of their supervisory roles. he has an even greater burden to see that his agents are trained. Some tried to advise him of the damage to the ranks of experience that he was causing by what he thought to be innovative personnel management. He did not listen. and he did not ensure that the turnover he was creating left adequately trained personnel. It is a wonderful thing when a leader goes against all the critics to do what he knows to be right. and he is. in fact. right. However. when a leader goes against critics who tried to tell him he was wrong. and he is later proved to be quite wrong. he should do the noble thing and step down without further ado.

Voltaire. And where I come from In Tennessee. we generally quote country music. And when we talk about this Tax Code. I generally think of the great James Dean Hicks song sung by Randy Travis. \"When Youre In a Hole. Stop Digging.\" And that is what the American people and what a lot of our constituents are saying. We have dug such a hole with this 17.000 pages of Tax Code. and it is taking too much away. and there is not enough to cover the expenses every single month. So we are kind of looking at the IRS and saying. maybe we will bury these tax books. And I yield back to the gentleman.",

How wonderful for the American people if both sides would come together. if they would join the fiscally responsible Republican Study Committee and say. we are going to have this debate. We are going to get rid of this Tax Code. We are going to set about on the path so that our children and our grandchildren will say. they thought about me. They put in place a tax code that I can do my taxes myself. I can focus on building a business. I will have more money in my checking account. in my savings account. in my business. building that nest egg. They will leave that money with the person that earns it. rather than sending it to a bureaucracy to waste on frivolous desires.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. most Americans are not overjoyed to watch television commercials. but they are willing to tolerate them to sustain free overtheair television. What annoys all of us is the sudden increase of volume when commercials are aired. While the FCC does not specifically regulate the volume of TV programs or TV commercials. broadcasters are required to have equipment that limits the peak power they can use to send out their audio and video signals. This means the loudest TV commercial can never be louder than the loudest part of any TV program. A TV program has a mix of audio levels. There are loud parts and soft parts. Nuance is used to build the dramatic effect. Most advertisers dont want nuance. They want to grab our attention. and to do this. they record every part of it as loud as possible. The peak levels of commercials are no higher than the peak levels of program content. but those peaks are sustained for longer periods in commercials. Ive introduced the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act. CALM Act. to address the volume of commercials. The bill would mandate that the FCC within one year enact rules requiring that advertisements not be excessively noisy and that they must be at the same volume as the television programming they accompany. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this sensible bill.",

He will be remembered for his strong conviction. his populist spirit. and his unwavering commitment to protecting the environment. I want to send my condolences to his family. He was a great public servant to the State of Indiana and our Nation.",

On behalf of the constituents of the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas. I would like to extend to him my warmest congratulations on the commemoration of his Official Installation as Pastor of Progressive Baptist Church. As former pastor of Greater St. Pauls Missionary Baptist Church. his presence in Houston. the fourth largest city in the United States. and before the enthusiastic new members of the Progressive Baptist Church assembled today. serves as a testimony of his renowned commitment to excellence and eminence as one of Houstons foremost religious and community figures. How do you describe a man who is known as a pastor. spiritual leader. and extraordinary community leader? You can do so by simply calling him Pastor Willie Ray Davis. Pastor Daviss commitment to serving his community is exemplified by the many committees that he is involved in and his ability to put the needs of others before his own. Consequently. I would like to join his family. friends and church members in congratulating him on your Installation as Pastor of the Progressive Baptist Church in Chicago. Illinois. Houston and Greater St. Pauls Baptist Church has lost one of its beloved treasures. but I am confident that Pastor Willie Ray Davis will exhibit the same profound preeminence that he exhibited in Houston in Illinois to the members of the Progressive Baptist Church. My wish is that on this momentous occasion. Pastor Davis will look at what a blessing his life has been to others and that he will continue on with his good work blessing his community. congregation. family and friends. Madam Speaker. I would like to congratulate Pastor Willie Ray Davis as he celebrates this wonderful occasion with his family. church members and friends. He has been a pillar of faith in his community and I extend my heartfelt wishes and prayers for a wonderful tenure as Pastor of Progressive Baptist Church.",

I would like to speak about the budget this morning and the concern that I have that the budget President Bush has proposed makes it very clear that his priorities are out of touch with everyday Americans. President Bush would rather maintain his tax cuts for the wealthiest in our communities. while leaving seniors. veterans and working families behind. He also believes that his budget will rid our Nation of debt in 5 years. even though he wants to keep spending billions of dollars in Iraq and maintain these tax cuts for the most wealthy. Further. President Bush continuously fails to be up front with the American people about the true cost of the war. Even in the supplemental that he proposed. he fails to acknowledge the additional cost of the troops and support personnel that will be required by the troop surge. Folks. the numbers simply dont add up. I am disappointed that the budget fails to include ample funding for the Everglades restoration and beach renourishment. which are an important asset and resource in our country. The Everglades and our beaches in Florida are not only important to Floridians. but also national treasures enjoyed by millions of Americans each year. It is time for our government to step up to the plate and fulfill its commitment to the Everglades. our beaches. and all our other natural assets. I am going to fight to make this happen. President Bushs priorities are out of step. and as we continue to debate his budget. I am confident Congress will restore funding to many of the programs our American families deserve and depend on.",

Medicare costs for patients who contract an infection while hospitalized is five times higher than for patients without these infections. For Medicaid patients. costs are 14 times higher. Many hospitals have dramatically reduced infection rates by implementing patient safety procedures. I will be introducing the Healthy Hospitals Act to provide financial incentives to hospitals for savings gained from eliminating these infections. and require public reporting of infections so health care providers and patients can work together to save lives and money.

President Bush sent us a budget this week that significantly shortchanges veterans health care. While our brave troops are fighting abroad as of right now. the President proposes a $3.5 billion cut in veterans health care over the next 5 years. His budget also provides less than veteran service organizations say is needed to meet the growing needs of veterans. including the fact that we have a growing robust amount of veterans with the IraqAfghanistan war. For the fifth year in a row. the budget raises health care costs on 1.3 million veterans. imposing $4.9 million in increased copayments on prescription drugs. and new enrollment fees on veterans over the next 10 years. The budget also increases TRICARE health care premiums for the Nations military retirees. and includes several other changes in military health care that have been rejected by Congress In previous years.

The third branch of government holds its session in public. as it ought to be. The theory behind public court proceedings is that the more public and open. the more likely they are to be fair. More courts throughout the vastness of America are expanding on this public trial concept by allowing unobtrusive cameras in the courtroom. This allows citizens to view court proceedings. When I was a judge in Texas. I allowed cameras to film criminal trials. including a capital murder case. I found that this enhanced the concept of a fair public trial. Those that have never been a trial lawyer or a trial judge say that lawyers play to the cameras. but lawyers dont play to the cameras. they play to the jury or the court.

The overwhelming majority of these Americans are middle class workers who oftentimes accepted better health care coverage over pay increases during negotiations with their employers. Many of these workers either need the substantial coverage for themselves or a sick family member. The Presidents tax increase proposal is the latest assault on employerprovided health care. Employers with older and sicker workers pay higher insurance premiums. not because they have goldplated insurance. but because their insurance companies charge them for more coverage. At a time when 1 million more Americans are becoming uninsured every year. the administration should not provide employers another reason to drop their health care coverage for their workers.",

In Minnesota. methamphetamine usage has increased dramatically over the past decade. With that being said. legislators. law enforcement and concerned citizens are all taking the necessary steps to protect our communities from the threat of methamphetamine usage and production. This legislation addresses the difficult problem of meth lab remediation. Meth production. which occurs most often in residential homes. leaves behind dangerous toxic waste. In fact. according to the Minnesota Department of Health. meth production leaves behind up to 7 pounds of dangerous chemical waste for every pound of meth produced. This waste presents a health risk to future residents and an environmental risk to the surrounding area. In 2005. in Minnesota. 88 major meth labs were discovered. each of which presented significant risk. Although Minnesota has strong local and State February 7. 2007 CONGR] guidelines for dealing with meth lab remediation. the Federal Government can still play an important role in making our communities safer. H.R. 365 will direct the EPA to research and establish important voluntary guidelines for meth lab remediation. Furthermore. the bill will bring together local and State agencies. organizations and individuals to share their best strategies for cleaning up meth labs and determining when they are inhabitable. Mr. Speaker. this legislation is a necessary step toward improving the meth lab remediation process nationwide. It will help local. State and Federal law enforcement safely move forward after discovering a meth lab. and it will make local communities dealing with the methamphetamine problem cleaner and healthier.

I want to take a minute or two to tell the Members that there will be an amendment coming up during the amendment process offered by Mr. BLUMENAUER and myself to deal more effectively with how the Federal Government determines taking into consideration future effects of climate change on the American taxpayer and homeowners. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for the amendment. The amendment does basically two things: Are we. as a Federal Government. providing incentives to put more people in harms way in coastal areas and are we adding cost to the Federal taxpayers as a result of that. and are we incentivizing ecological degradation? I say that because there are maps on coastal areas and there are maps on flooding and there are maps on predicting storms that are all based on history. Nothing is projected into the future with an understanding of what global warming is going to do. Let me tell you how it has impacted my district In the Chesapeake Bay. Poplar Island for decades was a popular place for many people in Maryland. including Presidents of the United States. It was 1.500 acres. It is now 5 acres as a result of sea level rise. We are now restoring that island with dredged material. Holland Island. 350 people lived on Holland Island. It was 5 miles long and a mile and a half wide. It is down to 100 acres today. and nobody lives on Holland Island. Barren Island was 582 acres. It is down to 120 acres now. Areas in my district. Blackwater Refuge. for example. in Dorchester County. loses 120 acres a year due to sea level rise and exacerbated erosion problems. It is not taken into consideration by the Federal Government. by FEMA. or anybody else. to project those natural causes that are occurring right now. In the Chesapeake Bay. sea level used to rise 3 feet every 1.000 years. In the last 100 years. it has risen a foot and a half. It is important for us to take these things into consideration.

I think the work product coming off this House floor will be less than it could have been had we had an open and fair process here on the House floor. It is obvious and true that the National Flood Insurance Program is already in deep trouble. Its $18 billion in the hole. Since 1981. over the last 26 years. its borrowed from the Treasury 14 times. $18 billion in the hole. Certainly it needs reform. I think the underlying reforms for flood insurance in this bill are appropriate and good. and I appreciate the chairman of the committee. and I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts accepting my amendment in the committee that says that new and renewing multiperil policies shouldnt be extended in a time when the National Flood Insurance Program is borrowing from the Treasury.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. Madam Speaker. I am pleased to lend my support to 2 amendments to H.R. 3121. the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. that will help those Americans. including many in my congressional district. at risk of increased flood insurance premiums because of actions of the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA). FEMA is demanding that many towns and communities spend thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to certify levies and other mitigation devices. If the levies are not certified to FEMAs satisfaction. the residents of those communities will face higher flood insurance premiums. Many local governments are struggling to raise the funds to complete the certification in time to meet the FEMAimposed certification deadlines. Several communities in my own district have been impacted by these requirements. My office is working with these jurisdictions and FEMA to establish a more reasonable schedule for completing the certifications. My office is also doing every thing it can to help these local jurisdictions fund these projects. Unfortunately. even though there is never a shortage of available funds for overseas programs. there are no funds available to help countries comply with this new federal demand. While FEMA has thus far been willing to cooperate with my office and the local officials in providing extensions of deadlines for certification. there remains a serious possibility that many Americans will see their flood insurance premiums skyrocket because their local governments where unable to comply with these unreasonable federal demands. In some cases. people may even loose their flood insurance completely. The amendments offered by Mr. CARDOZA Of California will help alleviate this problem by providing a fiveyear grace period for homeowners whose flood insurance coverage is affected by decertification of a levy. During this fiveyear. these homeowners would receive a 50 percent reduction in flood insurance premiums. Another amendment. offered by Mr. GREEN provides a fiveyear phasing in of any changes for flood insurance premiums for lowincome homeowners impacted by the updating of the flood maps. These amendments will benefit my constituents. and all Americans. whose flood insurance is endangered by FEMAs certifying requirements. and I hope my colleagues will support them. I also hope my colleagues will continue to work to help those communities impacted by the new mitigation requirements.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 3121. This bill. the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. takes important steps towards bolstering the protection provided to homeowners in disasterprone areas who face a constant threat of flood and windstorm damage. Nearly all of my constituents and my fellow Floridians fall into this category. In Florida. especially. H.R. 3121 will help to ease the homeowners insurance crisis that grows worse everyday. Expanding the federal floodinsurance program to include wind damage simply makes sense. Those who have their homes flooded are often in the path of destructive storms that wield powerful winds. Common sense would dictate that if we are seeking to help protect homeowners from the liability that comes from destructive natural disasters like hurricanes. we would consider all of the forces of nature associated with these storms. Instead of arguing today why we should include wind damage into this program. the discussion should rather be about why we have gone for so long without it. While I understand the costs associated with this bill are an issue with some of my colleagues. the cost of doing nothing is much greater. Many of the homeowners in my District. in the State of Florida. and in disasterprone areas throughout the United States spend each day staring down the barrel of a gunwaiting for the storm to hit that will put them and their families on a path to financial ruin. We have a chance to do something about this today. It is this bodys responsibility to act in the interest and welfare of the American people. Vote YES on H.R. 3121. and vote yes to protect millions of homeowners and their families.",

This amendment will provide a 5 year grace period for homeowners who are required to purchase flood insurance as a result of new flood maps that decertify previously certified levees. During this period. homeowners would be entitled to a 50 percent reduction in their flood insurance premium while the levees are being recertified. Recently. while updating flood maps in my congressional district. FEMA asked the Army Corps of Engineers to certify that the Santa Maria Valley levees would protect the City of Santa Maria for the next 100 years. Without the Corps certification. much of the community will be placed in a flood zone and many of my constituents will be required to purchase expensive Federal flood insurance. something that many of them cannot afford. The CardozaRossReyes Amendment addresses this problem. Since the Army Corps of Engineers completed the 26mile Santa Maria Valley levees in 1963. the City has prospered. becoming the largest in Santa Barbara County. However.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I rise to support of H.R. 3121 a bill that will modernize and reform FEMAs flood insurance program and thank Chairman FRANK and MAxINE WATERS for their leadership on this legislation. This bill will provide long overdue and muchneeded reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program. NFIP. and update the program to meet the needs of the 21st century. Hurricane Katrina caused property damage from both wind and flooding in parts of five parishes of Louisiana. three counties of Mississippi. and two counties of Alabama. Yet insurance companies in those areas have refused to count claims where property damage was a result of both wind and water. Instead. for 2 years they engaged in the practice of denying and delaying claims and took advantage of the desperation of disaster victims who lost everything. This bill provides fair and equitable protection of combined wind and flood losses by allowing property owners to purchase wind and flood coverage in a single policy. It will help us right that wrong for many victims. As we saw during Hurricane Katrina. FEMAs maps are significantly outdated. often understating flood risk and leaving homeowners without enough information to protect themselves. I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to address this problem by requiring FEMA to conduct a thorough review of the nations flood maps. making the updating and modernization of flood maps an ongoing process. and increasing funding for mapping. H.R. 3121 addresses a number of weaknesses in the Flood Insurance Program that were exposed by the unprecedented 2005 hurricane season. It is a strong bill that will ensure the programs continued viability. encourage broader participation. and increase financial accountability. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I am honored to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3121. \"The Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007\" and I would like to thank Chairman FRANK. Subcommittee Chairwoman WATERS. Representative TAYLOR. and Representative JINDAL for their leadership in reforming a program that plays a vital role in protecting residents and communities in flood prone areas. Flood protection is an important issue in my district and in Texas. a state which has experienced the greatest number of flood and flash flood deaths over the past 36 years. In 2006. Texas saw an increase of over 20 percent in new flood insurance policies under the National Flood Insurance Program. I want to thank Chairman FRANK for working with Congressman HINOJOSA and I in committee to preserve subsidies for those properties that serve as affordable rental housing for many families. A measure was included in the bill to acknowledge that the loss of subsidies for properties that serve as primary homes for rental households could result in significantly higher premiums. to the detriment of these families. Higher premiums would increase the cost of property ownership. a cost that apartment owners would likely pass on to tenants in the form of higher rents. By protecting subsidies for these properties. this measure would ensure their continued affordability at a time when our nation is faced with a shortage of affordable housing. I want to also express my strong support for a provision in the bill authored by my colleague Congressman TAYLOR to expand the National Flood Insurance Program to include coverage for wind damage. Multiperil coverage. or the coverage of both wind and flood risk in one policy. has proven especially important in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as survivors continue to struggle to receive fair compensation for the damages they experienced. Private insurers have used anticoncurrent causation clauses to deny payment for damages on the grounds that the damages occurred as a result of flooding. which is covered by the Federal government. Multiperil coverage would shield consumers from these arguably deceptive practices. protecting consumers in the absence of a solution to this controversy. Again. I express my full support for this important piece of legislation.",

Now. there are some folks who think if somebodys not a citizen or if they are here in the country illegally. you should be able to listen to them. This bill doesnt even authorize that. It has very strict protections for Americans in the United States or for Americans wherever they happen to be. Now. we collect intelligence. We spy overseas.

I believe this was written about in the 9/11 Commission Report. there were two sus54. Pt. 2 2439 pected terrorists. and I know there was an individual whose name I cant recall at the moment. but I believe he was in the counterterrorism division of the FBI who was very concerned about two individuals who he thought were in this country. and he wanted a nationwide manhunt. And he had written a memo in August of 2001 saying. some day someone is going to care about this. that all the protections are being provided to al Qaeda and bin Laden at the expense of the security of the American people. Those two people he was concerned about were the two who crashed the plane into the Pentagon on September 11. I believe it was sometime in the afternoon of September 11 be received his request to go engage in that nationwide manhunt for those two individuals. So this is a very real issue. And I think we should try to conclude this program in the way it began. in talking about the need for bipartisanship. particularly when it comes to national security issues.

For me to say this. after all the battles the President and 1 have had. is good for the President and for me. I wish to do something to move this along. The American public needs the cooperation of Democrats and Republicans. with the President joining in.

I think they probably have been seeing the intermediate actions which have been taken. the requests that have been made by the majority leader. and the response. Even as the time is moving along. there are efforts to try to sort of find some common ground in consideration of additional Republican amendments. as well as some of the additional Democratic amendments. We made remarkable progress. I thought. yesterday afternoon and last evening. We were very hopeful that we could move. this afternoon. in a similar way to consider both the Republican and Democratic amendments. I know and expect we are going to have a proposal that is going to be made by the majority leader in the near future to see if we can*t get back on track. I am very hopeful that will be the case. We have had good debates. good discussions over the last couple of weeks. and I think we have made good progress. We know there are still a number of outstanding issues for our colleagues. We had hoped we would be able to address a number of those during the course of the afternoon but. as we saw when the leader made the requests. there were objections to proceeding in that way. We are not giving up. and the leader is preparing now to make some additional requests. I myself find that his plan is virtually irresistible. but we will have to find out whether our colleagues on the other side feel that way as well.

There is a demand on this side of the aisle to have roughly the same number of Republican rollcall votes that we had when we took up tbis bill in the last Congress. Now. my good friend. the majority leader. keeps referring to Members on our side of the aisle who are not going to vote for the bill under any circumstances. and there are a number of those on our side of tbe aisle. But they are not the key to getting cloture. It is the rest of us. Let me be perfectly clear about it. What I am saying is. the rest of us who would like to be able to vote for cloture and would like to see us pass a bill are going to insist that the others of our colleagueswhether they vote for or against the bill in the endhave a chance to have roughly the same number of rolleall votes we had before. It is not complicated. It is a very complicated bill. but the key to getting it passed is not complicated. We are not that far away from being able to get cloture on a bill. And the people like myself. who. if this procedural hurdle of getting an adequate number of rollcall votes is met. are going to vote for cloture would probably be able to bring enough of our colleagues along to get cloture on the bill. That is why I advise my good friend to give it a couple more days. That is why I also advise himright now. again. tonightif he is going to turn back to this bill. I would not wait a whole long time to do it. It strikes me that it ought to be done sometime in the near future. If we can get this reasonable number of additional rollcall votes.

It is like having a basketball tournament where you have the five players on each side. and they are going to have a tournament. and the winner is the team with the most points. butone problemnobody will supply a basketball. That is what we had here. The logic of the statement of my friend from Kentucky leaves me without a lot of understanding. They want more amendments. We did everything we could to have amendments today. I will go through it again. We started out with eight. They objected to it. Six. five. they objected every time. We said: Do you want more amendments pending? Here they are. We will give you six or eight. Objection. So we know where we are. But lets realize where we are and not make up the facts. The real true facts: We wanted to give the Republicans votes on amendments. Voice votes did not count. It had to be rolleall votes. And I accepted that.

We worked together on a broad range of issues from protecting consumers to stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons to Iran.

Politics is a rough business. with lots of highs and lots of lows. After a long time in politics. I come to understand that the point of it all is helping people. TED STEVENS has helped a lot of people. We all make mistakes. I have made more of them than I have hair follicles. But thank God we will be judged in the next world by the good we do in this world. TED STEVENS has done a lot of good. I wish for you. my friend TED STEVENS. many happy years. I know you will never stop working for the people of your beloved State of Alaska. Bless your heart. TED. I love you. I offer an Irish blessing: May all the roads that you have built. TED. rise up to meet you. and may the wind. TED. be always at your back. May the Sun shine warmly upon your face. TED. and may the rains fall softly upon your fields. And until we meet again. may God hold you. TED. in the hollow of His hand. Bless your heart. TED. I love you.",

I just want to say this to you. The Constitution of the United States said that there will be a difference between the Senate and the House. They said the way to get a constitution is to make sure they provide that individually the States would be adequately represented. And they said: We will make sure of that by creating a U.S. Senate where two Senators represent the State. My friend. I want to say to you. obviously I have traveled a little bit different path in my 36 years. but many times the paths have crossedyou and this Senator. I do want to say that. more than anyone else. you have taught me the meaning of representing my State. You are unabashed about that. That caused me on many occasions to think about what I was doing and whether I was representing my State correctly. to the full extent of my ability. and whether I did that with gusto. knowing that we needed things. For we are comparable in that we are a very poor State. We are among the last that came in. and we have many of the same problems you have. It has truly been a luxury of my life to work with you. to see bow you got things done. and. from time to time. to be able to help you because you askedyou were unabashed in that regard tooto help your State.

Since I was elected a shortto him12 years ago. it has been truly enjoyable to work with TED on the numerous western issues before this body. Often. those issues correspond to Alaska issues. working for a strong military. missile defense. sound land management practices. energy development. He has been very helpful to Colorado. I have particularly admired his work for our Nations military. TED and I worked together. and worked hard. on missile defense. He was an appropriator. I was an authorizer. I should also say. he was a titan of the Senate. I was a freshman Senator. So the workload was a little unfair. in my favor. But we. along with many others. got the missile defense established. I am delighted that after such a rocky fight the system is now a cornerstone of not only our national defense. but of our NATO relationship as well. European militaries understand the value of what we can do. and what protections we can afford them. TED saw this. he knew what the results would be. and he shouldered the burden. fought the fight. and dragged the system into reality. I have had the pleasure of helping TED raise money for his conservation efforts on the World Famous Kenai River. I have been fortunate enough to join him on the river. I had the even greater fortune to win his annual tournament a couple times. Some rivers are just lucky for some fisherman. and while I might wish my lucky river is a little closer to home than Kenai. AK. being lucky on a river famous for its prize salmon is not so bad. And what he is doing for that river. his conservation efforts. is remarkable.

I would gladly yield time to anybody who agrees with the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that. one. that these earmarks are competitively bid. Anybody in agreement here. or. two. that the U.S. taxpayer. after paying for these earmarks. has rights to the technology that developed these earmarks. Any takers there? I didnt think so. I think that is simply wrong. That is simply wrong. An earmark. by very definition. is a sole source contract. It is circumventing the competitive bidding process. Maybe you dont like what the bureaucrats over in the Defense Department do. but to say that this is a competitively bid contract is simply wrong. To say that the U.S. taxpayer has rights to the technology developed with the companies that are getting these earmarks. is simply wrong as well. If anybody can contradict. please take time. But lets not defend these earmarks on that basis when thats simply wrong. Any way. lets get to this one. This earmark. I am sorry. this amendment would eliminate $1 million for the Marine Desalination Systems. Inc.. in St. Petersburg. Florida. for atmospheric water harvesting and reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount. The earmark described in the certification letter submitted to the committee by the sponsor informs us that this earmark would be used to fund lightweight. low power expeditionary water production. According to the website of the entity. Marine Desalination Systems is a corporation that develops new technologies to create inexpensive. potable water. to bring to market. Again. I have the same issue that the last gentleman to offer amendments did. the gentleman from California. Why are we singling out this one company for this project or this earmark? I would ask similar questions to the ones he asked. but these. I think. are more in the defense speak that goes with the language in this bill. Was this project palmed. which means. is it a program of memorandum? I would ask the sponsor that. Is it on any unfunded requirement list? Number 3. does any operator in the field say that we need this particular program or technology from this particular company?

How about getting water out of the atmosphere? Because there is water in the atmosphere. And this company has proved they can do it.

What did you need? We didnt get an answer. We didnt get an answer. so after repeated requests we had to go to the services who were fighting the war and say to them. what do you need? And we identified those items and we put them in that $70 billion supplemental. which most of us voted for. So I was responsible for and got credit for a $70 billion earmark.

I appreciate his tenacity. but I would like to have an opportunity to debate with you the many good things that have been done to defend our Nation and support our troops that have been done created by the Congress. not requested by any administration. One of the very best earmarks that I can give you an example of off the top of my head is the Predator. the Predator that the Iraqi terrorists really hate because It hunts them down and it kills them. The Predator was a congressional earmark. The administration. the Defense Department didnt ask for it. didnt give us any support. We said we need this capability. and we got the capability.

The Doyle Center. which is a monument to its sponsor. is an earmark incubator. much like Concurrent Technologies. a center created out of earmarks for the sole objective for obtaining more Federal contracts or earmarks. The center is a sister organization to a number of earmarks incubators like Concurrent Technologies. which is an entity. as mentioned before. receiving $11 million in earmark funds in the bill. How do we know that there is a symbiotic relationship between Concurrent Technologies and the Doyle Center? For one thing. the chairman of the board of the Doyle Center is the senior vice president and chief financial officer of Concurrent Technologies. We also know that the Doyle Center and Concurrent Technologies work closely together on projects funded through earmarks. It is no surprise that they share the same leadership. According to a recent article in The Hill. the creation of the Doyle Center is adding another layer to three nonprofit organizations devoted to a similar mission of helping spur economic development in the area. the Pennsylvania Technology Council. Pittsburgh Technology Council. and the Catalyst Connection. The article in The Hill stated that all four groups share the same address and many of the same officers. In addition. the Doyle Center handed over a large portion of its earmark money in 2004 to the Catalyst Connection for research. These funds came from a portion of a larger $1.36 million earmark that make up the centers entire budget for that year. Just think of that. We are giving an earmark to a center that is funded completely with taxpayer dollars with the goal of receiving more taxpayer dollars. A certification letter for the project says that $1.5 million in earmark money will go toward the Doyle Center. But with all these groups sharing the same address. the same money. the same officers. do we really know where the money is going? So my answer to the sponsor to the earmark is as follows: Is the money going to the Doyle Center. the Pittsburgh Technology Council. the Catalyst Content. Connect. or the Concurrent Technologies?

I went down to five bases. sent the staff down later. and we found that they didnt have the money to take the troops back when they come back after BRAC. We put $3 billion in that. This is an earmark. Years ago. we put a couple billion in for ships. That is an earmark. and the Navy didnt want them. And yet. the SL7s. if we wouldnt have had them in 1991. we would not have been able to get there. We have confidence in the Members. Under the Constitution.

I would have hoped that the sponsor of the earmark would come and talk about it. But here is another example. as I mentioned. of an earmark incubator where an earmark creates an organization. in this case. named after one of our own. and the same one who it is named after gets more earmarks year after year for the same center to get more earmarks and more Federal contracts.

I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2358. the Native American $1 Coin Act. and I applaud my colleague and fellow Michiganian for cosponsoring this legislation. and the other cosponsors as well. and for bringing it to the House floor this morning. Native Americans have played an important role throughout the history of our Nation. so it is certainly appropriate that we honor them and their accomplishments as well. In fact. were it not for some great Native Americans. America as we know it today might look quite a bit different. Think about Squanto and Somerset. who helped the Pilgrims survive their very first winter in the New World. or Sakakawea. who guided Lewis and Clark across the unexplored North American continent. or Jim Thorpe. the athlete who thrilled millions. really. across the globe with his exploits in baseball and football and the Olympics. where he won a gold medal. or the Navajo code talkers who broke the Japanese code. which was a key moment in the Allied forces prevailing over Japan. during World War II. These individuals and many others like them have made invaluable contributions to the survival and to the character of these United States. This legislation will require the Seeretary of Treasury to mint and issue coins in commemoration of Native Americans and the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development and the history. the very rich history. of the United States. These coins will serve as an important reminder to all Americans of the Important role that Native Americans have played in our Nations history. the things they are achieving today. and the goals that they will meet in the future. Native Americans will be involved in the design selection process as well. which will also remind them of their important historical contributions. So I applaud the sponsors and the cosponsors of this legislation for their efforts. And I urge all of my colleagues to support the Native American $1 Coin Act.",

Barton College won the NCAA Division 11 Elite Eight Tournament by defeating the defending champions. Winona State University of Rochester. Minnesota. College basketball fans. student athletes. and the general public were treated to an exciting national championship game with one of the greatest rallies in Elite Eight Tournament history. Barton College had an extraordinary year. The team won all nine of its overtime games. an NCAA Division 11 record. The team also had a season record of 315 and won their last 21 games. which is a school record. I want to extend my congratulations to Head Coach Ron Lievense. Athletic Director Gary Hall. Barton College President Dr. Norval Kneten. and Bartons student athletes for winning the national championship. I also want to extend my congratulations to Winona State University of Rochester. Minnesota. on an excellent season. Winona State finished their season with only one loss. which happened to be the national championship game. Winning the national championship in such a courageous fashion has brought attention to the outstanding athletic program at Barton College.

I rise in support of H.R. 2637. the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. I appreciate the work of Chairman MILLER and Chairwoman WOOLSEY. as well as the gentleman from California and the gentleman from South Carolina in crafting this legislation. There is no one more vulnerable in our workforce than its youngest members. While the employment of young workers is essential to instilling in them the work ethic and the value of a dollar. their collective safety must be the highest priority of our Nations employers and. indeed. the Nation as a whole. With this in mind. the measure before us would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act by increasing to $50.000 the civil penalty for any type of child labor violation that causes a death or serious injury of an employee under the age of 18. The current maximum civil penalty is $11.000. and it is low by any reasonable estimation. So this update is both prudent and necessary. Moreover. the legislation would allow the $50.000 penalty to be doubled up to a maximum of $100.000 for the willful and repeat violations that cause the death or serious injury of any child employed in violation of the Federal child labor standards. Once again. such an increase is both prudent and necessary. The measure before us is essential for the continuation of the Department of Labors ongoing focus on workplace safety for youth. and I commend President Bush for his work in this issue. Earlier this year. the Department submitted draft legislation similar to H.R. 2637. and before that. the Department proposed new labor standards rules to cover nonagricultural occupations for employment of 14- and 15yearolds. as well as occupations that place the wellbeing of employees under 18 years of age at risk. Mr. Speaker. we are making undeniable. bipartisan progress on updating our child labor laws. As the Bush administration continues its work. the Child Labor Protection Act would provide it with additional tools to address serious child labor violations. decrease repeat occurrences and strengthen the overall enforcement of critical child labor laws. Again. I thank my colleagues for their work on this measure and urge passage of this bill in the House. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The Child Labor Protection Act of 2007 is a narrowly drafted. bipartisan bill that increases penalties substantially for violations of child labor protection provisions that actually cause death or serious injury. Although this legislation does not make the imposition of penalties mandatory. it leaves the decision of whether or not to assess penalties up to the Secretary of Labor. and it provides the Department with an additional enforcement tool to address the most serious labor violations. There is much more that must be done. Mr. Speaker. to strengthen our child labor laws. but this bill is a small first step. It is a beginning.",

    "speech": "I want to first thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me this time. I want to also commend the gentleman from North Carolina for bringing this resolution before us today and commend all of the cosponsors. Mr. DAvis and others. Mr. Speaker. some people might think this is an insignificant resolution. I think there is probably very little that we could talk about today that would be more important than fatherhood and the important role it plays in the life of this Nation. This was brought home to me most vividly in January 1981 when I became judge of the criminal court in Knox County. Tennessee. trying felony criminal cases. the murders. rapes. armed robberies. the most serious cases. I was told that first day by Gary Tullock. the chief probation counselor for east Tennessee. 16 counties in east Tennessee. that 98 percent of the defendants in felony cases came from fatherabsent households. Im not sure that it is quite that high. but I know its well over 90 percent. Its the entire crime problem. 1 hasten to say that I know many good people have come from fatherabsent households. but I also know that children cannot raise themselves. And because 96 or 97 percent of the people plead guilty in criminal cases and then apply for probation. I went through over 10.000 cases in the 7 / years that I served as judge. I cannot tell you how many times I read over and over and over and over again.\" Defendants father left home to get pack of cigarettes and never came hack.\" \"Defendants father left home when defendant was 2 and never returned.\" And so I can say this. that fatherabsent households not only are the root of our crime problem. all the things like drugs and alcohol and all of that come secondary. I know there are exceptions to everything that you say. but we need to get into the minds of our young people and teach them how important it is that fathers dont desert their children as so many millions of fathers have unfortunately over the years and have gone out of the lives of their children much to the detriment of those young people and to the detriment of this Nation. I support this resolution and I commend all of those who have brought this to the floor today. E 1120",

The past decade has seen this nation pull into a shell like a turtle. something the rest of the world took as not caring about the fundamental challenges elsewhere in the world ... before those challenges became fullfledged hot spots. We are a great Nation. a leader among nations. We must only act in that fashion. Today. we begin a new direction in foreign policy. While this Foreign Operations bill deals specifically with our global footprint. it also has benefit for those that live near international borders. For instance. I am pleased the bill includes $15.5 million for the Rio Grande Flood Control System Rehabilitation. a matter my border colleagues and I have been working on for several years. These funds will allow the International Boundary and Water Commission to begin repairing and restoring the 270 miles of levees along the Rio Grande River. This is only a first step to tully restore the integrity o1 the levees. the cost tor restoration is estimated at $125 million. These tunds were requested by the South Texas Delegation. including Congressman HINOJOSA and Congressman CUELLAR. Over the last few years. budget limitations have not allowed the IBWC to property maintain the levees. Used by Border Patrol to patrol the border and farmers to manage their land. the levees have severely deteriorated to the point that some areas are flat. In their current form. the IBWC is unable to certify the levees meaning the 1.3 million residents along this area are in danger of severe flooding. Hurricane Katrina showed us the awesome and dangerous power 01 Mother Nature. This funding is critical to prevent an international tlooding disaster . . . a disaster that will remain possible until all the levees are repaired so IBWC. can certify them. This is--quite literallyIhe least we can do to begin to fix this damage.

I would like to begin by thanking Chairwoman LOWEY for her leadership on the issues facing Colombia and for crafting such a forwardthinking piece of legislation. I visited Colombia a tew years ago. and learned so much about that beautiful country. On that trip I heard chilling accounts of the tragedy that our policies have created. A lot has changed since my trip. but many of the fundamental problems still exist. and in some cases. have worsened. I heartily support the new balance of aid in the FY2008 Foreign Operations bill. As outlined in the bill. now 55 percent of aid for Colombia will go toward military functions while 45 percent will go to rural development. social development. and strengthening the judicial system. This new approach is a dramatic change that will help remedy the problems that our policies have caused. Just this month. the Office o1 National Drug Control Policy announced that more than 387.900 acres of coca were detected in Colombia in 2006. an increase of 32.120 acres from the previous year. The increase in coca production is a huge blow to the proponents of Plan Colombia. which was created in 2000 to reduce drug cultivation. This Foreign Ops bill recognizes the failure o1 past policiesespecially our counterdrug initiatives. and moves U.S. policy in the right direction. The funding in this bill will help families persecuted by paramilitaries. farmners struggling to grow crops other than coca. those displaced by fighting. and the Colombian justice system. which is valiantly struggling to bring justice to victims of violence.

Due to economic mismanagement by the Iranian govemment. this leading OPEC nation now heavily depends on refined gasoline from abroad to run its economy. One Dutch company.

I have long advocated for economic sanctions against Iran as part of an intemational diplomatic effort to halt the regimes pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of the United Nations.

So that is something in the range of 2.5 percent of profits. a much smaller percentage of revenues. of total revenues. So I point out that is not an undue burden on anyone. and I think all of these screams that this is the end of the world for the oil and gas industry are not founded on any kind of basis in fact. I think the whole purpose here is to do some very good things in the Tax Code. which I compliment the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa for proposing. and to do so byunder our paygo rules. find revenue where it will reduce production at the very least. and I think they have done an excellent job in accomplishing that. I urge my colleagues to support the tax package and vote for cloture on the tax package when it comes up for a vote following the Kyl amendment. and obviously I urge all Members to oppose the Kyl amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. when oil was $55 a barrel. President Bush said oil companies dont need taxpayer subsidies to drill. Oil is now just under $70 a barrel. and certainly oil companies truly dont need taxpayer subsidies to drill for oil. The Finance Committee amendment begins to reverse decades of policies that equated what was good for the major oil companies was good for America. and that oil companies would get us cheap and plentiful energy supplies here in America. The reality is. if you go to the gas pump today. you see gas is not cheap. If you look at the impact of a refinery fire or a pipeline problem or a cold snap and the impact on heating oil prices. you see energy is not plentiful. If you look at the growing level of oil imports from countries around the world that dont have our best interests at heart. you will see that what has been good for the major oil companies has not been good for the wellbeing of the citizens of America. The Kyl amendment is just the latest in a long line of arguments that has been advanced on the theory that we ought to keep subsidizing the oil industry or energy prices will go up. oil imports will go up. and America will be less secure. The fact is our people and our country have now experienced the results of past policies based on the idea that we ought to send billions and billions of dollars of subsidies to the major companies. It is time to end those subsidies. It is time to stop the major oil companies from fleecing taxpayers when they drill for oil on public lands. and it is time to embrace the very different vision of a more positive energy future. largely constructed by the chairman of the Finance Committee and the chairman of the Energy Committee. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment and to support the work of the Finance Committee.",

    "speech": "This is a letter from R. Bruce Josten. who makes the point that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the tax increases in the bill and supports the amendment which I offer. which would condition that tax increase on not hurting American consumers. He says: This amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to certify that the tax provisions included in H.R. 6 will not lead to increased reliance on foreign oil or higher gasoline prices for American consumers. As a result. they support the amendment. and I believe they will key it as a key vote. He goes on to say: The Chamber strongly opposes the tax title of this bill because it contains many proposals that amount to little more than a modernday Windfall Profits Tax. When that tax was enacted in 1980. it resulted in higher prices for consumers. long waits at gasoline lines. and increased consumption of foreign oil. That is what we are concerned about here. If the tax increases dont have that effect. then nobody has to worry about it. But if they do have that effect on the American consumers. they would not go into effect. My penultimate point is the argument that we have to do something to wean ourselves from OPEC. so what do we do? We slap a new 13percent tax on the production of new oil. How does that help wean us from OPEC? What it does is to say to the producers of oil: You go out and find some. and by the way. if you do. we are going to hit you with a new tax. This is a perverse incentive. not a proper incentive. Mr. President. I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator CORNYN as a cosponsor of my amendment.",

I think the argument we are hearing today is we should have trust in the oil companies and that ExxonMobil and their friends are staying up nights and days worrying about high gas prices in the best interests of the American people. If anyone believes that. I think we have some good bridges to sell you right now. The truth is the oil companies are ripping off the American people. This moment in American history is a time that our country needs to radically change the way it does energy. and the Finance Committee. in a bipartisan way. and the Energy Committee. in a bipartisan way. are making some very clear statements. What they are saying is that global warming is a huge problem for this Nation today. and if we do not get a handle on it. that problem will only intensify in years to come. What we must begin to do. and what this legislation is making clear. is that we have to break our dependency on fossil fuel. we have to move to energy efficiency. we have to move toward sustainable energy. and in that process not only can we substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions but we can also create millions of goodpaying jobs for the American people. As the chairman of the Energy Committee made clear a moment ago. the oil companies. year after year. are making recordbreaking profits. I for one do not stay up nights worrying about ExxonMobil. when a few years ago they were able to provide a $400 million retirement package to their former CEO.",

My question is: Is it the intent to operate traditionally as has been done. or is the intent to adopt a unanimous consent agreement prior to the bill being taken up?",

Set in historic Bucks County. Pennsylvania. the now closed base was operational during the cold war in order to protect Philadelphia from Soviet missile attacks. Now. 30 years later. these same individuals are working to ensure this base receives recognition through the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commissions Historic Site Program. In a time when fear of missile attacks plagued the entire country. the military built the Nike missile base in our quiet Philadelphia suburb. Currently. the base lies dormant beneath batting cages and other sites from a modem community. Children run over it. unsure of exactly what it is. Though many are unaware of its significant cultural and historical importance. the missile base still retains much of its former integrity. The workers employed there during the cold war underwent extensive military training and carried a strong sense of camaraderie and pride for their country. They worked together to ensure the base was efficiently run and to protect Philadelphia from an imminent Soviet attack. Madam Speaker. for these reasons. on October 5. 2007. this site will become part of the Bucks County Historical Society. The efforts of the great people who worked here will be forever remembered in a timeless plaque that describes the role of this base and the importance it held for our country during trying times. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking those who worked tirelessly to make this honor possinle and those who fought to protect our community. Madam Speaker. I proudly recognize the Nike missile base for its historical significance.",

Clinton has earned a place among the ranks of more than 500 other communities across the country that have achieved this distinction. In honor of this accomplishment. I am entering into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD this special tribute which details the extraordinary efforts made by the people of Clinton and the strong example they have set for other cities in North Carolina and our Nation to follow. Fully incorporated in the year 1822. Clinton has become a community dedicated to progress. development. and civic engagement. It has become a community committed to a strong system of values and faith. And it is this powerful combination that has helped earn the City of Clinton its AllAmerica designation. Three community projects in particular set Clinton apart from the other cities in the competition. First. through the Technology Project at the Butler Avenue School. both students and adults have been given greater access to computers and the World Wide Web. Afterschool programs and \"howto\" classes can now give underserved segments of the community access to modernday technologies and the advantages that come with them. Second. the March to a Million campaign raised over $2 million in donations in just 3 months from professionals. corporations. churches. civic clubs. teachers. alumni associations. and other citizens to help pay for the construction of a new Clinton High School. Students even sold Valentines to help pay for the auxiliary gym. auditorium. and academic programs that could not have otherwise been built and implemented. Third. the city of Clinton has tackled the obesity crisis headon by implementing the Fitness Renaissance program in school physical education classes. as well as building a Center for Health and Wellness. These two efforts have given the citizens of Clinton the proper tools to begin and maintain a healthy way of life. The city of Clinton will be recognized and congratulated for their designation as an AllAmerica City on October 24. 2007. here in Washington. DC. Its citizens are to be commended for this accomplishment. May God bless the people of this great community for the very positive example they have set for the cities around our great Nation.",

For 100 years. the Second Baptist Church has served. with dedication. the Bucks County community. Initially chartered on April 29. 1874. the Second Baptist Church also has its roots in the St. Mark C.M.E. Church of Doylestown. Pennsylvania. A church that originally consisted of a small congregation first expanded and purchased its own building from Abraham Geil on October 1. 1887. Then. on September 26. 1907. the St. Mark C.M.E. Church changed denominational affiliations and was incorporated under the present name of Second Baptist Church of Doylestown. Since that day. the Second Baptist Church and its congregation have been committed to improving the community. Madam Speaker. a strong community can shape the lives of children and young adultssomething I saw firsthand growing up in a working class family in Northeast Philadelphia. The Second Baptist Church provides a place for our community to come together and work together. especially with the ongoing growth of the congregation. Over the last century. the Second Baptist Church has grown in numbers and in spirit. They have formed deep connections to our community that are significant to so many. The Second Baptist Church has many friends and neighbors across our area. When the Second Baptist Church was constructing a new building and was in need of a place to worship. the Christ Community Church of Plumstead. Pennsylvania opened its doors. Their impact on our community is hard to measure but it is all of our hope that it will only grow over the next 100 years. Madam Speaker. the Second Baptist Church is a model for our community and our Nation. Those who worship there today are continuing the legacy of their founders a century ago. I join many in Doylestown and across the 8th District of Pennsylvania in offering congratulations to the Second Baptist Church of Doylestown on its 100year anniversary.",

I also agree with all of the findings in H.J. Res. 52 that praise General Petraeuss exemplary military career. for which he has received numerous awards for his service to our country. However. I decided to vote against this resolution as a matter of principle and because it is a diversionary tactic by the Bush administration and the congressional Republicans. As a legislative body determining important issues affecting our citizens. the Congress should not be in the business of passing resolutions supporting or opposing political ads. Adopting such a practice would consume all our time and divert our attention from important issues like the war in Iraq. The MoveOn.org advertisement was wrong to question the integrity of General Petraeus. It was also counterproductive in that it took the focus off of President Bushs failed Iraq policies and made General Petraeus the political face of the war. That is exactly what the Bush administration wanted. Moreover. by shifting the focus from President Bush to a political attack on General Petraeus. the Republicans have cleverly attempted to divert attention from the Presidents responsibility and the real security issues we are facing in the world. like the reemergence of alQaeda along the PakistanAfghanistan border. I would have supported the resolution that was put forward by Senate Democrats which reaffirms our strong support for the men and women of our Armed Forces. and which condemns all attacks on those who are serving or who have served in the Armed Forces.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3121. the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. This reauthorization and update of the National Flood Insurance Program is needed to ensure all home and business owners in flood zones have the ability to plan for the worst and purchase an appropriate level of coverage. In 2005. we witnessed the extreme case of storm damage. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita showed that insurance companies try to blame wind damage on water. Too many lawsuits have been filed to try to resolve the dispute. This bill creates an option: homeowners can purchase a multiperil policy that will pay them for hurricane damage. whether caused by the wind or storm surge. H.R. 3121 also includes language to further encourage to my constituents on Long Island to purchase flood insurance. A recent study has shown the southern shore of Long Island would be flooded if a Category 1 storm were to strike the area. That flood zone pushes further north on with each intensifying category. The affected areas on Long Island are home to middleclass and businesses. Under H.R. 3121. the maximum coverage for a home increases from $250.000 to $335.000. for residential contents from $100.000 to $135.000. and for nonresidential properties from $500.000 to $670.000. These provisions will ensure that flood insurance participants on Long Island will be able to pick up the pieces and start over following a hurricane. The bill includes another little discussed provision that I strongly support. Most people dont realize that today their finished basement family or media room and its contents are not protected by flood insurance because that room is located below ground level. As more families add on to their homes rather than move to larger homes. basements are becoming another room. often more important than the traditional living room. H.R. 3121 allows optional coverage for improvements and personal property located in basements. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 153. Pt. 18 Too many people who should be purchasing flood insurance have no protection. Some people they live too far from the coast. Others dont realize that their homes are in a flood plain and learn this fact. to their dismay. only after a flash flood destroys their residences. I am pleased that H.R. 3121 funds a program to help communities reach out to residents and encourage them to purchase flood insurance. I commend the gentlewoman from California",

This is a very important designation because it helps to raise awareness about ovarian cancer and its symptoms. In the State of Connecticut alone. over 300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. It is predicted that 190 women in Connecticut will die from ovarian cancer in 2007. Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common female cancer in Connecticut and the fourth most common cause of female cancer death in the State. Although in the United States approximately 20.000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and an estimated 15.000 women die of the disease. there is currently no screening test for ovarian cancer. Until there is a cure for this disease it is important to support and recognize the hard work that organizations are doing to raise awareness for this disease and its symptoms. I want to commend organizations like the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance. OCNA. for its commitment to ensuring that women are aware of the symptoms of ovarian cancer and for its advocacy on behalf of the women and families who have been touched by this devastating disease. Early detection of ovarian cancer must be our focus and education and awareness are imperative. Studies have shown that if ovarian cancer is treated before it has spread outside the ovary. the 5year survival rate is 93 percent. However. only 19 percent of ovarian cancers are found at such an early stage. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing September as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and to work to increase awareness about this deadly disease.",

He also made a point of putting people at ease when they came to testify before the council and for keeping debates focused on the issues at hand. not personalities. This openness. this credibility. this unflinching optimism brought citizens together even when his ideas didnt enjoy universal support. Among his greatest legacies will be his insistence that Highway 36 run through the center of North St. Paul. Some feared the increased traffic would bring nothing but pollution and gridlock. But Mayor Sandberg insisted that thousands of commuters would visit the citys downtown area who otherwise never would know it existed. This championing of all things North St. Paul permeated everything the mayor did. He considered attendance at local high school hockey games and Chamber of Commerce meetings as important as attending council meetings. He encouraged others to participate in council activities and worked tirelessly to connect citizens to their government.

The House Oversight Committee received S. 171 after it had been considered and passed by our colleagues in the Senate. The measure was originally introduced by Senator JAMES INHOFE of Oklahoma back on January 4. 2007. and the Oversight Committee passed the bill by voice vote on June 12. 2008. S. 171 calls for honoring Mickey Mantle by designating the post office in his hometown of Commerce. Oklahoma. as the Mickey Mantle Post Office Building. Mickey Mantle was born on October 20. 1931. Named Mickey by his father after the Philadelphia Athletics Hall of Fame catcher. Mantle is one of the greatest American baseball players of all time. In 1974. he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. and his uniform number 7 was retired. celebrating his 18 years of playing for the New York Yankees. Mr. Speaker. in honor of Mickey Mantle. let us pass. without reservation. S. 171 and rename the post office facility on Commerce Street in Commerce. Oklahoma. after this legendary American athlete.

    "speech": "I appreciate Congresswoman VIRGINIA FOXX talking about Mickey Mantle. He was an idol to many of us that played a lot of sports. I know as a young gentleman who was playing during that period of time. I admired Mickey Mantle. Not only was he a positive role model for myself. in terms of trying to aspire to become a professional baseball player during the time I was in high school. but he was a coal miner. an individual that came from that area in Oklahoma that showed us that with hard work and dedication that you can make it. Not only hearing the history of his personal life but what he did for a lot of us. because not only did he hit from both sides of the plate. which is very important for many individuals. we saw a switch hitter that could hit a lot from both the left and the right. We saw the competition that he led with Roger Maris during that period of time when they were competing for the home run championship. I think having a post office named after Mickey Mantle is a great honor for many individuals. especially as we look at many of the Little Leaguers that play in Little League right now that look towards major league ball players who have played in the past who were a positive inspiration to many of us who say that if you can lead. you can be an inspiration to a lot of us. Therefore. I say that we should support this kind of legislation in naming the Mickey Mantle Post Office Building. I support the legislation. which is S. 171. and I compliment Congresswoman VIRGINIA FOXX for carrying on and going through a whole history of his history and background. where he came from.",

It lowers prices for consumers and protects taxpayers. It expands domestic drilling offshore and on land. It expands renewable sources of energy.

Lyles was among the heroic crew on United Flight 93. which. along with the passengers on board that day. overtook the terrorists and prevented them from completing their diabolical plot.

Shortly before Flight 93 crashed. CeeCee called her husband. Lorne. and told him she loved him and she loved her children. CeeCee was born and raised in Fort Pierce where she served as a police officer for 6 years. In those years as a police officer. she had worked her way from patrol officer to detective. and was respected for her willingness to tackle fleeing criminals. Fulfilling a lifelong goal to travel. she became a United Airlines flight attendant in 2000. where she served with distinction. CeeCee had a true and giving spirit. She loved her volunteer work at a womens shelter that two of her aunts helped found in Fort Pierce.

In this process we have had a large number of holes in the legislation that had been presented to us by the President for this year. and in his budget was $2.8 billion under the bill that we had presented here this evening. In the process there are several items which are very similar and some which are quite different in reaching where we are in this legislation. In particular. the section 8 funding under HUD. we felt that we had to increase the funding for section 8. both for the TenantBased Housing Assistance program and for the ProjectBased Housing Assistance program. by a substantial sum of money. That is done specifically because there was a change in the CR of the authorizations there for funding vouchers. and in order to make certain that every person had their vouchers and no one was going to lose rental assistance. it was necessary then to add about $1 billion into tenantbased and projectbased assistance in order to meet that and fill that need. That is one of the items. We had also to very substantially increase the programs in transportation in order to reach the guarantees necessary for meeting SAFETEALU. which. of course. the President doesnt really care about. So those items. which I think everybody in this Congress agrees with. have had to be increased and require that we not reduce the funding under the legislation to the level that has been suggested.",

We have a lot of common sense in those mountains. We understand when you spend $3.2 billion. thats a lot of money. We have men and women all around America right now sitting around their kitchen tables trying to decide just exactly how they are going to feed their children. how they are going to take care of their families. how they are going to pay the tuition and buy that next tank of gas. We talked about in the last election that we are going to be providing a change here in Washington. I believe the freshmen Republicans that came into Congress with me this year are here to offer that change. The way we offer that change is quit spending as much as has been spent in the past. We can do that. When we have an economy growing about 3 percent and this bill is going to grow by 6 or 7 percent. people understand you cant grow government at twice the rate of the American familys income. It just cant be done. We need to make sure that we use some commonsense when we put these budgets together. We cant spend more money than the American people can earn. I think the American people did send us here to Washington to rein in that spending. get a handle on our fiscal House. I think this amendment by my friend from Ohio will go a long way towards doing that. This is not about a cut. This is simply about holding the line on spending. The American people can understand if they have $100 this year and somebody wants to grow it to $200 next year but you cant afford it. and you say. \"I cant give you $200. but I will let you keep your $100.\" if you kept that at $100. that is not a cut.

I have noticed the signs that talk about the truth needing to be told regarding the majoritys budget that was passed. the claim that while there is no tax increase in that budget. and technically that is true. Mr. Chairman. There is no language in that budget bill that says taxes are raised on anyone in any manner. There is no claim there are additional taxes. That language is not in that budget. But the effect of that budget. Mr. Chairman. will be increased taxes. Why do I say that? Well. because the majority has been very vocal throughout the last year. through the last campaign season. that by golly. one of the things we need to do is get our spending under control. get this deficit problem under control. Well. Mr. Chairman. the problem Is not taxes at this point. The problem today. though. is the spending. because if the spending continues at the rate we are going. that the majority is proceeding. one of two things has got to happen: Either we have to increase deficit spending or we have to increase taxes to pay for it. I would just point out that about $1 in $5 for the budget last year was deficit spending. so how does the majority intend to avoid deficit spending at the same rate that they criticized last year? And. in fact. how will they avoid increasing that deficit spending by spending more this year unless they intend to increase taxes. At some point that choice has got to be made.

And then that family I just described. its going to be tougher for them to pay for that vacation. pay for their kids school. pay for the shoes for soccer practice and Little League and pay for all those things that families have to pay for.

They are very happy to try to run the lives of all Americans from the Federal level. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have produced a real decrease in the tax burden on North Carolinas married couples. single parents. and families. Almost every taxpayer. lowincome. married. single or selfemployed. will lose valuable tax cuts under the assumptions made in the Democrat budget proposal earlier this year. and that would cover the costs that are in this budget tonight.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize and celebrate the life and political legacy of former Connecticut State representative. Richard Tulisano. Richard passed away on Wednesday. February 20. Richard was a giant in Connecticut State politics for over three decades. His political career began in 1976 when he was elected to represent the 29th District in Connecticuts General Assembly. During his tenure. he served as the chairman for the judiciary committee from 1979 to 1985 and 1987 to 1993 and the house majority whip until his retirement in 2001. Following retirement from the General Assembly. he served as chief of staff for House Speaker Moira Lyons. a position he would retain until his passing. I had the privilege to serve with Richard during my tenure in Connecticuts General Assembly and saw firsthand his fearless defense of individual rights. freedom of speech. and tenacious advocacy for \"the little guy.\" He was known at times for a gruff exterior. but beneath it was a heart of pure gold. He taught me a lot about being a good legislator. but even more important about being a good person. The outpouring of people and accolades in the wake of his passing was a testament of how revered and admired he was. Also his wife Beverley was as much a part of his wonderful life story. Madam Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join with me and my constituents in celebrating Richards life and offering condolences to his family.",

    "speech": "Madam President. there are many ways to address the needless outsourcing of jobs. One of the things we could do is to have the Government impose even more restrictions on the private sector. However. in many cases that is not the solution. it is the problem. According to the Congressional Research Service. there is a relationship between high employment restrictions and high unemployment. CRS says: . * * the four largest countries with the most protection (Germany. France. Italy. and Spain) had the highest unemployment rates of any country. CRS cites the \"unintended effect of making firms reluctant to take on new workers\" is the result of the protectionist policies. Interesting comments on this came from former Labor Secretary Robert Reich. who was President Clintons Secretary of Labor. On November 2. 2003. in the Washington Post. he said. in a headline: \"HighTech Jobs Are Going Abroad! But Thats Okay.\" What is he talking about? How did he say that? Man. that sounds bad. That sounds as bad as some of the statements we have heard out of economists in this administration. I will submit the whole thing for the RECORD. but at the end of it he said: So why dont I believe the outsourcing of hightech work is something to lose sleep over? He says: First. the number of hightech jobs outsourced abroad still accounts for a tiny proportion of Americas 10millionstrong IT workforce ... Second. even as the number of outsourced jobs increases. the overall percent of hightech jobs going abroad is likely to remain relatively small. Next: Outsourcing also poses qualitycontrol problems. Next: As smart U.S. companies outsource their more standard hightech work. theyre simultaneously shifting their inhouse IT employees to more innovative. higher valueadded functions. such as invention. creation. integration. key R&D and basic architecture. Theres no necessary limit to the number of hightech jobs around the world.... In conclusion. this former Secretary of Labor says: \ufffd . . it makes no sense for us to try to protect or preserve hightech jobs in America or block efforts by American companies to outsource. Our economic future is wedded to technological change. and most of the jobs of the future are still ours to invent. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Robert Reich be printed in the RECORD.",

The Senator probably remembers the State of the Union speech where the President announced a new program in association with community colleges-$250 million. Then he went out the next couple of days and went to community colleges and worked with local workforce groups about this issue. At the same time. they have cut $800 million from the identical training programs in the last two budgets. That is the record. We can go back. I havent got the appropriations here. but I know it. I am familiar with it because we resisted it and we had amendments here. Again. there was an amendment from the Senator from the State of Washington to restore the training programs. Nonetheless. those programs were cut. You talk one way one day and another way another day. We saw the classic example of it in the State of the Union. We were talking about: Oh. yes. we are going to have a workforce communitybased community college program to upgrade the skills. But in the previous year. and the year before. cutting those work training programs. People arent stupid on this. They know it. I am sure they know it in Connecticut. I know they know in my State. on these workforce investment boards. what is happening and its devastating impact. We had a strong bipartisan effort. when Senator Kassebaum and Senator JEFFORDS chaired. as the Senator from Connecticut remembers. First we had the JTPA. a program we worked out in a bipartisan way in the committee that was chaired by Senator Dan Quayle. People differ about Senator Quayle. He was a stalwart on job training. It was the only social program that passed. as the Senator remembers. during the first 4 years of President Reagan and it took a lot of courage for Dan Quayle. Then we went beyond that. Because we had over 125 different job training programs in 12 different agencies. we wanted to get these pulled together. so we had a KassebaumKennedy commitment to get workforce training in one place. It was bipartisan. We began to fund it and then what happens? As soon as we begin to get life in that. this administration effectively guts this program.",

Why not vote up or down instead of going through the gyration of trying to find some cute way of avoiding having to vote on this issue or coming up with some phony alternative believing that outsourcing is good for the economy? I think shipping jobs away. destroying the manufacturing base and human capital investment that makes it possible in the 21st century for us to be competitive in a global economy is the wrong way to proceed.

I conclude and remind our colleagues about what is happening across the world. That is on this chart. American workers are working longer. American workers are working harder. American workers saw their incomes go down over the period of the last 21/2 years. These are all of the other industrialized nations in the world. It isnt only these workers. Women in our society. women are working longer and harder. Our challenge isnt about American workers. it is about the policies. The Dodd amendment gets to those policies.

Eight thousand Kentuckians are employed at that particular site as a result of the outsourcing from Japan of those jobs into my State. They are highpaying jobs. We are extremely pleased they are there. and we would not want to do anything to jeopardize the existence of Toyota or the 50 or 60 supplier plants that have come into my State as a result of the Toyota company being there to send parts to the Toyota plant.

    "speech": "an important amendment during the markup process to clarify that nothing in this bill imposes any new fiduciary duties on boards that the majority of the committee accepted. However. I am concerned not only about whether this statute imposes new. additional obligations on a board. I am concerned that a court might construe a boards decision to disregard the advice of a shareholders advisory vote as prima facie evidence of a boards failure to satisfy its existing duties. The chairman has frequently said. \"This bill does not do what this bill does not do.\" I hope he is right. because in the Financial Services Committee hearing and markup. in the Rules Committee. and on the floor. he has stressed that this bill is purely advisory. Rather than hope. though. I offer this motion to recommit in order to be certain and to protect the directors in their discretionary exercise of their duties. If this provision is redundant. that is fine. We do a lot worse here than redundancy. As Chairman FRANK often advises. the law is filled with redundancies. and when Members oppose language in language in bills because they are redundant. they are typically being disingenuous. So if this bill really does bar frivolous litigation by activist shareholders. then the majority should have no trouble accepting this motion to recommit. However. if it does not preclude private rights of action. as I fear that it does not. then this motion is critical. If the majority cannot support an amendment that limits frivolous litigation. then their motives are suspect. This motion to recommit protects Americas competitive position visavis international capital markets. If a court can weigh a vote intended as noncompulsory when evaluating whether directors have breached their fiduciary duties. the real beneficiaries of this bill will be trial lawyers racing to the courthouse. The losers will be American enterprise. American stockholders. and. ultimately. American workers. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

And we were literally seconds from actually having that vote. which under the rules of the House would have sent the bill to the committee promptly. There may have been no way to leave the committee with that bill. but you could have started a new bill just like you did. The only difference would have been that the gentleman from Texas would have had his motion voted on. as I believe he had a right to.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for his observations. This has probably gone on longer than the Members or the public wants it to. but let me simply observe that waivers obviously relate to and PAYGO relates to entitlement spending. and while you may not have waived it with respect to spending. because PAYGO does not affect discretionary spending. what it affects. of course. is entitlement spending. The reason it affected the D.C. bill was because the Member from Utah would have had to have been paid and would have been entitled to be paid. So a relatively de minimis sum was involved in that. Frankly. the gentleman and I have a disagreement in terms of the rule that was used. First. the rules have not been amended. They have not been amended. Secondly. this rule was consistent with our rules. The only thing that this rule did that I think caused so much consternation on your side was it adopted PAYGO without opening the bill up to what were amendments that were extraneous to the subject matter and offered the bill on its merits. You were free to offer a motion to recommit. with or without amendments. on the subject matter of the bills. either bill. That was your right then. The tabling simply referred to making sure that we kept our promise that bills would have PAYGO on them. and if they didnt have PAYGO on them. we werent interested in passing them. because we were going to be faithful to our pledge on that rule. That is what the tabling dealt with. It didnt deal with your motion to recommit. If you had defeated H.R. 1906. the second bill with the PAYGO provision. H.R. 1905 would not have gone forward. But our side of the aisle believed that both were important and wanted them together because we wanted the PAYGO provision in there. a relatively de minimis sum in terms of the budget. but consistent with our rule. If I can make another observation on another matter. you mentioned the supplemental had been pending 94 days. It has been pending 73 days. I think that is an important distinction. That is almost a month of legislative work. if not more.",

This cynical bill uses our troops as a political bargaining chip for additional billions in unrelated. pork barrel spending. which has nothing to do with winning the global war on terrorism. This bill has become a Christmas tree of pork. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. what does $25 million for spinach growers. $74 million for peanut storage. and $50 for the Capitol Power Plant have to do with winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. the list of unrelated spending goes on longer than I have time. Spinach producers and peanut farmers may very well need and deserve the money. And I am sure the Capitol Power Plant needs improvements. but why in this bill? Why is this money not being considered through regular order or subjected to normal budgetary rules. like PAYGO? And most importantly. why at the expense of our troops? This important spending bill is being used as a vehicle to micromanage the war and score political points. Our troops deserve better. We need to focus on getting the equipment to our troops on the front lines and get away from political posturing. However. this bill is not about the troops. It is about politics. It is about tying the hands of the commanderinchief because some in this body do not agree with his policies. People on both sides of the aisle can certainly agree that mistakes have been made in Iraq and a change of strategy is long overdue. However. what should this change of strategy be? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq. leave the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk? Or do we need a new strategy to win the war and finish the job? While no proposal guarantees success. a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. support would guarantee failure. The stakes are too high to fail in Iraq. It remains in Americas strategic interests to ensure regional stability in the Middle East and to deny terrorists a safe haven in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. Furthermore. I hope that the House leadership will bring up a clean bill that focuses solely on supporting our troops and not one filled up with pork and unrelated spending.",

A vote against this bill is a vote for the President but against our soldiers. it supports the war but abandons our young men and women in uniform.

This country cannot afford another Walter Reed. nor can it afford to send the President another blank check to indefinitely extend this occupation.

But I do believe. in regard to Iraq. that it is the best we are able to do right now. The legislation for the first time establishes performance benchmarks for the Iraqi military and government. and firmly states that it is time to bring the troops home sooner rather than later.

I am particularly troubled by the nonmilitary and nonveteran spending in this bill.

President Bush outlined several benchmarks for the Iraqi govemment in his January 10 address. Unfortunately. there were no real consequences for the Iraqi government if these benchmarks were not met. Todays vote put real pressure on Prime Minister Maliki and the Iraqi government to meet these benchmarks. If the Iraqis do not step up and take control of their own security.

All U.S. troops must begin their redeployment by March 1. 2008. by which time. the Iraqis will have had ample opportunity to be trained and take control of their situation.

March 23. 2007 CONGR The President was quoted yesterday as saying we needed a clean bill to fund the rebuild of Iraq. I disagree with that statement and suggest that we need the comprehensive bill put forth by the majority. so that the people of the Gulf Coast States can rebuild. For too long we are funding the rebuilding of foreign communities. While this is admirable. the American people deserve first call on the rebuilding money. and help when it is their very tax dollars that are being spent. My Caucus leadership took me seriously when I challenged them to put forth action rather than words. The supplemental appropriation bill we are debating tonight is the first and only vehicle available to KatrinaRita affected citizens! Because of budgetary rules. there is no other opportunity to address the unfinished levees. the rebuilding needs of local governments. affordable housing so people can return. and help for the coastal fisheries and farmers who have. to date. been virtually ignored. My colleagues in the affected Gulf Coast States need to decide where they stand. If we let this one chance for $1.3 billion in levee assistance pass us by. every Member of Congress who votes against this should be held accountable for putting South Louisianas citizens in harms way. Are you in support of your Party. or are you for helping Louisianians. Mississipians and taxpaying Americans? I support the Americans! I would also like to submit the following clarification for the record: This supplemental will provide funding for agriculture and fisheries disaster assistance along the Gulf Coast. For livestock producers. our intent is to increase the payment limit for those who lost hundreds of cattle as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These cattlemen have been inadequately compensated as a result of previously underfunded USDA programs. Our citrus growerswhose groves were destroyed from up to a month of saltwater several feet deepshould receive an increase in the payment rate for USDAs hurricane assistance program. Additionally. this bill contains desperately needed assistance for our shrimp. menhaden. as well as other fisheries that were devastated by the storms and. unfortunately have been forgotten for the past 18 months by the Administration and Congress.",

I have decided to support this legislation. With todays vote. we are taking an important step toward ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home. This legislation does not go far enough for me. I pushed for a vote on a course of action that would have gotten us out of Iraq much sooner and stipulated that all funding go toward drawing down troops. The House Rules Committee did not allow a vote on this position. and even if they had. I know that there are not enough votes to support it. Todays vote was a very difficult one for me and I have been carefully weighing the impact of this legislation for weeks. In the final analysis. I decided that H.R. 1591 carried enough practical and symbolic weight that if it needed my vote to pass the House. then I should support it. For me. the most important component of this legislation is that it stipulates the withdrawal of troops must begin no later than March 1. 2008 and be completed within 180 days. It also establishes specific benchmarks that the Iraqi government must meet. benchmarks that mirror the criteria President Bush himself set forth in his 2007 State of the Union address. If real progress on these benchmarks is not made by July 1. 2007. then U.S. troop redeployment will begin immediately and must be completed within 180 days. President Bush has been threatening to veto this bill for weeks and I fully expect he will do so if it reaches his desk in its current form. Regardless. the House is sending an important message to the President today by passing this legislation. In the weeks and months ahead. I will continue to do everything I can to end this war. There may not have been enough votes today to bring a faster end to this war. but there were enough to establish a date certain for withdrawal.

President Bush announced to the American public and the world that the mission in Iraq had been accomplished. Now. nearly 4 years later. our military is still deeply involved in Iraq--with no end in sight. This spending measure puts pressure on the Iraqi government to follow through on their political and security promises and ensures that our government will lake the necessary steps to scale down our military involvement in Iraq. In fact. it actually gives the Iraqis the leverage they need to push the agenda beyond a military solution. This legislation may not be the preferred way to end this conflict. but not one good choice remains. Up until now. Congress has been AWOL in its oversight responsibility. As a result. our military readiness has suffered. Without this legislation. the readiness and strength of United States military will continue to degrade. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee. I cannot sit idly by and watch our Army and our National Guard be stretched to the brink. Nor can we tolerate the strategic risk posed by devoting so much of our militarys time. training and equipment to the conflict in Iraq. Mr. Speaker. without this legislation. the administration will not be held accountable to achieve progress and success. Now is the time to exert oversight of this conflict and make the difficult. but necessary choice of establishing requirements and expectations. From the deck of the U.S.S. Lincoln President Bush said. \"Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit. Americans. following a battie. want nothing more than to return home.\" Mr. Speaker. Americans have bravely fought for 4 years to protect the United States and bring hope to the people of Iraq. For the sake of our military readiness. international credibility and safety of Americans in harms way in Iraq. it is time to make plans to bring them home. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a hard look at where we are today in Iraq. and vote for legislation that will provide the funding our troops badly need and accountability for success and results in Iraq.",

Space Ship One flew again on September 29. 2004. and on October 4. 2004. and upon successful completion of these flights. Mojave Aerospace Ventures. the developers of Space Ship One. captured the $10 million Ansari X PRIZE. Just as important as Space Ship Ones historic flights. the competition for the X PRIZE spurred the creation of a private spaceflight industry in this country.

This new prize will award a multimilliondollar prize to teams that can design. build and demonstrate productioncapable vehicles that achieve 100 miles per gallon or its equivalent. With the current price of oil hovering around $100 per barrel. it is more important than ever that our country develops technologies that increase the efficiencies of our automobiles. To this end.

I would like to thank Mr. LUNGREN for introducing this resolution. and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker I reserve the balance of my time.",

Shell Oil Company sent out a press release saying that by no later than 2015 the world would not be able to meet the demands of our economies for oil and natural gas. At just about the same time as that. a group came to my office to brief me on the Automotive X PRIZE. You may have noticed how much harder people will work for a prize than they will for money. Just note the Olympics and what these athletes will do for a prize. So I am very. very supportive of this fantastic idea. I bought the first Prius in Maryland. I bought the first Prius in Congress. and I want to buy the winning car from this competition. I have here a note from Donald Foley. who is the executive director of the Automotive X PRIZE. and he has noted my desire to buy that winning car. So hopefully we will be driving that to the Congress in not too long. Thank you very much for yielding.",

Those unable or unwilling to secure grants can participate in the race for the goal. With prizes. government funding is not used to pick technological winners and losers. The prize is only awarded if the goal is met. Prizes encourage the investment of private capital and research. even beyond the monetary value of the prize. I applaud the X PRIZE Foundation for spurring competition and innovation in the race to a more efficient automobile. When the 100 milepergallon vehicle is achieved. citizens of my home State of Nebraska will be able to drive across the State on Interstate 80 on only 4 gallons of fuel. This tremendous efficiency would dramatically reduce our Nations dependence on foreign oil. it would stimulate our economy. and certainly improve our national security. I am grateful for the vision and enterprise of men like Dr. Peter Diamandis who kindle the spark of innovation that leads to revolutionary technologies.",

I know that the NDI and the NRI. the National Democratic Institute. National Republican Institute and these organizations that we promote as a country. we need to. as a Congress. continue to support those organizations because they are absolutely indispensable towards our national security in helping to secure better faith and confidence in these elections that are taking place around the world.

I applaud the people of Kenya for pursuing their right to democracy. Democracy is a fundamental right to be shared by all. Voting is at the core of a democratic society and conveys the will of the people. I encourage the Kenyan government to work diligently and quickly to restore order to their nation. Violence should not be used as a means by which to achieve political objectives. After the devastating bombing of the U.S. embassies in 1998. Kenya became a crucial ally in the global war against terrorism. Thus. the welfare and stability of the Kenyan people is of concern to the United States. I am hopeful the leadership and strength that prevailed during that crisis will rise and put an end to the current devastating violence. I encourage the Kenyan leaders on all sides to welcome the U.N. human rights teams to investigate the violent acts that have destroyed the confidence of the citizens of Kenya. In doing so. the government can slowly start to rebuild the trust of its citizens. Therefore. I urge Kenyan officials to do everything humanly possible to end the unprecedented bloodshed and violence. It is unsettling to hear that over 1.000 people have lost their lives and more than 300.000 have been displaced. Kenya was hailed as a great example of democracy for other African nations to emulate. I look forward to the day when Kenya returns to its pursuit of democracy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Res. 947. a resolution congratulating Lee MyungBak on his election to the Presidency of the Republic of Korea and wishing him well during his transition and inauguration on February 25. The United States and Korea share a longstanding and special relationship. Our strong alliance is rooted in the common principles of freedom and democracy. Today that relationship has blossomed into a strong economic partnership in which the Republic of Korea has become one of the United States major trading partners. In my State of California. Korea is the States fifth largest trading partner and the Los Angeles Custom Districts third largest trading partner. with $18 billion in twoway trade annually. In my congressional district in Los Angeles. Hollywood. and Culver City. ethnic Koreans have built a thriving business and cultural area known as Koreatown. Many maintain close cultural. business. and family ties to their homeland. Accordingly. it is my hope that the Republic of Korea will be fully admitted into the Visa Waiver Program in the very near future so that we may share even closer peopletopeople exchanges between our two countries. H. Res. 947 is also timely and important due to the ongoing SixParty Talks and current attempts to dismantle North Koreas nuclear weapons program. Presidentelect Lee has pledged to make the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula a priority of his administration. In order to achieve the goal of a nuclear free Korean Peninsula. the Republic of Korea will need the full support of the United States. Madam Speaker. as cochair of the Congressional Caucus of Korea and the U.S.Korea InterParliamentary Exchange and as a member of the House Subcommittee on Asia. the Pacific and Global Environment.

Madam Speaker. not a little more than a half century agowithin living memory of several Members of this House. most notably our distinguished Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. my dear friend Mr. RANGEL--the Republic of Korea was an impoverished casualty of imperialism and war. It has since grown to be affluent and productive beyond the wildest dreams of the American and South Korean soldiers who fought shouldertoshoulder for freedom and democracy during the Korean War. There are over two million Americans of Korean descent living throughout the United States. from Hawaii. where the first Korean immigrants landed a little more than a century ago. to New York. which is home to one of the largest and most vibrant Korean American communities in the Nation.

Because of the importance of the land to the cultural survival of the Tribe. the legislation requires that the land may only be used for the protection. preservation. and maintenance of archaeological. cultural. and wildlife resources. Only maintenance roads may be constructed and the land must be administered in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the Tribe and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The pending measure would also transfer approximately 12 acres to the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. which has an unauthorized electric line on part of the land. The land will be transferred only upon payment of fair market value for the land. plus payment for the past unauthorized use of the land. Last Congress. a similar measure passed the House. and I would note that this measure is supported by the City of Temecula. and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors.

Despite the success of this law. in this instance. the law is impeding two Tribes located in Oregon and their efforts to engage in nongaming economic development. In this case. the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 20 acres of land to these tribes via a quitclaim deed. But because it was transferred pursuant to the Indian SelfDetermination Act. it contains a reversionary clause. This clause requires the land to revert back to the United States if the land is not used for economic development purposes. Although the Tribes intend to use the land for economic development purposes. they are unable to obtain conventional financing because of the reversionary clause. Senator SMITH of Oregon introduced S. 375 to address this issue and our colleague Representative DARLENE HOOLEY is the sponsor of an identical measure in this body. The legislation simply directs the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a quitclaim deed that is not subject to the Indian SelfDetermination Act. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Too many of these road crash fatalities can be prevented through legislation. consistent enforcement and better education on the use of safety precautions such as seatbelts. child restraints and helmets. Drunk driving prevention programs and campaigns such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving are useful tools to bring awareness to such tragedies. Communities and families worldwide must work together to prevent road crashes and related deaths. These traffic accidents injure or disable more than 50 million people.

The Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio. Mark Parson. and John Marin Linde have still not been brought to justice. John Branchizio. Mark Parson. and John Marin Linde were slain by terrorists who assaulted a clearly marked convoy of American diplomats. Ironically. the diplomats were on a mission to help the Palestinians by identifying Gazan candidates for the Fulbright exchange program. In February 2005. Palestinian Authority President. Mahmoud Abbas. assured Secretary of State Rice that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. Further. senior Palestinian officials asserted that the Palestinian Authority knew the identities of the assailants. Yet inexplicably. these terrorists have not been named. they have not been questioned. and they have not been arrested. charged. prosecuted. and punished. No way is that justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. It is imperative that the legitimate leaders of the Palestinian Authority show their willingness to confront the scourge of terrorism if they are to be considered a reliable partner for peace.

Congresswoman THELMA DRAKE. for sponsoring this important resolution and for her leadership on this issue. Twentyfive years ago. William and Kathleen Magee of Virginia traveled with other medical professionals to the Philippines to treat children with facial deformities. Little did they know it was a trip that would change their lives and the lives of thousands of children around the world. Inspired by the Filipino children. the Magees decided to start their own organization designed specifically to address cleft palates and cleft lips in countries where medical care leaves those afflicted with few options. They called it Operation Smile. and the Magees were the perfect couple to start it. William is a plastic surgeon. and Kathleen is a nurse and social worker. Since 1982. operating out of their headquarters in Norfolk. Virginia. they have led a dedicated coalition of medical services workers to address facial deformities around the world. Aside from appearance and comfort level. these are serious conditions that can cause problems with feeding and speech. as well as ear disease. In the past 25 years. Operation Smile has provided corrective reconstructive surgery to some 100.000 children and young adults in 25 countries. Operation Smile adeptly recognizes the differences in these countries and brings together medical professionals to tailor their care depending on the setting. The organization coordinates training activities. as well as fellowships and professorships. to further both its own mission and the medical system in these countries overall. Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the United States with children born with facial deformities. It runs an annual international student leadership conference and student leadership program. and it trains surgeons in certain advanced skills. We can all learn from Operation Smile and the model it provides to medical professionals and organizations around the world. and we can all learn from the Magees that public service can go far beyond ones chosen profession. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor Operation Smile and William and Kathleen Magee on the 25th anniversary of their organization. Madam Speaker.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor the 25th Anniversary of Operation Smile. a worldwide childrens medical charity that repairs cleft lips and cleft palates for children and young adults in developing countries. Operation Smile. which is headquartered in Norfolk. VA. was founded by Dr. William Magee. Jr.. a plastic surgeon. and his wife. Kathleen. a nurse and clinical social worker. In 1982. the Magees traveled to the Philippines with a group of medical volunteers to repair childrens cleft lips and cleft palates. While many children were treated. the inundated volunteers. lacking in resources and manpower. were forced to turn away the majority of those who sought help. The Magees were heartbroken to see such an overwhelming need. Yet. instead of being discouraged. the Magees were inspired by their experience. As they prepared to leave the Philippines the Magees made a promise to return to the Philippines to help more children and Operation Smile was born. The Magees returned to Norfolk and began to solicit the donations of surgical equipment and supplies. began grassroots fundraising. and assembled a volunteer team of doctors. nurses and technicians. Just as they promised. the Magees returned to the Philippines to treat even more patients. Since those humble beginnings in 1982. Operation Smile has grown into a worldwide childrens medical charity whose network of medical volunteers are dedicated to helping improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Operation Smile has helped more than 100.000 children and young adults in 30 developing countries overcome their physical irregularities. The organization now operates one of the worlds largest volunteer networks. utilizing more than 5.000 medical and nonmedical professionals around the world. During their medical missions. credentialed medical professionals volunteer to repair facial deformities while building public and private partnerships that advocate for sustainable healthcare systems for children and families. Furthermore. Operation Smile trains and educates local medical professionals and leaves behind necessary equipment to lay the groundwork for longterm selfsufficiency. I commend the Magees for their passion to improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Through Operation Smile. their efforts over the past 25 years have offered new life and new hope to those suffering from facial deformities and their families. In recognition of Operation Smiles 25th Anniversary. I am truly honored to commend their noble work here on the floor of the House of Representatives.",

More than 140 years ago. the great Henry Dunant founded the International Committee of the Red Cross after witnessing the atrocities of the Battle of Sol ferino in 1859. Mr. Dunants heroic advocacy on behalf of the humane treatment of wartime sick and wounded spawned a global movement dedicated to helping those in need and protecting human dignity for all. Today. there are more than 185 Red Cross. Red Crescent and Magen David Adom societies throughout the world and more than 750 chapters in the United States alone. These organizations help vulnerable people in communities prevent. prepare for and respond to and recover from disasters. complex humanitarian emergencies and lifethreatening conditions. The red symbols of these great organizations are unambiguous. internationally recognized. signs of comfort. hope and protection. The American Red Cross. in particular. is a vital lifeline for many people. both in this country and abroad. In conjunction with its sister national societies throughout the world. it has assisted millions of distressed individuals. In 2006 alone. the American Red Cross responded to 23 international disasters and contributed more than $16.1 million in financial support. Often beyond the lens of cameras or public view at some of the most devastated corners on Earth. the American Red Cross represents our country and our national spirit of generosity and hope. To honor Mr. Dunants legacy and the work of thousands of volunteers and donors. the American Red Cross and its partners will celebrate World Red Cross Red Crescent Day. This resolution pays tribute to this event and to the work of thousands of volunteers internationally.

I think that particularly those of us in the Republican Party. most of us have led lives that keep us in touch with our constituents. We havent spent a lifetime in Washington. We havent advocated for being in Washington 5 days a week. out of touch with the American public. There are a couple of things that have been said that I think have to be responded to today. They havent been responded to properly in the last few weeks. I dont think. One is the Clintonsquandered surplus. Let me remind the majority party that the reason we had a surplus during the third and fourth years of the Clinton administration was because there was a fiscally responsible Republican majority in the Congress. You cannot attribute the surplus to a President who has no control except to veto. I want to say something about the waste of money on the war in Iraq. Were we not supporting those brave men and women who are currently serving not just in Iraq. but all over the world keeping us free. we wouldnt have the right to come to this floor and say the things that we say. The Federal Government was formed for the defense of this Nation. That is where money should be spent so we can maintain our freedom. Nobody wants to be at war. I dont want to be at war. The President. I dont believe. wants to be at war. But we are at war because we were attacked. Those people have said repeatedly they want to destroy us. they want to destroy our way of life. We need to spend what we have to spend to keep our freedom. We dont have to raise these budgets by 10 percent to keep doing what we need to do for the American people.",

I am somewhat curious from time to time why so many Members on this side of the aisle appear to be so grumpy. since they did win the last election. The gentleman said that early on that he wasnt sure if we cared. We certainly care about the gentleman from New York. We just care even more about hardworking taxpayers in our districts. He talks about the devastating cut that an amendment to levelfund this bill would be to the government. A devastating out. when you are giving them exactly the same amount of money this year that you gave them last year. Webster must be spinning in his grave. I have actually looked up the definition of \"cut\" and it means \"to reduce.\" So for levelfunding this bill. I fail to see this thing called a cut. What I do know is being cut is the family budget. because. as the gentleman from Ohio has aptly pointed out. there is all of this spending. a 9.9 percent increase. and somehow it is devastating. devastating. anything less than a 9.9 percent increase in this agency. Well. how about the $3.000 a year largest tax increase in history that this is part of? This spending. this 9.9 percent increase is being funded with this largest tax increase in history. That is where the devastating cut is coming. Mr. Chairman. in the family budgets of American families all across the Nation.

I wanted to say something about the fact that they were here and how good it is that we have children on the floor and that we have young people watching what we are doing. They are here to remind us that the actions we take now are so important in the future because we are setting the stage for their future. The majority party made a lot of promises last year on a lot of little issues. in my opinion. but they have done nothing to really fulfill those promises. They particularly have done nothing to deal with the longterm liabilities that we have facing us. We know that pretty soon 70 cents out of every dollar coming into the Federal Treasury is going to be dedicated to Medicaid. Medicare and Social Security or we wont be fulfilling the obligations we have made. So those children are going to be faced with tremendous responsibilities in dealing with those issues. and I think it is important that we acknowledge that. The other thing I want to say is that one of my colleagues talked about wanting to compare notes on having lived in public housing projects. Without realizing it. I think he made one of my points for me. One of the problems that we have in this country is that the Federal Government is funding things it has no business funding. If the States and the localities want to subsidize housing for people. that is one thing. But having the Federal Government absorb that kind of responsibility. in my opinion. is not right. My family didnt grow up in public housing. We never asked for public assistance. We did it on our own. We did without a lot of things. but we did it on our own. And I think we have to look for ways to help the American people learn to live without subsidies from the Federal Government.",

Mr. SERRANO and my fellow Members. it seeks to say that if you are doing business with the Federal Government. if you are a contractor building something or selling something to the Federal Government. then you should have a Social Security verification for your employees. This was Inspired by two things: Number one. the fact that the American people have spoken. They do not want comprehensive immigration reform. They spoke so loudly and so well that even the United States Senate eventually heard their voices. Now. weve heard their voices in the House and we have passed lots of immigration reform measures. such as fences. such as the REAL ID Act. some other things that we have put on all the bills on a bipartisan basis. What this says. though. Is that if youre the contractor building the fence on the border. as we have had a real case. then you have to make sure that you have legal immigrants. legal people. working for you. Thats all it is. There are a lot of people who sell to the Federal Government in the school lunch program. There are a lot of people who work for the defense. a lot of people who work for these agencies. a lot of just different contractors who may have Illegal aliens working for them on a Federal Government job. and the only thing that this does is says that those contractors have to be involved in the basic pilot program. which is a program in which technology enables these employers to check Social Security numbers for authenticity within about 90 seconds.

So instead of the bill growing. since last year. by 9.9 percent. the bill will then grow by 9.4 percent. Thats all were talking.

As a former insurance commissioner of the State of Florida. he has more than a passing familiarity with these issues. He has described it. made the case more eloquently than I did about the difficulty we have with the wind amendment. not on the substance of whether we ought to do something about it but whether we can and what the effects of this amendment could be. I commend him as someone who understands that. for laying it out and the problems inherent with it. As he and my colleagues know. the ability to then alter that kind of amendment then becomes almost impossible in this process. As I said earlier in the presence of my friend from Mississippi. we. Senator SHELBY and I. are deeply involved in the foreclosure issues. as we have been over the last number of months. As our colleagues are aware. this subject matter of catastrophic insurance would have been the major subject matter of the Banking Committee. I regret we were caught up in the foreclosure situation. for obvious reasons. But that does not minimize at all the situation my colleague from Florida facesor that other States do. It is not only a Florida issue. this is an issue that affects all of us in this country. and we need to have a far better plan in place on how we deal with it. I mentioned earlier: Pick up this mornings newspaper. You read the headline in the local newspaper and every newspaper. I presume. across not only this country but around the world on what happened in Myanmar. 120 mileanhour winds. devastation. loss of life. These problems are occurring around the globe.

It is important. symbolically. to get something done. Now. the Senator from Mississippi has suggested another idea. that at the end of the day. when it is very difficult to enact a national catastrophic fund. what the Federal Government can do is encourage. by giving incentives to the States. enactment of a regional catastrophic fund. Florida. of course. had to take the lead because we were the ones who got devastated in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew. Florida set up this fund called the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It is a reinsurance fund to insure against catastrophes. But that cost is spread over 18 million Floridians. Does it not make a lot more sense to spread that hurricane catastrophic risk over 50 million Americans. by getting all the Gulf States and the Atlantic coast States to combine in a regional catastrophic fund. since at the end of the day. it is going to be very hard to get a national catastrophic fund? So as we get on down the line. with the commission. if that is the only thing that survives this legislative process. then certainly that should be an item on the table that the commission would consider when they would report back to the Congress. I am hopeful for the first time now. we have something on the floor that is going to address this. and I am grateful I can speak out on behalf of 18 million Floridians who are hurting because what they want is available and affordable homeowners insurance. Right now many times it is not available. and they have to go to a government insurance company such as Citizens or it is unaffordable. Remember. if you cant have homeowners insurance. you cant build homes. make loans on homes. or sell homes. The necessary component for all three of those industriesreal estate. construction. and bankingis an available and affordable homeowners insurance policy.

I am sure this debate went on in the Florida Legislature. But they were so desperate. they actually had no recourse because the Federal Government will not come up with a plan that will work for everyone. So Florida had a choice: They could either shut down every commercial business. shut down every homebuilder. completely stop the housing market in Florida. or they could selfinsure themselves. It was a pretty desperate situation. so Florida went ahead and did that. But let me explain. Louisiana is not a rich State. and we are not a big State. We cannot insure ourselves that way. If we had another Katrina. the whole State would go bankrupt and our kids could not go to universities. our hospitals would shut down. I know people think I am making this up. but it is the truth.

Many Members are curious about votes this evening. We would like to give a clear indication of when the votes are likely to occur. Let me take a few minutes and respond. First of all. all of us in this Chamber. including myself. have expressed ourselves over the years in terms of what has happened when people have been devastated by natural disasters. including those in the gulf area. I have traveled down there reviewing the area and seeing what happened. We all care deeply about what happened to people in the Gulf State areas. In terms of the devastation that occurred. Let me point out quickly that is not the debate. in the sense whether we understand it. It is what we can do about it. The bulk of this legislation. as presently writtenit is a given that most of the 5.5 million properties that are going to be covered are in the Gulf State areas. FEMA borrowed money from the Federal Government to pay the $17 billion in claims. The flood insurance program generates about $2.5 billion each year as a result of premiums as part of the fund. and about $1 billion of that goes to administrative costs. There might be a legitimate amendment as to why there is so much administration in that program. That is bow it breaks down. You are left with $1.5 billion to cover this. As a result of natural disasters and floods. here we are left with a debt of $17 billion. which FEMA owes to the Federal Government. In the process of paying that debt. they are Increasing the premium costs. unless we take action. So",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator LANDRIEU. my friend from Louisiana. which would allow the mandatory purchase provision for areas behind levees and dams to be eliminated. Currently. the flood insurance program suffers from a $17 billion deficit. mostly as a result of payments made to individuals living behind manmade structures such as levees and dams. The fact that people behind manmade flood protections do not have to purchase flood insurance clearly sends the wrong message. As we all know now. flood protections sometimes fail. Telling people they need not protect themselves from the risks associated with those failures provides a false sense of security. Keep in mind that all of these individuals will be required to pay a rate that reflects the risk associated with living behind flood mitigation devices. Currently the rates behind many of these structures would suggest an individual homeowner would pay approximately $316 for coverage up to $350.000. That is less than $1 per day for full flood protection. $1 dollar a day. This bill eliminates the entire debt associated with this program that is owed to the Federal Government. but it also demands that in the future people begin to pay a fair price for the risk associated with living in highrisk areas. This amendment would require that we undertake a study as to the effect of requiring insurance behind manmade structures. I believe we have learned all we need to know about the risk associated with living behind manmade flood protection devices. The insurance premium takes into account the real risk properties face. Levees fail. They fail all the time. They do not eliminate all risk. Flood insurance protects people against unforeseen risk. These amendments do not recognize that fact. A prudent course is riskbased premiums for everyone at risk. I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.",

I rise in strong support of H.R. 4. which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug companies for lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. American seniors are not getting the best possible prices for the drugs that keep them alive and in good health. A study by Families USA shows that the median drug prices among Medicare plans for the top 20 drugs prescribed for seniors is increasing at a rate of 7.4 percent per year. Thats more than twice the rate of inflation. These price increases are passed on to seniors in the form of higher premiums and outofpocket expenses. Clearly. the Medicare prescription drug program has not resulted in the lowest possible prices for seniors. But it has resulted in record profits for drug companies. In November. the New York Times reported that the Medicare prescription drug program has proven to be a bigger financial windfall for big drug companies than even the most optimistic of Wall Street predictions. The Veterans Administration already negotiates with drug companies for lower drug prices for American veterans. In the Families USA study. the lowest price charged by Medicare prescription drug plans for all 20 of the top drugs was always higher than the lowest price obtained by the Veterans Administration. I am a great defender of our Nations veterans. They have served our country with honor. and they deserve the lowest possible prices for their drugs. But so do our Nations seniors.

That is why it is so important that we pass H.R. 3 today. There are an estimated 100 million Americans waiting for us to take action. They dont believe this is a partisan or political issue. They just want hope for a cure. Lets give them that hope. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3.",

Advancements in science and technology have put our Nation in the position to make breakthroughs for these children. How did the President respond to their request?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3. We are all aware of the potential embryonic stem cells hold for mankind. It could very well be that these cells prove to be the Rosetta stone of medical researchallowing us to break the code on some of the worst afflictions: Alzheimers. Parkinsons. juvenile diabetes. We must acknowledge. however. that there is much we dont know about embryonic stem cells. and we are mistaken if we believe great cures are right around the comer. But we will never know either the true potentialor the dangers of stem cell related treatments if our scientists are overly constrained. I understand the concems ot those who question the ethics of embryonic stem cell research. and agree that we must not throw caution to the wind at the hint of miraculous cures. Indeed. left unconstrained. this type of research could lead to dangerous outcomes. That is a key reason why I support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. It provides essential ethical guidelines to which federally funded researchers must adhere. It would be far preferable to have the Federal Government setting standards in this field rather than a hodgepodge of states and private entities. In fact. I believe that the National Institute of Healths rigorous ethical guidelines would prove to be more protective of human life than individual states or private entities. Remember. embryonic stem cell research is not illegal. and individual states have already moved forward on their own. It is crucial that the Federal Govemment lead the way. I supported President Bush when he announced his plan to allow federally funded research on 60 preexisting stem cell lines. But we now know that only 21 stem cell lines are available for research. These 21 have significant shortcomings that make them of dubious value. Federally funded U.S. researchers are at a technological disadvantage as they lack access to newer stem cell lines. This is causing concern that some of the top stem cell biologists will move into nonfederally funded research. or even move overseas. We should not allow this to happen. There are a great many difficult questions that attend this debate. However. I can not look in the eyes of a couple whose child is suffering from a debilitating disease and tell them that I am doing everything possible to stop their childs suffering without supporting this legislation.",

This bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to support the expansion of research involving stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells are derived and under the principal condition that such research conforms to certain ethical standards that would be set forth by the bill. I have joined over 200 of my colleagues in cosponsoring this legislation to demonstrate my general support for ethically responsible. expanded. federally funded scientific research that stands to yield advances toward discovering treatments and cures for many terminal. debilitating diseases and physical impairments. It is true that research on the lifesaving qualities of stem cells predominantly remains in preliminary stages. But the potential for easing the suffering of individuals. curtailing illnesses. and protecting the general health and welfare of future generations that is offered by continuing and expanding this research is too great to ignore. Authorizing Federal support for the continuation and expansion of this research under strict ethical guidelines is an investment worth making today. We should pass legislation to enhance the abilities of and authorize funding for the scientific community to attain the most advanced scientific achievements possible that modem technology can bring and that we. as a society. can morally afford. I believe that this legislation provides for the ethical safeguards needed to ensure that government funding is not used to compromise the integrity and morality of the American people in exchange for supporting research that could lead to cures for many illnesses. I support H.R. 3 because it provides appropriate safeguards while promoting the lifesaving research that will make a profound difference in many lives in the future.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me be clear: I fully support stem cell research and its potential to solve many of the worlds most complex medical mysteries. Many scientists have concluded that certain types of stem cells. called pluripotent stem cells. may one day be used to develop treatments for debilitating diseases. Some of these types include cells derived from adult stem cells. umbilical cord blood. amniotic fluid and finally. human embryos. Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research began in 2001 when President Bush announced a policy that allowed researchers to destroy and conduct research on stem cell lines that had come from human embryos already destroyed prior to August 9. 2001. This policy did not encourage or offer incentives from the government to destroy human life for research. Yet the newly elected Democratic majority chose to bring a bill to the House floor today that forces taxpayers to encourage and fund the destruction of human life for embryonic stem cell research. This legislation also has no protections to ensure human embryos can not be cloned by researchers who receive this funding and access to destroyed human embryos. It is disheartening that the Democratic leadership wants to force all taxpayers to fund the destruction of human embryos for research. regardless of any moral and ethical concerns they may hold. Stem cell research is currently legal in the United States. In fact. nothing in any past federal legislation or policy would ban privately funded embryonic stem cell research. Yet private investors are reluctant to fund embryonic stem cell research that destroys human life and many have chosen to look for altematives that offer better results. In this world. we are measured by our treatment of the most delicate and weak among us. And in the world of science. there are lines that must be drawn when the destruction of innocent human life is at stake.",

I find it no coincidence that as we were preparing to deliberate federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. a study was released that announced a breakthrough in the form of amnioticfluid stem cell research. These stem cells do not present any ethical controversy and have already shown more promise than embryonic stem cells. Federal funding already goes to research and development for embryonic stem cells. The NIH currently spends $40 million for such studies. It spends $600 million on stem cell research in general. In fact. nearly $3 billion has been spent on all stem cell research over the past six years. Much of this research. like the amniotic fluid stem cell research. is without the ethical dilemma. and has simply proven to be more effective. Researchers have expended years of time and energy trying to develop a single treatment or cure for any disease from embryonic stem cells to no avail. and actually finding adverse consequences like tumors at the implantation site. But adult stem cells have already provided us with treatment options for 72 diseases. Adult stem cells have shown a real return on the American peoples investment. We have seen results from adult stem cells and should continue to support and subsidize progress in this field. And. as I mentioned a moment ago. there is a new option in the form of amniotic stem cells which has already shown great promise and even more success than embryonic stem cells.",

Congressman BLUMENAUER. the lead sponsor of the Water for the Poor Act of 2005. has been a strong advocate on this issue for years. and he was kind enough to testify about the challenge of clean water in Africa at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Global Health I chaired in May of 2007. During the course of that hearing. it became clear that in Africa. the region hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic. the problem of safe water is particularly acute. The total number of people without access to potable water in the region has actually increased by 60 million in the past half decade. That is why Mr. BLUMENAUER and I. along with other Members of Congress. successfully secured $300 million for safe drinking water and sanitation projects for fiscal year 2008. We all know that HIV compromises the immune system. Those infected with the disease are far more likely to succumb to the illness caused by unsafe drinking water. especially if they are children. and there is no way that people can take ARVs if they do not have access to clean drinking water. I strongly support Mr. BLUMENAUERS amendment. and thank him for his cosponsorship of H. Res. 318. supporting the goals of the United Nations International Year of Sanitation.

I have been involved extensively in the issues before us today. I really do appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that has guided this process. particularly by Chairman BERMAN and our ranking member. Ms. RosLEHTINEN. Thank you. This bill is appropriately named for two giants of this institution. Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde. My amendment addresses the issue of transparency and accountability in the Global Fund. The Global Fund is a unique. nongovernmental multilateral organization headquartered in Switzerland and focused on combating HIV/ AIDS. tuberculosis and malaria throughout the developing world. The U.S. Government is the single largest provider of resources and technical assistance to the Global Fund. and since 2001 Congress has appropriated nearly $4 billion to the Fund. The LantosHyde bill before us today authorizes additional funds that will total in the billions. The bill currently and appropriately calls for systematic assessments of performance data of principal recipients and subrecipients of funds. as recommended by the Government Accountability Office. the GAO. This technical amendment simply clarifies that audits by the Funds Inspector General should also encompass principal recipients and subrecipients. the entities that actually receive programmatic funding. Madam Chairman. I believe that this amendment strengthens the spirit of accountability that is present in the underlying bill. According to a June 2005 report by the GAO. the Global Fund possessed a limited ability to monitor and evaluate grants. Concerns have also been raised that the volume of funding provided through the Global Fund may exceed the capacity of the recipients in the field to actually utilize it. Since we are considering an additional contribution that may total in the billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Global Fund over the life of this reauthorization. I believe that it would be beneficial for ourselves. as well as for the Fund. as well as for other donors. to have additional clarity on how these funds are being used in the field for those most in need of our assistance.

Swaziland. and Lesotho. to the lists of countries that will be a part of the focus countries in the reauthorization of this Global HIV/ AIDS legislation. In 2003. the original PEPFAR legislation designated 14 focus countries. These countries were prioritized for intensive investment of resources and technical expertise as provided through PEPFAR. The bill on the floor today adds focus countries by designating Vietnam and 14 Caribbean basic countries with PEPFAR focus status. Unfortunately. these three countries in Southern Africa. each confronting devastation as a result of HIV/AIDS. have not been granted priority status in PEPFAR. The crisis of HIV/AIDS confronting Malawi. Swaziland. and Lesotho is real and in some cases worse than the existing focus countries. Malawi is a country of 13 million people. with 900.000 children orphaned by AIDS and nearly 1 million of its adults living with HIV. a 14 percent infection rate. Swaziland. with a population of only 1.1 million people. has over 200.000 adults living with HIV. one in three adults. or a 33 percent adult infection rate. Lesotho has a population of 2 million people. and an HIV infection rate among its adults of 23 percent. These three countries are not only confronting HIV and AIDS. but they are also among the poorest countries on the planet. which makes their challenge so much greater. Malawi. for example. is 164th out of 177 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index. Also. each country is geographically surrounded by countries that were designated focus countries in the original PEPFAR legislation. South Africa. Mozambique. Zambia. Tanzania. which are presently receiving massive investments to confront their epidemics. Malawi. Swaziland. and Lesotho are working bilaterally with the United States. but by not being granted PEPFARs focus country status. the gap that they face between the needs and available resources means that too many people will continue to be infected. too many people will continue to die needlessly. and too many orphans will be left to fend for themselves.

These men of the 515th represent the best of the greatest generation. Composed of officers and enlisted men from various units around the United States. the 515th was trained to operate the 155mm \"Long Tom\" guns. From the time that it fired its first rounds in combat until nearly the end of the war. the unit was constantly on the move and involved in combat. supporting various units. Moving steadily northward. the unit finally crossed the Rhine River on a heavy pontoon bridge at Worms. Germany. From here the battalion moved south to the area of Heidelberg and then north again toward the area of Birkenfeld. It was reported that during the month of March the battalion traveled a distance of 557 miles. 153 miles of which were during combat. The 515th fired 3.122 rounds of ammunition during this time. The 515th rarely stayed in any one place for more than a day or two. Movement was not fast and generally cumbersome since the tractors pulling the \"Long Toms\" moved at only about 30 miles per hour. Once an area was designated it would sometimes take as much as a day to set up all three gun batteries. coordinate their positions and lay communication lines between the individual guns and battery commands. and then from the battery commands to Headquarters. These men met monumental challenges every day. and courageously faced their obstacles and overcame them.

John Hestir attended University of Arkansas and later the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Texas for graduate school. While attending school in Texas. he accepted an offer to serve as the primary doctor of DeWitt. Arkansas. When Hestir first moved to the small town. DeWitt had limited capacity for medical services. The town had no hospital or ambulance and the closest emergency medical facility was a 12 bed hospital in Stuttgart. which is over a half an hour away by car. However. the sparse amenities did not discourage Hestir from providing the citizens of DeWitt the medical care they needed. With some perseverance and ingenuity Dr. Hestir engineered miracles that went beyond medicine. Dr. Hestir knew that in order for him to better serve the people of DeWitt he needed an improved medical facility. In 1962. Hestir convinced the mayor. Jim Colvert. to apply for a government grant to build an 18 bed hospital. Today. the hospital has been expanded to a 35 bed facility. serving DeWitt and the surrounding areas. Hospital capacity is not the only expansion happening in DeWitt. With this new hospital and other improved medical care. people are living much longer. When Dr. Hestir first arrived in DeWitt. the life expectancy was 58 for men and 62 for women. today the average stands at 78 for men and 84 for women.

Withholding keeps many Americans ignorant about the true size of the federal tax burden. Withholding is also the reason millions of Americans overpay their income taxes. granting the United States Government interestfree loans. Many of these taxpayers are further misled into thinking the U.S. Government is acting benevolently when they receive \"refunds\" of money improperly taken from them through withholdingl Collecting taxes via withholding damages the economy because it forces every business in America to waste valuable resources complying with the withholding tax requirements. The Internal Revenue Service is so fanatical about forcing employers to act as de facto federal agents that it once confiscated the assets of a church because the church refused to violate the churchs religious beliefs by acting as a tax collector. The IRS sent armed federal agents in this house of worship. even though the churchs employees regularly paid taxes. When the United States Government implemented withholding in 1943. it promised the American people that this would be a \"temporary\" measure. I am sure my colleagues agree that 64 years is a sufficient lifespan for any \"temporary\" measure. It is time to end the deceptive practice of withholding and empower taxpayers to reflect upon their tax bill each month and ask. \"What are they getting for their money.\" An honest answer to that question may lead to a groundswell for true tax reform.

Melvin devoted his life selflessly to serve others for the sake of making Dumas and Desha County a better place to live and raise a family. He was an active participant in the community where he served as president of the Dumas Chamber of Commerce and the Dumas Lions Club. and just this year. he was awarded the esteemed Lions Club Citizenship Award. He held the post of chairman of the Desha County Hospital Board and served as chairman of the ChicotDesha Boy Scout District. He also worked in numerous roles with the Red Cross and March of Dimes over the years. In addition to his civic leadership. Schexnayder was also a man of devout faith. He was a member of Holy Child Catholic Church where he served as a lay reader and building committee member. I give my deepest condolences to his wife. Charlotte. his 2 sons. M. John Schexnayder. Jr. and Dr. Stephen Schexnayder. his daughter Sarah Steen. and to his numerous grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. Melvin Schexnayder will be greatly missed in Dumas. Desha County and throughout the State of Arkansas. and I am truly saddened by this loss.",

Moore joins a distinguished collection of studentathletes continuing West Virginia Universitys rich athletic tradition. Moore perfected his soft shooting touch by practicing in the dark on a basket outside his familys home. During his three seasons. Moore averaged seven points per game. leading the Mountaineers to a 6020 record and a Southern Conference Championship in 1951. Impressively. his 84 percent free throw percentage still remains second on the alltime Mountaineer record books. After college Moore was drafted by the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball Association but opted to serve as a lieutenant in the Army infantry. Nonetheless. Moore continued to excel on the basketball court. In 1954 he was selected to play in the Armed Forces Pan Am Games in Mexico and the International Games in Germany. Although his playing days are long over. Moores legacy on the court continues to grow. The State of West Virginia congratulates \"Moo\" and the rest of the 2007 Hall of Fame inductees.",

As Members of Congress. we have a responsibility to do everything in our power to protect teens from the dangers of alcohol abuse. The \"We Dont Serve Teens\" will raise awareness of the important role retailers and private citizens play in making sure alcohol is not accessible to teenagers. Their website. www.dontserveteens.gov. clearly outlines the proactive measures we can all take to limit teens access to alcohol. This will ensure a safer environment that is free of the unnecessary dangers of alcohol. including binge drinking. and drunk driving. I believe we should applaud the alcohol wholesalers. brewers. distillers. their advertisement agencies. and the private and Stateowned retailers for their willingness to cooperate and support this cause. Without their assistance it would be very difficult to get this campaign off the ground. The FTC is successfully uniting all adults in one organized effort that agrees not to serve those under the legal drinking age. I wholeheartedly support this movement and hope to be an advocate for \"We Dont Serve Teens.\" If we can all understand the benefits of the drinking age and believe it when we say. \"We Dont Serve Teens. Its unsafe. illegal and irresponsible.\" we will create a safer today and a more responsible tomorrow. Please join me in supporting the \"We Dont Serve Teens\" effort.",

Mary Esther Gaulden Jagger was a scholarly woman who earned a bachelors of science degree from Winthrop College and a doctorate in biology from the University of Virginia. Dr. Jagger began working in 1949 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge. Tennessee as a senior radiation biologist. The Jaggers relocated to Dallas from Tennessee in the mid1960s. where Ms. Jagger took a position as professor of radiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

She was president of the Association of Southeastern Biologists in 1959. She was also a member of the Committee on Toxicology and the U.S. National Research Council. as well as being involved in the Radiation Research Society and the Environmental Mutagen Society. I know from my time in residency at Parkland Hospital. that Dr. Jagger was revered as an expert. When in doubt or if any questions arose. you could always turn to the wisdom of Dr. Jagger.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it has been 19 days since the President called for a stimulus plan. and economists called for swift action on it. Republicans and Democrats in the House got the message. and they made some hard choices. showed restraint. and forged a bipartisan compromise literally within days. Unfortunately. Senate Democrats didnt follow suit. They turned the idea into political gamesmanship. with the head of their campaign committee calling for \"tough votes.\" The American people are tired of political \"gotcha.\" We dont have time for it. The economy needs a boost right now. So I think we need to step back and ask ourselves what this exercise was all about in the first place. My preference is to modify the House package to include rebate checks for seniors and disabled veterans and certainly eliminate the possibility that any illegal immigrants will get checks. The White House and Treasury Secretary have indicated support for such a plan. so we can expect it will be signed into law. Meanwhile. we have no such assurance for the alternative. larger proposal Senate Democrats apparently are still hashing out. We read this morning that \"negotiations are still ongoing\" among Democrats about what to include in the final package. We started out united behind a proposal to help struggling taxpayers and stimulate the economy. Now some are insisting on a plan that might not even be signed into law. However. there is still another choice. We can still pass a bill that is targeted and timely and which helps seniors and disabled veteransand that is the amendment I will be offering later today with Senator STEVENS. The Reid amendment. on the other hand. might not even get signed. So should the Reid amendment fail. we should immediately move to include seniors and disabled veterans. exclude those who are not legal citizens. and then quickly send this good. bipartisan. Housepassed bill. as amended. back to the House. which I am sure will pass it quickly. and send it to the White House for signature. To do less would break faith with the American people who were told nearly 3 weeks ago they could expect relief quickly. I urge my colleagues and the whole body to support it so we can deliver timely help to the American people. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

This amendment relates to reverse targeting. which is a theory that the Government could target a foreign person abroad when the real Intention is to target a U.S. person. thus circumventing the need to get a warrant for the U.S. person. Quite simply. reverse targeting is already considered illegal under FISA. Going even further. the Intelligence Committee bill has a very explicit prohibition against reverse targeting. The amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin adds subjective language which completely alters the meaning of the original bipartisan provision. I asked Attorney General Mukasey this during a hearing on Wednesday. and here is our exchange. HATCH: Now the topic of reverse targeting has been mentioned often during the FISA reform debate. From an intelligence perspective. reverse targeting makes no sense. From an efficiency standpoint. if the government was interested in targeting an American. it would apply for a warrant to listen to all of that persons conversations. wouldnt it? Not just his conversations with terrorists overseas? MUKASEY: Correct. HATCH: Now. I asked General Wainstein about this during the Judiciary Committee hearing last October. and he reiterated the governments view that FISA itself makes reverse targeting illegal. Does the DOJ still consider reverse targeting illegal under FISA? MUKASEY: Absolutely. HATCH: Are you aware of any instances of intelligence analysts utilizing reverse targeting? MUKASEY: I am not aware of any such instances. We are enacting national security legislation. and it is our responsibility to ensure that this bill does not lead to unintended consequences which provide protections to terrorists.

Nobody has explained how you can target a foreign terrorist to get collections on a particular U.S. person unless that person is engaged in a terrorist activity. and you have to target an overseas person who has foreign intelligence information. and that is the legitimate reason for making the collection against the foreign target.

I filed additional views with respect to the need for stronger exclusivity provisions. Then the Judiciary Committee reported out a bill that included its view with respect to strengthening the fact that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be the exclusive manner in which electronic surveillance against Americans could be conducted. The Judiciary bill subsequently failed on the floor of the Senate. The amendment I have at the desk is essentially the exclusivity language from that Judiciary Committee amendment. It has several cosponsors: the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Mr. ROCKEFELLER. chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. LEAHY. Senator NELSON of Florida. Senator WHITEHOUSE. Senator WYDEN. Senator HAGEL. Senator MENENDEZ. Senator SNOWE. and Senator SPECTER. As filed this is an amendment that only covers exclusivity. In the interim period. the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee approached me about the possibility of a modification of the amendment that would allow the administration to be able to operate outside of FISA for a time. We have not been able to come to terms on that amendment. I could not agree to the length of time that Mr. BOND proposed. which was 45 days plus an additional 45 days. for a total of 3 months. enabling the administration to operate without a FISA warrant. The fact is. since January of 2007. the entire Terrorist Surveillance Program has operated within the confines of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and under orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That is. I believe. as it should be. I have a modification to my exclusivity amendment that would limit the period of time outside of FISA following a declaration of war. an authorization for the use of military force. or a major attack against the nation to 30 days. The question is whether I would have unanimous consent from the vice chairman to be able to call up that modification of my amendment. But that has not been given to me yet. So at this time.

Mr. Chairman. all of us want to ensure the highest levels of security at LNG terminals and other atrisk assets. This amendment would do that by leveraging the collective resources of Federal. State. local. and private sector officials. I urge all members to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The amendment addresses section 720 of the substitute regarding waterside security around LNG tankers and terminals. It provides that the Coast Guard may consider security assets and personnel provided by State and local officials who are contracted for or otherwise made available to an LNG terminal operator in determining whether security resources are available to carry out our waterside security measures. The Coast Guard has. as we have so often discussed. limited resources to undertake its many missions. Partnering with State and local officials or contracted waterside security services will be in effect force multipliers for the Coast Guard. So we support that initiative.

It would effectively block the construction of a widely supported plant that is just north of my district that could definitely help provide much needed relief for home heating costs. The bill I believe would also have the potential to undermine our security by not the allowing the Coast Guard to determine the personnel and assets necessary to escort LNG shipments. This should be a decision by the Coast Guard. I believe they are best able to do this. and the LaTourette amendment represents a very reasonable and realistic compromise which will give the Coast Guard the flexibility they need to ensure the security of LNG shipments as well as to deal with the other potential threats in our ports and waterways.

Subsection C of that section requires that. before the Coast Guard can approve a facilitys security plan for a new LNG terminal. the service must determine that it has available to the sector in which the terminal is to be located the resources it needs to carry out the risk mitigation measures identified in the waterway suitability report for that terminal. This amendment would include State and local resources in the assessment. which is a good thing. With the adoption of this amendment and with the measures already included in subsection C. section 720. we will ensure that the Coast Guards resources do not have to be diverted from other highpriority missions as determined by the commandant to secure LNG operations. The Coast Guard will be able to depend upon those State and local law enforcement resources that have the proven training. resources. personnel. equipment. and experience necessary to combat a terrorist attack. to conduct waterborne patrols around LNG facilities. I emphasize that the State and local law enforcement cannot and should not be seen as replacements for the Coast Guard resources. as the Coast Guard is our Nations maritime time security agency. Further. having the Coast Guard. our trained maritime security agency. defend our communities from the risk of a terrorist attack on an LNG terminal in the neighborhood is not an unwarranted and unnecessary subsidy. As our Nation continues to approve new LNG terminals. we must commit to ensuring that all of the resources. particularly Coast Guard resources. necessary to secure these facilities are in place.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Over 10 million Americans travel on cruise lines each year. Unfortunately. many are unaware that they are at risk of being victims of crime while on their vacations. And. it concerns me even more that these victims have inadequate access to assistance or law enforcement in the aftermath of a crime. In recent years. the media has reported on a number of highprofile cases of passengers falling overboard. passengers going missing. and passengers being raped and sexually assaulted. Sadly. many of these cases remain unresolved. and the perpetrators of sexual violence and other violent crimes on cruise ships are rarely brought to justice. I became personally involved after a constituent of mine. Laurie Dishman. came to me for assistance after she had been a victim of a violent crime on a cruise ship. As a result of continued cases of crimes on the high seas. and with the leadership of Chairman CUMMINGS. this Congress has held two hearings on safety on cruise ships. We learned that we must take action to inform people of exposure to risk while on cruise vacations. Mr. Chairman. sometimes even cruise ships need sunshine. Our amendment seeks to do just that by requiring the Coast Guard to post online the number of deaths. missing persons. and reported crimes committed on cruise ships. The amendment also requires cruise lines to include a link to this data base on their public web sites. Our amendment would create transparency and promote a culture of accountability by allowing the public access to the number of crimes reported. Prevention can be just as powerful as enforcement. and we all know that prevention starts with making people aware of the potential for a crime to occur. With prevention and enforcement. it is our hope that the tragic events that so many passengers have endured will not be repeated. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

These cruise ships are floating cities. But unlike cities. there are no peace officers or properly trained security personnel to protect passengers on board these ships. There is really no oversight or accountability for the cruise industry to properly or timely report secret crimes that occur on ships. Our amendment just requires the Coast Guard to publicly maintain and regularly update a numerical accounting of crimes and number of missing persons on each ship. This is commonsense. We value information on college campuses. and this Congress under the Cleary Act requires reporting of crimes on college campuses.

We have given the Coast Guard so much responsibility. and they have been up to the challenge. I have great respect for my colleague from California. but I rise to express my serious concern with her pending amendment. As a Member from the State of Florida. which has 14 ports and numerous cruise lines. I have a particular interest in the cruise industry. The cruise industry is one of the most important economic engines in the State of Florida. Over 5 million passengers embarked from Florida in 2005 and the industry contributed more than $6 billion in direct spending. In addition. the cruise industry is the second largest employer for Florida. generating more than 125.000 jobs. Before coming to Congress I owned a travel agency. and I can tell you that a cruise is one of the most costeffective. safe and enjoyable vacations one can take. In fact. I recently sent my mother on a cruise. The cruise industry is highly regulated by State. Federal and international laws. They ensure that passengers are safe and have a sound safety and security record. It is apparent from the FBI statistics that crime against U.S. passengers on cruise ships are very rare. The proposed amendment would unfairly penalize the cruise industry and require the public posting of crime allegations. organized by the name of the cruise line. No other private industry is required to provide such information on an Internet site. The bill unfairly penalizes the cruise industry without any evidence or justification for this measure. Requiring the reporting of allegations of crimes onboard ships would be misleading to the public as there is no distinction between an allegation and an actual crime committed. That is why if a local government requires the reporting of allegations of crime. no specific business is identified since in many instances these allegations are unfounded. In closing. I will continue to work to make sure that the cruise industry is one of the safest industries in this country.",

She has worked diligently on this issue and has helped raise public awareness for the 10.000 to 40.000 approximate Americans currently diagnosed with DandyWalker syndrome. I commend her on her work with H. Con. Res. 163 and support further research and activities to increase public awareness. professional education. diagnosis. and treatment of DandyWalker syndrome and hydrocephalus. Currently. the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding abnormal brain development and offers hope for new ways to treat and prevent developmental brain disorders such as DandyWalker syndrome. DandyWalker syndrome is a congenital brain malformation that can appear dramatically or develop unnoticed. Symptoms. which often occur in early infancy. include slow motor development and progressive enlargement of the skull. In older children. symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as irritability. vomiting. and convulsions. and signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as unsteadiness. lack of muscle coordination. or jerky movements of the eyes may occur. Other symptoms include increased head circumference. bulging at the back of the skull. problems with the nerves that control the eyes. face and neck. and abnormal breathing patterns. DandyWalker syndrome is frequently associated with disorders of other areas of the central nervous system. and subnormal intelligence is manifested in 41 to 71 percent of the patients. Treatment for the one in every 25.000 to 35.000 individuals diagnosed with DandyWalker syndrome generally consists of treating the associated problems with a special tube to drain off excess fluid inside the skull. This will reduce intracranial pressure and help control the swelling. Mr. Speaker. I urge Members to recognize the outstanding research that the NTH has conducted and commend them on their efforts to gain more insight into brain disorders such as DandyWalker syndrome and hydrocephalus.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in America and takes the lives of nearly 28.000 American men each year. Over a lifetime. that is one out of every six males will fall victim to this silent killer. Early prostate cancel usually has no symptoms and is commonly detected through prostate cancer screening tests such as the PSA blood test and DRE. The chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increases rapidly after the age of 50. The most likely risk factors that are associated to prostate cancer are age and family history of the disease. In addition to the PSA blood test and DRE. imaging is another useful tool that can help with the detection and treatment of the disease. It is important for men to take advantage of prostate screening exams which could yield early detection when the disease is still curable. I urge my fellow Members to support House Resolution 353.

We also need to recognize that we have many of these 89.000 veterans who live in rural areas and also will be traveling distances. we need to acknowledge. to these rehabilitation centers. so there is an energy cost issue. which we are going to address here in a moment. The VA has a long history of providing specialized treatment and research on epilepsy. In 1972. recognizing that head trauma. whether mild or severe. is a risk factor for developing epilepsy. the VA created dedicated centers to improve the quality of care for veterans who may develop posttraumatic epilepsy as a result of military service. Today the VA operates seven sites with advanced capabilities to monitor and perform epilepsy surgery. There are. as I said earlier. approximately 89.000 veterans. many of whom also live in rural America. with epilepsy enrolled in the VA health care system.

Mr. Speaker. this is a very. very pertinent and important issue. The increased prices to the VA. a few years back we had an emergency supplemental. and part of that was because of the increase in energy costs to the VA. This is a pretty important issue. So let me now embrace your counsel. Mr. Speaker. to me. H.R. 2818. as amended. will improve the VAs research. Now why do I mention research? Well. because what were doing here. we recognize the VA has a long history of providing specialized treatment and research on epilepsy. So now lets talk about the impact on energy prices on research. Its a proper nexus. would the Speaker not agree? The Speaker is stoic. H.R. 2818. as amended. I believe it improves VAs research. but as we look at this. the research activities consume high amounts of energy. and these activities include using CT scans. MRIs. other medical imaging technology. We use medical testing and other laboratory devices. Research laboratories require high amounts of security to protect personal medical information on research subjects. Laboratory data may examine beating and cooling systems to control specimen temperatures to ensure viability in our research activities. All that requires energy and in fact energy prices will impact the delivery of care that we do at our epileptic centers. Facility energy consumption also involves power to run computers. printers. scanners. copiers. shredders. Some of these research. medical research projects require specialized lighting and may occur after hours when VA physicians have time to work in their labs and analyze data when these systems would then be shut down. From 2005 to 2007. the Department of Veterans Affairs energy costs have increased by 20 percent. The VAs energy costs have increased 65 percent since the 2003 baseline set by Federal maiidates in the OMB energy scorecard. May I ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining.",

We should be looking at ways to reduce the energy burden on the VA. So when I look at the energy baseline in 2003 in the VA on energy costs and its impact on how we caii provide quality health care to our veterans. that baseline was $287.7 million. Today. that energy baselineactually. my numbers are of 2007was $475.5 billion. That is a 65 percent increase in VA utility expenses. So with regard to the Speakers counsel to me that I can talk about energy prices in the VA so long as there is a proper nexus. well. I think if we are talking about a 65 percent increase in fuel prices and its impact upon the VA and how we will be able to deliver not only quality research but also quality health care at our epileptic centers. I think is a pretty important issue. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I look at our families in Texas. everything seems more expensive these days. whether it is getting your kids through school or paying medical bills or insurance or paying light bills. and it is tough enough for family budgets to stretch as it is. I just cannot imagine why we in Washington would hand our families another tax bill for $2.700 for Texas families and expect them to like it. especially since we can balance this budget without that tax increase. When I talk to our Texas seniors. the first thing they tell me is. please stop spending our Social Security money. quit spending the trust fund. that is our money. Yet. the Democrat budget spends that Social Security trust fund. The Republican budget for the first time in 40 years stops spending it. preserves it for Social Security. When I look at small businesses. who are the backbone of our country and really struggle to make payroll. I used to be a Chamber of Commerce manager. I know how hard it is to meet that payroll. And 26 million small business owners. we are going to hand them another tax bill of about $4.000 on top of what they struggle today? That is just asking too much. especially when we can balance the budget without those tax increases. without taking seniors Social Security. and do it the right way.

Numbers do not lie. Mr. Chairman. They turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $2.3 trillion deficit. And they are preaching fiscal responsibility. The administration has incurred the three largest budget deficits on record. including a $413 billion deficit in 2004. And lets remember that the Bush administration not only lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since they took office. but we now have almost a $9 trillion debt. and that breaks down to all of us in America owing. our own individual share. $29.000. Now. that is what they have given the American people. On top of that they gave us another record. another horrible record. The highest trade deficit in the history of our country. $857 billion.

Pt. 17 sense of the House of Representatives that Rebiya Kadeers children should be immediately released from detention. and that the Chinese Government should refrain from further persecution of the Uyghur people. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution and believe strongly that the Chinese government must be pressed on these points. The China of today is not progressing. Madam Speaker. it is regressing. It is becoming more violent. more repressive. and more resistant to basic values of human rights and religious freedom. The Chinese government tortures and imprisons Catholic bishops. Protestant church leaders. Muslim worshipers. Falun Gong followers. and Buddhist monks and nuns just because of their faith and systematically destroys churches and confiscates Bibles. It persecutes the Uyghur people. cutting them off from the outside world as it pursues a policy of cultural liquidation. Rebiya Kadeer is a brave soul who has stood up to this violence and repression. She has suffered so much at the hands of the Chinese Government. and yet does not recoil in fear. For her bravery. the Chinese Government has retaliated by capturing and imprisoning her children who remained behind in China. They have been held at unknown locations. interrogated. and very possibly tortured. A couple of years ago. the FBI identified Chinese secret police following Rebiya Kadeer and spying on her at her Fairfax home. The Chinese Government will stop at nothing to silence those who oppose its brutal tactics against its own citizens. I urge the House to adopt this resolution. and to demand that the Chinese Government cease its persecution of the Uyghur people and immediately release Rebiya Kadeers children from detention.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. when the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11. 2001. the towers sent up a plume of poisonous dust that blanketed Lower Manhattan. A toxic brew of lead. dioxin. asbestos. mercury. benzene. and other hazardous contaminants swirled around the site of the disaster as rescue workers labored furiously in the wreckage. many without adequate protective gear. Thousands of first responders. residents. area workers. students. and others from around the country inhaled this poisonous dust as it settled onto and into countless homes. shops. and office buildings. Now. 6 years later. there is no doubt that thousands of people are sick from World Trade Center contamination. A study released in September 2006 by Mt. Sinai Hospital found that 70 percent of the more than 9.000 first responders studied suffer health problems related to their work at Ground Zero. This number does not include the Stuyvesant High School students whose school sat near piles of debris from the towers. the nearby residents whose apartments still contain poisonous dust. or the thousands of people who work in offices that were never properly cleaned. Abraham Lincoln once said that we must \"care for him who shall have borne the battle.\" And so we should. Today. 1. along with my colleagues. am introducing essential. new legislation that ensures that everyone exposed to World Trade Center toxins. no matter where they may live now or in the future. would have a right to highquality medical monitoring and treatment. and access to a reopened Victim Compensation Fund for their losses. Whether you are a first responder who toiled without proper protection. or an area resident. worker or student who was caught in the plume or subject to ongoing indoor contamination. if you were harmed by 9/11. you would be eligible. This bill builds on the best ideas brought to Congress thus far and on the infrastructure already in place providing critical treatment and monitoring.",

The VFW is defined by a record of service and commitment to our country and our veterans. From initially fighting to protect our freedom overseas. to later ensuring that veterans have the compensation and care they deserve back home. the 2.3 million members in approximately 8.400 Posts worldwide deserve our thanks and recognition. Since 1899. when a group of 13 SpanishAmerican War veterans convened to advocate for the benefits then denied to their comrades in arms. the VFW has worked tirelessly to protect the rights of fellow veterans while continuously honoring the service of those who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our way of life. One of the many privileges I have in serving New Hampshire is working with representatives of the Granite States VFW Auxiliary Posts. Never losing sight of the organizations mission or obligations. the straightforward approach of members serves as a breath of fresh air. They ask direct questions and expect direct answers. New Hampshires VFW members should be proud of their representation. Nationally. the VFW is committed to its mission to \"honor the dead by helping the living\" through veterans service. community service. and steadfast advocacy of a strong national defense. This dedication can be witnessed through the organizations work to create the Veterans Administration. its efforts to establish numerous memorials in memory of those who have served. and its devotion to improving the educational. health. and other benefits owed to returning veterans. Moreover. the VFWs efforts in the community. annually providing more than 13 million hours of volunteerism and donating $2.5 million in college scholarships. further endears the organization and its members to all Americans. At a time of ongoing conflict abroad. the VFW welcomes our returning servicemembers with support. guidance. and camaraderie as they readjust to life on the home front. Additionally. as they continue to serve the communities around them. VFW members act as role models whose experiences and commitment to service provide a beacon of light in todays society. For their longstanding and continued contributions. the VFW and its members deserve our immense respect and sincere gratitude.",

Reading is the gateway to attaining knowledge. This very basic skill can catapult students into new levels of understanding and give them the tools they need to excel. I have always been an avid reader. which has helped me become what I am today. I never stop learning. and I hope these students never stop either. It was a pleasure to visit with Pat Dee when I was in New Mexico a few weeks ago. The work he has done with this program has been noticed by many. including the President of the United States. Mr. Dee received a Volunteer Service Award from the President for the many hours he has dedicated to helping students learn to read. He directs over 300 volunteers who help facilitate the program and is looking to expand it with an additional 200 volunteers. Albuquerque Reads places these volunteers in underperforming schools to tutor kindergarteners. With their help. reading proficiency has increased 40 percent. I want to say thank you to Albuquerque Reads and Pat Dee for all that you have done for students in the area. I wish you much success in the future.*",

Dennis Sutton. through his work in the Childrens Home Society. has been a true asset to adoptive and foster parents and adoption agencies both in West Virginia and across the Nation. I would like to take a moment to highlight his service to his community and congratulate him on receiving the Congressional Adoption Caucuss Angel of Adoption Award. As the CEO of Childrens Home Society of West Virginia. Dennis Sutton has dedicated his organizations program to securing loving homes for West Virginias children in needa derivative from his belief that every child is entitled to a lovingfamily and home. Childrens Home Society of West Virginias utmost priority of bringing children and families together has been the result of more than 110 year experience. skilled and wellinformed staff. certification by the National Council on Accreditation. and readily available statewide service. Dennis Suttons commitment to our Nations vulnerable children can be further seen in his participation as a founding member of Childrens Home Society of America. A national organization. CHSA is comprised of the leading child welfare agencies across the country and aims to promote the safety. nurturing. and wellbeing of vulnerable children. This remarkable organization is working to make the adoption process easier for everyone involved but put children in the care of stable families. give them the tools to succeed in todays world. and give them hope. To me. it is clear that this kind of work merits the Angel in Adoption Award. Because of Childrens Home Society of America. more than 250.000 children are now living in stable environments. That is an extraordinary accomplishment. one that will benefit our communities now and in the future. Dennis truly has been a passlonate advocate for our children in need. has laid the groundwork for a better adoption process. and has put forth the bold vision to enrich and strengthen the fabric of this Nation. I am delighted to have had this opportunity to highlight not only the wonderful cause but the person who is working on this in my State of West Virginia. To Dennis and the Childrens Home Society of America. I offer my most profound respects and deepest appreciation.*",

At the point of which President Bush was sworn in as President in January of 2001. as a renowned oil industry veteran. the price of a barrel of oil was $30. Today. as we are now in the eighth year of the Presidents term of office. it is $126 a barrel. an historic high. nearly a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of oil. Other interesting facts: On the day that the President was sworn in. again. as President. gas was $1.45 a gallon. the good old days when the Bush administration was sworn into office. Today it has hit a record high of $3.72. on average. for self serve regular. So that is something else that is quite dramatically negative in terms of the impact on American consumers. Now. heres what has happened over the years with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Back in 1991 President Bushs father actually deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. and the price of a barrel of oil dropped 33 percent. In 2000 President Clinton deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. and the price of a barrel of oil went down 18 percent. In fact. President Bush himself deployed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2005. which led to a 5.6 percent drop in the price of a barrel of oil. Now. this is an interesting Uturn that the President has taken because what he said in 2006 was-",

I have analyzed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve issue. and I dont think it would affect the price.\" Well. thats a surprising change of economic analysis by the President in just 2 years. And as we debate this out here on the House floor. he seems to find himself in the minority because. in fact. what the President has at his disposal is the ability to be able to do something about this issue. As consumers get the shakedown at the pump. this Friday President Bush is going to meet with the sheiks in Saudi Arabia to ask for more oil. And while the President sent troops to the Middle East to look for weapons of mass destruction. hes avoiding using a weapon of price reduction here at home. The President has said he does not have a magic wand to wave away high gas prices. but he does carry a big stick. Its called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",

I got a letter a few minutes ago from the American Trucking Association saying that the additional $391 million that truckers are having to pay for diesel cannot be handled by them for long.

Again. if we just go outside and clap our hands. we would probably have a 2 percent chance of lowering the price of oil by two cents a barrel. Just by clapping our hands.

We are pushing other sources of energy through biomass and a whole variety of things. This is going to take a lot of work across the board.

When I hear how partisan some of my colleagues have gotten on the other side of the aisle. it really astonishes me that somehow it is the Presidents fault. The clear fact is that we had better find a way to work together. because in my judgment. we have a challenge because we are not working together. Republicans or Democrats. We all have our fingers on this. And we need to deal with it. It seems to me we need to conserve and not use so much energy to reduce demand. We also need to increase production. It Is going to include alternative fuels. renewable fuel. It is going to include mining the outer slope of the continental shelf. It may include nuclear power. It is going to require increasing production and reducing demand. I think this legislation. while it is a drop in the bucket. it is a step that we need to take. But it will have minimal impact. But in the end. we can fight as much as we want to about this issue. and we are going to fool no one. There are basic laws of supply and demand that are coming into play here. And we dont seem to want to address it. When I vote not to mine ANWR. I know I am not adding to production. I am not voting to do that for a variety of reasons because I want us to conserve more. But when we conserve more. then we are going to have to look at other ways to increase the supply. T. Boone Pickens is saying we basically consume about 86 million barrels. and we are producing just about that level. We are going to have to produce more and consume less. So I would just make this concluding point. My Democratic colleagues won this Congress. And you are in charge. And I have seen prices continue to climb. It is not necessarily your fault.

There is plenty of blame to go around. Nobody is suggesting this is going to resolve the energy crisis. It is a shortterm alleviation of high prices that would. in fact. allow us to take the steps that we have not taken for 20 years. And also in the last 5 or 6 years. when the Vice President derided conservation. you acknowledged on the floor the importance of conservation. It was dismissed as part of our arsenal in our energy policy. When those of us who talked about investing in new alternative energy. wind. solar. thermal. it was also dismissed. and continues to not only be dismissed. but vetoed. That. too. Is unilateral disarmament by the United States. So you are right. There is plenty of blame to go around. But there are plenty of solutions to also be picked up. Conservation was denied as a national policy. And we have paid the price as a country. Alternative energy was denied and denied for years and issued veto threats by the President of the United States. And we pay the price because of that policy. This is a shortterm solution. $25. which means a lot to Americans. a barrel. but it gives us the breathing space to do what we need to do and take care of Americas energy independence. Now no one is going to claim that in 2005 when you all did pass your energy bill. let me quote your minority leader. \"the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a balanced. bipartisan bill that will lower energy prices to consumers and spur our economy.\" Nobody is claiming that. This gives a shortterm alleviation to allow us to tackle a problem that has been festering for 25 years and denying what all of us should have done in Washington. invest In longterm. alternative energy and technologies that will give America its leg of independence. as well as adopt an energy policy of conservation. it would also save.",

First of all. the question is how. when its such a small amount of oil. 70.000 barrels a day. can suspending purchases have an impact on the price? There are two things. number one. history has shown that when the Federal Government. on behalf of the consumers of this country and the small businesses. have used this Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help alleviate market pressures. Its worked. and the previous speakers have recited how it happened with this President Bush. the prior President Bush and President Clinton. We have history as a guide that says taking this action does work. Second. the reason it works is that one of the problems we have in the oil market is speculation. There was legislation passed in 2002 by Congress that included a loophole that allowed the deregulation of the energy futures trading market. and there Is enormous evidence. that that has allowed hedge funds and arbitrageurs and speculators to impose a premium in the cost of each barrel of oil and in the cost of a gallon of gas. The fact is. if the Federal Government is showing. particularly on a bipartisan basis. that we are going to use the levers that we have. even in a shortterm way. to protect the consumer against the speculator. then that has a chastening impact on speculation and helps bring the price down. Third. the process. My friend from Texas is the distinguished ranking member of that committee. but this issue about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is well worn. In fact. its been used before. as I mentioned. so its not all that complicated. We are doing it only for the period of 2008 in respect to the wishes of the chairman. The Senate has passed the ReidDorgan amendment by 971. essentially the very same proposal that we are considering today. The bottom line is this. will we take the shortterm actions that its within our reach to take that have a proven capacity to help the consumer? I urge a \"yes\" vote on the bill.",
