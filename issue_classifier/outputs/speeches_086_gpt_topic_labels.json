    "speech": "I cannot help but feel rather strongly that. after 25 years of the efforts of Congress. by controls .planned to be diverse. but in the end being in principle identical. we have failed to solve this problem. It was contended that by means of controls a balance would be developed between reasonable consumption and production. After 25 years of experience. today we are in a worse position than we were - when we started. The Senator from Florida has made the statement that all the programs have worked substantially well except the price support program. I recognize that we cannot suddenly pull out. but I am also firmly of the opinion that we cannot continue to subsidize to the extent we have been subsidizing without producing ill results. I have listened to such statements as. -\"Let us work on the problem. We will come up with something.\" We have worked for 25 years. and nothing has come from our efforts. We are sinking deeper and deeper into the mire. I agree with the Senator from Georgia. -since we are subsidizing the merchant -marine. the airlines. the metal producers. and the truckers on the highwaysand the railroads are now asking for a subsidyI suppose we must subsidize all up and down the line. I was at the airport in Cleveland on Friday morning. The supervisor of limousines said. \"Senator. I want you to do something for me.\" I said. \"What is it?\" He said. \"I want you to get the Congress to pass a subsidy for limousine supervisors. but for no one else.\" That statement was far graver to me than it was to him. There was. this little man. with his uniform and his taxicab directors cap. He is beginning to say. \"You are subsidizing every one else.\" He as much as said. \"I am paying the bill.\" From the standpoint of Ohio. the farmers are sick and tired of the Congress trying to tell them. \"We have the Utopia. We will provide the formula.\" We have tried for 25 years. and we have produced nothing. We are worse off than when we started. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I know of his deep interest in creating stable economic conditions. My remarks are not directed at him. because I know of his legitimate and honest objective in trying to establish stable government.",

Of course there will always be a few thieves. There will always be those who will disobey the law. However. they are not the general run. There are always some who want some special privileges. We do not condemn the entire banking structure of the countrythe independent banker. the small banker in our hometownbecause a big bank has pulled a fast deal. A few of them have. of course. We are proud of our banking system. We do not condemn the whole business structure of America because there happen to be some pretty big businesses. and because some of them take advantage of the market. for example. I wonder why Members of Congress are not so irate at some airplane companies for overcharging the Federal Government on defense planes as they are about some farmer getting an overpayment. It is interesting that the General Accounting Office should reveal that some of the large manufacturing establishments have actually overcharged the Government of the United States. When such a revelation is made. hardly a ripple goes through Congress. However. if a farmer leases his land under the soil bank. and gets a large payment. it becomes the subject of a great big investigation. I hope Senators will not misunderstand me. That is wrong. An overpayment is wrong. I certainly do not wish to justify any wrongs. I do not justify one wrong because someone else does another wrong. All I am asking is that we take the same look at the agricultural program. By and large. without the program. bad as it is. the situation would be incredibly worse.",

The title of my address was \"A New Era for Latin America.\" Apparently this speech attracted some attention. particularly in the Latin American countries. Regrettably. far too little attention is paid to United StatesLatin American relations in the United States. It is a pertinent topic of a handful of newspapers and journalists. rather than the daytoday subject of interest to all areas of the United States. Our neighbors to the south. our Latin American neighbors deserve our continuing attention and consideration. The political and economic developments in Latin America are of vital importance to the United States and the free world. The inadequacies of our present policies concerning Latin America. while generally admitted. have received far too little thoughtful attention by public and private bodies in the United States. There is every indication that the international Communist movement has selected Latin America as its next target. We can expect to see much more activity on the part of Communists in that area. We shall not be able to combat it merely by repressive measures and military assistance. The answer to communism in Latin America is an all out struggle against poverty. disease. hunger. and unemployment. Latin America needs economic development. Our Latin American neighbors need a United States that is interested in the people of these countries and not merely in the resources. the mines. the oil. the timber. Indeed. we need to be the good neighbor and to extend the helping hand of friendship and understanding. It is already late. Let us hope and pray it is not too late.

I have for many years advocated that the Federal Government adopt a capital budget bookkeeping system. whereby the current expenditures of the Government would be differentiated from investments of the Government upon which we will realize a return plus interest. Again this year I have introduced a bill to put such a bookkeeping system into effect. S. At the time that I introduced this bill I noted that Great Britain. among other countries in Europe. has such a bookkeeping system. I invite the attention of the Senate to an article which appeared in the U.S. News & World Report of April 20 on the British bookkeeping system. The article is entitled \"How Britain Balances Budget.\" The article points out that if the United States used a capital budget such as Great Britain does. the Federal Government would show a surplus of at least $3 billion for fiscal 1960. rather than $100 million. as forecast by President Eisenhower. under our present antiquated bookkeeping system. It has been my observation that discussions of the budget engender more emotional outbursts than rational thought. One of the main reasons is that our annual budget report does not reveal an accurate fiscal picture. No business would think of lumping current expenditures in with its investments. yet that is just what our Federal Government does under the presffnt bookkeeping system. I say it is time that we put our bookkeeping system in order. It is time that we adopted a modern. uptodate capital budget. We are indebted. indeed. to the author of this particular article for a very objective and factual survey of budgetary conditions in certain countries and how a capital budget would work. I was so pleased to find this particular material. because all too little attention is given to modernizing the budgeting system of this Nation. Until we modernize it. there will be all kinds of heat. thunder. and fury about budgets. but very little light and constructive information and reform.

Some of these with which I am personally familiar have been mentioned by others. including accomplishments in the fields of seasoning. gluing. wood chemistry. and dimensional stabilization. I am personally well acquainted with some of the Laboratorys work in the field of paper manufacturing and the production of hardwood veneer and lumber. These are particularly important industries in Wisconsin. This anniversary brings to mind some of the people who have contributed to the Laboratorys program. The first two Directors. McGarvey Cline and \"Cap\" Winslow. were before my time. but I have had pleasant contacts with George Hunt. Al Hall. and the newly appointed director Ed Locke. I must also mention George Trayer who left the Laboratory to head the Division of Forest Products here in Washington. All of these men not only made substantial technical contributions. but they were leaders in progressive thought. All of them were outstanding individualistic personalities. They have left their mark on the Laboratory. Other oldtimers who come to mind are \"Doe\" Truax. R. P. A. Johnson. \"Mark\" Marquardt. and J. D. (Mac) MacLean. Although these men are now retired. they are still contributing importantly in an unofficial capacity. as are a number of other retirees. whose donation to their lifes work brings them back to the Laboratory almost daily. \"Doc\" Truax and J. D. MacLean exemplify the Laboratorys contribution to our knowledge of glues. veneer. plywood. and wood preservatives. R. P. A. Johnsons dynamic espousal of timber as a structural material will be long remembered by anyone who has heard his theme on \"Use and Abuse of Wood.\" Marquardt spent over 40 years at the Laboratory. and is recognized internationally as \"the\" authority on timber mechanics. Arthur Koehlers spectacular testimony in the Hauptman kidnaping case will be remembered by most of you. He is an outstanding wood technologist. now living in California. I could name many more oldtimers who had a large share in making our Forest Products Laboratory the outstanding institution it is today.

This worldfamed U.S. Forest Service research unit has made and is continuing to make contributions of tremendous importance toward the full economic utilization of our forest products. I know in my own State of Washington the lumber. plywood. and pulp industries benefit and depend on work accomplished at the Laboratory. These industries. large and small. look to the Laboratory for impartial evaluation of various products. for methods of testing and for assistance in establishing commercial standards. For example. the work of the Laboratory on advancing methods of seasoning lumber and drying veneer is known throughout the world. While the past work of the Laboratory has been a key factor in our present utilization of forest materials. the future potential is of equal importance. For instance. the use of wood residues from mill and logging operations depends on the development of a wood chemical industry. The Laboratory already has done bench chemistry to develop heatpressuretime factors for making useful chemicals by a process called hydrolysis. However. there are other processes. largely unexplored. that show promise and it is hoped the Laboratory can proceed in an orderly fashion with research in this field. Those who are informed in the field of industrial chemicals point to the tremendous growth of organic chemical industrieslargely based on petroleum chemicals. It is the consensus that the petroleum industry cannot hope to satisfy all of the growing demands for chemicals and that a new raw base is needed. What better base is there than a renewable resource such as wood? And where can the wood industry look for the researchbased information required by these advanced fields but to the Forest Products Laboratory? I would like to mention briefly another valuable function of the Laboratory: supplying expert technologists. Over the last several years a number of Laboratorytrained men have been engaged by private industry throughout the country. Thus. the Laboratory activities yield not only research information but welltrained scientists to apply it. Mr. Speaker. I cannot stress too strongly how important the Forest Prodducts Laboratory is to the continuing economic development of all segments of the wood products industries. and it is with real pleasure that I pay tribute to this fine institution on its golden anniversary.",

This is the report of the study group that visited major countries of Western Europe last fall for the purpose of trying to determine why U.S. exports of agricultural commodities are lagging when the demand for agricultural imports Is increasing. I feel that this report is a most comprehensive analysis as to the shortcomings of our present export operations. and goes far in recommending a solution to this problem. It is my feeling that every Member of Congress should read this report and that the public. generally speaking. should be enlightened.

Religious and civic groups. government officials at all levels. and just plain interested citizens have joined the fray with particular emphasis on means for preventing the flood of obscene publications into the hands of our young people. There are a number of legislative proposals in this field. each of which holds some promise for finding solutions to this perplexing problem. I am hopeful Congress will act soon in this area. A recent editorial in the Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat & Chronicle pointed up a positive means for combating the spread of pornographic literature. The Batavia (N.Y.) Youth Bureau suggests that a good way to stamp out smut is by keeping a watchful eye on the mails. The Democrat & Chronicle further suggests that parents launch their own campaigns to get interesting and wholesome reading into the hands of their children. and to stimulate them to take an interest in this kind of literature. There is certainly great merit in this editorials comment that \"the problem of salacious literature finding its way into young hands does not exist for youngsters who have been intelligently and skillfully motivated in their reading.\" I hope this idea will gain wide circulation. because it contains great promise. I certainly commend the Democrat & Chronicle. which has consistently been in the forefront of efforts to wipe out the flood of filth. for its editorial stand. and I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

Lane to be president of the Mississippi River Commission. and I am highly pleased that the Senate Public Works Committee has unanimously recommended confirmation. The Mississippi River Commission is composed of three officers from the Army Corps of Engineers. one officer from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. and three civilians. Created in 1879. the Commission is responsible for flood control. navigation. and water resource conservation on the Mississippi River and its tributaries from St. Louis to New Orleans. The presidency of the Commission is one of the most important assignments in the Corps of Engineers. and I am grateful that a man of experience and outstanding ability has been selected for this key post. General Lane is particularly suited for his new assignment because he has full knowledge of the people and of the problems of this area. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. General Lane is well known throughout the Mississippi River Valley. having served as executive officer and disbursing officer in Memphis from 1933 to 1935 and as district enginer in Little Rock from 1948 to 1950. His 3 years of service as one of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia has given him broad experience in the field of municipal operations. as well as in water resource development problems. He is now commanding general. U.S. Army Training Center. Fort Leonard Wood. Mo. General Lane will have the full support of all leaders in the Mississippi Valley. His nomination is in keeping with the long tradition of having our finest engineering officers serve on the Mississippi River Commission. He succeeds Maj. Gen. W. A. Carter. whose record has been outstanding. In keeping with his distinguished civil and military record. I am confident that General Lanes efforts as president of the Commission will be to build up the area. and I predict that during his tenure the entire Mississippi Valley will move forward in a constructive way. I am confident his services will greatly benefit not only the Mississippi Valley. but the entire Nation.",

She is a writer of poetry and possesses literary talent.

In addition. by another joint resolution. the Congress has designated the 17th day of September each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution of the United States of America on September 17. 1787. It has come to my attention that the District of Columbia plans a ceremony on Citizenship Day. The essence of the ceremony will be an actual session of District Court to be convened on the monument grounds by Judge Holtzoff for the purpose of swearing in new citizens. Here is an even more active and concrete example for our Russian visitor. What more fitting example of tribute to the principles we believe in than to see throngs of people standing in the shadow of the Washington Monument to witness the coming into their ranks of new citizens?

Mr. REECE submitted to the House a lengthy account dealing with the case of. the German expellees with special emphasis on the Sudeten German issue. On the whole. the statement was pervaded by unfounded charges against the Czech nation. On many points of fact and opinion. the critical reader may well wish to take issue with the gentleman from Tennessee who has seemed to disregard the obvious fact that the socalled Sudeten Germans themselves were mostly responsible for the whole sequence of events winding up with their removal from Czechoslovakia. The attempt to picture the Czechs as the villains rather than the victims of the east central European tragedy seems to make a large draft on the imagination. As some facts and various of his inferences were dubious and erroneous. attention should be directed to them. Thus Mr. REECEs psition deserves careful analysis by all those who have the solution of the GermanCzech problem at heart.",

    "speech": "used the terms \"the Sudeten Germans\" and \"the Sudetenland\" regardless of accuracy and propriety. The Czech Germans were split in many areas and ethnic islands with different cultural and ethnical backgrounds. They did not form a single racial group. They had been originally related ethnically to the Central and Northern. East Franconian. Upper Saxon. and Silesian tribes. Inclusion within the same state drew together these various German groups. The term \"Sudeten German\" was coined only in 1902 and became popular during the Nazi era when it was used to impress international public opinion that the Czech Germans formed an independent branch of the German nation which had to be liberated by its union with the German Reich. The lack of geographical compactness split the Czech Germans into eight separate and isolated sparts. Their leader Josef Seligerso highly esteemed by Mr. REEcE--stated himself in October 1918: The eight territorial fragments in which Germans are settled are separated from each other by broad belts of territories in which the Czech language is spoken. and they. therefore. cannot form a state or even a united administrative area. (Franz Koegler. \"Oppressed Minority?\" London. 1943. p. 22.) When in 1918 the Czech Germans wanted to separate themselves from the newly founded Czechoslovak Republic they had to constitute several unconnected provinces which still contained a number of Czechs. In 1938. after Munich. Hitler again was compelled to break up the annexed Czech areas into several parts falling to Austria. Bavaria. Silesia. Only the remainder formed the socalled Sudetengau. Some 700.000 Czechs and 2.820.000 Germans were ceded to the Reich. Yet it was still impossible to draw the ethnographical line between the Czechs and Germans because many of each of them lived in the mixed German or Czech regions. in the linguistic enclaves or as dispersed individuals.",

It was on the strength of this judgment that he concluded that the Czech Germans were right in having prompted the dissolution of the state in 1938. Alas. the evidence appears to suggest a far gloomier view as far as the Germans were concerned and fails to bring out any confirmation of Mr. REECEs scathing condemnation of Czechoslovak democracy. The Czechoslovak Germans were better equipped with schools than the Germans. Poles. and Magyars in Prussia. Poland. and Hungary.

Mass executions and terror rendered impossible the whole idea of a peaceful cohabitation between Germans and Czechs. The Czechoslovak resistance movement and the exile Government formulated and proposed unanimously the removal of the disloyal majority of the German ethnic group to Germany as a necessary measure of protection. The horror. savagery. and brutality of the Nazi regime helped to create during the war the favorable terrain for the acceptance of the principle of the transfer by all the Great Powers. Great Britain. the United States. std Soviet Union. But the impetus toward the transfer was supplied by the Czech common people at home. The transfer of the Sudeten became an axiom for all the resistance groups through the entire era of German occupation. 193945. The idea arose. so to speak. from the necessities of Czechoslovakia at a time when no one knew whether the Czech people would have a chance to survive.",

When Members of the Senate speak on the floor of the Senate on some more controversial aspect of our foreign policy. or our aid program. such speeches attract widespread attention. and attract support or. sometimes. attract opposition. I think the Senator from Minnesota is now discussing one of the most important parts of our aid program. and one of the most important instruments of our foreign policy. We attach great importance to military programs and economic aid for the industrialization of other nations. But the Senator is talking about a food programsomething the United States can do that no other country can. and when he says that food assists the economic growth of newly dependent countries and developing countries he is correct. The first need of all such countries is food and we have the surplus food. Second. as the Senator has so clearly pointed out. our provision of surplus foods for counterpart funds. enables the governments of other countries to sell the food to their own people. and thus obtain a source of revenue which can be used internally for the industrial development of their countries. The program has another value. As those countries begin to be industrially developed. the first increases of their workers earnings go into food and fiber. As a result. the danger of inflation is presented. Additional amounts of food from our country help reduce inflationary pressures. and save for their people their small increases in earnings. The Senator is correct in saying that the ability of the United States to furnish food to other nations when no other country can do so is a potent instrument of our foreign policy. Russia cannot supply food. the United States can. Despite all the practical reasonsreasons of policy and reasons of selfinterest. I am glad the Senator has pointed out that our willingness to supply our surplus food to the needy peoples of other countries is the best expression of the moral and spiritual interest and heart of the people and Government of our country.

I in no way challenge the right of labor to participate in politics. My only wish is that they would form a labor party and quit using first. the Republican Party and. then. the Democratic Party as a figurehead and get out of those two parties and have their own. But. what I was trying to raise here was to call to the gentlemans attention. and I am sure he knows about them. certain practices that are now prevalent and have been for 15 or more years. ever since 1936. and the answer to them or the solution to them. In the Committee on Labor. we have worked earnestly and. I think. in a nonpartisan way trying to get a bill. That bill should be reported out next Thursday. and it should be under consideration by the House before a great deal of time goes by. We will have to find the answers to certain situations which are not political. but which exist and to which the gentleman has indirectly referred. As I understand the gentleman. he does not propose any solution to any of them. You want to create a Commission to study them. As a matter of fact. millions of people know about them from practical experience. I thought the gentleman was going to give us some help along that line. If he does not. why then that is his privilege. of course.",

I. and the other Members of Congress. will unite our efforts. and I will do all in my power to see that a good labor bill is passed. Right now my point simply is that I do not believe even the most ardent proponents of the bill which is soon to be reported to the floor of this House will claim for that bill that it will solve or settle all of the labor problems. I am not referring to just the problems of improving understanding between labor and management. about which we have heard so much. but I am also talking about all of the other labor problemseconomic. social and technological. which are becoming so vast and intricate. These problems are continually with us. The decisions handed down by the Supreme Court and the various circuit courts of appeal and of the National Labor Relations Board are becoming almost too numerous to count. Because of that I feel strongly that it is necessary that experts go into this entire matter. sift out the facts. and come up with something workable.",

Its provisions are designed to protect the union member against corrupt officials and it makes at least a pretense of giving protection to the public generally. the average union worker. but it is woefully deficient in words which will adequately protect the welfare of the people or the average individual forced to work for a livelihood. It does not give adequate protection against blackmail picketing and secondary boycotts. It does not protect the average businessman or industrialist against extortion. Certainly. the Members of the House. as well as the average informed individual. know that secondary boycotting is wrong. that organizational picketing has no place in a free nation. Certainly. every intelligent individual should. if he does not. know that levying a tax by private groups upon the right to work or the privilege of doing business should not be tolerated. Those who are not familiar. either from experience or from reading the press reports of the McClellan and previous congressional hearings. can be advised of the millions of dollars which have been collected by extortion from American citizens. much of it illegally spent. Those unfamiliar with customary practices of unions which are illegal and destructive of the individuals freedom should read the book recently published. written by Sylvester Petro.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. added two more significant milestones to its 60year history. It is the first Goodyear manufacturing unit on West Virginia soil and also the first installation devoted exclusively to the production of the companys revolutionary polyester materials. Vitel and Videne. Vitel is the resin from which synthetic textile fibers can be spun. Videne is a unique laminating film for protective and/or decorative surfaces. Goodyear selection of the West Virginia tract near the city of Point Pleasant on the Ohio River was not mere chance but the result of a detailed study of what was needed to manufacture these new miracles in plastics. After years of research and development. involving millions of dollars. the new products were ready for marketing in early 1957. But an analysis of properties then held by Goodyear revealed there was not enough land available to build a plant of the size necessary to meet projected sales potentials for these new materials. Once the need for new properties was determined. a task force of Goodyear representatives began an exhaustive search for new property. which would not only provide adequate production space immediately. but also protect for future production expansion of these materials and other chemical or associated products.",

April. as reported by Business Week. saw a $700 million extension in consumer credit. Added to that. we now have reports showing a $870 million jump in May. This is a truly inflationary trend the administration might well get concerned about. This is private deficit financing at the rate of $10 billion a year.

But I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that in his younger days the Senator from Alaska wrote a very excellent book on Mexico. and I would recommend to all Senators that they read the book. even these many decades after it was written. because what the Senator from Alaska wrote in that book still holds good. At that time the Senator from Alaska indicated a very great personal interest in Latin America. Mr. President. the pending measures have to do with a cooperative program covering Latin America. onesixth of the authorization of the Latin American bill is to be used for the redevelopment and rehabilitation of Chile which. as all Senators know. has been damaged very severely and gravely by earthquakes. In fact. the latest one occurred only today. when Santiago underwent another tremor of some severity. So I urge the Senator from Alaska to save his ammunition until next week. when we shall consider the appropriations for the mutual security program. But certainly prompt action by us on the pending measures is most important. in view of the fact that at the present time there is under way in Costa Rica the Conference of Foreign Ministers. and in view of the fact that in another 2 weeks there will be the Conference of Foreign Ministers at Bogota. Columbia. Prompt action by the Congress on the two measures now before us would give a psychological imperative which many of us think extremely important at this time.",

Or. if a person is renting a house. and the landlord had to borrow money in order to build the house. the cost of rental housing is going to increase 10 percent if there is a 1 percent increase in the interest rate.

A large portion of the holdings of banks are in savingsperhaps half. or a little less than halfand the money in savings accounts has had the benefit of about a 1 percent increase in interest rates. So that. on the whole. I should imagine that an average of about half or threequarters of 1 percent additional interest is paid on money in banks. while the banks are getting on the average more nearly 2 percent extra. It appears to me that fact would be enough to result in a major increase in the profits of banks without depositors getting nearly so great a deal of increase in the interest received on the moneys on deposit. I also believe the Senator will find there has been a great benefit resulting to insurance companies. who receive a stipulated amount of money each year and pay out a stipulated amount when an insured person dies. The insurance companies have based their risks on a certain assumed level of interest to be paid on the money they lend. while the interest on the money they have invested has greatly increased. There again the middleman is in a position to profit handsomelyparticularly the stock insurance companieswithout the person who holds the policy getting any particular benefit from the increase in the interest collected by the insurance company.",

I am quite satirfied the Republican Party is not responsible for the wars or the debt that grew out of them. All I am blaming the Republican Party for at this moment is doubling the interest rate. which means doubling the cost of carrying the national debt. That is all I am blaming the Republican Party for. and that cost is very heavy. Their high interest policy is especially bad for people who are trying to buy homes even though they have no direct connection at all with the national debt. . I am satisfied. and I believe the Senator is satisfied. that if there were in the White House an Executive who did not like the high interest rate policies. and was not committed to them. and had a desire to reverse the policies. he would have all the cooperation from Congress he needed. As a matter of fact. a majority of the Congress would like to stop the increasing of interest rates. The trouble is if Congress tried to tell the Federal Reserve Board how to do its job. and the Board did not want the policy of Congress to work. the Board could find a dozen different ways to prevent it from working in the way it should. If the Board is not willing to cooperate. it is almost impossible for the Congress to do the Federal Reserve Boards job for it. On the other hand. if the President and the Congress cooperated together and made it clear to the Federal Reserve Board they were against high interest rates. I am very much inclined to the view that the Board would follow the views of the President when it knew he had Congress on his side. So far as I am aware. there has never been a time when the Board has gone directly against the policy of the President. I would be curious to have someone point out to me an instance where that occurred. The nearest instance I have been able to discover was an instance when Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey testified that he thought the Board was going a little too fast in raising interest rates although he did not interpose any particular objection.",

As I was about to say. this is simply one of a series of speeches which I intend to make in the coming weeks. with regard to the hard money policy. pointing out its total cost to the American citizens. As Federal taxpayers. we can be precise and explicit as to how much this policy is costing us. and the fact that this absolute waste gives the taxpayer nothing. Furthermore. as the Senator from Louisiana has said. costs to the American citizen as a local taxpayer have increased tremendously. When the local governments desire to finance hospitals. schools. streets or any other kind of community construction. money has to be borrowed on a longterm basis. and interest constitutes a very importantoften the most importantelement of cost. In addition to those items. of course. the farmers who have to borrow. the small businessmen who have to borrow. and the home buyersand they are perhaps the largest single group of borrowersare forced to pay more and more and more. The reason I am emphasizing this matter in my first speech on interest rates is that our good friends of the Republican Party. as usual. have one issue and only one issue. This is economy in government. That is the one issue they have talked about for 20 years. and I am sure they will make it the big issue for the next 20 years. That is the No. 1 issue of the distinguished Vice President and the President of the United States for the coming campaign. They want to speak of economy in government. and the way economy in government relates to a balanced budget and relates to the cost of living. That is why I think it is very important to emphasize to the American people that the hard money policy being followed is completely wasteful. It means the spending of a billion dollars without getting a single thing in return for the money.",

The Senator can. if he wishes. attribute the best of motives to those responsible. but I believe they knew what they were doing. and I believe they achieved what they set out to do. which was to double the income of certain people who were engaged in lending money. Conceivably they did not have that in mind and perhaps it was merely an accidental effect. but I think they knew it would happen. In my judgment. the $15 billion annual increase in interest extractions from the public was the main purpose of the program.

President Eisenhower has carried out the mandate of the resolution. and proclaimed the third week of July as Captive Nations Week. This morning. as we all now know. Soviet Premier Khrushchev made a very bitter speech. charging that the resolution and the Presidential proclamation were a direct interference in the international affairs of the Soviet Union. and stating that there was a campaign in the United States to discredit communism. The Soviet Premier was correct in one respect: The passage of the resolution was a part of a campaign to discredit communism and to hit communism in one of its weakest spots. namely. its control over various national groups which undoubtedly desire their independence. but which are unable to obtain it because of the pressure of the Russian secret police and the Russian armies. Those countries include the three Baltic States of Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia. Poland. Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria. Romania. Albania. Hungary. East Germany. and various groups in the prewar Russian states such as Ukrainia and others. I wish to make it clear that the resolution is not intended to encourage any premature revolution. We do not wish to cause the patriots in those countries prematurely to take up arms and to sacrifice the leadership in those areas. But we do want to assure them that we have not forgotten them. and that we hold out a message of hope for their ultimate liberation. At the same time. we serve notice upon Russia that while she is making a vicious attack upon the democracies of the West. we intend to emphasize before the bar of public opinion her own weaknesses and criminal acts.",

The question has been raised as to whether this was intentional or purely coincidental. I can say most emphatically that it was purely coincidental. The original resolution called for making the week of July 4 Captive Nations Week. But there was a delay in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in dealing with the matter. largely because of the lateness with which the resolution was introduced. Therefore. it was not until the 6th day of July that the Senate could pass upon the matter. So it was necessary to fix the period as the third week of July. rather than the week of July 4.

I think anyone who has been there knows the bitterness of the feeling between the two countries. One of their problems has been the use of the waters of the Indus River. It has been believed that if the differences between the two countries over this river could be composed. the resolution of those differences could lead to and establish a first step toward the easing of tensions. and perhaps toward a final settlement of their differences. over a period of years. So it is of great importance to peace and good relations in that area. Someone may ask. \"Well. of what importance is that to the United States? Both of these countries are friends of the United States.\" Yet the fact that these differences exist between them makes our own relations with those two countries difficult. The United States has taken the lead in trying to find some way to resolve the differences over the Indus River. Other countries have entered into those negotiations. I think it would be a great mistake. looking to the larger interest of the Nation. looking to the interest of composing the differences between those two countries. and looking to a day when perhaps both friends will not be estranged from the United States because of their own differences. not to make this movement in the right direction. It seems to me we should adhere to some principle which. in the broad gage. is of importance to the United States. and if we defeat such a broad and general and desirable purpose as this. we shall be doing something which is injurious to the broad interests of the United States.",

We have served together in the leadership meetings with the President. in the policy committee. and our own party conferences. His perspective and his viewpoint have never been dimmed or narrowed by provincial considerations. I fully subscribe to and join in the statements that were made concerning his service to his constituency in the great State of Massachusetts. but perhaps more so to the people of the United States of America. He regards himself not only as a Senator of that State. but also as a Senator of the United States of America. From that high vantage ground he has always pursued his public responsibilities. He deserves all the acclaim we can accord him. and we do wish him well in the approaching contest. As I have said on a number of occasions. the people of the State of Massachusetts will not be serving him. they will be serving themselves best when they send back a man of such great background as a member of his legislature. as Governor of his Commonwealth. and then for a long period of time as a Senator of the United States.",

My mind went back to the colloquy which occurred before we left here for Sunday. with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts . who is his partys nominee for the highest office in the land. about the fact. which I think needs constant emphasis. that. as my friend and colleague from New York has made so crystal clear. there are a very substantial number of Members on this side. as there are on the other side. who are very anxious to get on with the pending business and to vote on the minimum wage bill. Mr. President. I point out that a number of us tried to facilitate that. not only by urging it. but also by removing from the consideration of the minimum wage bill any of the discussion with respect to the very hotly debated subject of civil rights. upon which so many of us feel very keenly. I say that because I think the debate is not partisan. I think the Senators who are engaged in it are entitled to great credit. The country needs to be aroused to the fact that. without regard to party. there is here a very solid coalition in favor of the passage of a minimum wage bill. which is being frustrated and delayed by some who feel that they might profit by delay. I wish immediately to point out that my dear friend and colleague. the junior Senator from Arizona . who is quite sincerely opposed to the bill. is here. and that he was very wise and statesmanlike in making it clear. the other day. as soon as he had an opportunity to do so. that so far as he is concerned. he is not pretending to lead the Republicans. or anything of the sort. The country should have very clearly in mind. therefore. the fact that there may be quite sincere opposition and deeply held opposition. and that the Senator from Arizona is ready to meet the issues as they come up. and that there is also support for this particular measure on both sides of the aisle.",

Those of us who are opposed to this measure or the Members of the Senate who wish to see the measure changed before it is passed have not been the ones who have been delaying action on it. and I may point out that this has not been a partisan matter. Only a handful of Republican Senators and only a handful of Democratic Senators have spoken to the subject. So I cannot agree with anyone who says action on this bill has purposely been delayed. It has not been. I repeat what I said the other day: that were we in a regular session of the Congress. I can assure my friend. the Senator from New York. that consideration of this bill would take 3 weeks. and he knows full well that it would. because this bill is an extremely complicated one. Many members of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare are not aware of what the bill provides. So I wish to correct any misapprehension which my good friend. the Senator from New York. may have left in the minds of some personsnamely. that the junior Senator from Arizona or any of the other Members of this body who have been engaged in debating this measure have been purposely delaying action on it.

There is one angle which I think ought to be brought out. Our party is frequently called the party of big business. We are accused. erroneously and unfairly. I believe. of showing partiality to big business. and so forth. I think if the record were carefully examined and objectively examined it never would sustain the charge. but instead would show that we are very much the friend of small business and the friend of all business. The important thing about the nomination of Mr. Bicks is that the nomination has run into some opposition from the field of big business. There have been big business operators who have pled that the Bicks nomination should be set aside. I simply wonder whether it is responsive to that plea from big business that our friends across the aisle are holding up the nomination of Mr. Bicks. Are they doing it at the request of big business?

To set the record straight. four Democrats voted with an overwhelming majority of Republicans on Tuesday. August 9. against a motion to table the extremely moderate civil rights legislation introduced by the minority leader. the Senator from Illinois . Those Democrats were Senators PAUL DOUGLAS. PHILIP HART. PAT McNAMARA. and WAYNE MORSE. They have long been associated with the cause of civil rights and their support was most welcome. coming as it did at a time when many of their Democratic colleagues who normally join forces with us on civil rights did not vote with us on this occasion. A constituent of the Senator from Illinois heard the \"Leading Question\" broadcast and understood me to say that the Senator from Illinois had cast his vote for the tabling motion. when. in fact. he did exactly the opposite. along with the three other Democratic Senators noted earlier. The Senator from Illinois has a consistent and courageous record on civil rights. During his very first year in this body he joined in the fight to invoke cloture during the filibuster against the FEPC bill. and he has been very active in a leadership position in that fight ever since.

It goes into an area concerning which certainly the mood of the American people is this: If there is Communist propaganda coming in we would like it to be identified as such. But this bill refers not merely to Communist propaganda but to any political propaganda. The bill refers to it in terms of a very broad definition. indeed. it is so broad that while the intent may be as narrow as just stated by the chairman. the terms of the language of the bill which he reported to the House. put on the statute books a grant of authority which might well at some future time be used for proceedings far beyond the limited purpose to which he alludes. I therefore now find myself. Mr. Speaker. in the same position that I have found myself in once or twice here before. That is to say. as one who has taken an oath and affirmation to uphold the Constitution against all enemies. foreign or domestic. I must abide by the spirit of that Constitution. Therefore I must here register my protest against what I believe to be a proposed statute that is drawn so broadly as to transgress certainly on the spirit and quite possibly the letter of the Constitution itself.",

    "speech": "I refuse to yield further. Mr. Speaker. numerous hearings conducted by the Committee on UnAmerican Activities reveal that approximately 10 million pieces of Communist propaganda is coming into the United States from behind the Iron Curtain each year. Now. this propaganda is not only printed in English but in 13 different languages. and it is directed to different nationality groups throughout the United States. The evidence was clear that whenever the Russian propaganda machine wanted a certain nationality group within the United States to take a certain position on a current political issue. that particular nationality group was flooded with Communist propaganda directed to that issue. Now. as has been said. this legislation in nowise prohibits this propaganda from continuing to come into the United States through the U.S. mails. It merely says that it shall be labeled as was contemplated by the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 so that when a person gets the material he will know where it comes from. just the same as our pure food and drug law requires that we must label certain drugs as being poisonous. so that the individual can evaluate the propaganda better and know its source. This is all this bill is designed to do. The question is raised: What kind of propaganda do we want to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act? Here is a piece (of propaganda) that was part of the evidence in the hearings in Buffalo. Thousands of these pamphlets were sent into the United States in 10 different languages. But listen to some of the propaganda. This is the type of vicious propaganda we are talking aboutthat we want properly labeled. This was printed not years ago but in 1959. and it came out of Peking. China. Listen to this: American imperialists have committed atrocities unprecedented in the history of mankind in their aggressive war in Korea. They have massacred at random innocent people in North Korea. Now. we do not believe this tripe. but it is printed in different languages all over the world for the purpose of creating ill will and hatred toward the United States. They do not talk about atrocities committed during the Korean war. they talk about alleged atrocities committed since the Korean war. This is whqt it says:",

I was pleased that the Senate version of H.R. 12580 retains the provision eliminating the age 50 requirement for eligibility under the disability insurance program. since my own bill. H.R. 917. was directed at this needed change in the law. The proposed reduction in the retirement age from 65 to 62 years for men and the increase in the outside earnings limitation to $1.800 a year. are also worthwhile amendments which I have urged for many years. It is regrettable that a number of liberalizing amendments contained in the House bill were eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee. including those provisions improving the unemployment compensation system. However. I am hopeful that floor amendments in the other body may restore these important provisions. Mr. Speaker. the greatest disappointment in the Senate Finance Committee version of H.R. 12580 was the failure to provide for an adequate and workable program to provide medical care for the aged within the established social security system. I hope that some action will be taken in regard to catastrophic illness. the cost of which is a heavy burden on many families in the Nation. particularly among our aged citizens. Social justice calls for legislation to ease the burden of catastrophic illness. which often wipes out a lifetime of savings and toil for many of our citizens. Home. farms. possessions. are often lost in the struggle to meet the rising costs of medical care during a serious illness. or for hospital. nursing home or institutional care. These bring severe hardship and deprivation to many citizens and families. Mr. Speaker. I hope the other body will reject the administrations repugnant \"paupers oath\" approach to this problem- and adopt a genuine. realistic program to deal with the problem of catastrophic illness of such vital concern to the old people of America.",

I am conscious of the oppositions argument that statements were made on the bills origin that it would not have to be in force for more than 5 years. The gentleman from Alabama has explained. however. that the annual appropriations for the library services program have never come up to the full amount of the original estimated amount that was foreseen as necessary to do a complete job. Despite the statements of the opposition. I am here today to say most definitely that much remains to be done in assisting the development and growth of adequate library facilities in Nebraska. and particularly in the Sand Hill counties of my district. The region that I mention is range cattle country. where the population is sparse and the towns are small. Great advance. under this program. has been made in county seats such as Thedford. Valentine. Bassett. Springview. Taylor. and other towns. toward supplying books by a centralized library. as well as by bookmobile to students who are enrolled in schools too small to be able to supply them with the most desirable type of library. This paucity of book material has proved to be a very strong factor in the inability of many high school students to carry on successfully in collegiate work. The understanding of the worth of such a program is increasing in my State. I am in favor of continuing the Federal stimulus to the State and local cooperative movement. not just for the purpose of extending another Federalaid program. but for the very strategic purpose of better equipping our local libraries with the implements to cause a better modern education for our schoolchildren. I am certain. too. that the program in my State has been well administered by earnest men and women who are genuinely dedicated to the purposes mentioned. and who will continue to use this service efficiently for what are. at the present time. promising but incomplete results.

As recently as 1956. as the report in his bill points out. as many as 26 million persons were without any library service. Since then library service to many millions has been improved or made available for the first time. These programs are not yet fully developed. Neither are they selfsupporting. Perhaps the Federal Government. by cutting off its modest appropriations. could run the risk of curtailment or abandonment of library Services. We might hope that necessary funds would be made available at the local or State level. Mr. Speaker. in my opinion. this is a risk which should not be taken. This is a partnership program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the House of Representatives is considering passage of the 5year extension of the Library Services Act as one of its first official duties in reconvening for this extended 2d session of the 86th Congress. This. I believe. is an indication of the importance placed on the extension of the act at this time. It was my pleasure. on March 11 of this year. to introduce a companion bill to the one being considered at this time and to which I have given my complete support. As the chairman is aware. the act. when passed in 1956. was so designed as to serve as a stimulus to the States to provide better public library services to rural areas. In my home State of Washington. provisions of the act helped to inaugurate and successfully carry out the Columbia River Regional Library Demonstration in North Central Washington. As an example of the value of this demonstration in public enlightenment. nearly 48.000 residents of the five counties included in the demonstration now have library cards. Before the demonstration period. only 23.000 people had cards. Between 1957 and 1959 the number of library users increased nearly 76 percent. the amount of library materials borrowed increased more than 106 percent. and the hours of service per week increased more than 58 percent. Twentyeight town or community libraries have had their shelves stocked with new books. and are open longer hours than previously. Three bookmobiles serve families living far from established libraries. Books may also be borrowed by mail. When this particular project terminates. there will still be 17 counties in the State of Washington without rural library service. That the people of my State feel that these programs are worthwhile is demonstrated by the fact that of the funds expended thus far in carrying out the provisions of the Library Services Act. the State itself has contributed $330.965 compared to $125.287 in Federal funds. Extension of the act will allow the State Library Commission to entertain proposals for demonstrations in other areas of the State. It is felt that such library demonstration programs are the one way of making known to rural residents the benefits of good library service. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge the House of Representatives to adopt this legislation at this time.",

This includes such fields as: youth development. industrial progress. conservation of natural resources. stimulating greater patriotism among our citizens. and a wide variety of other constructive activities. At this time. I refer specifically to the upcoming Conference on Aging. scheduled for June 13 at Madison. Wis. We recognize. of course. that our senior citizens often face serious. difficult problems. in making social. economic. and other adjustments to changing conditions. as these affect their personal life. Consequently. there is. I believe. a community responsibility for attempting to establish the climate which can best accommodate these older citizens and. as possible. provide them an opportunity to continue to make their unique and valuable contribution to community Projects. The upcoming conference in Madison proposes to consider a wide scope of problems. including economic security. housing. social services. health and medical care. life adjustments. and a variety of other topics integral with the problems of aging. Reflecting one more way In which the great State of Wisconsin is moving forward to meet its own problems. and to deal with the difficulties confronting its citizens. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the May 15 La Crosse Sunday Tribune. entitled \"Plans Are Made for Conference on Aging\" be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

The underlying tragedy of the situation depicted can tug at the conscience of each of usin terms of personal responsibility to our own parents. as well as the realization of the tragic dilemma of millions of elderly Americans who face a similar problem. On the surface. it would appear that the problem relates completely to lack of filial responsibility. But this is not the total story. as revealed in the findings of the.Senate Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging. of which I am a member. The man in Bishops syndicated column is beset by problems common to millions of our elderlyinadequate income. substandard housing. lack of preventive health services. and soul searing loneliness. While companionship and financial assistance from children can play an important role in helping to make the later years of parents more comfortable. this is not enough in most instances. The report of our subcommittee. released earlier this year. lists 12 recommendations for legislative action needed to make it possible for our senior citizens to live comfortable. satisfying. and meaningful lives.

I have a couple of questions to ask of him. but first. I wish to say that today we have listened to a forthright address by the Senator from West Virginia. giving a profound. scholarly. and. in fact. magnificent statement of the situation confronting the American people at the present time. I compliment him for the service he has rendered to our country in making this address. A few moments ago he asked the question. What alternatives are open to us if the East Germans and the Russians provoke a nonnuclear. limited war in Germany? May I ask the Senator. Is not the only alternative confronting us to use nuclear weapons against the East Germans and the Russians in that area. and use them in such a manner as to repel and in the hope that they would repel the East Germans and keep West Berlin free. at the same time seeking. of course. to make such a nuclear war a limited war? That leads me to another question. Coming from a neighboring State. I too. like the Senator from West Virginia. desire. in this type of crisis. to support the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. I listened with satisfaction and with a degree of pride to the Presidents statement to the Nation last Monday evening. The Senator from West Virginia stated. in a better way than I can. that politics ends at the waters edge. and we all want to support our Commander in Chief. Along with that feeling. however. I had the feeling notwithstanding the address of our Commander in Chief to the Nation. it was hinted that if the Communist dictators of the Soviet Union persisted in their attempt to drive us from Berlin we were giving notice that nuclear weapons would be used by us to fight back at them. I am wondering what the Senator from West Virginia has to say on that subject. because we can assume. from the magnificent address the Senator from West Virginia has delivered. that he has given the entire subject a great deal of thought.",

I share with the Senator a strong feeling that the President should have stated categorically and in no uncertain terms that we are ready to meet the Soviets. if we must meet them. with nuclear weapons.

In the judgment of the Senator from West Virginia. instead of having an implication or an inference from our Commander in Chief that at the time of the deadline the dictators have fixed. or at some future deadline they may fix. if they persist in what they have said they are going to do. would it not be better for the Commander in Chief to say to the world that this Nation will resort to nuclear weapons to keep West Berlin free?

His view that a summit conference should not be held without first having some adequate determination of Soviet intentions to make genuine agreements and assurances that they will keep such agreements is also a position of which I thoroughly approve. I should like to ask the distinguished Senator from West Virginia a question with regard to his reference to Prime Minister Macmillan. I am not clear whether Prime Minister Macmillan is considering disengagement or some form of demilitarization.

In his address the Senator from West Virginia quoted statements dealing with events at the time when Mr. Litvinov defrauded President Roosevelt in order to gain recognition. and immediately reversed himself. having gained what he wanted. The wonder is that we ever. at any time. seriously believed Soviet words when not accompanied by effective deeds in the interest of all men. I close my comments to the distinguished Senator by saying that I agree with his conclusion. which is taken from the Bible. I note. as a matter of interest. that the President used that expression about the time of his inauguration. Therefore. we all support the Commander in Chief in the view that: When a strong man. armed. keepeth his palace. his goods are in peace.

In that yeai they regained their national independence. and the Estonians were among them. These people had settled in their historic land long before the beginning of modern times. There. in the northernmost outpost of Europe. they led a quiet and contented. but strenuous and hardy life. They were one of the smallest ethnic groups in Europe. and they succeeded in maintaining their national identity and freedom. Then in 1710 they were subjected to Russias oppressive czars. For more than two centuries they endured that detested regime. but they always wanted their freedom and were prepared to fight for it. Toward the end of the First World War. when the czarist regime in Russia was overthrown. they felt free and on February 24 proclaimed their independence. That was exactly 42 years ago. and today. unfortunately. independent Estonia is no more.

This northern plains city of 50.000 was saddled with problems. It had a 50yearold city hall built when the population was only 13.000. Its residential districts were becoming slums. Then civicminded residents formed a citizens for city planning organization to work for improvements. Over strong opposition. they won approval for a major bond issue to provide the needed funds. Now. on the site of a 17acre slum area. a new civic center is rising. Already completed are a modern city hall and an auditoriun. Other public buildings will follow.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is my privilege to call to the attention of the House that yesterday. February 24. marks the 42d anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Estonia. It does indeed seem cynical that when so many new nations are recognizing independence and selfdetermination throughout the world that those countries of Eastern Europe which were once independent still remain in captivity. Among this number Estonia. of course. must be included and. with her Baltic neighbors of Latvia and Lithuania. she does not even have the fiction of independence as do the other captive nations. - Indeed the history of these three small Baltic countries constitutes one of the most flagrant and outrageous violations of international agreement on the part of the Soviet Union that the world has ever seen. Ever since these three countries were absorbed by the Soviet Union. Communist policy has dictated the eradication of any vestiges of nationalism and is attempting to completely absorb them into the U.S.S.R. It is. nevertheless. heartening to realize that the people of Estonia still retain their burning desire for freedom and independence in spite of the tortures and slavery which they have undergone now for nearly 20 years. This display of courage on their part. however. must continually be nurtured by evidence of interest in their behalf on the part of the free world and above all by the United States of Ameriola who is rightly regarded as the guardian of hope for their ultimate freedom. That is why expressi6ns of interest on our part. in addition to commemorative meetings on this solemn occasion. will help to remind the captive peoples. including the Estonians. that they will never be forgotten in the hearts and minds of freemen everywhere. I trust we will all join in observing this national holiday of Estonia and in once again expressing the hope that the day will soon come when these brave people will be able to observe their own national holiday in a free land. Meanwhile. our Government rightly pursues the policy of refusing to recognize the forced annexation of Estonia and are continuing to recognize the representatives of its government in exile. This is the policy to which we should all continue to give our undivided support. Private Voluntary Insurance and H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. almost the complete insurance industry along with the American Medical Association has taken up the cry of \"socialism.\" \"governmentation.\" and many other words they use to create an image of a monsterH.R. 4700. The truth is that private insurers are not insuring the aged for medical. surgical. and hospitalization. The one fact they admit is that this group is a highcost. highrisk group. which has been completely avoided until very recently. . The argument is made that private insurance companies have made great strides in the voluntary health contracts. It is true that more people today are able to buy better health insurance than at any previous time. However. these policies are usually offered to that segment of the population under the age of 65 or even 60. The cost for a reasonable plan for the aged would be higher than the average person on a pension could afford. The coverage offered our aged population on policies in existence today is limited to a benefit rate that would have been proper or feasible back in 1940. These policies are in an experimental stage. and the natural conservatism of the industry is holding the benefits down to a minimum. The possibility always exists that. when it is found financially unwise to issue this type of policy. the companies will decline to renew. under their socalled cancellation clause. The following three policies are the best the insurance industry has to offer the aged today. In reading through these policies ask yourself this question. Is this policy adequate* for our aged today?",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a great deal is heard these days about the introduction of Americanmade small cars on a wide scale this fall. Many commentators interpret this move as signaling the U.S. automotive industrys counterattack on the mass invasion of foreign cars. In my opinion. there is antther side to the story. the export side. For the loss of markets by American automakers has not been confined to these shores. While imports have risen dramaticallyand are still climbingexports of U.S. autos have declined tremendously. Now. with the domestic industry turning to small car production on a mass scale. perhaps there is hope that the export trend will be reversed. Perhaps it will be possible. for example. to persuade our friends in West Germany to purchase more than 333 U.S. autos. our total exports there in 1958. a year which also saw 134.610 West German autos imported here. Or it may be possible to expand our exports to Great Britain from 329. the total we shipped there in 1958. to a number more in keeping with the 156.597 British cars unloaded herelast year. Happily. the Government of the United Kingdom has seen fit to increase the annual dollar quota on passenger cars from North America to $2 million. compared to the $600.000 limit which has been in effect. Admittedly. $2 million is a far cry from $194.072216the value of Britishmade cars imported by the United States in 1958but it is a tiny step in the right direction. nonetheless. Both at home and in overseas markets. U.S. manufacturers have a lot of ground to make up. In the period 195658. imports of new passenger cars quadrupled. from 107.675 to 433.921. and if the present import pace continues. 1959 will see 600.000 foreign cars landing here.",

President Eisenhower has recently visited with him and paid him a tribute of respect and honor. Out of rubble and ruins. the Chancellor and his Cabinet have built a strong republic. which is orientated westward and has done all and sundry to buckle itself as a stanch ally to the United States and Western democracies. There is no doubt that West Germany. under the guidance of her leaders like Chancellor Adenauer and President Heuss. Foreign Minister Brentano. Economic Minister Erhard. and others. has realized that the mark of Cain was upon the Germans because of the terrors of Hitler and nazism. They worked feverishly to wipe out that strain and have succeeded in reestablishing West Germany as a liberal nation in the liberal world. dedicated to the principles of individual freedom and democracy. A look at the map will reveal in realistic fashion that Germany in the heart of Europe must always be a buffer state on the flank of a free and democratic Europe. We do well to strengthen Germany by our insistence that East and West Germany be made one Germany. We do well to assure the world that we will never let Berlin down. that Berlin. now an island in a Communist sea. must be integrated into a unified Germany. It is worthy of comment also. that Chancellor Adenauer. President Heuss and his successor. Dr. Heinrich Luebke. and the other praiseworthy officials of Germany have made. and are making restitution to the Jews in Israel and other Jews. whose property and valuables were filched from them by Hitler and his cutthroat bandits. That restitution. of course. cannot bring back the 6 million dead. but it can go a great way in the court of public opinion to show that Germany wishes to be rehabilitated. that Germany is repentant and that Germany is expiating her wrongs. We all. therefore. hail Chancellor Adenauer on his 10th anniversary and present our compliments to President Heuss and his able successor in the Presidency. Heinrich Luebke. We present our compliments also to Foreign Minister Brentano. and Economic Minister Erhard for work well done.

This is a new 27year high and the highest of any time since the stockmarket crash and the great depression of the thirties. I am not predicting that we are entering a similar cycle but I want to add my word of caution since there seems to be a continued policy of this administration to make the small businessman extinct. I am particularly concerned because I feel that the small businessman is a very important part of our economy. If hls administration is successful in its attempt to eliminate this segment of our economy it could have farreaching and perhaps disastrous effects. Mr. Speaker. this hike was even anticipated by our commercial banks who raised their basic interest rates to 5 percent last week. The effect of these increased rates has been to make it difficult if not impossible for a small businessman to secure necessary loans to conduct his normal business operation. It has increased his cost to the place where all of his normal profits have been diverted into the hands of bankers through increased interest rates. Corporations are able to provide necessary financing regardless of interest rates through the issuance of bonds or stocks in the markets but the small businessman is forced on bended knees to beg the local bankers for even this expensive money.

I believe such a change in policy to be very dangerous. indeed. and I thank my colleague. who apparently received the same impression that I did from the Secretarys interview. The clear implication was that the Secretary of Defense virtually rules out the concept of a limited conflict and the possible use of conventional forces. should the access road to Berlin be closed. Certainly that is the strong impression that I received. As Mr. Reston. of the New York Times. so ably pointed out. that represents a reversal of our timehonored policy of trying to keep all conflicts in the limited war category and to use conventional forces. rather than allout hydrogen warfare. with its catastrophic results. The only sane policy for the United States to follow is to prevent. rather than trigger. such a conflict. I am alarmed by the growing evidence of the administrations neglect of our conventional ground forces. discussed so ably yesterday by the Senator from Mississippi . I submit that not only do we lack adequate forces to meet local emergencies. but we are not developing the airlift capability required to insure that we can rapidly and efficiently apply conventional forces at points of danger. That is why the distinguished Senator from Missouri . formerly the Secretary of the Air Force. not only has spoken eloquently. but also succeeded in having $140 million added to the appropriations made last yearas a result of his recognition of this very grave deficiency in our airlift capabilities. A flagrant example of the failure to appreciate the importance of our military airlift potential is the postponement of the tactical airlift exerciseswhich were to be conducted jointly by the Military Air Transport Service and the Army. this monthdue to lack of operational and maintenance funds in the MATS budget. Now I yield to my distinguished colleague from Missouri.",

Certainly. all the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not think the airlift we now have available is adequate. I should like to ask the Senator from Oklahoma if it is not possible that one of the reasons why the Secretary of Defense was forced to fall back to the theory of massive retaliation. as he did in last Sundays telecast. was that he knows that our Army is neither mobile nor modernized. By \"mobile\" I mean capable of being moved by air. with their combat equipment and their support.

The President in his press conference opposed the cries on the floor of the Senate for even a slight mobilization of our Reserves and for a discontinuance of the reduction of the Marine Corps. about which the able Senator from Missouri has spoken. as being saber rattling.

The final trip of papers was made in rowboats to the offices on State Street in Hartford. During the 1938 hurricane. the paper was published by candlelight. With the rise of naziism. the Ledger assumed new importance. filling a vital need to inform Connecticut Jewry of the new dangers and problems abroad. Wartime presented the problems of a big drop in advertising and a sholtage of newsprint. But the Hartford Jewish Ledger overcame this hurdle. too. Publisher Samuel Neusner. who founded the paper. suffered a heart attack in October 1945 but remained active. He is now inactive due to illness. He used the Ledger as an instrument of Zionism in the fight for an independent Jewish A5398 state in Palestine. He obtained support from newspapers in the Connecticut Valley in this battle. In the first issue of the Ledger. Mr. Neusner said it was founded to give Connecticut Jewry local means of recording its life and voicing its need. and to make known the interests and institutions of the Jewish communities in the region. The paper also was designed to mirror the movements in Jewry. the religion. the thought. the literature of the Jewish people. Palestine and its romance. the Diaspora and its needs.

Conflicts of law is one of the most vexatious subjects in the whole field of jurisprudence. Those who have. over the years given attention to conflicts of law have struggled with comity. the obligations imposed by the doctrine of full faith and credit and the relationship between the States and the Federal Government in those fields wherein each is competent to act. In recent years. the Nelson case and others like it have given thoughtful lawyers pause. Certainly. the courts let stand for too long the impression that by the Nelson case the States were disarmed from protecting themselves against subversion. If H.R. 3 sought only to make clear the power of the people to defend themselves through their governments against subversion. it would have a laudable purpose. Undoubtedly. clearcut legislation aimed at the problem of subversion and the interpretation of laws concerning that crime would receive unanimous support in this body. When. however. H.R. 3 aims not at subversive activities but seeks in two pages to restate the law of conflicts as devolved through 150 years of jurisprudence it leaves the field of constructive legislation and sows confusion in the fields where clarity and general understanding have characterized the law for years. Every interstate carrier. every packer and processor of food. every importer and exporter of goods. will be threatened with a relitigation of legal relationships which have been accepted as the law based on scores of decisions. If there is a corn on our jurisprudential tob. let us not seek to relieve the pain by amputating the leg at the hip. If the sponsors of. H.R. 3 truly seek to define the respective interests of the States and of the Federal Government in the field of subversive activities. let them. by direct and positive action propose legislation so aimed. and they will find multitudes of supporters where they now meet opposition.

The good that youth accomplishes is lost in the glaring headlines of juvenile gang fights and shocking disclosures of horrible incidents. which. if performed by adults. would be serious crimes. It was a refreshing experience to hear a young man plead eloquently for the cause of youth and an understanding of its accomplishments and an appreciation of its problems. The following valedictory remarks by Mr. Paolini in the presence of several public officials. the schools principal. Mr. Maurice Bleifeld. the assistant superintendent. Miss Marion Clark. I am sure will prove as inspiring and informative to the readers as it was to the listeners:",

The capacity of this interceptor shall be sufficient to serve not only the airport itself. but the anticipated population growth of the surrounding area as well. The seweage is to be conducted to the District of Columbia treatment plant. located at the southernmost point of the city on the Potomac River. Thus. for the first time. a means will be provided to eliminate all contamination from the Potomac River above the intakes for the District of Columbia water supply. both for the present and for the foreseeable future. This project is to be accomplished with a $3 million contribution from the Federal Government for the initial part of the work. and a loan of $25 million from the U.S. Treasury. This loan is to be repaid with interest over a period of 40 years. Such debt payments. plus all costs of operation and maintenance of the sewer. are to be paid from fees charged to the users of the facility. which will include several Federal Government installations. These charges are to be received by and disbursed from a metropolitan area sanitary works fund. which is provided for in the bill for that purpose. This plan distributes the burden of financing fairly and equitably among the localities which will benefit from the interceptor. and maintains at the same time a degree of participation by the Federal Government commensurate with its responsibility to those localities in connection with the project. The Committee on the District of Columbia of the House of Representatives unanimously endorsed this bill. and as chairman of that committee I am pleased indeed to recommend it to the Congress.",

We have pending before the Committee on Public Works an additional and supplemental bill to provide for additional sewagedisposal facilities in the District of Columbia. I call the attention of the Members to this additional bill so that the bill now pending before the Comrfittee of the Whole will not be confused with the bill which we hope to have before the House in the not too distant future. These two measures. the one involving the Dulles International Airport. now pending before the House today. and the one providing for the plan C system. pending before the Committee on Public Works. will take care of only the initial steps to insure that the water supply for the Nations Capital and the surrounding communities be safeguarded for the future. Having adopted these two measures as starting efforts only. there must be brought to the Congress in future years programs for still more basic. fundamental. and largescale sewage facilities needed here in the Capital.

The Senate District Committee has acted just as expeditiously as the House committee in reporting an equivalent bill to the other body. which I am certain will act just as favorably on this important measure. We are all cognizant of the everincreasing need for Dulles International Airport due for the most part to the rapid replacement of conventional aircraft by jetpowered planes combined with the everincreasing air traffic which the other nearby airfields will soon find impossible to handle. The jets are barred from the use of the nearby National Airport for a variety of practical reasons. the main one being limited landing area. An important problem that came up in the construction plans for the Dulles Airport was how to get rid of sewage without polluting the District of Columbia water supply. This bill. H.R. 12063. solves this vital problem. The bill also allows for the usage of the sewage system by the everexpanding suburban areas touching on the District. The other day. I flew over the construction site of the marvelous Dulles Airport in a singlemotored plane. To me it was a beautiful picture. On the highways. the trip to the new airport from the Nations Capital should not take more than 20 to 30 minutes. The airport will service jets coming and going to and from all points of the globe. Needless to say. at present we must travel the distance to Baltimores Friendship Airport for jet travel. I think it is wonderful that we had this concept of a fine airport to effectively service the Nations Capital and I commend Mr. BROYHILL. and the other gentleman from Virginia and Maryland. on their exhaustive efforts in behalf of this highly beneficial project.",

It has been a troublesome question and has been under consideration ever since the construction of the airport began because it was discovered then that there was no place to put the sewage without running it into the Potomac River. This bill comes to us approved by the Bureau of the Budget after months of consideration. It was unanimously approved by a joint subcommittee of the District of Columbia of the House and Senate. It was unanimously approved by the House committee. It is one of the things that has to be done and done pretty soon to purify the water supply of the District of Columbia. I might say on the Virginia side. Alexandria has constructed its own sewage treatment plant in which the county of Fairfax is now participating under a lease agreement. The county of Arlington has constructed its own sewage treatment plant which is now in operation and will doubtless have to be enlarged. This project. if carried out. will provide for the sewage from Dulles Airport to be transferred across the river to the Blue Plains sewage treatment plant. It also will provide for those areas along the Potomac up to the intake of the District of Columbia water supply system. It is a very essential thing. and I hope it will be the pleasure of the House to pass the bill.",

The Senator from South Dakota very kindly said that without my efforts the bill would not have come to fruition. Mr. President. without the efforts of the Senator from South Dakota the bill never would have survived the many rugged experiences of the legislative hammering and compromise to which it was subjected. The friends of the TVA in the valley were tremendously cooperative. The members of the committee on both sides. Democrats and Republicans alike. could be named individually. I would name one or two. but I must not do so because there are so many who worked hard and time does not permit the naming of all of them. All gave of their time. effort. and sincere devotion to the development of the legislation which has now been signed by the President. the last main objection to which will be removed when the House passes S. 2471.",

I find in one case the bill was supported. and in the other case it was opposed because of the retirement provision. I still believe that the kind of retirement provision provided for is faulty and bad. If we can apply this procedure to 1.500 or 1.600 persons who are on a private payrollif they can be insinuated into or kept in the retirement system of the Federal Governmentwe can do it with regard to 100.000 persons. I am afraid the proposed action would establish a bad precedent. However. I am not insensible to the difficulties which confronted the committee in this matter. because it is very desirable to dispose of these institutions and to put them into private hands.

Some of the trucks carry only one log. and require a special guide car to warn motorists that a wider than highway limit load Is following. Others may carry a load equivalent to several small trees. The species include Douglasfir. western hemlock. sitka spruce. ponderosa pine. white pine. white firs. cedars. lodgepole pine and many other lesser known varieties. I have long marveled at the great variety of products made from these logs which vary so widely in size and type of wood. It is evident that the Forest Products Laboratory. which does our Federal utilization research on wood. has dealt with a broad and complex field during these past 50 years. The timber industries are not the only ones who benefit from work of the laboratory. During the past few years the laboratory has collaborated with the Agricultural Research Service in improving the engineering design of palletized field boxes used for harvesting apples and other crops. Some excellent designs have already been developed through this joint effort. I am also grateful to the laboratory for the advances it has made in use of wood in the home. The warmth of wood makes it a favorite material in home construction. The development of better finishes and paints for wood. better ways to protect wood from insects. decay and fire. and more economical ways of using wood for the structural parts of the home are of great value to all home owners and prospective builders. I subscribe to the principle of \"wise use\" expounded by the Forest Service. The development of economic processes to use all of the products of the forest should be an important part of the job. I am sure that the Forest Service can rise to the challenge in its Forest Products Laboratory.

I would like to call to the attention of the House of Representatives a bill I introduced today to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 so as to provide that lawful expenditures for legislative purposes shall be allowed as deductions from gross income. The Internal Revenue Service recently published a regulation which attempts to define the type of \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense that may be deductible for Federal tax purposes when such expenses involve socalled legislative activities. This regulation. which was published on December 29. 1959. holds that business expenses are not a justified tax expense if for \"lobbying purposes. or the promotion or defeat of legislation. for political campaign purposes (including the support of or opposition to any candidate for public office). or for carrying on propaganda (including advertising) relating to any of the foregoing purposes.\" These broad. ambiguous terms are not defined in the regulation and therefore there are no guidelines either for the Government or for affected taxpayers to determine what type of activities in this area may be covered. Because of these ambiguities. there is widespread concern that such administrative interpretation may have the effect of inhibiting freedom of expression of views on matters of government. With the ever expanding impact of government activities. at all levels of government. in the daily lives of our citizens. any action that may curtail the freedom of expression of views on such matters should be examined very carefully. Our Constitution expressly guarantees the rights of free speech and a free press and the right to petition the Congress. The tax laws should not be invoked as an indirect means of curtailing any of these basic freedoms of expression. The Congress should immediately undertake a review of the problems raised by this regulation for it appears that the only appropriate clarification can come through congressional action. Any action of the Government that affects a persons business or right to do business should be a permissible tax expense. Congress should express this philosophy in clarifying legislation that makes it absolutely clear that it is the \"sharply defined national policy\" to encourage and not to repress freedom of expression.

The States involved could enter into compacts. as some States have done with respect to regional education. for instance. When I was Governor of South Carolina. my State entered into a compact with a number of other States with respect to regional education. Five States were joined in that compact. I believe the problem of mass transportation is one on which the States should work together. The great preponderance of the problem rests in the urban areas of each State. A few highways may cross from one State to another. but the main purpose of the bill. as I construe it. is to help the urban areas to provide for transportation studies and to help solve them.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in reply to the statement made by the Senator from New York about making loans to the railroads. let me state that the theory for that. as I understood it. was that they were vital and essential to the national defense. In short. in the event of emergency. the railroads will be needed for transportation from one side of the country to the other. they will be needed to haul troops. equipment. and materiel. That was also the main argument which was advanced when this mass transportation program was brought forward. A similar argument was made in regard to the highway system and the program for itnamely. that the highways are needed in order to provide transportation across the Nationfrom north to south. and from east to westin order to haul equipment. tanks. troops. and other necessary items in the event of an emergency. In fact. I predict that perhaps they will also be needed to facilitate the hauling of missiles. because I believe it will not be too long before we shall have transportable bases for missiles. That factor is highly important. because the Communists could zero in on our missile bases. Just as we have the Polaris submarines. which are movable bases under the water. if we have movable bases for our missiles. they can move up and down the highway and up and down the railroad. In that way the Communists will not be able to zero in on them. There is no question in my mind that the railroads and the interstate highways are essential to our national defense. That was thetheory on which. as I understood. the Federal Government entered this field. Someone has said the cities need help. I certainly do not deny there is help needed. There is no question that the cities probably need help. But I say there is only one of two ways to do it: One is to let the cities or States finance and provide for it. and the other is to amend the Constitution of the United States to delegate this field to the National Government. It has never been delegated. and therefore it is reserved to the States. For those reasons. I think it is clear that the National Government does not have authority to go into this field. Furthermore. we do not have the money. if we desired to do it.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in regard to the matter which is under consideration today. the supplemental airlines justly deserve the major share of the credit for developing lowfare air travel. Right now. with authority to fly 10 regular scheduled flights between any 2 cities in the United States. they find themselves in the position of bringing air travel to many people who could not normally afford to fly. Although the equipment used for these flights are DC6s. DC6Bs. and Constellations. the same type aircraft still in use by the big airlines. the interiors are not expensively decorated. and the cabins are arranged for volume seating in keeping with CAB and FAA regulations. The advertising budgets and other promotional costs are trimmed to accommodate not much more than flight schedules. There is nothing elaborate or \"plush\" about supplemental air travel. but the safety record for this type air service has been remarkable since its origin. and the price has been kept within the reach of people who must look for economy. Just last week the big airlines were granted a 2/2 percent. plus $1 per seat. rate increase. I am not questioning the merits of this decision by the CAB. but I certainly cannot see any harm in keeping alive a slight suggestion of competition for the big lines. As I understand it. the supplemental airlines civilian ticketed business represents less than 1 percent of all the civilian ticketed business in the air transportation industry. Because of the flexibility of their certificated authority. these supplemental air carriers currently provide prompt air service to the Department of Defense for the movement of troops. The system used represents the only tried and proven readymade airlift. geared to respond to an emergency in a matter of hours. These airlines have not been subsidized by the Government. They had to match sound management. efficiency. and vision against the many obstacles of a pioneer business. I think the Congress will do well for our national defense. the air transportation industry. and the system of free enterprise and competition. to encourage the supplemental airlines. especially when all that is required of Congress is simply to back up the CAB after its 8 years of hearings.",

I shall make a very brief explanation of what the joint resolution provides. and I shall be happy and willing to answer any questions that may be asked of me by my colleagues concerning the joint resolution. As a preface to my remarks. I will state that some time ago a bill was introduced which provided for the granting of free time during the campaign period to the presidential and vice presidential nominees at certain specified times each week up to the time of the election. We held hearings on that bill before our committee. and it became quite evident that the time was rather premature for that type of mandatory legislation. Pursuant to a suggestion. I introduced the joint resolution. which provides that broadcasters shall be relieved of their obligations under the socalled equaltime provision of section 315 of the Communications Act. The representatives of the three major networks appeared before our committee and testified that they would be willing to assume this responsibility on a voluntary basis. They had already conferred with their affiliates and had organized in their own minds a plan which they thought would be satisfactory. It was one which they could and would carry out. provided they were relieved of the responsibility and the obligations under the equaltime provisions of the law. If the joint resolution is passed. all we shall have provided is that from now on until the next election in November broadcasters may grant free time to the nominees of the major parties for the offices of President and Vice President without being obliged to grant the same opportunity to all other candidates of all other parties for those two particular offices. The joint resolution is a rather indirect way of accomplishing this purpose. but it is the only way it can be done. In short. if the joint resolution is adopted. we shall free the lroadcasters from the equaltime provisions of section 315 so that they can inaugurate their voluntary plan to grant free time to the nominees of the major parties for the offices of President and Vice President.",

This is a serious amendment. If we take 40 percent of the telephone tax and divert it to States. $185 million is involved. Forty percent of various other types of taxes might then be diverted to States also. The office of the Secretary of the Treasury has sufficient problems already without trying to add to them with this type of legislation. There may be a time when the general telephone tax will be dropped. If and when the general telephone tax is dropped. then the suggestion which was made a while ago of picking it up within the States and using it for certain purposes may then be timely. I believe the Senator from Utah made a very proper point in saying that the recommendations which were quoted were recommendations made in exchange for something else. The Treasury Department has responsibilities. If it is relieved of this source of revenue. then certain other funds can be taken away from the Treasury Department that they have been using to meet those responsibilities. As long as the trade is not made. action cannot be taken unilaterally. If we were suddenly to say. \"We will give 40 percent of the telephone tax to the States ready to receive it.\" New York State may be the only State which has passed legislation in the field. I think it is not. but if it were the only State. and word went out that 40 percent of the telephone tax was going back to the State of New York. how long would it take legislators of other States to pass bills to receive 40 percent of the Federal taxes in their States. as well? They could or could not. as they wished. under the amendment now before the Senate. make provision for any type of education. In fact. the amendment does not require them to spend one penny for education. They could use all the money for roads or schools or for the policing of highways. or on anything to which they may wish to devote it.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the amendment provides for the withholding of taxes on interest on dividends. and provides for a withholding tax of 20 percent. It would raise $1 billion. on the basis of conservative. competent. authoritative estimates made by economists of very high reputation. The $1 billion is money which the Government now legally owns. It is money which the U.S. Treasury should be receiving. but which it is unable to collect because of the avoidance of the payment of income tax on interest and dividends. The amendment has been very carefully prepared. based on the experience of a number of years. It is based. as a matter of fact. on studies which go back more than 40 years. Very few persons realize that when the first income tax law was passed in the United States in 1913. provision was made for a withholding tax on interest. The only reason why there was not a withholding tax on dividends was that dividends were exempt from the income tax. However. for 3 years there was a withholding tax on interest. and it worked. In 1941 and 1942. when consideration was given to a withholding tax on wages. the House provided for a withholding tax on dividends and interest and sent the measure to the Senate. The Senate killed it. In 1950. again. the House passed a withholding tax on interest and dividends. after the Committee on Ways and Means had approved it. But when the bill came to the Senate. the Senate killed it. The same thing happened in 1951.",

I am thinking. for example. of Federal savings and loan institutions. private savings and loan institutions. and credit banks. and in my own State there are other types of specialized banks. Those who invest in those banks to a great extent are not people who fall within the generalization I just mentioned. On the other hand. quite to the contrary. there are people who save $5 a month or perhaps $10 a month from their salaries. and put that money into a savings and loan association or a credit bank of some kind. Then they proceed to draw a little interest on it. and they let the interest ride and compound. That is a method of saving which in this country generally has supplanted the method used at the beginning of the century. when people would put most of their savings into savings accounts in banks. Since that is the situation. I see that the amendment provides that 20 percent shall be withheld. which is the minimum amount. I am thinking about all of the people who have saved just a little bit of money. I am sure in numbers they far surpass those who have saved substantial amounts. Those who have saved a little bit depend upon the small amount of interest to add to their pensions. whether they be private or Government pensions. I refer to people who are barely living on a subsistence level. who are just getting along. They are the great rank and file of our people. Then all of a sudden we come along with an amendment like this and we take 20 percent out of what income they get from that source. and they have to justify getting it back from the Government. I am sure the Senator is conscientious and realizes this problem just as much as I do. and probably more. because he was the one who drafted the amendment.

The fact is that in the case of this bill the interest and dividend refunding is faster than wage and salary refunding. Instead of annual refunding. as in the case of wages. there will be quarterly refunding. I was discussing this question a little earlier with another Senator who was concerned with the same problem with which the Senator from Colorado is concerned. He concluded that the inconvenience to the people would be only for the first quarter. provided the income was consistent. I should say for the first 3 months at the very most. After that the refund would compensate. and the dividend or interest recipient would be in exactly the same position as before. The inconvenience to the individual would be very slight and transient. and it would be equitable because he would be in the same position the wage earner is in. People with small interest income. even older people. receive more income from wages earned than from interest or dividends. However. the Senator from Colorado has an excellent point.

As a matter of fact. the uniform experience is that. certainly. the average person making a salary of up to $5.000 or $10.000. by using the standard form of deduction which the Government allows him. can get a far bigger deduction than he can if he itemizes his deductions. So as a consequence. most people utilize the deductions. Therefore. the rather small wage earner may or may not have a deduction made. depending upon the size of his family and depending upon the size of his income.

There was a $250 million authorization for the 1959 program. which requires an appropriation of $241.5 million to meet the estimated commitments under it. Last year we authorized $375 million for the soil bank. and this bill carries only $340 million to meet the program and operating costs.

Last year. for the soil bank program we authorized $375 million. and appropriated $200 million. and only about $145 million of this will be needed to meet actual costs of contracts payments and administrative expenses. About $30 million was transferred for pay and other costs. and about $20 million of the sum remaining will be carried forward to fiscal 1960.

We cut out some of the milliondollar pyaments under the soil bank program by providing a $5.000 ceiling. I commend the committee for carrying that ceiling forward and for even tightening it up. That will save some money for the taxpayers. I think the ceiling which we put in the bill yesterday by providing a $50.000 limitation will save a lot of money for the taxpayers.

But if the entire $450 million were authorized. and if the Department were able to enter into contractswhich it has never been able to dofor the full amount of the authorization. I would support an appropriation in that amount. I would do so because that is the only farm program today which actually reaches the farmer and assures him of getting some good from it.

LYNDON JOHNSON. who has stated his wholehearted support of the plan. Secretary of the Interior Seaton has recommended that this legislation be adopted at this session. and has promised to earmark $8 million for expenditures on the development within the next 5 years. if Congress will enact the bill at this session. With the overwhelming support lined up for the project. a plan to preserve 88 miles of Americas longest. southernmost open beach for public use it seems certain that a national recreation area will ultimately be set up on Padre Island. But there is a tendency in some quarters to put it off until next year. This is. in my judgment. a costly attitude and one which will inevitably result in the park costing more money than is necessary. * Each passing year. with private development of portions of the island. the remaining property which we need for public recreation facilities becomes more valuable. Consequently. it will cost more for the Government to secure It. I urge the Congress to act to establish the park on Padre Island this year so we can get this property while the price is relatively low. I have already mentioned the fact that corporations are buying up large tracts of land on the island. Salesmen are going out across the country selling lots from these large tracts. All of this will mean that the price of the land will go up tremendously if the project is long delayed.

That the country whose citizen I am celebrates the 110th birthday of Thomas Masaryk makes me proud. while at the same time I feel sad that his native land. under Communist rule. suppresses and even abuses this very memory. For Thomas Masaryk is a man of the universal world. esteemed as one of the apostles of democracy in much the same way that we esteem Washington and Lincoln. His philosophy of humanism is a sublime. beautiful. and infinitely higher concept than Communist materialism that has replaced it. with its dedication to class struggle. the cruelty of which has horrified us and filled us with disgust. Think of Masaryks motto. Truth Prevails. and is it not far superior to the Communist principle that the ends always justify the means. \"As long as Czechoslovakia adhered. and was able to adhere to these great Ideals of Masaryks. it was an island of peace and a prospering state. Democratic Czechoslovakia was also the closest friend and a faithful partner of the United States of America. which contributed so much to her freedom. during the First as well as during the Second World War. \"I trust that I will live to see the day when the United States of America will again be able to consider Czechoslovakia among its closest partners and friends. when no citizen of Czechoslovakia will be intimidated to speak openly Thomas Masaryks name. and when in his native land as well as in the rest of the world he will again be held as the PresidentLiberatorthe Father of his Country.\"",

Time has not changed the meaning of Masaryks teaching. His words are as alive as when they were written many years ago. Masaryk believed that theory and practice were necessary to each other. He wanted politicians to be philosophers and wanted philosophers in politics. in touch with the people. Thus when we call Masaryk a democrat. we mean he was a theoretician of democracy and a practicing democrat as well. Whatever he wrote or preached he carried out to the utmost. During the First World War. Masaryk wrote a treatise called New Europe. In it he set out a plan for federalization that the nations of Europe are now40 years laterthinking of seriously. Masaryk knew better than Hitler that Europe could not be united by force. because her free people abhorred force. The Europe of today. divided along the Elbe River. is just the opposite of what Masaryk understood as unification. It is contrary to his ideal because that unification was accomplished by the Soviet Union by force and suppression of freedom. Still. Masaryks effort was not in vain. Those who know the history realize that progress marches at a slow and heavy pace and that each step demands new .sacrifices and new strife. Some daywhen a free Europe will be firmly established in a free worldMasaryks name shall be one of the main milestones along the road to a better political future. Masaryk was a great philosopher on a small post of Europe. The world did not rise in protest when this post collapsed after he died. Yet his post was in the heart of Europe. and Europe cannot be united without its heart. Neither Munich nor the usurpation of Prague by Communists after the Second World War. was a solution for Europe. We believe. as Masaryk. that the people of Eastern Europe will never be content until they take their place in freedom with the nations of the world.",

Liberty was not long enjoyed by the Czechs. however. as they with many of their neighbors came under the domination of the Soviet Union.

Today marks the 110th anniversary of Masaryks birth. Thomas Masaryks life began in an era when the Czech people endured under a great empire based in Vienna. Today they endure under another great empire. based in Moscow. That Czechoslovakia enjoyed any moment in the sun as a free nation was in a large measure due to the genius and determination of Thomas Masaryk. His devotion to Czech independence. and his tireless efforts to see it established. bore fruit in May 1918. when the United States expressed its sympathy with his great ideal. The other Allied Powers soon joined in that resolution. and on November 14. 1918. Thomas Masaryk was elected first President of Czechoslovakia. Masaryk was. in a real sense. more than a nationalist. he was a friend of human rights and an apostle of human dignity. In a time when these rights are everywhere denied. and that dignity assailed. it is appropriate that we pay tribute to one of their great protectors in the past.",

Through centuries of hope. at last. on October 28. 1918. Czechoslovakia achieved its independence. It came through leaders of superlative character and skill. Thomas Masaryk. the first President. was a Slovak. the son of a coachman. The first Premier and the last free President was Eduard Benes. a Czech. the son of a peasant. For 20 years. Czechoslovakia possessed freedom and proved itself a nation of deep. practical. and successful democracy. The bright memories of that score of years still stimulate the hearts that now chafe under the Communist sway. Czechoslovakia has cause to be suspicious. resentful. and bitter. The betrayal of Munichthe German butchery of Lidicethe deceit of Moscow are deep wounds in the hopes of a determined people.

My amendment would still continue an element of the \"double standard\" for it requires approval only for projects or programs involving an aggregate expenditure of foreignaid funds of $1 million.

I should like to call to the attention of Senators a copy of a letter which is on the desks. It is signed by the Acting Secretary of State. and relates to another matter which will come up later. I believe that Members of the Senate should have an opportunity to consider this letter during the next few hours. It does not relate to the pending amendment. It relates to the Douglas amendment that we discussed last Thursday. There is very little difference between the pending amendment and the one which has just been turned down by the Senate. It would require an administrative procedure which would make the program unworkable. That is my view. That was the view of the committee. That is the view of the State Department. It would make the program unworkable. Under existing law. section 517 of the Mutual Security Act requires completion of cost estimates and engineering plans prior to obligation of funds for projects. Section 202(b) requires the Development Loan Fund to take technical and economic feasibility of proposed projects into account before approving projects. Section 103 of the Mutual Security Appropriation Act. 1960. requires a determination of feasibility of water and related land resource projects in accordance with domestic standards and criteria. The proposal of the Senator from Alaska would operate to bring each project to the committees in Congress and have it gone over in the same way that we go over every dam in Washington and every flood control project in Arkansas. for example. It is utterly and completely unnecessary. If one is against the bill and does not want the bill. the adoption of such an amendment would be one way to destroy it. I do not wish to comment on the motives of the proposer. but he always has voted against the mutual security bill and is against the bill. This is one way to destroy it. It is that simple.

The loose manner in which some of these foreign public works is undertaken is Inexcusable. It is fantastic and ridiculous. Some of these projects are proposed left and right and cannot possibly be justified. yet we are asked to agree to them without even knowing what they are. I venture the guess that the chairman of the committee cannot tell us how many projects costing more than a million dollars have been planned for construction with foreign aid money right now. I do not know the number. I doubt that anyone in Congress knows. If flood control or navigation projects are proposed for construction in our own country. it takes on the average about 8 years before they are authorized. and before the first dollar of construction money is appropriated. Such projects must first be studied and approved by the district engineer. then by the Board of Engineers. then by the Bureau of the Budget. and then by Congress. After the American public works projects have been carefully studied. Congress authorizes the money for their construction. and later Congress begins to appropriate the money. I was informed last year that about half of the foreign aid public works projects have been abandoned before completion. That represents a fantastic waste of money. Why should not Congress carefully examine each of the proposed projects? The Committee on Public Works carefully examines and selects the projects which it recommends for construction. but the Committee on Foreign Relations simply proposes to give all the money which is asked for the construction of projects abroad. All the amendment really seeks to do is to require that Congress be apprised of the cost of each of these fantastic projects before we authorize the spending of millions of dollars for their construction. and before we end by finding out that half of the projects for which we have spent money have been abandoned. All the amendment provides is that if we are to spend more than a million dollars. we will at least know what the project is and will examine into it first.

    "speech": "I should like to make a comment in cornection with the mutual security program. to which I generally subscribe. My comment is predicated upon a letter I received from the Reverend Anton Merkun. His letter is written in Slovenian. He says: YouR ExcELLENcy: I am very nearly blind. I cannot hear. I have a heart sickness. I have sugar diabetes. It is with great difficulty that I write. Badly do I need money which is in Yugoslavia. I will be thankful to you if you can be of any help. He attaches to his letter a form letter which obviously has been addressed to various Members of Congress. It reads as follows: I am an American citizen. and your constituent. and I am turning to you for your kind assistance. I have real property in Yugoslavia. and although I cannot get any income from the property or make any disposition of the same for several years. I still am the owner of the land registered. and I hope that the intervention of the Department of State would help us to protect our ownership. In December of last year the Yugoslav Government finally issued a law on nationalization. by which all apartment houses and building lots in cities were nationalized. and a ridiculous compensation was set up. of 10 percent of the present rent. payable each year. for 50 years. So I shall get at least 10 percent of the rent. as the owner of my property. but not as compensation. Other statements are made in the letter. but I shall not read them. I believe some consideration should be given the fact that the Yugoslav Government has confiscated the property. and. as compensation.. has said. \"We will give you. each year. 10 percent of the rental value. for a period of 50 years. at which time your rights come to an end.\" I hope our State Department will give heed to what I have said. That development is nationalization of the very worst type. Ten percent of the rent is the annual compensation for 50 years. and nothing else. My sympathy goes out to Rev. Anton Merkun. I know the man. He is in his eighties. Here he is in his country. with his property confiscated. left helpless and sick. While we are giving aid to Yugoslavia. that country is taking their property away without compensation.",

Its one of the oldest. and certainly among the most basic. of all branches of engineering. charged with the vital task of seeking out and recovering the mineral raw materials of industry and defense. But in the midst of all the ballyhoo over rocketry and spaceage science. mining engineering apparently has lost much of its allure. This year. throughout the Nation. only 208 new mining engineers received their first degrees (usually bachelor of science). according to the Engineering Manpower Commission. That compared with 469 only 8 years ago. Total first degrees in all branches of engineering exceeded 35.000 annually in recent years. It is true that most other engineering branches also posted declines from the levels of the early 1950s. when graduation rolls were swelled by veterans finishing their work under the GI bill. But no branch had anywhere near the drop experienced by mining.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I do not intend to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment. I may say for the information of the Senate. What this amendment will do is suspend the duties on the importation of casein. as now provided in the bill. for 1 year from last March 31. I offer the amendment for two reasons: First. so the Congress will have the opportunity of reviewing this matter again next year. Soybean research continues. and the soybean industry feels that it will have an almost complete substitute for industrial casein within the next 3 years. I. therefore. feel that in fairness to this great industry. Congress should permit it to come before us again next year. tell us the progress they are making. and then let us decide whether the suspension should continue. based on this report and testimony from the other industries affected. Second. I propose this amendment. Mr. President. for a reason I stated earlier. The committee was told by the large users of casein that they are using as much casein as they possibly can at the present time. and that they would like to have a domestic product which they could depend on. However. threats of economic reprisals have been made by these users against manufacturers of isolated soya protein because of their opposition to a suspension of the duty on casein. I think Congress should review this matter again next year and determine whether or not the casein users made their statements about the use of isolated soya protein in good faith. I believe this is a good amendment and that. in fairness to the industry affected. it should be approved.",

H.R. 7947. as passed by the House. provided that taxpayers could treat as a cost of doing business the loss that they were required to incur in purchasing at par certain stock of the Federal National Mortgage AssociationFNMAas a condition for doing business with that association. The loss would be measured by the difference between the par value of the stock which the taxpayer is required to pay and the current market value. The Senate substantially accepted the House bill but modified the application of the bill with respect to cases prior to the current taxable year. In substance. the Senate amendment provided that for taxable years between 1954 and 1960 the loss incurred on these purchases of FNMA stock would be treated as ordinary and necessary business expenses rather than as capital losses if the taxpayer had claimed these losses as business deduction and before the date of the enactment of the bill the taxpayer has not paid up any deficiency attributable to his treatment of the loss. The new treatment would also apply under the Senate amendment with respect to any taxpayer who on his initial return treated the FNMA stock transaction as a capital item but then later applied for and received a refund on the basis treating it as a business expense deduction. The substance of these amendments is to make the new treatment applicable to all prior years covered by the 1954 code to the extent that this will not involve refunds from the Treasury. In addition to this. the Senate amendment made the new provision fully applicable only with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1. 1960. whereas the House bill was fully applicable with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1. 1959. This part of the amendment was made necessary by the delay in the passage of the bill. The House conferees accepted these Senate amendments.",

Neither your intemperate characterl7ations. your threat to get me nor your erroneous assumptions concerning my study of the measure impress me as worthy of a high official of a powerful labor organization. No representative of the National Association of Manufacturers or the chamber of commerce \"pressured\" me or even contacted me.

I heard nothing from you or your unionbut would have welcomed any proof you could submit--as I requested of the other union officialsthat specific language in any of the various bills would hamper legitimate organizational and collective bargaining activitles of unions. My conception of the duty of a legislator requires more than simply voting by labels or adjectives unsupported by fact and logic. Requiring democratic procedures and honesty In handling funds In labor organizations cannot possibly harm the rank and file union member. though it may well curb dictatorial officials insensitive to their position of trust with respect to the rights and the funds of those they represent. Shielding innocent third parties. managers. employees and consumers. from being drawn into someone elses labor dispute and preventing \"sweetheart\" contracts and representation not actually desired by the free choice of employees are reforms demonstrated by the McClellan Committee Investigations to be necessary and should not impair legitimate union activities. Consequently. it is a misrepresentation to describe legislation designed to achieve these goals and no other as \"punitive.\" \"repressive\" or \"killer\" legislation. I believe my colleagues. like myself. are far more likely to be impressed by logic than by threats. To assist in advising the working men and women of my district on this very important issue.

I was amazed to find that people generally were only concerned with and aware offarm subsidy. Coming from a city district. it was unpopular for me to support high farm price levels. However. in so doing. I pointed out that business generally prospered from subsidies by vastly greater amounts than did the farmer. In fact. the farmer looks like a \"piker\" in comparison. Although 90 to 100 percent of parity may not be the answer to the farmers dilemma. it is the best program at the moment. I do. however. sincerely hope that this Congress will come up with a better answer so the farmer can prosper along with the rest of society. I am mindful of the fact that the farmer is a great consumer of factorymade goods. hence provides substantial employment in cities like the one I represent. In making my position clear. I have stated publicly I would support the elimination of all farmprice subsidies if all other subsidies. both direct and indirect were likewise eliminated. I still maintain that position. and do not while so doing. consider vital defense work a subsidy.. In reflecting on this subject.

We must look to the future that our survival in the field of international commercial air transport should not be imperiled by the operations of the heavily subsidized airlines of foreign countries. It is difficult enough for American free enterprise to compete in a field where subsidized foreign aviation has a free reign. The inexcusable thing is to see U.S. free enterprise being stifled by its own Government. It is the clearly announced policy of the Congress. as set forth in the Civil Aeronautics Act. to fnrther the promotion and development of American air transportation systems both at home and abroad.

I recently had the honor of acting as moderator of a panel of outstanding scientists and experts who discussed \"Weather Modification and Space Exploration\" at the 46th Annual Convention of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress. meeting here in Washington. I consider the Information provided by the three sneakers so important and timely that I would like to make summaries of their remarks more generally available. One of these papers is presented herewith. It summarizes the address of Capt. Howard T. Orville. U.S. Navy. retired. whose long career in meteorology includes his chairmanship of the important Advisory Committee on Weather Control. and whose report of this Committee is the Nations basic document in this field. Captain Orvilles summary follows: From time immemorial man has dreamed of controlling the weather. His efforts have encompassed three principal areas: religious ceremonies. mysterious rites and rain dances. and scientific research. Scientific research has yielded some potentially important findings during the past 12 years in particular. Weather modification using these techniques promises to be one of our most important sources of water supplies in the future. Small scale cloudseeding efforts are already producing limited but important increases in snow pack in the western States. Progress reports of research now underway at the University of Chicago. the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Arizona.. and the Santa Barbara project in California are most encouraging. Increases in precipitation of 10 to 25 percent with new and improved techniques for observing the results are not uncommon. The Navys effort in developing new techniques with the use of carbon black are indicative of the importance of weather modification. military as well as economically. The new research program developed by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Weather Bureau. both of which we will hear about at this meeting. are of the greatest importance to the field of weather modification. Basic and applied research programs which will be undertaken. improved instrumentation. and new engineering- techniques hold promise of substantially increasing our knowledge of weather modification. and eventually providing an important new source of water supplies over the entire United States.

False Bail.\" Mr. President. if there is validity to what the Senator from Ohio has said. why did not he ask that the proposed law be applied all the way across the board? Why say process servers. extradition agents. committees. agencies of government. and all the other items? Why not take It across the board? But in every case. a specific need developed. and Congress heeded the need and amended the title and the section accordingly. So here we deal with it in the same manner. We added six subsections in 1948. because there was a need for them. We added two in 1950. because the Department asked for them. Here we are in 1960. Here is a request. They think they need the provision. So they ask for it. I think it is In conformity with what has happened over the years in building up the law when the need arose.",

In that respect we are dealing with criminal law. and not with the civil rights law. The Senator has not answered the proposition that all the Attorney General of the United States could ask for was a law dealing with crime. The Attorney General did have a right to come to Congress and say. from a civil procedural standpoint. \"I need specific types of remedies.\" In civil procedures. Congress could adopt such laws as it saw fit. but when the Attorney General asks for a statute to prohibit a crime. Congress must conform with the general rules applicable to the adoption of criminal statutes. I therefore respectfully submit that if we are going to find justification in the adoption of nonuniform criminal laws because the Attorney General asks for them. we may as well abandon the principle of uniformity. The answer will be. \"The Attorney General askeu for It. and we felt obligated to give it to him. we could not call upon our consciences to prompt us to defend the citizenry as a whole.

I repeat that the essence of my argument is that the Attorney General showed no need for this. In my opinion. the Department of Justice in these cases has not exhausted the procedural remedies it already has available. As I said earlier this afternoon. I think the Attorney General is disturbed about the fact that the administration used the Army in Little Rock. rather than exhausting all the procedural remedies they had available. Had they exhausted them. I do not think it ever would have been necessary to send the Army into Little Rock. Second. I feel the inherent contempt powers of the court are adequate to cover this situation. Third. I question the usefulness of creating a new Federal crime in this field. As I said earlier. that gets us into a criminal trial in a locality where emotions are very high. It raises very serious questions as to whether one could possibly. under those circumstances. enforce a court order by that procedure. whereas the judge. exercising his contempt powers. could do so. For the reasons I have stated. and for the further reason that I think we ought to wait until we listen to the judges. through the Judicial Conference. I feel we should not adopt section 1.",

I hold him in high esteem. I said so In a speech in support of the confirmation of his nomination. I say so now. Secretary Herter. in my opinion. told us the truth.

To borrow Churchills term. this is the \"soft underbelly\" of our hemisphere. and Soviet activities there indicate they are acutely aware of this vulnerability. Our efforts to stem political unrest and Communist expansion in Europe and Asia are indeed admirable. but certainly what can be more important than tending to this same problem right at our very back door? I feel the Congress should immediately provide the initiative so that a program such as is proposed in Dr. Plazas article will be brought into existence before our losses in Latin America cease to be recoverable.

The committee dealing with this subject placed in the report. at the bottom of page 3. under the heading \"Payments to Air Carriers.\" a statement of the committees opinion on this subject. I feel strongly that Congress needs greater cooperation from the CAB in this matter. Too much granting of flights for feeder carriers which could not possibly carry the expense. much less make a profit. has been the rule in recent years. I think the Senate will find that sentiment very well expressed in the report. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in my remarks the section of the report to which I have referred.",

I should like to amplify the statement in the report by the further statement that the recommendation in the report is not .intended as an approval of terminaltoterminal nonstop operations by local carriers in direct competition with unsubsidized trunklines. The result of -any such misinterpretation would be that the local carriers would put their energies into such markets instead of into the local markets they were created to serve. In my judgment. the Board has been too generous in its granting of routes to local service carriers where there is no prospect of their being able to operate profitably. This is reflected dramatically in the figures given the Appropriations Committee in support of the budget request for subsidies. Estimated subsidy accruals for local service operations rose from $22.567.718 in 1955 to an estimated $37.504.832 for 1959. What is more dismaying. the estimated accruals for 1960 and 1961. respectively. are $49.771.000 and $55.434.000. Mr. President. it is very evident that the feeder carrier subsidy has gotten clear out of hand. I hope that both the Civil Aeronautics Board and the aviation industry will give attention and strong consideration to our report. which I have sought to supplement at this time.",

As the report shows. and as the particular paragraph which the Senator from Florida has placed in the RECORD shows. the Board transferred from carrier relations. and specially stressed this year an increased budget. With respect to the overall appropriation for subsidies. I think we feel. for the most part. that the Board has moved too slowly in trying to cut it down. The committee. I feel. wants local companies to have small and big cities themselves. and does not want trunklines in cities where they provide only one or two flights a day. or carry relatively few passengers. The Board. it seems to me. should stop considering the hairline details of these cases and get at its business. This brings up the general question with respect to all the agencies which are confronted with bigger and bigger backlogs. We provide more and more personnel each year. and still each year they show a bigger backlog. It seems to me that what we should do is to try to get them. fundamentally. to look at their own procedures. to see if they cannot get back to doing the things which have to be done. so as to clear up the backlogs which exist in every one of the agencies.",

I obtained from the Department of Defense some information with respect to Defense Department passenger travel having to do with travel of military personnel within the confines of the United States. The figures they have submitted to me indicate that. for fiscal 1958. 1.250.000 military personnel traveled by one means of transportation or another in the United States. Of this amount 461.700 traveled by commercial air. Of that amount roughly 71 percent traveled by first class. 3 percent by coach. and 4 percent by charter plane. In passenger miles traveled. 54 percent of the military personnel traveled by airplane..35 percent by first class. 7 percent by coach. and 11 percent by charter. Now. it came to my attention a couple of months agoand I have not checked this out. but I assume it to be true from the information I have obtainedthat. for instance. on a jet flight across the Atlantic Ocean where they have two classes of passengers on the same plane. the rear section being the luxury class. the front section the economy class. the cost differential for a round trip is around $425. It is not unusual. so I am told. to find that the luxuryclass compartment is occupied chiefly by Government civilian and military personnel while the economy department is occupied by private business people.",

    "speech": "Taxpayers. yes. and the same thing is true on flights across the country. A number of companies now have combined types of flight on the same plane. one. the firstclass flight. occupied by passengers in the rear part of the plane and the fore part occupied by what they call coach flight passengers. And. it is not unusual to find the firstclass compartment occupied by Government civilians and military personnel whereas the taxpayers. as the gentleman indicated. occupy the coach compartment or coach part of the plane. The cost differential on a round trip across the country is about $100. Now. I have traveled by coach both on combination flights and where the flights are entirely coach. and in my estimation they are all first class. Now. I would like to ask the committee if it has given consideration to adopting or suggesting a policy to the military whereby we could possibly save from $10 million to $20 million in the military transportation cost in flights in this country alone simply by having the military personnel who are traveling from one assignment to another travel by coach wherever possible. When I say \"coach.\" I am calling attention to the fact that these coach flights are designations only. They are actually firstclass flights. Can the committee give me any information on this matter?",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I take this time to express my criticism on Army policies which arbitrarily idle and reserve defense production facilities and prevent their use by jobcreating private enterprise operations. In my city of Cleveland. we have a heavy bomber plant built in World War IIwhich never did receive much use for bomber assembly. This is. however. one of the finest buildings of its type in America. 25 acres under roof. a hangartype construction. It is ideally suited for aircraft or missile production. Since 1951 General Motors used this plant to manufacture Army tanks and until recently the M56 airborne antitank gun carrier. Production terminated last month on the antitank gun carrier. and the Army has declared its intention to shut the plant down and keep control of the structure on a reserve status. At the same time. the Army has released other similar facilities in various parts of the country. The declared Army policy on this plant reflects a doginthemanger attitude toward the facility. The basic design and structure of the plant is for aircraft or missile assembly and not for weapons production. generally characteristic of Army requirements. Release of the plant for private enterprise use would make it available for research or production which would contribute to the Nations defense more usefully than an idle. deteriorating plant rapidly proceeding to obsolescence. It is ridiculous to see this type of plantone of the finest in Americaidled. while new missilemaking structures of similar type are popping up at public expense like mushrooms in the night all over southern California and Texas. Cleveland needs the 5.000 jobs that would be created if this plant were put to proper use.",

I think it is interesting. too. though this may not be exactly the appropriate place to raise this point. that the Army has behaved in a very secretive fashion with respect to the closing down. presumably for economy purposes. of various military installations around the country. Recently the Rossford Ordnance Depot in my district was closed down for what the Secretary of the Army has said will result in a $5 million a year saving. A month ago or longer. I requested the cost figures upon which this decision was based. And do you think I have been able to get one single figure from the Department of the Army? Absolutely not. And it is not only that I have not been able to get these figures. They have been refused me by the Secretary of the Army. And yet the people of Toledo are supposed to swallow this move that will cause an increase in our unemployment from 7.2 to 7.9 percent. Sixteen hundred men and women in the Toledo area are going to be put out of work because of this Army order. and they are being asked simply to take the word of the Secretary of the Army that this is for economy purposesto take his word while he hides the facts. The fact of the matter is that all of the information that has come to me from independent audit teams and from high ordnance personnel. which has come voluntarily. has been to the effect that the move to transfer activity from Rossford to Erie Ordnance Depot is for a purpose quite contrary to what has been stated. that economy is not going to be served. that this is a fabulously uneconomic and inefficient move. I want to call the attention of the House to this matter because we are being asked today to consider a $40 billion military budget item. All I can say is that if this budget was arrived at by the same kind of methods and by the same procedures that I have experienced from the Department of the Army. it is going to be a little hard for me to recommend it or explain it to the people I represent.",

I know that there are some who think and believe that the mutual aid program Is the only program offering assistance to our friends and allies. As a matter of fact. there are very few departments of our Government that do not participate to some degree in our program to assist friendly nations to improve their status and defensive position. It is instructive to note that since the end of World War II we have spent nearly $90 billion to assist our friends. allies. and to help underdeveloped nations throughout the world. A summary of foreign aid programs and expenditures by various Government agencies for development in foreign countries follows: Mutual aid grants and loans. $80.8 billion. Loans by exportimport banks. $5 billion. American contribution to International Bank for reconstruction and development. $650 million. American contribution to World Bank for economic development loans. approximately $1 billion. American contribution to International Monetary Fund. $2 billion. American contribution to International Finance Corporation. $35 million. Total loans. grants. and contributions. $89.4 billion. In addition. grants and loans in unspecified amounts have been made to foreign governments by the following agencies. I have not been able to obtain the figures for these: Agriculture Department: Commodity Credit Corporation and Foreign Agricultural Service. Atomic Energy Commission. Commerce Department. Executive Office of the President. Interior Department. United States Information Agency. As a member of the Appropriations Committee. I feel that the time has come for a thorough investigation of the mutual aid program. I think we have the clear responsibility to look into and revise our entire activities in this area with the point of view of coordinating these programs. of eliminating waste. duplication. inefficiency. and even corruption. and of even seeing to it that our funds are spent as efficiently and wisely as possible. The need for such a review was clearly pointed out by the interim report of the Subcommittee for Review of the Mutual Security Program in February of this year. Although this subcommittee was able only to scratch the surface. it developed convincing evidence that a thorough and complete study is justified and necessary.",

In addition to the foregoing. it is only fair to point out that there is on hand in the mutual security program an unexpended balance of $4.871.448.000. Therefore. there will be on hand for this foreign aid venture the grand total of $8.057.948.000. and this does not include local currencies available for expenditures in foreign lands approximating $1.565.148.000. What does this mean to the American taxpayer? Well. it puts foreign aid as the second largest item of our national budget. Foreign aid expenditures to date exceed $70 billion and represent onequarter of our national debt with an interest cost of $3 billion a year. There is no need to reiterate what I originally pointed out during the debate on the mutual security authorization bill with regard to certain glaring conditions in the various parts of the world with regard to the administration of this program. Suffice it to say. that the waste and corruption of this giveaway serves to add to uncontrollable extravagance and is its greatest evil. We must never forget that foreign aid which began as lendlease in 1940 was proclaimed an emergency program. yet here it is still with us in 1959. True. it has been known by other names but its result. in my opinion. has been the samean unwarranted. unsuccessful. and unproven burden on the American taxpayer. In other words. the assertion that foreign aid secures allies for us and helps save the free world from communism is not borne out by the past record of this program. As I have said time and again. one can neither buy friends or peace. and further what an odd way to save the world from communism when one looks at the record and finds that between July 1. 1945. and June 30. 1958. we had given aid to Communist or Communistcontrolled nations to the tune of $2.229.869.000. It seems to me that we are doing exactly what Lenin believed and wrotewe are spending ourselves into bankruptcy. There is no easier way to cause the downfall of our American way of life.

Now. I said: Will we be furnishing power to all of that population? And the answer was: We presently serve 64 percent of the population. Then I said: On the new system what would we serve? About 75 percent of the population. In other words. this powerplant we are going to put in at $18 million. which I do not think is authorized. will serve 40.000 American troops and their dependents and about 75 percent of the 700.000 people on Okinawa. Now. at the time we had this matter before us in March of 1959 the total cost of the project was to be $13.5 million. Now. the gentlemans committee had the matter before them in May of 1959. about 6 weeks later. and it goes up to $18 million. There is an increase of $4.5 million in this public powerplant on Okinawa. Will the gentleman tell us under what authority we are appropriating this $18 million?",

I would like to include the following editorial which appeared in todays New York Herald Tribune. entitled \"The Futile Filibuster\": THE FuTm FLsusTnR How long can the 18 southern Senators carry on their filibuster? Well. unless they choose to yield on their own. which no one expects. the only Immediately clear alternative is for the majority to insist by twothirds vote on stopping the socalled debate and getting down to business on civilrights legislation. But it Is equally clear that as of now the votes are lacking for cloture. So for the moment the Senate has no choice but to persist in roundtheclock sessions. This Is what LYNDON JOHNsON calls clearing the air. And doubtlessly all parties concerned are also interested In seeing how goes the impending debate in the House on civil rights. If. however. cloture Isnt attainable just now. It certainly does not follow that the filibusterers can interminably prolong their spectacle. Why? Because the overwhelming majority Is determined. in greater or lesser degree. on strengthening civil rights. The more the Southerners huff and puff. just so does their windy exhibition inspire Increasing public disgust and fortify the necessity of meaningful legislation. While Senator JoHNsoN talks of getting a \"reasonable\" bill and rejects cloture at this time. the danger is that this will make the filibusterers think they can somehow drive through a compromise. But that for which the Southerners might settle. which probably means a circumscribed version of voting rights. can be. assuredly described as so much dishwater. The problem of the Senate majority. the 82 nonfillbusterers. is to see to It that the final bill Is in fact strong. The heart of the argument. of course. Is to insure the Negro right to vote. That. surely. is not a matter for days and weeks of gumbeating. There cant be any compromise here. Indeed it ought to be. Ideally. a nonpartisan A2047",

Then we have had many sessions of the Public Lands Subcommittee. to which Senator NEUBERGER had come to sponsor or support individual pieces of legislation. I watched how carefully he presented and how quickly he was willing to withdraw a point if he found that there was something in connection with the legislation which he had not originally anticipated.

I would not want it passed until we had a full opportunity to look at every facet of it.\" He was on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. and chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs.

Justice Musmanno is undoubtedly one of the most able. implacable. and articulate foes of communism that this country has. In 1929. while a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature. he introduced a bill to outlaw the Communist Party in Pennsylvania. In 1951 he authored the measure now known as the Musmanno Act which definitely made membership in the Communist Party in Pennsylvania a criminal act.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. freedom suffered a sharp blow several days ago when Chough Pyongok died unexpectedly at Walter Reed Hospital. Mr. Chough was leader of the Korean Democratic Party. When the Korean Republic was established in 1948 he was a close associate of President Syngman Rhee. Then he became disgusted with the Rhee governments policy of controlling elections by violence. press suppression. and nonsecret balloting. At the time of his death. Mr. Chough was Dr. Rhees strong rival for the presidency. In order to attain the best possible health for what he knew would be an arduous and dangerous presidential campaign. Mr. Chough came to the United States early this year for a necessary intestinal operation. He had barely lost sight of the Korean shoreline when Dr. Rhee rammed through a provision declaring that the national election would be held 2 months earlier than previously scheduledon March 15 instead of May 15. This meant that even had he lived. Mr. Chough would have had little time to recover from his operation and campaign for his countrys key office. Possibly sensing that for the third time in the last three elections sudden death was to eliminate the oppositions candidate. Dr. Rhee pushed through another regulation setting February 13 as the deadline for any further entries Into the presidential race. By strange coincidence. Mr. Chough died on February 15. thus leaving Dr. Rhee with a clear road to reelection. America and the rest of the free world have given thousands of lives and billions of dollars to foster liberty in South Korea. We blocked Communist conquest of that Republic. only to find the Koreans are now political captives of their own dictatorial president. If he is to reestablish the faith of the American people in his government. Dr. Rhee must first permit the Korean Democratic Party to nominate another candidate. Then he must schedule the national election for the original May 15 date. and let his people choose their leader in free and secret balloting. If Dr. Rhee refuses to take these basic steps toward democratic government. he will forfeit much of our sympathy.",

The people are yearning for the leadership which the President alone could supply. As the occupant of the most powerful office in the free world. the President has a rare opportunity for leadership in these most critical times when America faces a great watershed of history. I was impressed yesterday by the testimony of two outstanding Americans who called attention to the nature of the crisis we face. Dr. William Pickering. Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. California Institute of Technology. testified February 24 before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Dr. Pickering repeated what President Eisenhower has declined to state. despite the unanimous opinion of the Presidents top administrators. In Dr. Pickerings own expression: In other words. we should frankly admit what the rest of the .world knowsthat we are indeed in a race with the U.S.S.R. in space. One can come to no other conclusion. I would also like to call attention to an excellent statement on February 24 by Robert C. Sprague.

His entire life was emblematic of the qualities which we Americans hold in such high esteem: honesty. industry. and leadership. His rise to prominence is another classic example of an American success story achieved by hard application and great perseverance. He was born in Turners Falls. Mass.. on July 31. 1881. Left fatherless at the age of 9. he went to work as a clerk and when. 2 years later his mother died. he assumed the responsibilities of mature manhood by taking care of his younger brother and sister. At 18 years of age he became a partner of the store where he worked. at 21 he was elected treasurer and tax collector of the town of Montague. He served in various offices in that towns government for 6 years and. at 27. he was elected State representative serving in that capacity from 1909 to 1912 and subsequently elected to the State senate. he served in that body until 1926. In 1928 he was elected State treasurer for 2 years. While these are the official duties and responsibilities he undertook. many other important activities of philanthropy and community service occupied his unselfish time. The Boy Scouts. the Red Cross. Agricultural Society. and a host of others received the benefits of his leadership. sage counsel. and unstinting devotion. To each of his positions in life. whether as merchant. legislator. official. newspaper publisher. or banker. he brought his many virtues and in each he was a success. But. above all material considerations. as a man he merited the respect. friendship. and admiration accorded him by his fellow citizens. Franklin County was fortunate. indeed. having had John Hagis as a resident. but in the more important broader aspects. the State of Massachusetts. the Nation. and those whom he served so well. are much better for his having lived. To his family I extend my profound sympathies in their great loss and I join all who knew him in their bereavement.",

Belligerents and neutrals alike were glad to see the human carnage stop and they all welcomed the return of peace. To some peoples 1918 ushered in a new era. it brought them a prize for which they had been fighting for generations and even for centuries. In that year they regained their national independence. and the Estonians were among them. These people had settled in their historic land long before the beginning of modern times. There. in the northernmost outpost of Europe. they led a quiet and contented. but strenuous and hardy life. They were one of the smallest ethnic groups in Europe. and they succeeded in maintaining their national identity and freedom. Then in 1710 they were subjected to Russias oppressive czars. For more than two centuries they endured that detested regime. but they always wanted their freedom and were prepared to fight for it. Toward the end of the First World War. when the czarist regime in Russia was overthrown. they felt free and on February 24 proclaimed their independence. That was exactly 42 years ago. and today. unfortunately. independent Estonia is no more. After the happy and joyful two decades of interwar years. the country was one of the early casualties of the last war and the unhappy Estonians were its victims. Since then. for 20 years. these sturdy Estonians have been suffering under Communist tyrants. but they still cherish. ever fervently. their freedom and independence.

It is a tragic thing that this occasion receives little attention since Estonia. as much as any other nation. stands as a constant reminder of the basic treachery of Soviet dictators and their complete disregard for the rights of mankind. Estonia. due to her brief span of independence and isolated geographical position with a relatively small population. never received the attention of the world that larger nations receive while undergoing the same brutal oppression. .3545 However. we should maintain the moral dedication and strength of our foreign policy by continuing to emphasize to the United Nations the barbaric domination that Soviet forces exercise over Estonia and her neighboring Baltic StatesLatvia and Lithuania. With all the phony Soviet propaganda concerning the termination of the cold war. we should point to a tragic people. such as the Estonians. to remind ourselves that until they are restored to the political. social. economic. and religious freedom that they desire. we will never have true world peace. In the coming summit conferences. President Eisenhower should be forewarned of the constant deceitfulness that is the standard Soviet diplomatic procedure. when he remembers the tragic diplomatic errors of his two immediate predecessors. Estonia and her brave people in their tragic suffering serve to constantly remind us that only through national strength and support of free nations of the world. and by efforts to constantly expose the insidious worldwide communistic agitation can we maintain for ourselves and all peoples true freedom and world peace.

Recently. the Attorney General of the United States commended his office as being one of the best administered U.S. attorneys offices in the Nation. The reasons for this recognition are many. The backlog of pending cases was considerably reduced. The office also vigorously prosecuted those who had flouted Federal law. while at the same time he and his staff were equally diligent in protecting the rights of those who were innocent. Mr. Carl Hauck. executive housekeeper of the U.S. Public Health Service hospital at Windmill Pointe. received the honor of being named \"Federal Employee of the Year.\" As head of the housekeeping department. Mr. Hauck is in charge of the cleaning and laundry work at the hospital. This responsibility also involves all of the auxiliary buildings and nine doctors residences. He has been officially recognized by the Public Health Service for his outstanding qualities through several letters of commendation. outstanding performance ratings. and superior accomplishment awards from Division Directors up to the Assistant Surgeon General. He takes exceptional pride in the general appearance and cleanliness of the hospital grounds and has done much to make this hospital an excellent one in every respect.

This son of Poland was a great soldier of freedom. and he is best remembered in this country as a brave fighter in our War of Independence. He was born into an impoverished family on February 12. 214 years ago. At the age of 13 he lost his father. but his yearning for education led him to the royal school at Warsaw in 1765. He was graduated with the rank of captain in 1769. Then. aided by a scholarship. he entered the famous military school at Mezieres in France. where he specialized in artillery and engineering. In 1776 he had already finished his studies when he heard of the American Revolution. At once he saw his chance for action in a good cause. and on borrowed money he sailed for America. Here he was admitted into the service. his qualities at once recognized. and he was charged with drawing up plans for fortifying the Delaware River. His success at this assignment earned him a commission as colonel of engineers in the Continental Army. In the spring of the following year he joined the northern army at Ticonderoga. During the next 2 years he was in charge of the building of fortifications at West Point. Subsequently he took part in many battles. distinguishing himself in all of them. On October 13. 1783. in recognition of his signal services. Congress made him a brigadier general. Having served the noble cause of this country with distinction. in July of 1784. he returned to his native Poland. hoping to carry on the fight for her freedom. There for more than 20 years he continued his brave but unfortunately futile efforts. and was fated to die in exile on October 15. 1817. Today in commemorating the 214th anniversary of his birth we pay homage to his blessed memory. Senator Jennings Randolph Delivers Significant Address at Boy Scout Award Dinner in West Virginia.

Lithuania made a brave and. for a while. untroubled entrance into the family of free nations. From February 16. 1918 until invaded again at the start of World War Il by. first. Nazi Germany and later by Soviet Russia. Lithuania earned the reputation of a model Republic. She was one of those nations to learn at an early date of the frail value of agreements with the Soviet Union. This little nation. which turned to the Soviets for help. felt the embraces of the bear. Russia scrapped their Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1939 and earlier nonaggression and peace treaties of July 12. 1920 and September 28. 1926. An illegal puppet government was forced upon the people. and on June 15. 1940. Russia fraudulently annexed Lithuania.

Today only refugee Lithuanians and friends of Lithuania in the free world can observe that countrys anniversary of independence openly. But we can feel confident that through radio. and other means. the word will get back to those patriots who have to observe their independence anniversary in secret.

I should simply like to ask the Senator if the background of the new treaty is not really this: In 1951. the United States entered into an agreement with Japan. when she was just reemerging from the position of being completely occupied. that the terms of that treaty necessarily gave Japan fewer rights. and gave to us more privileges and rights. Is it not true that as Japan has sustained her independence. has regained her economic strength. and has regained. in great measure. her stature as one of the outstanding nations of the world. much less of the Orient. a time came when the old treaty would never be acceptable to a proud. independent. and successful people. and when the terms of the new treaty must recognize this growth. this strength. this complete emergence of a free and independent Japan?

But when I read about the great crowd and mob in Tokyo which held the personal representative of the President of the United States a virtual prisoner for 70 minutes. and then when I observed that there were no reports of strong public reaction or resentment on the part of the people of Japan. I felt that there must be some underground or beneaththesurface movement or some other underlying reasons for that situation. and that it might grow. And it did grow. I resent the treatment of the Presidents representative and of our Nation. by means of what happened in Tokyo. and I think everyone in the United States should resent it. and we should not be timid in saying so. I cannot conceive that a government would remain in power if it were so weak as not to be able to try to do more about such a situation than the Japanese Government actually did. However. I take it that that situation did not represent the real spirit and intent of the Japanese people. who form a fine nation. and certainly are worthy of this treaty. which also is to our advantage.",

I take the positionand I think the Senator didthat this is not a very good time for a Presidential visit. Probably he stated that. and I agree with him.

All of us regret that the demonstrations in Japan got out of hand. and that the police force was unable to control them. Nevertheless. we might point out the difference between the methods of controlling demonstrations or not controlling them in a democratic country and in a country where a Communist government is in control. All of us are familiar with the recent student demonstrations in Hungary. What happened? The Hungarian Communist Government called for troops and tanks to come there. and they killed approximately 10.000 of those students. sent thousands more to exile in Siberia. and drove 100.000 students out of the country. because they feared that they would lose their lives if they remained there. So I think the world has a fairly good example of the difference. and that the people of the world will make up their minds as to which they prefer. It is unfortunate that one girl. I believe. was killed in Japan. She was crushed in some way. and no one seems to know precisely what happened. But when we contrast that situation with the slaughter of tens of thousands of young Hungarian youth by the Russians. who had their armed forces in Hungary. I believe that in the long run we shall have to agree that even though the Japanese demonstrations got out of hand. what happened there was vastly preferable to what happened in Hungary.",

The reason I ask the question Is that there is a continuous and consistent complaint on the part of American manufacturers. For instance. it has been said that Japan is the largest purchaser of American cotton. and at the same time the greatest exporter of textile goods in the world. I realize that in the nature of progress Japan must industrialize in order to meet world competition. I am wondering if. in this design. which I do not criticize. but which I understand. there Is some reason for resentment on the part of the workers.

I did not anticipate this argument. but I may mention that the real wages in Japan have been substantially increased. However. they are never as much as people would like to have. The per capita income in Japan is $253. which is about three times the average of the other Asian nations in this area. It is still too low. but Japan is far better off than any other country in the area. That fact probably explains some of the internal political infighting going on. However.

As the able and distinguished Senators from Tennessee and Minnesota have so clearly pointed out in their minority views. this bill is but a part of an old fight between producing and consuming sections of the Nation. I commend those views to my colleagues since they embody much of my own thinking that this legislation needs much further study. especially as to its specific effects upon all the States and their varying tax structures. As presented to us this bill would most certainly discriminate against the small. oneState business in favor of the large. multiState businesses. It would do this in addition to discriminating against the consuming sections of the Nation. May I remind my colleagues from the producing States that it is exactly because we have consuming States that their mills and factories are prosperous. Without our consumption there would be far fewer markets. But maintaining our services costs money. When the salesman comes to the consuming State from the producing State. he is provided with all the usual State and local public servicespolice protection. for example. These services the States must provide even though he maintains no permament domicile in the State and is transient. The costs of these services must be paid. and the State must obtain the funds therefor from some of the very businesses located in the State with which the salesmans concern is competing. That firm in the producing State may very well be located in a State having no income tax and therefore competing on advantageous terms with the firm in the consuming State. This does not seem equitable to me. It places firms in producing States at great competitive advantage. especially in States having no income taxes. This approach overlooks the fact that those firms who would benefit from the enactment of this proposed legislation must rely upon expenditures in the States in which they sellexpenditures for road maintenance. for exampleto make possible the completion of their sales.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. better housekeeping in the Department of Defense would save. and thus provide. some of the extra money that we need for missile development and for space exploration. Take an incident that occurred last Saturday as an illustration. It is difficult for us to understand how the worlds largest blimp was destroyed as it was being moved into its hangar. The 400foot dirigible ZPG3W was purchased by the U.S. Navy in 1959. The price was $12 million. On February 13 at the U.S. Naval Air Station. South Weymouth. Mass.. the blimp was wrecked when a sudden gust of wind smashed it against a hangar as it was being towed inside by a tractor. Its envelope was split. The blimp collapsed in a tangle of rubber and nylon. as 1.5 million cubic feet of helium escaped. Apart from the gondola and its gear. the ship was a complete loss. In fact. a substantial loss. Why was the safety of this $12 million investment in defense entrusted to one man driving the tractor and one man in the gondola? Why were not more men and more tractors assigned to lines at each side of. and in the rear of the blimp. to control it against vagrant winds as it was being eased into the hangar? In too many instances. the destruction of defense equipment in peacetime is passed off as a matter of little consequence. with no adequate explanation to the general public. and with no assurances that proper precautions will be taken to avoid further losses. This indifference toward waste and preventable losses on the part of the Armed Forces. is disturbing to me. to Congressman JAMEs A. BURKE. whose district includes the U.S. Naval Air Station at South Weymouth. and to every Member of Congress who is concerned with the efficiency of our National Defense Establishment. It is routine procedure for naval authorities to inquire into the causes of these expensive accidents but I think that the public also has a right to know. If there has been carelessness. we must fix responsibility for it. and insist upon better handling of valuable equipment in the future. For this reason. I ask the Committee on Armed Services to conduct an open investigation of the circumstances surrounding the loss of the big Navy blimp. and to make its findings and recommendations available to the American people.",

The second category of accomplishments goes toward the practical applications of our space program. and this would include the Pioneer. Transit. and Tiros series. From these we have the beginnings of reliable longrange communications. exact allweather navigation. accurate earth and planetary mapping. and weather and climate prediction. and possibly control.

Before too many months have passed we hope to achieve a suborbital flight of an astronaut and. before the end of next year. a true manned orbital flight under Project Mercury. In. 1961. also we should see the first launching of an AtlasCentaur vehicle employing for the first time liquid hydrogen as fuel. In 1962 we hope to impact the Moon with a scientific payload and launch a spacecraft to the vicinity of Venus or Mars. or perhaps both. In 196364 we should see the launching of the awesome Saturn vehicle. which we have here in model form. This 3stage giant will be some 185 feet high and 21 feet in diameter at the base. will weigh about 1 million pounds as it stands on the launch pad. and will develop 1/ million pounds of thrust in the first stage alone. This scale model of a man standing at the base (pointing) gives you some conception of the size of the Saturn vehicle. Also in the 196364 period we should see an unmanned soft lunar landing. as well as an Earth orbiting astronomical and radio astronomy laboratory. Unmanned vehicles are expected to circumnavigate the Moon and return to Earth. and reconnoiter Mars or Venus. or both. In the 196567 period we will launch a program which we expect will lead to manned circumlunar flight. and an attempt to establish a permanent nearEarth space station. After 1970 we envision man on the Moon. We recognize. of course. that unforeseen problems could slow down the achieving of these goals. or. conversely. breakthroughs could accelerate the program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a reading of the record of TVA from its inception in 1933 discloses that TVA has engaged in a progressive assumption and usurpation of powers that Congress never intended it should have. In fact. TVA officials and its proponents have from time to time denied the authority and the intention to do the very things that were later assumed or claimed. Such an agency should have greater congressional control. not less. It would take volumes on volumes to set forth all the various statements and claims that TVA and its proponents have made relative to the future programs or actions of TVA. and the record of failure to perform in accordance with such claims or contentions. A few of the more obvious failures of TVA to act in accordance with the expressions of its officials and proponents are here noted. In regard to the cost of TVA. the author of the TVA bill in the House stated that the entire proposed TVA program could be completed for less than $150 million. An opponent who prophesied at the time that it would be a billiondollar program was only half right. It now has cost $2 billion in money appropriated out of the U.S. Treasury. in addition to the loss of freedom and initiative of the people in the TVA region itself due to the autocratic power placed in the hands of a threeman board. Surely an agency that has had almost unlimited and dictatorial control of the spending of over $3.760.000.000 from its inception to June 30. 1958. and whose annual gross income now approaches one quarter billion dollars. should have more congressional control. not less. TVAs 14.600 employees are under the almost unlimited control of the three men who run TVA. It would seem more proper to provide that these 14.600 TVA employees come under the United States Civil Service Commission laws and regulations as do most Federal employees. rather than to continue or expand the almost unlimited control that three men now have over these TVA employees.",

DEAR LLOYD: Your letter is greatly appreciated and so clearly depicts the valid and sound arguments in opposition to payment limitation movements which have grown up in recent years. I have in my file an earlier letter from you on this subject which I prize most highly. This story needs to be told and reiterated. It is true that larger farm operators receive the greater return from benefits provided by the Government. The message is being related and emphasized as if such a person is a culprit. scoundrel. or grand rascal. His participation in these programs is greater since his contributions in volume output are larger. It is an effort to poison and prejudice the minds of the American people that the large farmer should be made smaller. That theoryif carried to its ultimate end conclusionwould mean that if a person had saved his money and lived frugally and acquired new holdings from time to time he would find himself confronted with a movement to split up his operations among his less fortunate brother farmers. That type of philosophy is not in keeping with the principles of equality of opportunity to the citizen. The incentive of the individual should be encouraged under our system. You are right when you say that no effort is being made to penalize large industry. Subsidies for railroads are not being made on the basis of the length of the line or the amount of equipment and other properties that the railroads possess. subsidies to the airlines and steamship people have no such limitations. Fast tax writeoffs have benefited all size operators. Your letter is most convincing. plausible. and informative upon this subject. and I am grateful to you for writing me.

Edgar Hoover. the Federal Bureau of Investigation. and the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. The members of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities are grateful for the support of this fine newspaper. With such backing by the press I am certain that the American people are not going to be. misled by the current vicious campaign to discredit the committee. the FBI and its great Director. The editorial follows: THEY NEVER Qurr It has become clear that the pseudoliberals. antiantiCommunists and leftists have singled out two targets for 1959. One is to discredit J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. The other is to wreck the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. The attack on Mr. Hoover and the great organization he heads has taken the form of articles insidiously slanted to undermine confidence in the fairness and meticulous care to protect both witnesses and accused by which the FBI operates. The attack on the House UnAmerican Activities Commiittee is more open. Representative JAMES ROOSEVELT. California Democrat. has introduced a resolution to junk it and shift its jurisdiction to the Judiciary Committee. He continued to press the attack yesterday and based his objections to the committee on the fact that \"it has subpenaed people who were former Communists after having learned their names from the testimony of friendly witnesses.\" What would he have the committee dosubpena members of sewing circles? The committee has been vilified for years by peseudoliberals. antiantiCommunists and leftists because it has been one of the most effective forces we have for exposing the Communist conspiracy. Fortunately. there is every reason to believe it will keep on being so. A far greater Democrat than JIMmy ROOSEVELT. by name of SAM RAYBURN. is adamantly opposed to the ROOSEVELT resolution and promises it will be overwhelmingly defeated if it ever reaches the floor.

It has been argued by the distinguished majority leader and other Senators that the Government has a great need for technicians and other highly educated and expert persons who are not now working for the Government because of the higher wages they receive in private industry. or who are leaving the Government because they can receive higher wages elsewhere. I suggest that this is an assertion which is not backed up by the committee hearings. We have no data or studies upon which to rest a competent judgment that that is so. We have no proof. upon which we can act. that this is so. We have merely surmises and the contention. Furthermore. we have no proof whatever that a 7 -percent increase will cause those persons to stay with the Government. as was well pointed out by the distinguished Senator from Arizona. The kind of salary competition which may be attracting them away from Government service is not a differential of 72 percent. it is a differential which may run as high as 20 or 30 percent. Therefore. I believe we cannot assume. upon the evidence now before us. that the passage of the bill providing for a 71/2percent increase would rectify the problem which has been alluded to on the floor.",

Second. it seems to me that if the 71/2percent increase were justified overall. then it ought to apply to persons in the higher categories as well as to those in the lower or middle categories. That is why I said at the outset that normally I would not support an amendment of this kind. But where there is no justification. in my opinion. for a 71/2percent increase overall. then I would prefer any amendment which would tend to limit the size of the increase to those who are clearly most in need of it. Those persons. obviously. are the ones in the lower and middle brackets. They are persons who are faced with the high cost of living but are having a difficult time making their budgets meet their living costs. So I support the amendment. I believe it will effect a saving of at least $35 million to $55 zaillion a year. Of those who are earning $10.000 or more a year. the great majority are not the technicians or the scientists to whom reference has been made. they are those in the regular civil service positions of the Government. They are not the persons who are most in need of a raise. So let us effect a saving in the increase. if there is to be one. by granting the raise to persons in the lower income brackets. who certainly are most in need of an increase. For these reasons.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the effect of the amendment is to strike Part B of Title I of the pending bill. If adopted. it would mean a saving of about half a billion dollars. I therefore think it is a matter of sufficient importance to warrant the yeas and nays. I ask for the yeas and nays. * The yeas and nays were ordered. If we were to confine this bill to the postal workers and adopt the increases in the proposed legislation for them. it would tend to bring them abreast of other workers in the Government. and to equate their pay with that being received by the majority of workers in the classified civil service. Secondly. the great bulk of the postal workers. as the Senate well knows. are concentrated in the lower grades. and they are faced with an increasingly serious problem in trying to meet rising living costs. I think they are the most entitled to a pay raise. They have more need for the higher pay. and there is greater justification for giving It to them. I think this is borne out by the particular fact that data before the committees show that 31 percent of the postal employees have to have a second job in order to make a living. and 43 percent of the postal employees have wives who work. in order that their joint pay may be sufficient to meet the family bills. Therefore. I think a convincing case is made for the need to increase the general level of salaries of the postal workers. Thirdly. there is evidence that many postal workers still receive far less for the work that they do. than those engaged in comparable work in private industry. During my 4 years in the Senate I have tried to be fair with Federal employees. I believe they are entitled to comparable pay for comparable work. The fact that this is still not true with respect to many in the postal service is still another reason why we should pass their pay increase. as embodied in this bill. Since 1951 average industrial wages have gone up 45 percent. while postal salaries have gone up 19 percent.",

That is not a sound or safe guide or policy to pursue. Can we therefore. in the light of our fiscal situation. in view of the heavy burdens upon us. go further into debt by spending money we do not have. to raise salaries to the tune of a half billion dollars for employees where no adequate justification is shown to exist at the present time for such increase. I cant in good conscience do that. A case is made here for the postal employees. and I want to vote to increase their salaries. I believe that we should raise the salaries of the postal workers. I agree that there is justification for doing so. and I want to do that. However. as the able Senator from Idaho has pointed out. there is no need to raise Federal salaries across the board.

    "speech": "I wish to join the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. MCCLELLA I in commending the magnificent and courageous presentation which has been made to the Senate by the able and distinguished Senator from Idaho. The bill before the Senate has troubled me. I have made a study of the matter and have reached the identical conclusions which the Senator from Idaho has reached with respect to the proposal to raise the pay of Federal employees as set forth in the bill. The postal workers have made out a case which in my judgment justifies the pay increase proposed for postal workers. I think there has been a total failure to make out a case for the increase of pay for Government employees generally. I sometimes feel as though we ought to hang our heads in shame for the conduct of Congress in fiscal affairs. I make that statement because 28 years ago the people of the United States had a national debt of $30 billion. Today they have a national debt of $290 billion. They have that national debt because Congress has failed to exercise the moral and political courage to raise. by taxes upon the living. sufficient moneys to pay the appropriations it has made. Instead of doing so. Congress year after year. in 25 years out of 28. has appropriated more money than it has had the moral and political courage to raise by revenue measures bearing upon those living Americans who have a chance to walk up to the ballot box and say whether they approve of the way Congress is managing affairs. It is time for Congress to quit appropriating the unearned income of unborn Americans. and that is precisely what this bill proposes insofar as it undertakes to raise the pay of Federal employees generally. I think it is time for somebody to represent these unborn Americans who. when they come into the world find themselves already in debt to an extent in excess of $1.600 apiece as their pro rata part of the national debt. During 25 of the last 28 years. Congress has not had the moral and political courage to raise enough revenue to take care of the expenditures which it has been authorizing. I wish to commend the Senator for his courageous and intelligent presentation.",

I also call attention to the statement on page 223. of the testimony of Mr. Campbell. As I say. there may well be an answer to these assertions. but it is said at page 220: During the 10year period ended In February 1960. Federal classified employees received three raises which amounted to an average increase of 30 percent on a cumulated basis. During the same period. hourly rates of employees of seven of the largest corporations were raised through collective bargaining to a degree far exceeding that of Federal workers. The total increase ranged from 53.7 percent for the Sinclair Refining Co. to 87 percent for the Aluminum Co. of America. as Indicated in appendix table 1. During the 2year period from January 1. 1958. the hourly rates of employees of these seven companies were raised as much as 10 percent In contrast to no raise for Federal classified employees. Then on page 223. below the middle of the page. there is this statement: It would require an average increase of approximately 12.5 percent to return classified salaries to their 1939 purchasing power. I would appreciate it if the Senator from Idaho or. for that matter. any member of the committee. could enlighten us on whether those are accurate statements or inaccurate statements. or whether there is some other answer to them. because they do seem to me to present an argument on the other side.",

This program was modeled on the very successful college housing program. During the House hearings. however. the Housing and Home Finance Administrator. Norman Mason. commented that the administration believed that this direct Federal loan program would involve an unnecessary and undesirable use of Federal funds. that it would compete with private enterprise. and have the effect of smothering the growing private interests serving this field. Notwithstanding that view. Congress included the elderly housing program in S. 57. the first general housing bill of that year. We are all familiar with the history of the legislation. including the vetoes. but finally the inclusion of this program and finally. too. this year. the inclusion of an appropriation of $20 million for the purpose of elderly housing under the program. I read recently in the New York Times that Mr. Mason is now an enthusiastic supporter of the direct loan program for housing for the elderly. Inquiring further. I learned that whereas there is time spent of around 90 days between application and commitment on other FHA programs. which is somewhat longer than the time between now and November 8th. the Housing and Home Finance Agency is gearing up to process the applications for this totally new and. presumably. what was described in the veto message as a dangerous and unsound program. in 7 days. With the applications just starting to come in. I have no doubt that the administration will be able to process a considerable number of the applications in the very near future.

The Senator will recall that on the floor of the * Senate we tried to get it raised to a figure of $50 million. $40 million. $30 million. and then $20 million. We were not able to bargain anything for the time being. Finally the Senator from New Jersey introduced the amendment calling for $50 million. and finally the chairman of the committee agreed to take the full amount to conference. Out of it came the $20 million. I am glad to see that the Housing and Home Finance Agency is seeking to get up some useful housing projects for elderly citizens.",

Educated in our principles and ideals. they are acting to create better understanding. and often to correct the distortions being spread about us by Communist propaganda. I am pleased to say that the University of Wisconsina truly great institution of learningis now educating about 649 students from 70 nations. Over the years. almost every country in the world has been represented at this fine university. As alumni of Wisconsin. many of these students will carry back to their homeland a better understanding of this great country. As a basis for activities. a number of these alumni have organized groups or clubs abroad. Today. for example. Wisconsin has alumni clubs in Bangkok. Manila. Tokyo. and Honolulu. In other nations there are informal gettogethers of alumni. The expansion of such effortsbased on private initiative. foresight. and constructive thinkingwould indeed make an important contribution to creating a better understanding of us among the nations of the world. To give my colleagues the benefit of Mr. Andersons thinking on this program. I request unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the first bill which I introduced this session provided for the establishment of Padre Island. stretching along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico between Corpus Christi and Brownsville. Tex.. as a national park. This island features some of the finest beach6s to be found anywhere in our United States. In addition. they are almost in the same State as they were when the Karankawa Indians lived on the island. when the Spanish explorer Alonso Alvarez de Pineda set foot on the shores in 1519. to be followed by Cabeza de Vaca. David Ingram. and others. and when a young lieutenant named George G. Meade sailed down Laguna Madre on the islands landward side to see if Gen. Zachary Taylor could take his artillery to Mexico by water. It is an unfortunate truth that in many sections of our country the shoreline was vanished from public use. According to a national survey. only 240 miles of the 3.700 miles of shoreline constituting the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are in Federal and State ownership for public recreation use. I believe a national park on Padre Island is sorely needed to preserve some of our coastline for the enjoyment Of all. If it is made a park. I confidently predict Padre Island will become a winter playground for the Nation. What better place could there be than this sandy island on which Texas longhorns once grazed and where one can still visit the wrecked hulls of fishing boats and pick up glass colored by the sun marking the sites of towns established here by early settlers? The story of the centuries lends flavor to this island. rich in legend of Indians. pirate treasure. explorers. soldiers. cowmen. and fishermen and sailors. In addition. the island provides sanctuary for birds and wildlife and the water around it yields fine surf fishing. A1084 Its unique combination of geographical formations. scenery. history. climate. and wildlife cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the Nation. Mr. President. in further support of my reasons for wanting to preserve this last substantial strip of the American coastline which is still almost entirely in its natural State.

Sometimes. when finding that a Senator has spoken well of another. one is inclined to feel that such a remark falls in the category of courtesy or easy compliment. But I assure my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that last week it was my privilege and my responsibility to associate myself with the able junior Senator from West Virginia . He conducted the hearings to which he has made reference in the course of his remarks here todayremarks not only of clarity. but also of the utmost challenge. Mr. President. the urgency of this problem cannot be disregarded. Earlier. in this Chamber. we heard the statement of the Senator from Ohio . who spoke about the starvation or near starvation of millions of people throughout the earth. Let me saywith no attempt to overdramatize the seriousness of the situationthat in the valleys and on the hillsides of our State of West Virginia. people are desperately in need of food. My colleague will recall the testimony of Sheriff Howard Chambers of Mingo County. His language was forthright as he told of the plight of the people in that area. He indicated to us that 41 percent of the population of that county is wholly dependent upon surplus food commoditiesprovided free of charge by the Federal Governmentin order to maintain a bare existence. \ufffd I congratulate my colleague from West Virginia on bringing to the attention of the Senate the acuteness of this situation. Mr. President. the pitiful plight of these West Virginians and the dire distress in which they find themselves are matters which my colleague well understands. . I am sure that if he desires to take the time to do soalthough. under the allotment of time we have today for debate on this subject. the time is running outmy colleague could appropriately state that he was reared in an area of mining production. where coal has been the basic industry. I am sure that the conditions of the 1930s are being matched and even exceeded by the more critical conditions in 1959.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the effect of the two major bills as passed by the Senate thus far in the current session of Congress would be to provide for back door expenditure of $3.3 billion before the first appropriation bill is even reported from the House Appropriations Committee. The housing bill. as passed by the Senate. would completely bypass the appropriation process by authorizing $575 million in expenditures from public debt receipts. and circumvent effective appropriation control over $2.250 million in contract authorizations. Likewise the airport bill. passed by the Senate. would provide $465 million in contract authorizations. And as HHFA Commissioner Norman Mason has pointed out. the public housing provision in the housing bill virtually commits future appropriations running into multimillions of dollars in Federal contributions to projects under this program. Federal contributions to public housing projects in existence are now running at a rate of more than $100 million annually. and increasing every year. and to date they have totaled approximately $0.5 billion. exclusive of loans. These two bills. as passed by the Senate. exclusive of further commitments such as those for public housing. represent an increase of $1.3 billion over administration requests for new spending authorization. No one can foretell at this date what the effect of these bills would be on expenditures in the coming and subsequent fiscal years. but this type of fiscal legislation outside of annual appropriation control makes a shambles of orderly efforts to keep the budget in balance. Assuming enactment of the Senate housing bill. $11.9 billion would be available for expenditure in Federal housing programs. including $9 billion in unexpended balances remaining in prior authorizations. Assuming enactment of the Senate airport bill. $610 million would be available for expenditure in the airport program. including $145 million in unexpended balances remaining in prior authorizations. In addition to the $2.8 billion in new cash spending authorizations outside of effective appropriation control. the housing bill as passed by the Senate would further commit public credit for the insurance of private housing mortgages by a total of $10 billion.

But this magnificent achievement might be delayed for years because scientists in other nations--who might realize the implications of this information due to their own studieslack the necessary means of communication to obtain these findings. The magnitude of the problem is indicated by the fact that many scientific investigators find it less expensive and timeconsuming to conduct laboratory experiments anew than to search for previously reported dataeven though such data are known to exist.

Its inspired report recently issued justifies and indeed demands a continuation of its activity. Nor is it too early to consider implementation of the Commissions principal recommendations. Accordingly. I have introduced in the House today a bill. H.R. 9254. to establish an agency of the legislative branch of the Federal Government authorized to conduct the elections of Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is identical to S. 2535. introduced in the Senate of the United States on August 12. 1959. by the distinguished junior Senator from the State of Michigan . for himself and 14 other able Members of that distinguished body. The bill establishes a continuing agency of the Congress itself. designed to insure that registration and election procedures shall be reasonable. fair. and equally available to all our citizens. Under unanimous consent I include a sectionbysection analysis of the bill and excerpts from a study on the constitutionality of such legislation. prepared by the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress. to be inserted at this point in my remarks:",

In my opinion. the foreign aid provisions. in impoverishing America to build up socialism and communism in foreign lands. amount to treason. the extension of the socalled Civil Rights Commission. with the evident intent to overthrow the American way of life. amounts to tyranny. The Kremlin hierarchy would be proud to claim authorship of this combination. Khrushchev on his arrival a few hours from now will be well pleased with such a welcome as given him and his breed by the enactment of this bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in protest against this attempt to bury a vital civil rights issue through a rider to the mutual security appropriation bill under consideration. Furthermore. the fact that the rider seeks only to extend the life of the Civil Rights Commission. without meeting other demonstrated needs. is in itself a reason for just protest. Ever since I came to this House 9 years ago. I have vigorously insisted that failure to meet the need for adequate civil rights legislation would serve only to expose to a skeptical world a weakness in our own democracy that must be promptly and soundly remedied if our system of a free government by free men is to survive. It is incredible to me that action on this matter has been delayed until the closing hours of the Congress. It is even more incredible that the only possible action to be offered us before adjournment is through a rider which has no germane connection whatsoever. under House rules. with the bill to which it was attached by the other body. I am. of course. supporting the amendment favoring the extension of the Civil Rights Commission. I can perhaps best express the strength of my conviction on this issue. Mr. Speaker. by here stating that. contrary to my general custom on petitions. I immediately signed Congressman CELLES petition offered recently to bring out to the House floor the civil rights measure reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Even this bill is in itself inadequate and superficial. I express the hope that at the very beginning of the next session of the Congress we may face our responsibility in this matter honestly and courageously. I shall certainly. once more. do all within my power to secure enactment of sound and necessary civil rights legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I voted against the conference report on the Mutual Security Appropriation bill because I protest the conferees compromise on the Hardy amendment. Through the years I have supported the mutual security program and adequate appropriations to carry out its necessary and appropriate functions. But I think the conferees should not have yielded to executive pressures with respect to the phraseology contained in the Hardy amendment. which would have assured effective enforcement of the right of the Congress to complete and accurate information about the expenditure of foreign aid funds. I believe the bill should have been sent back to conference with instructions to stand fast in upholding the basic prerogatives and necessary factfinding powers of the Congress. as provided in the Hardy amendment. Mr. Speaker. I believe it is important to point out exactly what we have done and what we have not done in our final action on the Hardy amendment: First. the Hardy amendment. even in its tattered and decimated form does establish the principle that the Congress may employ the power of the purse to compel personnel in the executive branch of the Government to honor requests for information by the Congress. its committees. and the General Accounting Office through imposing limitations on the use of appropriated funds. Second. the watered down phraseology accepted by the conferees is not a recognition by the Congress of the alleged doctrine of executive privilege but rather it indicates only that the Congress. in its wisdom. has refrained from exercising its full power to obtain information from the executive branch of the Government. Although I am sympathetic with the conferees who were subjected to great pressure. I disagree with what appears to be their retreat in this important area of effective scrutiny by congressional committees of expenditures in the executive branch of Government. Therefore. I was compelled to vote against the conference report. However. let me hasten to add. Mr. Speaker. that I fully appreciate that we have established in law a foundation upon which to build in the future an effective means of obtaining facts with respect to the public business within the possession of executive agencies. without which the Congress cannot intelligently and wisely discharge its policymaking responsibilities.",

I want to make it clear that I am not opposing the mutual security appropriation. Mr. Speaker. I would like especially to commend the gentleman from Michigan for the effective work which he has done on this subject. He has made a study of it and he has been extremely helpful to me. In fact. we have joined our efforts to preserve the rights of the Congress in securing the information which is needed in order that we may carry out our constitutional responsibilities. Notwithstanding my disappointment in the action of the conferees. there is gratification in the fact that the Congress has clearly asserted its power to enforce its legislative and investigative prerogatives through employing its constitutional power of the purse.",

I have been impressed that on a number of key issues. very little opinion from the general public is obtained from correspondence. The highway bill which was passed by Congress last week and which provided for an increase in the gasoline tax of 1 cent for a period of at least 22 months is a very good example. Checking through the correspondence that I received on this measure. I find that a great number of letters were received but not over halfdozen which advocated the imposition of an additional 1 cent on the Federal gasoline tax were written by people who had no apparent connection with highway construction or the manufacture or sale of supplies for the construction of highways. The road user. the fellow who is going to pay an additional penny tax in addition to the tax increase of 2 cents recently imposed by the State of Ohio offered little comment on the type of highway program that Congress would enact. I am quite sure that each Member of Congress exercises an independent judgment in his action on legislative matters. If he were to be guided solely by the special interest mail he receives. he could be ignoring the wishes and the welfare of those who do not have such a special interest.",

T wal somewhat disturbed. as were some of my colleagues in Congress. to hear so much talk that Congress planned to adjourn prior to the arrival of the Premier of Russia by reason of fear. embarrassment or for all sorts of explanations which had in common the picture of Congress leaving Washington under a figurative cover of darkness. I feel that these statements were unwarranted. untrue and not at all helpful in our dealings with the Soviet Union. The fact of the matter is that in most years the final gavel of the Congress drops during the month of August and had the way been cleared for adjournment several weeks ago there would have been no question of the reason why the Congress adjourned. The simple explanation would have been what it is nowthat its work has been completed. This year for reasons known and unknown. good and bad. the work of the Congress was not completed until midSeptember !and this adjournment date coincided with the arrival in Washington of the controversial Mr. Khrushchev and his entourage.

I have never known a group of men and women assembled in this Chamber who I thought were more dedicated to the job they were trying to do here than the Members of the 86th Congress. We have done. in my opinion. a tremendous and outstanding job. I think we have really worked to the limit of our ability and our strength to try to do the things that we thought were in the interest of all the people of the United States of America. In broader fields. we have been almost unanimous in everything that had to do with our foreign affairs. hoping that our way of life and the leadership of the United States of America will prevail. We are and we must be the leaders of the world if there is going to be a free world and a place fit to live in to rear the boys and girls who will be the men and women in the numberless years. I trust. that this. the mightiest. the best. and the freest government ever devised by the wisdom of statesman. will live. When the Constitution of the United States was struck off after 4 short months in Philadelphia in 1787. from May until September. they brought forth a document which a great English statesman. Gladstone. said was the greatest document every struck off at one time by the hand and brain of man. We have had Congresses since then controlled by both parties and during all of that time the ancient faith has been lived up to. Today that document has been unchanged in its essentials and its fundamentals because it set up a representative form of government and no amendment that has been adopted to that Constitution from then up to now has changed it one particle.

Mrs. Estes. on her income tax returns for 1952 and 1953. reported as income certain disability payments received from her employer. Prior to the time the taxpayer filed these returns. the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held that such disability payments were excludable from gross income. although the Internal Revenue Service had ruled to the contrary. On April 1. 1957. the U.S. Supreme Court decided that disability payments of the type here in question were excludable from gross income. On April 15. 1957. Mrs. Estes filed claims for refund for 1952 and 1953 based upon the excludability of the disability pay received by her. These claims were rejected because they were filed after the expiration of the 3year period of limitations prescribed by law for the filing of such claims. During the last Congress. I approved legislation designed to grant general relief. on a nondiscriminatory basis. to taxpayers who had received disability pay which was excludable from gross income under the Supreme Court decision. This general legislation does not provide relief for taxpayers. such as Mrs. Estes. who did not attempt to protect their rights by filing timely claims for refund. The statutory period of limitations. which the Congress has included in the revenue system as a matter of sound policy. is essential in order to achieve finality in tax administration. A substantial number of taxpayers paid income tax on disability payments received by them and failed to file timely claims for refund. Accordingly. to grant special relief in this case. where a refund was not claimed in the time and manner prescribed by law. would be to discriminate against such other similarly situated taxpayers and to create an undesirable precedent. Under the circumstances. therefore. I am constrained to withhold my approval from the bill.",

Mrs. DAgostinos claim for gratuitous national service life insurance benefits. filed April 20. 1956. was denied by the Veterans Administration because it had not been filed within the statutory time limitation of 7 years after the date of death of her son on December 22. 1940. The Veterans Administration has also determined that. even if her claim had been timely filed. Mrs. DAgostino would not have been eligible for the benefit because her sons death had occurred not in line of duty and did not meet the criteria specified in the law for such benefits. A subsequent statutory liberalization of line of duty criteria had no retroactive effect. H.R. 1387. in addition to waiving the time limitation. would retroactively apply to this case the liberalized line of duty criteria enacted in September 1944. H.R. 3733 and H.R. 6529. 83d Congress. also sought retroactively to apply liberalized eligibility standards which. as a matter of law. had only prospective effect. In disapproving those measures I indicated that it seemed to me irrelevant and unwise to accept as justification for those bills the fact that an ineligible beneficiary could qualify under the then existing law which was never intended to have retroactive effect. My view has not changed and applies with equal force to the present case. Approval of H.R. 1387 would be discriminatory and would create an undesirable precedent. Uniformity and equality of treatment for all who are similarly situated must be the steadfast rule if Federal programs for veterans and their dependents are to be operated successfully. Approval of H.R. 1387 would not be in keeping with these principles.",

The new act. herein referred to as the conference report. with a few significant modifications. is essentially the LandrumGriffin bill which passed the House on August 14. 1959.

Moreover. the President. immediately following the inclusion of the bill of rights for union members in the bill which passed the Senate late in April 1959. publicly expressed his approval of that provision. no similar provision having been included either in the Presidents original recommendations or in the KennedyErvin bill either as introduced or reported in the Senate. Again. a few days before the passage of the LandrumGriffin bill in the House on August 14. 1959. the President. in a nationwide radio and television broadcast. stated his support of the LandrumGriffin bill. and specifically indicated those provisions of that bill which. in substance. embodied his own proposals and which were either totally absent or inadequately provided for in the measure passed by the Senate.

For years New Jersey commuters have complained about the income taxes they have had to pay if they work in New York or in Philadelphia. Their cry of \"taxation without representation.\" repeated year after year. seems to have yielded results. in New York State. at least. Recent declarations before and after the November election had indicated a willingness to talk over inequities in allowable deductions and other difficulties faced by nonresidents. Now that we are approaching a new climate of cooperation. the time for more formal action. as proposed in the new bill. has come. A constitutional amendment is a finesounding proposal for ultimate solution of the nomesident taxation problem. But it is long range and susceptible to all the ills that kill off constitutional amendments. I find it difficult to believe that the 31 States which now tax nonresidents will suddenly decide that they will abolish the taxes. We can keep this plan as a distant goal. but we must also do what we can in 1959 to ease unfair burdens on persons who live in one State and work in another. This problem is not unique to New Jersey.

Weather modification. popularly known as cloud seeding. is relatively new. although its feasibility has been generally recognized by responsible scientists. While a member of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Coinmittee. I had the opportunity of presiding at hearings on weather modification. Testimony during these hearings. for example. indicated that the streamflow of many of the rivers in the Sierra Nevada region in California and in Nevada had been increased some 9 percent as a result of a cloud seeding program on the western slopes of the high Sierras. I was privileged to be a cosponsor of a bill introduced in the last session which provided for research and evaluation in the field of weather modification. That bill delegated to the National Science Foundation the responsibility for operating the program. Mr. President. at the outset of the current session of Congress our able majority leader outlined a legislative program which. among other things. called for a program to step up the supply and conservation of water for the West. The bill which was introduced on yesterday by the distinguished junior Senator from California is designed to assist in carrying out that legislative mandate by providing the necessary tools to increase the annual water supply in the great Colorado River drainage basin. This measure will work no miracles.

The Attorney General made it very clear that this amendment is. in his view. unnecessary. at best. At worst. the amendment could cause litIgation which would further bedevil what is already a bill going only a minimal way toward meeting the needs which are shown even in the voting rights field. As to the due process of law argument. there Is completely adversary proceeding at the beginning. when a pattern of practice is found. There is a completely adversary proceeding at the end. when. whether the court acts or the voting referee acts. the question comes up for determination. subject to any appeal and any objection. and any trial on all the facts. as to whether the particular individual whose name is to be recorded may be permitted to register and vote under the order originally made by the court. In the intervening period. the proceedings are ex parte. That is the way the Senate decided it wants to keep them. TIhis should be true whether the proceedings are before a court or before a voting referee. We should do the same thing for both. in order to carry out the full legislative scheme. In view of the fact that at best. the amendment is unnecessary. I hope the Zonate will reject it.",

I recall that when we had this issue up in 1957 an article was printed in the Richmond NewsLeader from the leader of the NAACP in Virginia. from which I should like to quote a paragraph. The article was published on July 31. 1957. The headline reads \"Protests Cleared Promptly.\" In part. it reads: No serious or effective efforts are made in Virginia to prevent Negroes from registering or voting. according to W. Lester Banks. secretary of State conference of branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Banks was asked for comment today in light of charges and countercharges being aired in the Senate in debate over the pending civil rights bill. \"Since 1951 and 1952.\" he said. \"most complaints we have heard have been minor in nature.\" He added that all such complaints had been \"cleared up promptly\" by telephone calls either to individual registrars or to Levin Nock Davis. secretary of the State board of elections.

The suit in Georgia had been dismissed and was on appeal. the one in Louisiana was pending. In short. no one had yet been registered through the civil remedies of the 1957 act. That is a blanket denunciation that nothing had been done. although the man to do it was the Attorney General. They criticized him for delay and. in effect. inefficiency. These statements were true on September 9. 1959. when the report was submitted. But these statements are no longer true. Both the Georgia case and the Louisiana case have been decided in favor of the Department of Justice. and the Alabama case is about to be argued.

It is almost sickening to look at and to think that such material is being sent throughout the United States. When we saw that material we immediately got busy as a committee and tried to do something. The Senator from Oklahoma. as chairman of the subcommittee. did the work that really shaped the bill when it reached us from the House. I am glad to say that I believe that the proposed legislation will do some good. We have plenty of work to do in this field in the future. I wish to call to the attention of the people of the United States the fact that when they hear about filthy mail being sent through the mails. they should call it to the attention of the Postmaster General immediately so that he can follow it up and stop it. The Postmaster General attempts to find where the mail is coming from. and though sometimes the senders get away with the practice for a long while and make a great deal of money out of the business before it is stopped. I am sorry to say. nevertheless offenders eventually will be discovered. I urge all Americans to call to the attention of the Postmaster General immediately any violations which come to their knowledge in order that we can stop the flow of this kind of literature through the mails. Again I wish to commend the Senator from Oklahoma for the work he has done on the subcommittee in this particular field.",

The bill has bipartisan support. including the support of the ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking and Currency. The bill does two things. It increases the revolving fund of the Small Business Administration by $75 million. The Small Business Administration originally requested $150 million. but agreed with the committee that $75 million would be satisfactory. This amount will take the program into fiscal 1962. The second principal provision is the provision to attempt to secure for small business a fairer share of the Government procurement dollar. I understand the Senator from Alabama . who.

The current total disability rating Is $225 monthly. For the most seriously disabled the maximum rate is $450 with $150 additional if the individual is not being hospitalized at Government expense. thus the top rating today is $600 monthly. This new rate of $265 is an intermediate rate and applies to a veteran who is totally disabled and whose activities are so restricted as to make him permanently housebound. This does not mean that he is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person. The terms of the legislation would be met if the veteran is substantially confined to his house or the ward and clinical areas. if he is in a hospital. and is reasonably certain to so remain during the balance of his lifetime. The Veterans Administration estimates that this bill would cost approximately $7.200.000 for each of the first 5 years following its enactment. The bill is favored by the Veterans Administration and has been described by that agency as both a \"reasonable and equitable approach to providing relief\" for this group of veterans.

I am thoroughly convinced now that we are not going to be able to satisfy the executive. even if we gave them every dime that they requested. We were home for 5 weeks of a brief respite from our labors. Lo and behold. during those brief 5 weeks. the executive cooked up a request for an additional $700 million.

I wish to commend the managers for the conference report in general. and particularly for going along with the other body In permitting the use of technical assistance -funds. up to $10.000. to help defray the cost of the already authorized study of the feasibility and practicability of a * Point 4 Youth Corps. This will enable the International Cooperation Administration to go forward promptly in commissioning such a study by a university or private foundation. I am informed that the ICA is going ahead on this. and that we may look for the completion of such a study early in 1961. It is Important that the timetable be adhered to. so that the new Congress may consider the studys recommendations early In the new session. Those who are preparing this study should draw heavily upon the heartening -experience of the International Voluntary Services agricultural team now at work in Vietnam. under the leadership of Gordan L. Brockmueller. The May 1960 report of the team in Vietnam gives an exciting account of how the dozen or so young Americans comprising the team have been conveying agricultural knowhow to the Vietnamese on a shirtsleeve to shirtsleeve basis. Those who have become disillusioned with much of our foreign aid program will find themselves singing \"three cheers for the red. white. and blue\" when they hear about what these young Americans are doing in Vietnam. It may well be a model for what the Point 4 Youth Corps seeks to accomplish.",

The conference report on the public works bill will be filed tonight. That will leave only the second supplemental bill. passed today. remaining for disposition. Even allowing for the customary excesses attendant to the last chance supplemental of the session. it now appears a certainty that the bills will aggregate something less than the Presidents requests for appropriations. If Khrushchev had not wrecked the summit meeting. the reduction could have been larger. These recordbreaking budgets have hiked the public debt by more than $20 billion in the last 7 years.

H.R. 968 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to construct the Bully Creek extension as an addition to the facilities of the existing Vale Federal reclamation project in Oregon. The legislation authorizes the appropriation of about $3.3 million for this development. Following the usual procedure. the actual appropriation of funds would be made later in the annual Public Works Appropriation Acts. The Bully Creek extension is a multiplepurpose development serving principally the purposes of irrigation and flood control. However. in addition. benefits would accrue to fish and wildlife and to recreation. The Bully Creek extension meets all the criteria and standards normally required for sound and feasible development. On an annual basis the benefits from development would exceed the costs by better than three to one. and the full reimbursable cost allocated to irrigation. amounting to $1.700.000. would be repaid by the water users in a period of 50 years. The floodcontrol allocation is $1.497.000. and the small allocations to fish and wildlife and to recreation. totaling $129.000. would be nonreimbursable in recognition of these national benefits. The proposed development Involves construction of a 32.000 acrefeet reservoir and additional irrigation works to provide a firm irrigation water supply to an additional 3.000 acres. No new lands would be brought into cultivation. This supplemental irrigation supply would help stabilize the farm income and increase business activity in the area. Operation of the reservoir would afford considerable additional flood protection and reduce flood damage. Mr. Speaker. the Irrigation and Reclamation Subcommittee held hearings on this legislation and gave to the proposed development very thorough consideration and study. The committee concluded that the Bully Creek extension was physically and economically feasible. and was urgently needed in the area to stabilize the local economy and provide flood protection. The Bully Creek extension has the unanimous support of the local people and area. and the committee received no testimony in opposition to it. The Department of Interior has submitted both a project feasibility report and a report on this bill recommending the authorization and construction of the Bully Creek extension. Both reports have been reviewed and cleared by the Bureau of the Budget. The BuIlly Creek extension is one of the best small reclamation projects the committee has considered and I hope that this legislation will be passed.",

This is a singlepurpose irrigation development estimated to cost about $5.100.000. The actual appropriation of funds. of course. would be made later in the annual Public Works Appropriation Acts. This proposed development consists of a pipe distribution system to provide a full water supply to 10.290 acres by pumping from ground water.

Crops grown on the project include peas and beans. alfalfa. irrigated pasture. tree fruit. truck and speciality crops which. for the most part. are crops that do not contribute to our agricultural surplus problem. The Irrigation and Reclamation Subcommittee held hearings on this bill and concluded that the Spokane Valley project met all of the requirements normally required for a favorable recommendation.

In just the past few weeks. two major failures in the present system have occurred posing a serious threat to the water users who depend on the system. One branch of the main canal washed out completely and several other sections collapsed. Complete failure is imminent. It has been determined that a new system for pumping from the underground reservoir would better meet the needs of the area than replacement of the present gravity system. The project lands consist of 10.290 acres of which 8.370 are presently irrigated and 1.920 are now dry. All but 197 acres of the project lands are located in the State of Washington. The estimated cost of the project is $5.100.000. all of which is allocated to irrigation and is reimbursable. This bill provides that the total amount shall be repaid by the water users over a 50year period. exclusive of a development period which might be required.

I have never seen a more abject surrender than that of the present President of the United States to the moneychangers of the Nation. Strong Presidents have resisted this power to dominate fiscal affairs by control of other peoples money in the deposits in banks and insurance companies. Now we see the power of the money market control. Even the Federel Reserve System. which was established as a safeguard for the peoples interest. today has more concern with the profits which it makes on rediscount. the profits it makes through the tight money policy. than it has with the responsibility which the authors of the Federal Reserve System intended be exercised when they created this great institution. the Federal Reserve Board. Let me illustrate that point. The Federal Reserve Board. if it has a duty at all. is supposed to provide a stable money supply and also to prevent the violent upswings and downswings in our monetary policy. Since 1955. the Federal Reserve Board has reduced its longterm bond holdings--that is. bonds running 5 years or moreby 372 percent. Today. the longterm bond holdings of this great institution. the central bank of America. amount to only $900 million. Think of that-$900 million in longterm bonds. But the Federal Reserve Board tells us that the greater the amount of holdings in longterm bonds the greater the stability of the public debt. The commercial banks. which the Federal Reserve Board. the Comptroller of the Currency. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are supposed to advise. since 1955 have reduced their longterm bond holdings by 54.6 percent. The mutual savings banks and building and loan associations. which are supposed to provide a reservoir for savings. would be a wonderful market for our Federal bonds or longterm bonds. but they have reduced their longterm holdings by 26.2 percent.",

    "speech": "I will yield in a minute. when I have finished my statement. The insurance companies. which use not their own money. but the savings of the little people of America. have reduced their holdings of longterm debt by 25.6 percent. Then who is holding on to the longterm Government bonds? I will tell the Senate. It has been the little people of America. a part of the 185 million. who are buying bonds on the savings and payroll deduction basis. These are the people who have confidence in U.S. bonds. These are the people whom the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico is designed to protect. The amount of their holdings of individual savings bonds has declined only 6 percent from 1955 until now. They are the people who are the backbone of America. This is where the emphasis is. When the moneychangers refused to buy the securities of the United States. the people came forward and said. \"We will lend our savings by way of payroll deductions.\" Certainly. perhaps it is possible to hijack a higher interest rate out of Uncle Sam by political machinations or Federal Reserve action. or by other means. But the little people are pretty well satisfied to ride with Uncle Sam. because they think their investment is important. is vital to the longterm stability of our Nation. Of the other groups I have mentioned. the Federal Reserve holdings are down 37.5 percent. commercial bank holdings are down 54.6 percent. building and loan association and mutual bank holdings are down 26.2 percent. and insurance company holdings are down 25.6 percent. What has happened? The distinguished Senator from Indiana in the Committee on Banking and Currency has consistently supported increasing the interest rate of the Siamese twin of the Government bond. namely. the Governmentinsured mortgage. which is backed by the credit of the U.S. Government. and which has almost the same security as a Government bond. The distinguished Senator from Indiana and the agencies of Government have consistently asked for congressional authority to raise the interest ceiling on Governmentinsured mortgages. Obviously. the insurance companies are going to take their profit. the banks will take their profit. and the Federal Reserve will turn its back on Uncle Sam and will say. \"We dont care what happens.\"",

The Congress itself is helping to create this chaotic condition. by permitting the issuance of Governmentinsured mortgages which bear a much higher interest rate than do the savings bonds or the marketable bonds for the longterm Government debt. In all my life I have never seen a worse example of fiscal mismanagement. There has been complete. abject surrender to the money markets of Wall Street and the insurance interests. who are investing in Governmentinsured mortgages and Governmentinsured securities. and are constantly demanding higher interest rates. In other words. the large investors have almost completely avoided their obligation to buy Government bonds. and they have created this situation.

I say that as one of those in favor of recapturing some of those powers. I was one of the sponsors of the Government Corporations Control Act when I was a Member of the House. I sought to bring the TVA under the control of the Government Corporations Control Act. If my memory serves me correctly. we set up a plan whereby the TVA would start to pay back something on the investment. The pending bill provides better control even than we sought to get at that time. I think the bill ought not to be recommitted.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself 2 minutes on the bill. I want to say to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire while he makes a plea for congressional control. the real weakness I see here is that we have a corporation with an investment of $1 2 billion of the peoples money. There is authority to issue bonds. funds for which will have to be extracted from the people and will constitute an expenditure. Yet the President of the United States is actually denied real authority and surveillance over the operation. because he becomes a conveyor. or a transmission belt. When the power budget of the TVA comes up for consideration. he can add his recommendations. But it is not the Presidents budget. This is just as clear as crystal. It is the only agency I know of in the whole scheme of Government that would enjoy that kind of privilege. How can one circumvent an agency when it is an executive agency? When Arthur Morgan. a Director of the TVA. was discharged. Robert Jackson. later a Justice of the Supreme Court. had to make a finding on that question. His finding was that TVA was an executive agency. That question was tested in the Federal Court of Appeals here in Washington. The court of appeals said TVA is an executive agency. Franklin Roosevelt said it was an executive agency. and included it in his consolidated budget. It has been there year after year. But the incumbent President of the United States is going to be denied budgetary control over one of the largest corporations in the country. so that the parent has no surveillance or control over the child. I think. traditionally. it is rather unhealthy in our scheme of things to make such a provision. Under the circumstances. I feel impelled to support the motion to recommit. I think the committee has done a good job in other respects. but I do not want to see a corporation of this size roaming loose in the land. so to speak. without a line of responsibility going to the Chief Executive. where it belongs.",

I thought we might as well pass on the issue now as later. However. I am not in favor of the bill. I make this statement for myself and for my distinguished colleague. the junior Senator from Florida . We both oppose the bill upon final passage for reasons which we think are sound. We understand that it is necessary to make this statement. because we are informed that there has been an agreement not to have a yeaandnay vote on final passage. in order to accommodate certain Senators. and I certainly wish to stand by that agreement. In the first place. we believe that the bill surrenders. in part. the power of the purse in a way which is not salutary. and that it should not be done by the Congress. In the second place. we believe that a completely wrong precedent is being set. and that it is extremely unsound and undesirable to allow bonds to be issued in this way by an agency against security which is. in fact. Federal revenue. Federal funds. that is. the net income from the sale of power of federally owned dams and steam powerplants. In the third place. we think it is undesirable and unfair to have an extension of territory served by TVA. We pay tribute to the efforts of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Georgia to restrict the extension of territory as much as has been done by their amendment. But we think it is unsound to extend the territory at all. We believe it is clear from the gentlemans agreement which was placed in the RECORD by the Senator from Florida earlier today that this means the Senate takes it upon itself to throw out the window the gentlemans agreement heretofore entered into between the TVA and the public power companies and. as I understand it. strictly observed up to this time.",

Lastly. we believe that this precedent will surely rise to plague the Congress. because the Tennessee River. the Tennessee Valley and the streams in that basin are not the only important area of power development which has been financed out of Federal money. and while the organization in those other areas is not identical with TVA. the fact is they could easily be made so in the Columbia Basin. in the Missouri Basin. in the Colorado Basin. and in other areas. and we believe this is a precedent which should not be set.

The existing system is costly. it is not providing real assistance where it is most needed. and it is fast becoming divorced from the realities of modernday agricultural production techniques. The taxpayers. particularly the city consumers. are paying a double crushing tax under the present program. the article points out \"the cost of the subsidy plus higher prices for food.\" A new look at this expensively mushrooming program is essential. The problems of supply and demand as well as an adequate living standard for our farmers should be approached in the light of modern concepts and means. not through an antiquated. extravagant. subsidy program. To emphasize this need.

In its aspirations for cementing a nation of free people. it compares favorably with our great Declaration of Independence. Its structure closely followed our own form of representative government as initiated by our Founding Fathers. The Soviet Iron Curtain has never been able to dim the ardor of the Polish people for freedom and independence. They have long now endured unbearable physical and mental suffering. However. their ordeals have strengthened the moral fiber of the Polish people and have increased their determination to help themselves at the earliest opportunity to regain their freedom. We should all have an abiding respect for those resolute men and women who displayed such courage and fortitude in the face of tremendous odds and the most brutal reprisals by the Soviet tyrants. A passion for liberty denied them in their homeland resulted in the migration of many Poles to our shores. Polands loss was our gain as they came here endowed with a high purpose of patriotism. They helped cultivate our soil. developed our coal and iron mines. and made tremendous contributions in all fields to the expansion of our Industry. They greatly contributed to the spiritual and religious growth of our country. The 168th anniversary of the Polish constitution is an appropriate occasion for all of us to express appreciation to all Americans of Polish birth or descent for their contributions in the defense and development of our great country. It is my fervent hope that the day may soon come when Poland will have a rebirth of freedom under the type of constitution whose establishment is now being commemorated.",

It is because of this complete integration of radio in the lives of the American people that I wish to be recorded as a devoted believer in the designation of May as National Radio Month. We in the Congress have of course an acute awareness of the now indispensable service that radio performs for the people on behalf of government. Radio is without the shadow of a doubt. the most powerful bulwark to democracy since printing. It is bringing the spoken word to 66 milion Americans every day. over more than 3.900 AM and FM stations. It means that government and news. educaton and entertainment. and enlightened salesmanship and advertising are within easy and pleasant earshot of 97 percent of all American homes. These enjoy a total of no less than 150 million radio sets. This is to say nothing of the radios in 38 million automobiles. There is the incalculable life and treasure saving performance. on the heroic scale. that is now the daily selfaccepted duty of radio. warning us of disasters. helping us when catastrophe strikes. It is in one sense the very heartbeat of our system of defense. Like few other services I can call to mind the work of radio in the public interest makes it the champion of the peoples needs and desires and earns it our very special gratitude and applause.

In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House and other committees of this Congress Secretary McElroy has repeatedly said that even though the Russians may be outproducing us in guided missiles. we still do not have to worry about matching their production item for item in 1960. I was amazed then to find that on April 27. in an address before the Bureau of Advertising of the American Newspaper Publishers Association dinner in New York City he declared that the Soviets may be increasing their military spending by as much as 50 percent over the next 7 years. and that such action would force us in this country to match the Soviets or even better them in the field of military production. This situation. said the Secretary. would confront the Nation with one of the hard choices which we may soon have to make. I wonder if this speech means that the Secretary has changed his thinking about the adequacy of the 1960 military budget? It certainly looks that way. It does seem to me that at the very least Secretary McElroy owes it to the Congress to come back here and tell us whether he has changed his thinking. If. as he says. we are going to have to face up to some hard choices with regard to our military strength because of increased Soviet productive capacity. then perhaps we in Congress ought to start thinking about those hard choices now rather than waiting until later on. I think the speech of the Secretary deserves the conscientious consideration of every Member of this body. and I am asking that it be inserted in the RECORD.",

H.R. 4797. and more importantly presented persuasive arguments as to why America must maintain preeminence in the field of basic research. Mr. Cresap pointed out that society gets a big bargain with the dollars it invests in research. He cited estimates by the McGrawHill department of economics that 13 percent of all manufacturers sales this year will be accounted for by new products. products which were not made 4 years ago. Mr. Cresap pointed out that most of these products are the result of research and development and that these products amounted to some $51 billion in extra taxable business. Mr. Cresap also cited instances in which other American leaders in industry. education. and government have urged the expansion of our basic research endeavors in behalf of military and economic strength. Mr. Speaker. in my judgment. Mr. Cre. sap has demonstrated industrial statesmanship of the highest order in the remarks he made before the Economic Club of Detroit.

Congress has recently passed legislation dealing with this matter for taxable years after December 31. 1960. and the purpose of the Senate amendment is to provide a solution for open years prior to 1961 by establishing a similar cutoff point. It should be made clear that this tax treatment would be based on a taxpayer election and if the taxpayer desires not to make the election. the cutoff point in his case for open years would be determined under existing law. The House accepted the Senate amendment. The second Senate amendment pertains to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code affecting income tax exemption and deductibility of contributions with respect to certain pension plans. The House accepted the Senate amendment with an amendment. The third Senate amendment arises from the fact that several States have recently enacted legislation which has enabled accrual basis taxpayers to claim that they are entitled to deduct in 1 taxable year property taxes for 2 taxable years. To deal with this situation the Senate amendment would deny an accrual basis taxpayer the right to deduct more than 1 years State taxes in 1 Federal taxable year. The conferees in agreeing on this amendment have made it clear that the legislation is to be prospective so that taxpayers who have acted in good faith in taking deductions in the past under existing law will be treated universally and not be subjected to retroactive action. The House accepted the Senate amendment. Mr. Speaker. the conference agreement should be adopted.",

In a recent broadcast he said: One of the most helpful things that I see in America today is the growing number of people who are coming to associate our cherished freedom with our inherited faith. In recent weeks. there have been other broadcasts and a number of sermons preached on the theme that our form of government is based upon the teachings of the Bible and calling attention to the fact that implicit in the propaganda program of the Communists to destroy our democratic institutions is an effort to repudiate the Bible and destroy our faith in God. All polls indicate that the current major concern of the American people is fear of another world war. Candidates for public office are promising a major strengthening of our defense posture. While God undoubtedly expects those made in His image to utilize the powers with which He has endowed them the Bible clearly teaches that we labor in vain to build a temple of peace that is not dedicated to the victory of moral force. Many will recall that in the midst of framing a great instrument under which we have enjoyed constitutional liberty the venerable Franklin said: If it be true that not a sparrow can fall to the ground without His notice. how can we hope to see a new empire rise without His aid?

A condemnation of the Communistinfluenced government of Fidel Castro will. we hope. result from the conference and lead to further measures for quarantining the Communist Infection in Cuba. It Is much easier. however. to condemn Communist actions than it is to plan constructive counteractions. I want today to call attention to an excellent article by Bernard J. Flatow entitled \"A Suggestion for Meeting the Communist Threat in Latin America.\" which was printed in the August 8 issue of Export Trade. because in this article Mr. Flatow does have some positive and very good proposals for U.S. action in Latin America. One of the major points which Mr. Flatow makes. is that the Communists have relied heavily on the anticause to unite their followerscauses like antiimperialism. antimilitarism. antinuclear weapons. What we can do to combat this. Mr. Flatow urges. is to adopt a few anticauses of our owncauses like antiviolence. anticensorship. antiilliteracy. antiSoviet intervention in national politics. These causes. he suggests. can easily be promoted through such existing civic groups such as Rotary clubs. Boy and Girl Scouts. professional groups. labor unions. church groups. and other similar organizations. I have found many of Mr. Flatows suggestions interesting and perceptive. I believe that they deserve a wide circulation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to include this article in the Appendix of the REcoRD. A6138",

Such was the shock I experienced upon the sad news of the passing of my good friend. my colleague and office neighbor. AL BUSH. AL BUSH was a good citizen. In this body of 437 men and women. which we like to think of as the outstanding institution for selfgovernment by the people of all time. AL BusH. in his quiet way made a most significant contribution. He was not the flashily articulate exponent of popular causes nor one to engage in the repartee and clash of congressional debate. But. with his friendly smile and a devotion to his country and the principles which he deeply believed would further her best interests. he diligently ministered to the needs of his constituency. Both in his participation in the work of his committees. and in the deliberations of the House itself he cast his votes and made his decisions for the benefit of all Americans. It would be impossible to dislike AL BUSH. He genuinely liked others. and all of his colleagues. whatever their political views or their personal natures. could not help but return the genuine friendliness of this man. Mr. Speaker. this House needs orators. it needs pioneers. it needs strategists. but it also needs friendly. rightthinking men and women. That is why we all will miss AL BUSH.

The news of AL BUSHs sudden heart seizure. on November 4. and death in Williamsport Hospital on the following day. brought shock and sorrow to me. as to all who knew him. AL BUSH was a devoted public servant. putting his business astuteness and his energetic determination into the advancement of the sometimes unpopular cause of governmental economy. Much of our legislation. over the past 9 years. has profited from the vigilance and good sense of ALVIN BUSH. His knowledge and experience in the field of bus transportation were often called upon. in his work with the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. and A191 with the Subcommittee on Transportation and Aeronautics. It will long be remembered to his credit that he was an enthusiastic supporter of little league baseball. and proud of the claim of Williamsport. in his district. to have founded little league baseball. In the past session. he had sponsored a resolution to establish a National Little League Baseball Week. We shall miss his aid as a legislator. but more than that. in the days ahead. we shall miss his quiet. friendly presence. and the feeling that. whatever our differences. we were all trying to accomplish a task together. for the common good of our Nation and of our home districts.

Most of my colleagues recall that HERMAN EBERHARTER during the last 2 or 3 years prior to his death had difficulty getting about because of illness. It was in 1946 when a subcommittee of our Committee on Ways and Means was organized. to look into the question of excise taxes. that most of us felt that HERMAN EBERHARTER should be resting instead of working. At that time our departed colleague. Jere Cooper. who was chairman. thought he was doing HERMAN a favor by not assigning him to a subcommittee. HERMAN was hurt. terribly hurt by that fact. He talked with the chairman and the chairman then assigned him to the excise tax committee of which I was chairman. I can testify here that no man worked harder in that subcommittee than did HERMAN EBERHARTER. despite his illness.

Though we were on opposite sides of the aisle in this Capitol Building. we often sat down and worked together on legislation designed to benefit our constituencies and the Nation. I respected HERMANs broad knowledge. and I appreciated his advice. He was particularly formidable in his unique ability to anticipate the conclusions of colleagues with whom he shared membership on the Committee on Ways and Means. This analytical advantage made it possible to save considerable time and effort in the preparation and presentation of legislation. just as it was to accrue eventually to the benefit of the general welfare. I miss HERMAN EBERHARTER. In the years gone by I enjoyed the company of him and his wife. Emma. who went to her reward before him. More recently.

Even though he was born. reared. educated. and lived most of his lifetime in a large metropolitan area such as Pittsburgh. he knew and thoroughly understood the problems of the smaller urban and rural areas. His sound philosophy of government was reflected in his thinking and in his actions as a Member of this body: The greatest good for the greatest number of our citizens was his yardstick of governmental responsibility.

I think the suspension provision in this bill is ample to give the commission the power it needs without this additional penalty of $1.000 per day. I call attention to the language in this section which states that such forfeiture shall be in addition to any other penalty. In my opinion the Commission now has adequate authority to enforce its orders without including either the suspension or forfeiture provisions in this bill. In any event. I submit it is not necessary to impose both penalties. and I feel the forfeiture section should be deleted. I commend the committee on reporting a good bill. but I think the committee has gone too far in adopting these penalty provisions. I have received information that there is concern in the radio and television industry over these penalty sections. I feel that the amendments we have adopted to both the suspension and forfeiture sections are most constructive and helpful. However. I contend that we do not need both of these penalties in this bill. and I hope the amendment eliminating the forfeiture provision will be adopted.",

However. I am not just sure as to where the gentlewoman started to be facetious in her speech and where she was serious. Thinking over what I understood her to say. at first it all seemed very logical and clear to her that employees of the Federal Government should be required to take a loyalty oath. and yet she thought that we were being inconsistent or not being entirely fair and realistic in requiring a schoolteacher to take a loyalty oath. Now. what is the distinction? Certainly an employee in the gentlewomans office. for instance. is indirectly an employee of the Federal Government. I do not think it is any more of an unfair requirement for that employee to take a loyalty oath than the employee of her local school board who is teaching the children of her own community.

Some of my superiors doubtless thought that I was kind of an \"odd ball.\" I do not think I was an \"odd ball.\" I do not think there was a need for that oath for Government service or for schoolteachers or for anything else.

S. 3846. for the establishment of an advisory board to the regents of the Smithsonian Institution. for the purpose of determining the feasibility. location. and authority of an Armed Forces Museum. The proposed board would be a continuation of a Commission appointed by the President of the United States. more than 18 months ago. and headed by the Chief Justice of the United States. Mr. Warren. Also serving on that Commission were the Secretary of Defense. now Mr. Gates. two Members of the House of Representatives. the Senator from New Mexico and myself. from the Senate. and several persons from private life. The Commission was appointed to study the subject of an Armed Forces Museum. It filed with the President of the United States an interim report. and more recently it has filed its final report. The final report indicates that in the unanimous opinion of the Commission. an advisory board to the Smithsonian regents should be established by means of congressional action. in order to continue the study and determine the feasibility of such a museum. The purpose of the museum is not alone to show what the Armed Forces are doing for the security of the country or what they have done in past centuries for its security. The museum would also give some indication of the other values of the Armed Forces. such as in our moral relationships. our social relationships. and our scientific relationships and accomplishments. So this bill will. if it is adopted by Congress. established an advisory board for the purpose of continuing this study and giving advice to the regents of the Smithsonian Institution. in order that ultimately Congress may consider this problem of establishing in or near the District of Columbia an Armed Forces Museum. That bill has now been referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. I hope that the committee will make a report and that the Congress. before it adjourns in September. will be able to pass the bill to establish the advisory board.",

It Is encouraging to note that the State Department has expressed its revulsion about the unconscionable imprisonment of Bishop Walsh and has lodged the strongest possible protest with the representative of the Chinese Communist regime. Very many people in the Nation and throughout the world will applaud the State Department for the efforts it is making to free Bishop Walsh and his colleagues. As the Department points out. the rest of the world joins in condemning the action taken against a citizen of the United States and a distinguished member of the Catholic clergy. It is true as the Department asserts that his only mission was religious. and his personal devotion to the spiritual welfare of his fellow Catholics was so deep as to compel him to remain on the Chinese mainland despite the persecution of his church by a godless regime. I am pleased to have the assurances that the Department will continue to seek by every feasible means the release of Bishop Walsh as well as the four other Americans still held in prison by the Chinese Communists in violation of the 1955 pledge to free them. As pointed out. these five men are in effect political hostages of the Chinese Communists who refuse to release them regardless of all humanitarian considerations. I know that a great many people in this country as well as in the world will be thankful to Secretary Herter. Assistant Secretary William B. Macomber.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. to say merely that there is a difference of opinion between the EisenhowerBensonNixon administration and the majority in Congress concerning farm legislation is a gross understatement. Congress has passed five farm bills outlining their preferred approach which have been voted. When the legislation on the books was expiring. Congress had to accept the administrations proposals or there would be no legislation and under these circumstances. Congress was bludgeoned into passing the flexible price support law and granting the authority requested by the administration. Experience has shown this EisenhowerBensonNixon approach of low prices and no controls to be a miserable failure based upon economic theories applicable only to countries with food and fiber shortages. I do not feel disrespectful toward those who. with intellectual honesty. cling to these old. thoroughly discredited theories. but Members of Congress who are seeking solutions in good faith and are even willing to make reasonable compromises become somewhat disgusted when those who are apparently barren of constructive ideas. make statements based upon false interpretations of proposed legislation rather than offer any constructive alternative. The National Republican chairman. Senator MORTON. in a speech in the district I have the privilege to represent. followed this negative approach. Instead of coming forth with some constructive and reasonable alternative. Mr. MORTON embarked upon a negative intemperate and irresponsible tirade against the possibility of various approaches possible under the Poage bill. It is obvious that the farmers and all taxpayers lose under the administrations approach of producing for Government bins. The only ones who gain from this are the newcomer. flybynight grain storage operator who was never in the grain merchandising business and the processor who now has his normal inventory carried by the Government. The Morton speech places the \"new team\" of Nixon and Morton squarely behind the Benson approach and repudiates the Presidents apparent offer to start working toward a compromise bill. It is disappointing and discouraging to taxpayers. farmers. and those in farm related industries. and in fact to everyone except those few flybynight storage cronies of the administration who dont want their playhouse wrecked.

We suspect that she had worked hard throughout most of her life. and had known. perhaps. more than her share of the hardships that go with life. The good things came to her late. but happily. not too late. Somehow. in our conversations with her. she always reminded us of that wonderful story about the Roman noblewoman. who when asked where her jewels were. drew her sons closely around her and said: \"These are my jewels.\" The elevation of her son to nationwide prominence left Mrs. HarmOn with mixed feelings. She was most proud of her son. as only a mother. who had borne him. who had nurtured him. who had hoped for him. could be. and yet motherlike. she was terribly upset by some of the unkind words that the press wrote about her son. \"He can handle himself. dont worry about it.\" we once told her.

The inclusion of the Wells Harbor project in the pending amendment along with these 10 other projects is greatly appreciated by me in the interests of my constituents in the town of Wells. as well as the entire southwesterly section of Maine. This improvement to the coastal resources of my State will result in gains far beyond the costs of the projects. Fishermen. pleasureboat enthusiasts. and taxpayers alike benefit through this type of development of this great natural resource of ours. the coastal shoreline of Maine. In fact. Mr. Chairman. this is a selfliquidating project. increasing the real values of the community and the entire area. The history of the Wells area is most interesting. In 1873. the Federal Government repaired a Government pier at Wells Harbor and straightened and deepened the channel over the entrance bar. This work was completed at a cost of $5.000. Since 1873. there have been no additional Federal expenditures for maintenance so that now only ruins of the pier remain. The town has constructed seawalls for the protection of private property near the harbor entrance. but has been unable to afford additional urgently needed expenditures for navigational improvement of the harbor. The town of Wells is one of Maines wellknown vacation areas for those who love the sea and our beaches. This is evidenced by the fact that the towns permanent population is 2.300 while during the summer the towns population mounts to over 20.000. The principal economic activities in Wells are centered around commercial fishing and the summer recreational business. Both of these endeavors require modern. efficient. and safe navigational facilities. However. incredible as it may seem. there is at present no waterborne commerce or vessel traffic at Wells Harbor. Locally owned recreational and commercial fishing craft are based at other harbors. which have been similarly improved under FederalStatecommunity projects. The adequate harbor facilities to be provided by this project are urgently required to meet local commercial fishing and recreational needs. - The monetary dividends which will result from the development of the Wells Harbor project will return manifold the Federal investment of $340.000 authorized by this amendment. These projects which are before the House today in this omnibus bill constitute an investment in our Nations future. Consequently. I strongly urge adoption of the pending amendment and passage of the bill.",

I am informed that arrangements wil soon be announced whereby the Vici President of the United States and large party. including the president o: Johns Hopkins University. will leavi Friendship on a brandnew jet aircraf and will arrive in Moscow 8 hours later Mr. Speaker. this is significant for two reasons: Friendship was the first airport on the Atlantic seaboard to be ready for jet operations and Pan American World Airways. which will fly the Vice President in its new 707321 airplane. made the first jet operation in and out of Friendship. The Russian aircraft which brought First Deputy Premier Koslov to the United States 2 weeks ago required 11 hours for the trip. Pan American is confident that it can cut that flying time by approximately 3 hours. If this estimate is correct we have at our disposal an infinitely valuable propaganda weapon with which to combat the Soviet Unions boasts and exaggerations. Another thing. Mr. Speaker. is the matter of competing air service between the United States and Russia. Pan American has a longstanding certificate for operations between the United States and Moscow. Early implementation of that certificateand. reciprocally. giving equal privileges to the Russian airline. Aeroflot. could conceivably bring about a lessening of the cold war. Travel has long been referred to as a great broadener. travel between the United States and the Soviet Union. by Americans and Russians. would unquestionably be all to the good for all concerned. Let us hope the latest mission to Moscow brings a bilateral air agreement a little closer to realization. When that momentous treaty is finally signed. I can assure you that Friendship Airport will stand eager and able to handle the flights of both airlines in both directions.",

Mr. Speaker. the overseas airlines of the United States are off subsidy. but they are competing daily against formidable foreign competition as well as each other. The term \"bigness\" is hard to define. By most standards. American Airlines is the largest of the certificated carriers. Using other criteria. Eastern might be labeled the giant. There are some who regard Pan American as biggest because of its 65.000 miles of international routes. more than half the mileage that MATS flies in regular scheduled service. TWA is a big domestic trunkline as well as a goodsized oversea airline. But neither Pan American nor TWA can match Air France or BOAC in overall size. Furthermore. Air France has recently joined with Belgiums Sabena. Italys Alitalia. and Germanys Lufthansa in a joint sales and promotional arrangement that could lead to merger. The move is frankly aimed at whittling down the U.S.-flag airlines share of the transatlantic traffic which. incidentally. depends on the U.S. traveler. These four airlines of the European Economic Community. and a fifth. the Royal Dutch KLM. are also seeking more extensive landing rights in the United States. including the use of San Francisco and Los Angeles as terminals on certain routes. The Europeans also compete with British Overseas Airways Corp. and its affiliate. British European Airways. both nationalized enterprises. as are many foreign international airlines.",

Further. probably four or five of the best known makes of aircraft are not only presently being produced at Wichita. Kans.. but they were originally designed and developed in that city. In respect to the gentlemans remarks. I would like to make one observation. The gentleman now in the well of the House who is addressing us today. as well as many other Members of the House take a very serious view of government subsidies to any form of transportation as well as in other areas of our economy. Certainly. I am a member of that group. I think at such times we are all on the floor debating condemning subsidies to airlines as such. perhaps. we should keep in mind the circumstance that the gentleman from Oklahoma is describing. I refer especially to the fact that our transocean airliners are in direct competition with other air services that are not only subsidized but are. in fact. owned by the governments of the various countries under whose flag they fly. That is an entirely separate and distinct situation from the economic format by which our own great air fleet must compete. So. as dedicated as we all are. to removing subsidies as soon as possible. we must keep in mind the economic climate and competition that is always facing the air carriers flying the U.S. flag.

I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the gentleman from Oklahoma in the statement he is making today both as to the need for a merchant marine of the air and. secondly. what is equally of great importance. the fact that our U.S. air carriers are being whittled down in their routes and in their business by the foreign giants. Surprisingly enough. these foreign giants are being aided by our own State Department. This is not a matter that started under this administration. the policy was followed in previous administrations. For the life of me. I cannot understand why when our State Department is negotiating with these countries. and we all admit that some amount of give and take is necessary for the maintenance of good diplomatic relations. but why can they not bargain as businessmen and if they are going to give a valuable route why not get a valuable concession in return? Specifically. we all know of one company which was given a roundtheworld route by being allowed to cross the United States. At the same time Pan American which happened to be involved in the negotiations was only given a right. for example. to fly from Melbourne to Perth. Australia. Maybe six people commute between those two points in a week. So it is very apparent to me. and I have been in the forefront of this fight and have made many speeches together with my colleague. the gentleman from Wisconsin . to correct this situation.

This clearly shows the way that these investigations are growing. What we are doing is allowing the creation of little \"kingdoms\" here in the Senate while the taxpayer foots the bill. I predict that if this trend is allowed to continue unchecked. then expenditures for these socalled investigations could very well reach $5 million for the current fiscal year. Of course. the only way to check such a trend is for Senators not to vote for the many resolutions authorizing these investigations. many of which are useless. that are presented to the Senate each year. I hope that next January. when the time comes for the presentation of resolutions authorizing investigations for the next fiscal year. the Committee on Rules and Administration will examine carefully each request with an eye to reducing expenditures.

When the President submitted his socalled balanced budget last January we all knew that the Committee on Appropriations would give careful study to each and every item requested. We were aware the committee would be guided by opportunities to obtain real savings or improved operations amounting to $1.2 billion. The committee has recommended savings of $142 million and. at the same time. has provided funds not requested by the administration. I am pleased that among these is an item of $27 million for the forest service. This money will be used to step up conservation work in every vital field. and. at.the same time. it will provide urgently needed income. One of the great problems we face in America is that our national forests usually lie in areas of low economic activity. In West Virginia they are lands purchased by the Federal Government after they have been partially stripped of their timber and the watershed denuded. These are the underdeveloped regions of our Nation fully as deserving of consideration as is money we may spend abroad. The committee has presented a domestic aid program which has as its purpose the maintenance of a strong and vigorous nation with natural resources developed to meet the need of a rapidly expanding population. I commend action taken by the distinguished chairman and his colleagues of the Committee on Appropriations. and I recognize the warm cooperation and splendid achievements of my able colleague from West Virginia . He has just spoken in reference to the importance of the national forests of the United States and the imperative need for the conservation and development of this part of our national domain.

He had just returned to the Soviet capital after a 5.000mile journey into the hinterland of eastern Russia and Siberia. \"Peace and friendship.\" the Vice President said. is what he encountered on every side. Not only were the words spoken but they were shown in spirited welcomes accorded to NIXON by Russian men and women from many walks of life. The Vice President noted it is \"highly significant that after all the criticism of the United States in the Soviet press. the people are still friendly.\" In view of the fact that Kremlin leaders have been preaching \"peace and friendship\" for yearsin words. but not actionswhy is the emphasis on friendship to NIXON so important? There are two reasons. One is that NIXON went where other Americans never had been. He penetrated the heart of the U.S.S.R. where foreign travelers of any nationality are very rarely seen. He talked to miners in mines. workers in factories. men and women on streets. He had brief but direct conversation with several thousand ordinary Russian people. What NIXON uncovered. for all the world to see. is a feeling of friendship for America in the Soviet grassroots. far from the propaganda mills of the Kremlin. The second reason the friendship shown to NIXON by the Russian people is so important is his high official position in the U.S. Government. An ordinary American tourist might reasonably expect cordial treatment from the native citizenry as long as he behaved himself. If there was any animosity of the Soviet people toward the U.S. Government. NIXON certainly would have felt the full impact of it. Although there were a few hecklers. the Vice President encountered for the most part a people curious about America. anxious to know Americans better. and hungry for knowledgeof the world beyond the Iron Curtain. The television address to the Russian people scheduled by NIXON today. on the eve of his departure from the U.S.S.R.. is to inelude answers to questions put to him by hecklersquestions that were too involved to be answered in a sentence or two. This speech could be a highlight of NIXONs tour. Whatever its effect. he already has shown that rankandfile Russians want to be friendly with us and should be given every opportunity to develop that friendship on a peopletopeople basis.",

The Vice Presidents long chats with Soviet Premier Khrushchevin public and privatemay or may not have a bearing on future United StatesSoviet relations. but the talks cannot help but promote greater understanding between the two Governments. Strangers sometimes fight for no reason except they have no other way to settle disputes. A spirit of friendship between the peoples of Russia and the United States will not solve serious problems resulting from political and economic differences. but friendly peoples can inspire governments to settle differences by negotiation instead of war. The seeds of friendship for Americans are firmly planted in the Russian people. NIXON helped cultivate them. It will take a lot more work in the form of international exchange programs. before the seeds will blossom into real peace.",

We can precipitate a preventive war. and hope to win it. We can reconcile ourselves to becoming definitely and permanently a secondclass power. Or we can tighten our belts for a long and selfsacrificing attempt to prove that capitalism is better than communism. that our science can be better than Communist science. our education better than Communist education. our dedication more determined than that of the Soviet Union.

The criticism was that the book. in part. engages in criticism in terms of President Eisenhowers painting and recreation. I agree that the burden and theme of the book is so enormously important that it might be better that the book should be concerned with the effectiveness or ineffectiveness or our military policies exclusively. In fact it does so almost exclusively. And it does an extremely useful job. I should like to cite one specific instance of a serious allegation that I think has been documented and which I think the Congress of the United States should investigate. It occurs in chapter V. which is entitled \"Slum in the Sun.\" It relates to the situation at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Very serious questions are raised about the efficiency and management of the vitally critical installation there. particularly the basis on which management of that installation was transferred from the Air Force to Pan American. According to the authors. the Air Force officer who was principally responsible for the contract which made Pan American responsible for management. later turned up. very shortly after this occurred. in a highly paid position with Pan American. In view of the very serious questions which have been raised as to the efficiency of the installation at Cape Canaveral. it seems to me this incident alone warrants very careful scrutiny by the Congress of the United States. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the disclosures about this matter be printed in full at this point in the RECORD.

When that Court handed down a decision long before segregationintegration had become a burning issue. that \"separate but equal\" schools met fully the requirements of the amendments written into the Constitution in the postCivil War period. the people were justified in assuming that an important matter had been disposed of. Our highest Court had spoken. and its decisions were the law of the land. The matter was settled. \"Separate but equal\"-the Nations highest Court had spoken. But on May 15. 1954. that highest Court. in an opinion written by its Chief Justice. made the astounding statement that it had been guilty of an earlier mistake. Separate but equal schools were not enough. Pupils of all colors must sit together in the same schools. Perhaps the same rooms. Under the same teachers. This now is the law. said the High Court. And the other Federal courts are passing along the word. We need something that will make Supreme Court decisions stick. so we can know. [From the Macon Telegraph. Jan. 28. 1959]",

We were welcomed in our own language. When I returned. I made a report to the President and suggested that we energize a greater interest in the Spanish language. in the interest of better relations between ourselves and all the countries of Latin America. and in particular such a great and flourishing country as the Republic of the Argentine.

He said: If the unification of Germany is essential and inevitable and if It is neither our responsibility nor in the interests of this Nation to seek that unity by force. then I submit a policy which merely clings to an unrealizable slogan. of free allGerman elections. which does not pursue German unification by other means. is not policy at all. It is a straitjacket. At a later place. the Senator from Montana said: AllGerman elections may not be essentialbut at least there must be a chance for men and women of Eastern Germany as well as Western Germany to express themselves and their political preferences and to participate in political affairs without the threat of terror. Shades of Poland. Shades of the Geneva Conference of 1955 with its promise of free elections. Shades of what took place in every other country in Central Europe. where the history is that the minute there was a coalition government with Communists in it. and the minute there were not free elections. that was the end of the country. So far as the free world was concerned. it went down the drain. So I suppose an immediately proper question is: How can the men and women of East Germany and West Germany have the chance to express themselves and their political preferences and to participate in political affairs without the threat of terror if there are to be no free allGerman elections? Are we to assume that this right of expression of political preference is to be permitted by the respective German governmentsin the case of East Germany. by its Communist puppet government?",

Herter. and the State Department for interceding so strongly to try to effect the release of Bishop James Edward Walsh who has been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Chinese Communist regime. and other Americans in a similar predicament. It is encouraging to note that the State Department has expressed its revulsion about the unconscionable imprisonment of Bishop Walsh and has lodged the strongest possible protest with the representative of the Chinese Communist regime. Very many people in the Nation and throughout the world will applaud the State Department for the efforts it is making to free Bishop Walsh and his colleagues. As the Department points out. the rest of the world joins in condemning the action taken against a citizen of the United States and a distinguished member of the Catholic clergy. It is true as the Department asserts that his only mission was religious. and his personal devotion to the spiritual welfare of his fellow Catholics was so deep as to compel him to remain on the Chinese mainland despite the persecution of his church by a godless regime. I am pleased to have the assurances that the Department will continue to seek by every feasible means the release of Bishop Walsh as well as the four other Americans still held in prison by the Chinese Communists in violation of the 1955 pledge to free them. As pointed out. these five men are in effect political hostages of the Chinest Communists who refuse to release them regardless of all humanitarian considerations. I know that a great many people in this country as well as in the world will be thankful to Secretary Herter. Assistant Secretary William B. Macomber. Jr.. Ambassador Beam and other leaders in the State Department for their intercessions and efforts to free Bishop Walsh and his fellow political prisoners being held captive by the Chinese Reds.

While it is true that it is a new organization in name it is not in anyway a new organization in fact. The National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. its predecessor. antedated the war. It did a great job in the field of aeronautics. When NASA was set up. its entire organization was transferred to NASA. Then. also transferred to it. was the group at Huntsville known as the Von Braun team. If this team. one of the greatest groups in the country. headed by one of the greatest scientists. the man who developed Jupiter. the first successful missile that we attained. if this team. I repeat. is to be fully utilized to the maximum. you have to give it the space. the tools. and the facilities with which to work. That is what you are denying him when you cut $16 million out of the proposed construction appropriation for NASA.

In the April 25. 1960. issue of Newsweek magazine Mr. Henry Hazlitt in his Business Tides signed signed comment captioned \"Age.

The policies of the welfare statists penalize and discourage production.\" Mr. Speaker. there is no question that the Government can give notihing to the people but what it first must take from the people. If we undertake at this time to launch a program of Government paid for medical care. we will be enacting a program that will eventually be a charge on our taxpayers of upward of $20 billion a year. The cost of such an expensive program will have to be paid for by taxes and it is my prediction that the quality of medical care now available to our citizens will deteriorate under the domination of a Government bureaucracy.

    "speech": "BROADENING The strategy of reform by broadening the tax base is the one favored by MILLS. He sees erosion of the base as the main problem. as Congress votes one exemption after another to special groups. The bill adopted by the House this year to aid the selfemployed is a case in point. And earlier. during a major revision of the Revenue Code In 1954. a halfdozen new areas of erosion were established: special treatment for sick pay. for expenses of widowed mothers who must hire babysitters. for the elderly. for recipients of income from dividends. MILLS grants that the underlying reason for such pressure is high rates. but insists that the solution is to examine all such special provisions. and drop as many as possible. This would broaden the base enough to permit reductions in rates. Too tough The political problems here are enormous. MILLS hopes he can minimize pressures by first calling in tax experts in panel discussions. or by assigning given subjects to carefully selected task forces. \"Ive seen both methods used and neither will work this time.\" a veteran of the tax wars in Washington predicts. \"MILLS is on sound ground in principle. but hed be better off to buy the idea of reform by simply cutting rates. Base broadening is just too toughtry taking tax privileges away from working mothers and the old folks.\" Base broadening is attracting some of the Democratic liberals as a means of pushing ideas of their own. Senator WILLIAM PROXMIRE. Democrat of Wisconsin. for example. has a bill ready to offer as an amendment to the first tax measure that reaches the Senate floor. Its purpose is to lower the present oil depletion allowance of 27.5 percent. MILLS and the other tax reform advocates oppose piecemeal moves of this kind.",

The full text of the order appears in the Federal Register. May 6. The order establishes. for practical purposes. a monopoly for Virginia and Maryland milk producers in the District of Columbia and in the several counties surrounding it. State and local regulations which effectively prevent the free movement of milk are not unusual. but this order goes far beyond those limits. It extends the exclusion to more than a dozen major Federal installations. including the Quantico Marine Base. In effect. then. the Federal Government is using its authority to enforce an order which sets up a virtual monopoly for two States. and it excludes milk producers from other States from contracting with Federal installations to supply milk.

This debate. here in Congress and elsewhere. has emphasized a simple but very vital fact. that a decrease in rail commuters means an increase in those traveling to work via our roads and highways. The results which follow are equally obvious: A vast increase in demand for new expensive throughways. more crowded and dangerous roads and streets. greater traffic congestion. and a rise in the amount of fumes interjected into the atmosphere of our cities by internalcombustion engines. I think we must keep more shortdistance travelers on private rightsofway. namely railroads. In urban areas our new Interstate Highway System could be constructed with tracks along the divider strip in the center for rapidtransit electric railroad service. Unless we take such action. our cities and metropolitan areas will be choked by cars and stifled by vapors from auto exhausts. I think we must also consider some form of subsidies so that railroads can continue to operate passenger trains without going deeply into the red ink on their ledgers. Surely this will prove to be less expensive than constructing more and more superhighways. cloverleafs and throughways at millions of dollars per mile.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced a bill which extends and amends the Sugar Act of 1948. I intend to offer the language of this bill as a substitute to H.R. 12311. the sugar bill as amended and reported by the Committee on Agriculture on June 6. The committee bill contains two provisions. The first is a 1year extension of the act. and the second is an authorization for the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce the quota of a country or area which Is unable to fill its quota. The Secretary may reduce the quota by the amount of the deficit for 1 year only. My substitute contains both of the provisions included in the committee bill. and it contains three additional and important items. The first is the grant of authority to the President to act only when the 86th Congress is not in session. Under this provision. the President must first find action necessary either in the national interest or to insure an adequate supply of sugar. If Congress is not in session. he would send his recommendations to Congress. If Congress has adjourned. the President could reduce the quotas of foreign nationsexcept the Republic of the Philippines which is covered by treaty. The Secretary of Agriculture would be charged with the responsibility of obtaining such amounts of sugar elsewhere and Insofar as practical would follow the pattern of quotas set forth in the act. The second additional provision in my substitute will prevent a windfall to Cuba which will occur unless the act is changed. This year Puerto Rico and Hawaii have been unable to fill their quotas. It now appears that there will be a total deficit of 500.000 tons from these areas. Under present law about 156.000 tons of this deficit will be assigned to Cuba. This would be worth between $15 million and $16 million to that country. My substitute will prevent this windfall. I for one do not think Castro should be rewarded for his previous conduct. The final additional provision in my substitute is to bring our new State of Hawaii into full statehood as far as the sugar act is concerned. It strikes out of the act all references to Hawaii as a \"Territory.\"",

It is inconceivable to me how the changes which the gentleman discussed and the change which he said would save the taxpayers so many millions of dollars in the long production run. it is difficult for me to understand how these changes compare so drastically in cost in comparison to the entire development contract. more than 110 percent of the original contract.

This news item begins as follows: Jobless benefits: Eisenhower said he signed a bill recently to increase pension and unemployment benefits of railroad workers because after very careful study he concluded that it was a well balanced measure. But the next paragraph of the ticker item reads as follows: But as for extending more liberal unemployment benefits to all other workers. the President made it clear he still feels that is a Job which the States should handle primarily. He recalled that he has urged repeatedly that the States adopt uniform standards with longer duration of benefit payments. Mr. President. I think all of us agree that uniform standards should be adopted. I think the President was absolutely correct. But I do not know how uniform standards can be adopted without having it done at the Federal level. I am surprised at the statement. attributed to the President. that so far as unemployment insurance or unemployment benefits are concerned. they should be left to the States. It seems to me that is about the only area as to which that kind of thinking is being engaged in. We are about to launch a program of increasing the interest on Government bonds. and apparently the ways are pretty well greased to shoot that program into operation in a hurry. I think this shows a great concern for the moneylenders and a great concern for the Wall Street crowd. When we consider unemployment programs and economic programs to make work. then consideration for the people should be shown. It seems to me that we should attack this problem at the national level. Unemployment insurance has always been a joint program as between the Federal Government and the States. I could not disagree more with the Presidents statement in which he said that it should be left to the States. I think we should show a little more concern in this Congress particularly for the problems of the people.

They were asked about this specific project. and did not then tell us it was classified in category 1. Other items involving category 1 marketing reports were disallowed by the committee.

I think the whole soil bank program. from its inception. has been a failure and that it would be much better to strike the provision for it from the law. I do not think it has accomplished the purpose for which millions of dollars are being expended. We should not be paying $300 million or $400 million to take acreage out of production particularly in view of the fact that the Senate has on numerous occasions appropriated millions of dollars to other agencies to bring new acreage into production. If we stop this contradiction we could save billions and have a better farm program. Only yesterday the Senate agreed to an additional $250 million to increase the fertility of the acreage already in production. Certainly. if we do not stop this kind of procedure these contradictory programs are going to bankrupt us. It appears evident that we are making a mistake on this program. It has been criticized by practically all Members of the Senate. I do not think anyone today would defend the program as being a workable one. Certainly we should not put $75 million more in this program. which is an admitted failure. than even the Department wants. I hope the chairman of the subcommittee will accept the amendment.",

From all I have been able to ascertain it is very obvious that there is no possibility whatever that this program will be extended as has been requested by the President in his message. The committee was attempting to carry out the philosophy of the Presidents message by raising this authorization to $450 million. I am somewhat astonished that the senior Senator from Illinois did not take cognizance of that fact. The bill has not yet become a law. It must run all the hazards of conference. It is highly unlikely that we shall be able to preserve the figure of $450 million in conference. If we were to reduce the figure to $375 million. we would not be able to preserve that figure. When dollars and cents are involved. a conference becomes a matter of give and take. We must give as much as we are able to take.

He was my personal friend. and my leader in many things. I admired the man. He possessed great qualities of character. He had an outstanding mind. and he was genuinely patriotic. He was of excellent Christian character. We have lost a fine and outstanding and helpful member of the legislative branch of our Government.

Since his election to the 75th Congress in 1937. DICK SIMPSON has been an eminently able Member of Congress. He was endowed with great energy and a personal warmth of feeling which will be cherished by all those of us who were privileged to be associated with him. I was happy to work closely with DICK SIMPSON during my tenure in the House of Representatives. One of his characteristics which particularly appealed to me. as it did. I think. to most of us. was his broadminded attitude toward those who might disagree with him on this. that. or the other issue. It in no way affected his close personal friendship or his willingness to work shoulder to shoulder on matters on which there might be complete agreement. I was always impressed by DIcx SIMpSONS high spirit of dedication. which he brought to every public question which commanded his attention. He was a man of heart and a man of character. His Nation. as well as his district and his State. shares with his wife. his family. and his friends in their great and irreparable loss.",

I believe my colleagues will indulge me for calling attention to one situationnamely. the most regrettable and deeply tragic outbreak of antiSemitic and proNazi manifestations In West Germany on Christmas Eve. and the rash of similar demonstrations and antiCatholic incidents which have spread to more than a dozen Western countries in the succeeding weeks. Certainly they warrant our grave concern. They warrant our severest condemnation. and that of civilized men and women everywhere. The significance of the paint smears and scurrility that have marred the walls of synagogues and churches can be minimized only at our peril. They mean that enclaves of totalitarian danger of the extremist right continue to persist here in the free world. waiting to take advantage of any complacency. News reports indicate that ultrarightwing elements are responsible for these outbreaks. and that their acts represent a kind of probing operation to test the worlds reaction. A genuine. widespread expression of public indignation would make clear that we in this day and age will not tolerate the malignant evil of bigotry and prejudice. At the same time. we should extend every support to the German Federal Republic. under Chancellor Adenauer. in its efforts to uproot antiSemitism and punish the hoodlums responsible for defacing the Bonn governments name. Especially Western Europe can show now support for and confidence in Chancellor Adenauers determination to establish a new road of interfaith understanding for the German people and of free institutions which cannot tolerate neonazism. In this connection. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the CONaRESSIONAL REcoRD editorials from the New York Times. the New York Herald Tribune. the New York Post. the Washington Post. and the Long Island Daily Press. commenting on this problem.

Yesterday on a rollcall I voted for two measures that were presented at the special request and insistence of the President to authorize the expenditure of $500 million for South America and $100 million for the Congo. Senators talk about cooperation with the President. Certainly there was no effort to delay procedures in order to pass those two measures yesterday on the floor of the Senate. They were measures which under normal circumstances would call for long debate and searching questions as to what would be done with the money after it had been appropriated. The point is that the bills were passed. and the majority of Senators on this side of the aisle. including myself. voted for the bills. I do not mind telling the Senator that we will meet the charge from Republicans at home that we are big spenders because we have spent what the President wants us to spend. We are big spenders because we authorize money the President wants us to spend. We have held up the progress of Congress when in one day we pass two bills which the President describes as emergency measures in our international affairs.

We all realize to what extent we are operating in the U.S. Senate during this special session in a nonpolitical atmosphere.

I am confident that he will again be on the right track. As to the charge that those who support the President are called big spenders. I think he is in error. It was at times when Congress tried to spend much more than the President said was necessary that Congress received criticism. On occasions. Senators on the other side of the aisle have felt the spending urge and have added to that which the President said was necessary. and such excess is what has caused the Senators party to receive the tag of big spenders. If you will stop trying to increase the appropriations far above the budgetary requests you will be able to drop the label of big spenders.

The administration proposal is to make a direct raid. a direct gift. and a subsidy to the people on the basis that they need medical care.

The question now is. How will the bill be paid? Frankly. we feel the bill should be paid in the real American wayon an insurance basis. by which individuals make contributions. and later receive the benefits from their payments. The administration believes that the Government should make a direct subsidy. I know my distinguished friend from Delaware. based upon his constant observation of the doctrine of avoiding subsidies to the people. will be on the side of those who feel that we should pay as we go on the social security approach.

Why do you compel them to come under the program if they are under the social security system?\" I have not hesitated to refer to compulsory social insurance. though I am aware that in the battle of semantics which has raged around our proposals this term is considered a devastating weapon. Nowhere has this issue been defined more clearly than in a column by Walter Lippmann which appeared in the Washington Post and Times Herald on June Mr. Lippmann. whose articles I am sure we all read. says: Shall it [the medical care program] be financed by compulsory insurance. which means that throughout a persons working life he and his employer will be taxed to provide an Insurance fund for his medical needs when he is retired and is no longer earning an income? * * Or shall the program be financed. as the administration proposes. by charitable doles to the very poor. paid for out of compulsory taxes collected by the National and State Governments? * * * * * Why does the President feel so strongly opposed to the principle of compulsory Insurance for medical care to supplement the insurance. which already exists. for old age? What Is wrong about its being compulsory that a man should insure himself against the needs of his old age? What Is so wonderful about a voluntary system under which a man who doesnt save for his old age has to have his doctors and his hospital bills paid for by his children or public welfare funds? There Is nothing unAmerican in the principle that the imprudent shall be compelled to save so that they do not become a burden to their families and the local charities. so that they can meet the needs of their old age with selfrespect which comes from being entitled to the benefits because they have paid the cost out of their own earnings.

Father Theodore M. Hesburgh. He describes how people go and stand in line to register to vote in certain sections of the country. They stand in line and answer questions. and then in three months or so they find that they have been denied. Then they have to go back. That happens again and again. and they do not find themselves registered. The motion before the Committee would require that in order to get relief the applicant would have to prove that he was denied the right to register on account of race or color. That is something that is impossible to prove. Mr. Chairman. This motion would cut the heart right out of this bill. The question is not whether there is a conclusive presumption. The question is. sir. whether under the Constitution this is appropriate legislation to try to remedy this deprivation. I submit that it is. I submit further that this question of conclusive presumption is immaterial. This proposed law says that after a pattern of discrimination on account of race has been found. a person of the same race can go before a referee and say that he has been denied registration. and the referee may find that he should be registered. There is nothing wrong with that. Anything else would be unworkable. If we want effective legislation. we have to vote down this amendment.",

Here we have a case of legislation by the absence of words. and it is done in this precise fashion: Once the pattern or practice is found to exist in an area. then any applicant of that race in that area can come in and prove these two elements: First. that he is qualified. and. second. that he has been deprived.

I know that there are some few labor elements that are dishonest. They have never offered to contribute to my campaigns. nor would I accept their support if they did. But. I hope and pray that I never become so snobbish as to reject the honest dollar contributions of the man in overalls.

Washington Post commenting upon the article in Fortune magazine which in turn comments upon the forthcoming book of Colin Clark. eminent British economist. entitled \"The Real Productivity of Soviet Russia.\" I am happy someone outside the United States has finally advanced the thesis that \"the specter of burgeoning Russian productivity\" is \"in effect. tripe.\" The Washington Post reporter states that almost alone this British economist has advanced this thesis in the face of \"politicians. businessmen. economists. and scientists pointing to figures showing Russian growth rate of 6 percent or more against our 3.5 average.\" It just goes to show that prophets are without honor in their own country. Last fall a subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee held lengthy paneltype hearings on a series of papers prepared at the request of the Committee by a group of outstanding economists who were our panelists and published well ahead of the hearings on the subject of the relative postures of the Russian and United States economies. A fair analysis of these papers and hearings. I think. would reveal that in essence they support the opinion of Colin Clark. \"The specter of burgeoning Russian productivity is tripe.\" As a member of this subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee. indeed as the person who was largely responsible for these study papers and the hearings being held. I was somewhat surprised to notice the press attendance at the hearings fell almost off to nothing as soon as it became apparent that there was going to be little or no substantiation of the Russian specter. I had thought we Americans were interested in the truth and I was satisfied that it was very important to find out as much as we could about Russias real prowess. The papers and the hearings of the Joint Economic Committee are still available for anyone interested in the truth rather than the specter. Let me just point out a few interesting facts.",

Of all the methods of recording the written word. books have proved to be the most durable. Books are of value. however. only insofar as they are available to be read. To make them more readily available to the rural people of America. Congress in 1956 passed the Library Services Act. Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced legislation to extend for another 5 years this act which has done so much to bring the world of books to the rural residents of our Nation. In my State of South Dakota. there are many living in areas far removed from established libraries. These people are just as interested in the quest for knowledge as is the suburban population. Passage of the original act has done much to bring books closer to rural America. More than 1 million persons now have library service for the first time. Some 66 counties formerly without any public libraries now are receiving service. More than 200 new bookmobiles are bringing books and information to rural citizens. The hunger for books and information has been emphatically demonstrated by the tremendous increases in library usage as a result of these improved services. The Library Services Act has encouraged States to inaugurate and extend their own programs tremendously. State funds. under impetus from this Federal legislation. appropriated for the improvement and extension of public library service to rural areas. have been increased more than 54 percent since 1956. and local funds have been increased by 45 percent. In South Dakota. as in other States. there are areas which have inadequate library service or no service at all. As more persons realize the values of a library. the needs for improved service will increase. It is my conviction that an extension of the act for another 5 years would benefit rural people. not only in South Dakota. but in the entire Nation. Education certainly must not stop with the classroom or upon graduation from school. Citizens should have the opportunity to enjoy the enrichment that reading can provide for them. I strongly urge the proposed extension of the Library Services Act to better meet the needs of our rural citizens.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I should like to concur In the remarks of my colleague the gentleman from the State of New York [Mr. BoscH]. The visit of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to our country is indeed a fitting time for us to reflect on the growth and development of the democratic way of life In West Germany since the end of World War II. for it is Chancellor Adenauer who has steered the West German ship of state during all of these turbulent years. It Is he who has guided and promoted the democratic institutions which have replaced the old totalitarianism of the Hitler era. It is he who has supervised the economic resurgence which today marks West Germany as one of the most prosperous nations of Europe. Under his leadership. West Germany. 15 years ago a thoroughly defeated. completely discredited nation. today stands as a citadel of freedom and democratic selfgovernment. It has been a truly remarkable metamorphosis. and it is difficult to understate the role of Chancellor Adenauer in effecting this dramatic change. At the same time that we call to mind the developments which have taken place In Germany since World War II. it is. I think. also fitting that we remember the tremendous contributions which have been made to our own way of life by those of German origin who have made their homes in America. In my own 38th Congressional District of New Yorkand I am sure this is true in other districts as well--GermanAmericans have made. and continue to make. large and lasting contributions to every community in which they live. They are industrious. hardworking. practical people who take a real interest in their work and in community activities as well. They are firstrate citizens in every way. and I consider it a privilege to represent them in the Congress. Americas relations with West Germany. based as they are on mutual respect and mutual love of freedom. are today at a high peak. and I am certain they have been even further improved by Chancellor Adenauers visit. Let us hope that in the years ahead this relationship will continue and that our two nations will always maintain the same spirit of friendship and mutual cooperation which exists today.",

It was charged against the general account. (Hearings. p. 9043.) In reality the proceeds were to be used to obtain a perjured statement which caused the false arrest of Carl Renda. Since expenditures for the purchase of real estate were required to be approved by the executive board and this one was not (hearings. p. 9044). an audit of the UAW general account would have disclosed this $25.000 discrepancy. Yet. apparently the books and records ordered selected by the chief counsel did not include the international union general account records of the UAW. We are perplexed that Mr. Bellino. a distinguished and very able auditor was not given sufficient instructions to enable him to examine books of the UAW that would have had a bearing on the relevancy of our contentions.

    "speech": "Mr. President. last Tuesday. our distinguished colleague. the junior Senator from Arkansas . delivered a highly illuminating address at the annual dinner of the Harvard Club of Washington. The title of his important speech was \"Where Do We Stand?\" It was a penetrating evaluation of the status of the United States in the world today. It was a sober and realistic appraisal of the decline of our Nation from its preeminence of leadership and power. a decade ago. to its present. far less influential position. when viewed against the phenomenal rise of Russia and of international communism in the world. In a sense. our colleagues brilliant address was of something of an epochmaking character. which I think was summarized in his conclusion that the United States will not be restored to its position of influence. prestige. and leadership in the world. that our Nation will not recover its lost vantage. and will not do what is needed to be done in order to achieve that goal. unless and until the control of both the executive and the legislative branches is vested in one political party. Senator FULBRIGHT said that unless the American people vest that control in only one party. the Nation will be courting disaster. Not wishing to give a political connotation to his address. our able colleague did not tell the Harvard Club which political party he thought that should be. nor was it necessary that he do so. The fact is that never before in our Nations history has the division of powers which Senator FULBRIGHT deplores existed for so long as it has during the two Eisenhower administrations. Therefore. our colleagues dictum is both new in its affirmation of a transcendently important principle. and. coming in a year of a presidential election. timely and appropriate. It deserves wide recognition. I ask unanimous consent that his eloquent and constructive contribution to our political science and to the national safety and destiny be printed in the",

I disagree that there is any conclusive evidence at all that the proposal of the committee is going to do anything for small business. I think it is going to hurt small business. The gentleman from New York was speaking for what is perhaps the largest corporation in the world in this field. As I said before. we cannot have our cake and eat it too. The facts are that as of right now small business is getting 2.3 percent of the research and development business from the Department of Defense. In other words. it is almost wholly concentrated in the hands of a few giant corporations. That is all right. but the point is that unless this information having to do with metals and a thousand other things developed at the taxpayers expense can be made available generally across the board. information that is vital for the small companies even to bid. if we adopt a policy granting to a few of these giant corporations the exclusive right. which amounts to monopoly control. to keep and retain this information. then. of course. the small companies are going to get smaller. in fact. they are going to cease to exist.

The House Armed Services Committee. after hearing testimony from the Department of the Army. recommended that $1.800.000 be authorized for the construction of a 75bed hospital and the necessary heating plant and $3.321.000 for the academic building. This authorization was approved by the House on March 9. 1960. The authorization was then considered by the Senate. The Department of the Army made such a strong case before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Senate was convinced that the construction of a 100bed hospital at this important base was justified. The Senate increased the authorization for the hospital and heating plant to $2.900.000. while maintaining the request for the academic building at $3.321.000. A conference committee was appointed and subsequently on June 1. the conference committee report containing the increased authorization was approved by the House and the Senate.

Every time we consider the name of someone for confirmation to office in the Government the name comes before a committee. and the first thing we do is to investigate any possible conflict of interest. I do not reflect upon these distinguished gentlemen. I only say that if I were in their shoes representing an institution that is a beneficiary under the bill. it would not make any difference how unselfish I was. I still believe that selfishness would color to some extent the amount that I would say was the minimum. That is the result. At least the Budget Bureau told me so. because they investigated it. Finally. Senators might think for all the world that this measure had no preparation before it got here. Last fall the budget directors of the various components of this agency had to bring their data together. It takes that long to prepare. It is winnowed. it is sifted. and it goes to the Budget Director of the agency. Members of his office sit down with the experts in the Budget Bureau in a long. careful. and painstaking effort. involving a good deal of testimony. before the figures are contrived. These are not snatched out of thin air.

The committee does not believe that these responsibilities are so dissimilar from the regular functions of the agencies that they should require supplemental funds. It is my understanding that included In the $12 million is the sum of $1.775.000 for the Business and Defense Services Administration. This sum is not a supplemental fund. it is not an increase for 1960 over 1959. it is not for civil defense activities. but represents the current activities the Business and Defense Administration is performing under its responsibilities in the defense mobilization field. The $1.775.000 was subtracted from the agencys regular request and appears as a request in the supplemental budget for the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization in line with the request and direction of the House Committee on Appropriations in its report accompanying the Department of Commerce appropriation bill for fiscal year 1959. I am much concerned by the fact that the action of the Appropriations Committee will reduce the BDSA from its 1959 current activity rate by approximately 50 percent. The Business and Defense Services Administration has important responsibilities in the defense mobilization field as distinguished from civil defense activities. This agency exercises the Presidents title I authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended. Under this authority the agency administers the Defense Materials System. which helps insure the prompt delivery of Department of Defense and Atomic Energy Commission products and materials on schedule. This. of course. includes production and construction in connection with the ballistic missiles and satellite programs. In addition. the agency has important responsibilities in connection with the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act. the National Security Act of 1947. the Trade Agreements Act of 1958. and in cooperation with all industries develops important mobilization programs that have for their objective the development of our industrial and economic strength to meet any national emergency.

His retirement to private life in 1952 was voluntary on his part. Herbert OConor was a man of deep faith which animated his thoughts and actions throughout his lifetime. He was not only a dedicated public official and legislator and a great American. but he was honorable and trustworthy in every respect. Herbert OConor not only possessed the affection of the people of Maryland. but also the deep respect of the people of the United States. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word. Possessed of an understanding mind. whenever he disagreed with anyone. he could disagree without being disagreeable. The deep faith and understanding mind of Herbert OConor. which I have referred to. justified an introduction he received while making a public address some few years ago. as one of Gods noblemen.

Mr. President. to return to the bill. the present depletion allowance has given us a plentiful supply of oil. and it is nearer to the price it was in 1912 per gallon than any other commodity we have. The Senator proposes a sliding scale of depletion. As I read it and as the general counsel of the committee interprets it. it would apply also to the royalty owners. If I read the bill correctly. a farmer on one side of a fence who leases his property for production of oil to Standard Oil or Gulf. or even to a rather small company. which has over a million dollars of gross revenue. the depletion allowance goes down to 21 percent. If it should exceed $5 million of total production of oil. the depreciation allowance drops to 15 percent. This means that farmer A. getting his royalty from a major company. would receive only 15 percent for the depletion of the oil under his land. whereas farmer B. who leases to a wildcatter would get 271/2 percent on the same oil. If that is not a correct statement. I hope the Senator from Illinois will correct me. A million dollars sounds like a great deal of money. However. let us break It down. The amount of one million dol* lars of gross production of an oil company. broken down to production per day. amounts to 850 barrels per day. That is not a great deal of oil.",

If the total of one stockholder who owns 51 percent produces more than 4.000 barrels a day. this reduces everyone elses depletion to 15 percent. Mr. President. these are not giant companies the distinguished Senator from Illinois is talking about. Those companies produce 5 times that much from each well in Saudi Arabia. Therefore we would not be reaching down to those great sources of great wealth. which avoid all Federal income taxes by shuffling leases with the sheiks or kings of the Middle Eastern empires. The oil industry in my Stateand it was one of the pioneer oil States--is a sick industry. It is scraping the bottom of the barrel and is trying to find saucer size fields. Little explorers are still going out to find oil. because they love the oil industry. The larger ones have moved on to the Williston Basin and other places. as they search for new supplies of oil. Although there may need to be some adjustment of supply. this is not the way to bring it about. Let us not penalize every small owner. That is what we would do. The boom days of oil have passed us by. and we are trying to get a little oil out of depleted fields. The loss of the 271/2 percent depletion allowance will end many leases and will lead to the liquidation of many small businesses. which will probably be absorbed by the giant companies. or be forced to shut down. leaving supplies to be wasted.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have heard some discussion concerning the oil depletion amendment. Usually it is an annual discussion. This evening. we are considering an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Illinois . This time it is a new proposal. I concur in the statement made by the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. MONRONEY. It is 4my firm opinion that this goes out to the royalty owners. It is further proof that the Committtee on Finance ought to examine an amendment of this kind. because of its farreaching effect. before it is brought to the floor of the Senate in an attempt to have it adopted this evening. Mr. President. we could spend much time talking about the percentage of depletion. but we must remember that depletion allowances have helped to establish and maintain the United States as the worlds greatest producer and consumer of petroleum products. The 272percent depletion rate has proved to be sound. It is fair. Today it does no more than to reflect the current value. in fact. it does not fully recognize the increase in the cost of finding oil. I think it is interesting to note that in 1926. when Congress first passed the 271/2 percent depletion allowance. the country had 8 billion barrels of oil reserves. In 1960. after this long period of 272 percent depletion rate. our reserves are 38 billion barrels of oil. I may note that in 1936. gasoline. less taxes. sold for 20.9 cents a gallon. In 1960. it is selling for 20.2 cents a gallon. That is proof to me. that as a nation we have benefited from the depletion allowance. Not only that. but in 1926 it took 1 hours wages to buy 2.6 gallons of oil. Today. 1 hours wages will buy 10 gallons of gasoline. under the 271/2 percent depletion allowance. The percentage depletion has meant lower prices for oil and gasoline for the consumer. I believe the critics of depletion allowance recognize that fact. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD. a table which proves this very point.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think the most recent statement on the need for the oil depletion allowance is a report entitled \"Amending the Mineral Leasing Act.\" dated June 10. 1960. and submitted by the distinguished junior Senator from New Mexico from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. I read from the report as follows: In general. the committee finds that in the past several years there has been a potentially dangerous slackening In exploration for development of domestic reserves of oil and gas so necessary for our security in war and peace. The decline in exploration is caused In large part by the falling off of domestic productionfrom 7.150.000 barrels daily a year ago to 6.850.000 barrels dally in May of this yearas a result of global factors embracing the fabulously flush production of Middle East oilflelds and increase in Venezuelan and. most recently. north African production. At the same time that our domestic production has been declining by some 3 percent. our consumption has been rising by about 5 percent to some 9 million barrels daily. This falling off of domestic exploration is readily discernible in the figures of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission covering active exploration crews. In April 1960 the number of such crews was 419. in contrast to 490 at the end of 1959 and 725 In the peak year of 1953. Mr. President. that is from the report dated June 10. 1960. and submitted by the distinguished junior Senator from New Mexico and his committee. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that I may have printed at this point in the RECORD a statement concerning the oil production situation in Kansas.",

    "speech": "First. I should like to clear up some misapprehensions. My amendment would cover the income derived by American oil companies from their operations abroad and would. therefore. apply to ARAMCO and Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey drillings in Arabia. Venezuela. and other countries. Their depletion allowances would be reduced. It is no cover up for them. Second. it would not cover royalties received by farmers. Farmers who lease land to oil companies almost universally receive a share of the fiscal product which is obtained from drilling on the farms--generally oneeighth. This comes as direct income to them. It Is not dependent on the profits of the drilling or operating companies. I think no farmer in the country gets an income of more than $1.000.000 from his oil leases. Therefore. since I have not changed the rate for those whose gross incomes are less than $1 million. the total royalty of any farmer In the United States would not be reduced by one cent. When the 271/2 percent allowance was originally enacted a third of a century ago. the corporation tax was approximately 14 percent of net profits. So the allowance of onehalf of net profits amounted then to a deduction of a maximum of only 7 percent of the net profits. That was the maximum then. Now the corporation tax is 52 percent. So the allowance of up to 50 percent of net profits would make it possible for a company to have 26 percent of its net profits completely immune from taxation. This frequently happens. This evil has therefore greatly increased as the corporation tax has increased. My amendment would bring in from $350 million to $400 million more revenue a year. This would still leave the oil industry with approximately $2 billion of depletion allowances. It would be a very moderate reduction.",

Also nonservice disabled and unemployable veterans should have a pension increase because they have not had one in 5 years despite the fact that the cost of living has gone up for them as well as for everyone else. If this $300 million is provided for Federal grants to buy homes it means that the budget will be further out of balance.

There is said to be 45.000 veteran requests on file for direct Federal home loans. The records of the Veterans Administration show that of these 45.000 veteran requests for direct loans for the purchase of homes only 521 are on file from the State of Washington. As compared to the 521 war veterans in Washington State. out of the 306.000 veterans in our State who may obtain a home loan. if this bill is passed. thousands need better medical care and other thousands of veterans. due to the rise in living costs. need an increase in their pension. First things should get first consideration. We ought to get the Federal budget in balance and then as a first step toward aiding veterans should take steps to provide the sick and ailing veteran with better medical care and better hospital facilities and to provide a more realistic pension system for veterans. Providing better medical care and hospital care for the veterans and granting a pension increase to veterans will do more for vastly greater numbers of veterans than establishing a fund of $300 million. and putting the country that much further in debt. to provide home loans to the 521 Washington State veterans who are seeking direct loans to acquire homes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am Introducing an amendment to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 which would extend the operation of this valuable surplus disposal program for 5 years. This act. also known as Public Law 480. performs a great service to our country. It is at the same time the instrument by which we bolster our economy here at home through businesslike distribution of our surpluses abroadand the means by which we discharge our obligation to our neighbor nations of the free world as the provider of food. I am urging a 5year extension of this essential farm program because I believe that the effectiveness of Public Law 480 is weakened if it lives by a virtual hourbyhour existence. depending on frequent extensions by Congress. The experience with the 85th Congress is a case in point. Last year the House of Representatives neglected to extend the program until the closing hours of the sessionwith the result that our longrange commitments were jeopardized. Foreign countries understandably did not know whether or not the United States would renew this actand the negotiations suffered. A clearcut majority in both Houses has believed in the past that this act is of great value to our economy. I am sure that the overwhelming number of Members of Congress in this session believe the same thing. Then it is prudent and wise for us to extend this act for 5 years. Such an action would enhance the operation of the act and would have a good effect on the agricultural economy of our Nationas well as our relations with countries we need to have on our side. This amendment provides for continuation of the $1.500 million annual authorization for the programs operationhowever it would allow the Department of Agriculture to obligate future years authorizations in order to give a foreign government certainty of future delivery of our surplus commodities to satisfy their needs. Mr. Speaker. for these reasonsand because Public Law 480 is directly related to our own economic selfinterestI urge consideration of this amendment.",

The committee intends that States shall set reasonable outer limits on the resources an individual may hold and still be found eligible for medical services. Individuals who are recipients of the oldage assistance benefits would not be eligible for assistance in that particular month. Let me proceed a little further. I can well visualize a standard which would provide that a person with an income of $2.400 a year would be required to pay the first $200 of doctor bills and the first $250 of hospital bills. but if that individual had a hospital bill of $2.000 or a doctor bill of $1.500. the State under this program could pay that part of it which would be above the minimum which had been prescribed by that State to be paid by citizens with an income from $2.000 to $2.400. just as the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico provided that every beneficiary would pay the first $75 of his hospital bill.",

The House provision added four onehundredths of 1 percent. or 0.04. So when the bill came to us. there was an imbalance of 0.24 percent. However. the actuarial authorities told us that. on the longrange basis. they regarded it to be within the limits of actuarial soundness. We had added an additional 0.24 per cent. or twentyfour onehundredths of 1 percent. and if we left that in the bill. together with the rest of the various House provisions which they were very vigorous in standing for. there would be an imbalance of 0.48 percent. or fortyeight onehundredths percent. which would throw the fund to a point of imbalance that could not be countenanced by a responsible viewpoint. Therefore we saw the necessity of resolving our differences with reference to the additional benefits which had been provided in the House and in the Senate. That we did. Therefore. when we brought the bill out of conference. it had the same kind of imbalance. which was 0.24 percent. that it had when the House sent the bill to us.",

It has been my conviction for several years that our social security law had an apparent inequity in our limitation on the earnings in business or profession of a retired person of $1.200 annually. In a sense we have allowed our senior citizens to be penalized for justified efforts to secure earned income and yet qualify for a modest social security payment. I presented a bill in March of this year. following my service on the Senate Subcommittee on the Problems of the Aged at the hearings held by our group In several parts of the Nation. Many retired men and women gave dramatic and ofttimes tragic testimony on the cost of living. I have listened. as I have indicated. to this discussion. I think this is a much better bill than I had thought a few days ago. not that the conference has materially changed the measure as it passed the Senate. but I have been impressed with the attemptand I believe an objective and purposeful attempt. at least in degreeto do in part what the Senator from West Virginia believed should have been done.

Although I regret the Senate conferees could not retain the $1.800 limitation. this colloquy has clarified the matter. I can realize that we have been compensated. through the efforts of the Senator from Oklahoma and other Senators who joined with him. to go a considerable way in embracing the goal which I have held in reference to a merited raise on the earnings of retirees. The needy people of West Virginia will be benefited when the conference report is adopted. with the anticipated approval of the President. I hope he will approve it.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in view of the many statements made by responsible persons in the Democratic Party over their concern for the small farmer. it is difficult for me to understand why this Congress had deliberately refused to extend a limitation on Commodity Credit Corporation loans for the 1961 crops. The Banking and Currency Committee has refused to even hold hearings on H.R. 9303 and the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee repelled my effort to extend the limitation place on the appropriation bill for fiscal 1960 to the appropriation for the Department of Agriculture for fiscal 1961. The end result. of course. will be that the large corporation farmers that are listed below or other borrowers of comparable amounts will again exploit the resources of the Commodity Credit Corporation for the 1961 crop and this exploitation will be charged to the Department of Agriculture. There will follow the usual demand next year for further relief for the average size midwestern frontier. Here is one opportunity we have missed. The failure to take action by the 86th Congress is in direct conflict with the announced aims and objectives of the Democratic Party for agriculture and I think this is an appropriate and effective means to so advise the farmers of America. Further. Mr. Speaker. at the time of the debate on the floor of the House in 1959 on imposing this $50.000 limitation. several Members insisted most of these loans were repaid and. therefore. no loss was sustained by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The table below and others on file in my office clearly indicate that the large loans are only rarely. if ever. repaid and thereby a great loss is imposed on the taxpayer and again charged to the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Speaker. although only the loans in excess of $50.000 are indicated on the tables below. I have on file in my office and in the Department of Agriculture. a list of loans over $25.000 and also an indication whether or not they have been repaid.",

One of the most important economic issues before this Congress is the administrations money policies. or lack of them. Those who disagree with the administrations money policies. like myself. contend that they are designed mainly to produce higher and higher interest rates. The effects of higher and higher interest rates are undoubtedly pleasing to lenders in general. and to commercial banks in particular. But a high interest rate schedule Is a poor way to achieve the goals of maximum employment. production and purchasing power set forth by the Employment Act of 1946. and a poor way of managing the $290 billion national debt. Very largely because of the tight money policies of the administration. our growth rate in recent years has averaged scarcely onehalf that of the countries of Western Europe. and scarcely onethird that of the Soviet Union. A disquieting plateau of unemployment. of around 5 percent. continues. And every month the cost of living reaches a new alltime high.",

The spokesman for the Treasury made clear there were three debt management purposes on the part of the Treasury. The first. which sounds logical. to manage the debt in a manner that will assure the orderly growth of the economy. He says: To do this it should try. except in periods of recession. to place as much of the debt as possible outside of the commercial banksapart from temporary bank underwriting. Restraint should be exercised in the amount of longterm securities issued. particularly in a recession period. in order not to preempt an undue amount of the new savings needed to support an expansion of the economy. The second deals with a balanced maturity structure. and the third basic pupose is to borrow as cheaply as possible. which he says must be balanced against the broader consideration of the public interest. Now. would the gentleman say. as he is a competent student of this subject. that in a period of recession there is some reason for not selling longterm Government bonds when there is no other strong demand for longterm funds?",

Would not the best policy be to put them out when they could borrow as cheaply as possible? According to the Treasurys own argument that it should borrow as cheaply as possible. it would seem to me the best argument for the course of action the gentleman from Wisconsin is proposing. namely. that the Treasury be encouraged to place more longterm debt at times of low interest rates. instead of encouraging longterm debt only at high interest rates. The Congress insisted last year that it should. during highinterest periods. settle momentarily for shortterm commitments. so that the public would not be saddled with very expensive 30or 40year commitments at peak interest rates.

For example. from the Treasurys statement of the ownership of public securities for August 1960. one can examine the fluctuation in the placing the debt among commercial banks and other owners. During the last year there was considerable concern about the inflationary threat. I find that the commercial bank holdings in January 1959 were $68 billion. They fell during the first 9 months of 1959. and they have gone down again this year. currently the commercial banks hold $56 billion. So we have had bonds going out of the banks during periods of inflation and of recession. It seems to me that there is a hiatus between the asserted purposes and the record which has been made by the Treasury. It seems to me also. because debt management is essentially a technical area. that the public misses the simply fantastic situation now being proposed. that we refund 2.5 percent loans not due for 8 to 12 years. The taxpayers are asked to give up 2.5 percent bonds in order to issue what might be 3%-percent bonds.",

This seems to me to be robbery in broad daylight. Yet I have heard no criticism. even from the press. about the Treasury having made such a proposal to saddle the taxpayers with a higher rate through refinancing at a higher rate. I am sure there would have been loud screams in protest had this been proposed by a Democratic administration.

The gentleman from Colorado mentioned another very important criterion of fiscal and monetary responsibility. namely. the idea that to the largest possible extent the ownership of the national debt should be kept out of the hands of the commercial banks. because to the extent that the commercial banks hold the debt. just to that extent is it inflationary. It is interesting to note in that connection that just this month. when the Treasury sold a billion dollars worth of longterm bonds. $5 billion worth of applications appeared for those bonds.

    "speech": "Mr. President. according to many of the newspapers. and some of the mail. it appears that after the socalled labor reform bill was passed a considerable amount of abuse was heaped upon Members of Congress who voted for that bill. Previous to the vote I received probably twothirds as many communications from labor as I received from management. and I am sure that I did not read more than 1 percent of them. This bill. as all legislation is. was a compromise. When you get Senators like KENNEDY and GOLDWATER to agree. the bill cannot be so bad. In fact. I feel it is a good bill. one that will be beneficial to both labor and management. but especially beneficial to the public. The national welfare needed this bill. It is interesting to note that Senators who have been among the leading friends of labor have not replied to the abuse. I am sure the rank and file of labor remember how we were abused for the TaftHartley bill. Who gave us such abuse? I shall not spend much time on that question. There is a great deal of misunderstanding abroad on many matters. I hold in my hand the monthly letter of the First National City Bank of New York. Beginning on page 104 there appears an article headed \"The Hundred Largest Salesmen.\" The article refers to Americas economic achievement as resting \"on the initiative of entrepreneurs working under free institutions and seeking to discover and satisfy human wants.\" I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which I have referred printed in the RECORD at this point as a part of my remarks.",

I now turn to the consideration of another subject for the next 3 minutes. \"The question of food spread.\" From time to time. public attention is directed to the fact that although the prices of farm products have come down a little. none of the decline has filtered through to the consumers. This particular statement shows that no one in particular is benefiting. The only problem is that the farmer is not getting his fair share. So I place.this statement in the RECORD. because in the last days of our Senate session it is well that we consider some facts. so that when we get out on the hustings. and begin to talk. the people will be able to have the record and refer to what the actual facts are in this connection.

The record should show that Mr. Khrushchevs parents were brought up in the faith of the Russian Orthodox Church. In fact. during my visit with the Soviet dictator. he reminded me of that. Khrushchev says he is a confirmed atheist. I guess he is. But I surely agree with the Senator from South Carolina that if Mr. Khrushchev really wants to see the United States of America. and see it all. he should attend a service in a church. I read in the newspaper the other day that Khrushchev would like to see not only the beautiful buildings in Washington. but also the slums. It is expected that he will see our farms and factories. Some persons have suggested that he see our military installations. I join with the Senator from South Carolina in saying that the strength of our Nation is not merely in its factories. fields. and military installations. the strength of America is to be found in the deep. abiding faith of our millions of people who worship and believe in God. and who take their religion seriously. I do not think Mr. Khrushchev would really have a picture of America without at least coming in contact with the spiritual power which is a fundamental part of our strength. Whether it will do any good or not. no one can predict. But as the Senator from South Carolina has said. the great Caesars of the Roman era were just as dictatorial. just as tyrannical. and exercised the same degree of power. Yet they were. some of them. finally brought under the influence of the great Christian church and were moved by the religious spirit.",

August 10. shows the time for coming in was set between the Senator from Illinois and myself. He asked what time I wanted the Senate to convene. I suggested 9:30. We had a little discussion about it. I said if the Senate was willing. I would suggest 9:30. I assured the Senator from Illinois his presence would not be required before 11 oclock. because we had some speeches to be made and there would be no votes. I said I would not permit any rollcalls. or promote any. and I would certainly give him notice if we had any. Then I said if we convened at 9:30 and made good progress on the bill. I would be willing to go out at 7 oclock. Afterward we had a little conversation that was not on the RECORD. at which time I said that. so far as I was concerned. we could come in at 9:30 and go to 11. but we finally agreed to come in at 10 and close at 7. and that was announced. and that is in the REcORD.

But I have said to him. and to every other Senator who has asked me. I think we ought to be prepared. between 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. for votes. and I say that to Senators who need to be away on Saturday. The Senator from West Virginia is here at his post because he feels the importance of this bill to his people. Senators did not ask me to stop this debate.

This historic milestone in the conquest of space is real cause for rejoicing in the United States. for it marks a tremendous leap toward successful manned space flight. On behalf of the people of Hawaii I wish to extend heartiest congratulations to the many dedicated men who. despite six earlier unsuccessful attempts to retrieve a manmade object from space. persevered until their efforts were crowned with success. We of Hawaii are very proud of our American scientists. our engineers. our airmen and our sailors for their ability and their teamwork which demonstrated we can recover objects sent into outer space. Last Wednesday the capsule was lofted into orbit by the Discoverer XIII satellite. where it whirled over the poles of the earth at 18.000 miles per hour. On command from earth the capsule was ejected about 200 miles over the North Pole. spinning downward in just 7 minutes to 50.000 feet. where a parachute opened to slow its descent. It required about 10 minutes to complete the parachute journey which brought the capsule within the 200 by 60 mile recovery area in the waters of the Pacific. To appreciate the outstanding technical achievement. we must realize the very narrow tolerances within which our scientific team had to operate. A delay of only a few seconds in the separation sequence of the capsule from the satellite could have resulted in the capsules landing outside the target area. This space first by the United States shows we are not taking a back seat in the technological race.

Yet a deep gratefulness impels me to voice a posthumous \"thankyou\" note to that champion of freedom and peace. Can any of us today fully appreciate his role in the critical postwar years? Is it possible to overstate how well our late Secretary of State steered our course in international relations? I think not. Here was a leader in the best sense of the term. Never an equivocator. he made his position clear and firm. In an age of committees and bureaucracies. Mr. Dulles stood alone. an individual supported by a strong religious faith that never failed him and a remarkably wideranging intellect that was capable of understanding and controlling the complex problems our Nation faced. We are still very close to the life work of Mr. Dulles. and the involvement that is ours in the perspective of immediacy suggests caution in the use of superlatives. I am confident. however. that in the distant future when detached historians judge our time they. too. will come to the same conclusion that people all over the world have come to in the past few days--the conclusion that John Foster Dulles was a very great statesman.

I have previously refrained from speaking out on the disgraceful lynching of Mack Parker in Mississippi because the FBI had entered the case and it appeared that something could be done under the Lindbergh law to apprehend and punish his murderers. I now read in the papers that the FBI has withdrawn from the case and that information derived by the FBI has been turned over to the Governor of the State for appropriate action. We note that this information will be turned over to the grand jury for action as its next regular meeting which will take place in November. It appears that in the absence of such Federal statute there is the possibility that the FBI does not receive fullest cooperation from the people in the area and from local authorities in their efforts to apprehend members of the lynching mob. It further appears possible that during the long period prior to the next meeting of the grand jury that evidence may be lost. witnesses will move away. and that possibly even the guilty parties may disappear. The antilynching bill I introduced earlier this year. H.R. 353. would have made possible immediate. vigorous. and forceful action by the Federal Government. as well as the State. for the protection of citizens against lynching. and for apprehension of Mack Parkers slayers. Under my bill the Department of Justice could have carried this prosecution through to a successful conclusion. Surely Congress can do no less than to enact effective legislation like H.R. 353 to protect citizens from mob violence.",

Many people tell us that what we do with respect to one thing or another will be declared unconstitutional.

As a matter of fact. some elements of the Civil Rights Act have been declared unconstitutional by the lower courts. and are now before the Supreme Court for final decision.

Of infinitely greater importance. once we feel or are convinced that we are right. is that we are doing our duty with the assurance which the people expect of us as representative legislators. As I started to say. if it is properand we have to be convinced of thatto proceed by statute. that is our first duty. The burden of proof is not on me.

Perhaps the Senator from Washington was not in the Chamber at the moment I pointed this out. but the minute we say we are going to follow the constitutional amendment route on this question. we will be faced with that procedure in half. at least. of all the measures which will be recommended in connection with the civil rights bill. because numerous constitutional questions are inherent in the proposed civil rights legislation. Once we decide that we will follow the course of the constitutional amendment on civil rights. there will be no end of such proposals. There is a long history connected with this matter. It has been considered five times in the other body. but they have not sent it over here. We have not acted on it. Occasionally we have had what is called a filibuster.

The reason I have participated in this debate is that I. too. have a little interest in the subject. I introduced proposed poll tax legislation in Congress in 1937. That was a long time ago. I was then a Member of the House. We never had enough votes to get it out of committee. Like the Senator from New York. I wanted to get it out immediately.

We have before us today the composite view of the members of the District of Columbia Committee as to the type of legislation which should be enacted.

I realize some of the questions the Senator has had in mind relating to the appointment of the juvenile court judges. and certainly in fairness it should be said that at no time has the Senator from Delaware attempted in any way to slow up the processes by which the bill could be brought to a final vote in the Senate. I commend the Senator for that. I also wish to add a word of commendation for the author of the bill. the senior Senator from Pennsylvania . who has just entered the Chamber. He guided the bill almost to full statutory status a year ago. and devoted a great deal of time to the important work handled by juvenile court judges. The Senator from Pennsylvania was very helpful.

We all know the menace of juvenile delinquency. We all know the need for repairing broken homes. and for steering children along the paths of righteousness when they get into trouble. This cannot be done without an adequate number of judges to handle the caseload. I pay tribute to Judge Ketcham. with respect to whose appointment I was not very enthusiastic a year or two ago. But he took off his coat and went to work. and has devoted a year or two of dedicated service to this cause. But he needed help. I am glad to see that he is about to get it.

I do not want to brag about him too heavily at this time. because it might keep him from getting the position to which he has been nominated. but I should like to say it is my belief that it is important that the heads of the political parties be men who have had some experience in the business of getting elected. me who have had some experience in the problems of a campaign. I think one of the difficulties from which the major political parties have suffered from time to time has been that in positions of leadership there have been men who actually did not know some of the problems faced by those of us who were candidates for office. and who did not thoroughly realize that. in most instances. those who were running for election. particularly to the Senate or the House of Representatives. were involved in issues which were statewide rather than nationwide.

A student went to him one day and asked how he had made out in the final examination. The professor said to him. \"Nelson. I am going to put you first of all the flunks.\" I occasionally think that is perhaps the position of someone who is elected to head the Republican Party. at least in these somewhat tenuous and parlous times for the Republican Party. However. I wish. in all seriousness. to add that I have had the privilege of serving with the junior Senator from Kentucky on the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. We have been together on several subcommittees which have had to consider very controversial and delicate legislation. I have always found Senator MORTON to be a person of high ethics and unimpeachable personal character. One of the things which has most distressed me in recent years has been to speak at high school and college campuses. and to learn how many bright and idealistic young people do not want to make politics a career. When. with Mrs. Neuberger. who was in the State legislature. I asked them why. they said. \"Because politics is such a dirty business.\" It seems to me that is a distressing situation. because if our country has any hope at all. the hope rests on persuading the most intelligent. the best educated. the most courageous. and the most idealistic young men and women to go into government. I have this very great faith: that while THRUSTON B. MORTON is national chairman of his party. he will never indulge in character assassination or personal epithets which in the past have sometimes characterized American politics.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. my guest today. in the Capital. is a young man from Binghamton. N.Y.. who has just received the signal honor of being named \"Boy of the Year\" by the Boys Clubs of America. That young man is John Drupa. a constituent of mine. John. now 15 years of age. fled with his mother from Latvia when the Soviets took over the country. His father and brother have until recently. been prisoners of the Russians in Siberia. I hope that somehow. a way can be found to bring them. too. to the United States to be reunited with John and his mother. Mr. Speaker. if It is true that the greatest asset we have in America is our young people. and I am sure that is true. then surely we can all take reassurance that the next generation of Americans is composed of people like John Drupa. a boy who. from a half million Boys Club members. was selected by a national committee as the boy who best fulfills the character of \"junior citizen who has rendered outstanding service to home. church. school. community. and Boys Club.\" I am inserting in todays RECORD an account of his personal achievements. accomplished in the face of many obstacles. Needless to say. all the people of his city join with me in being proud of and grateful to John for the honor he has brought to us. and for the inspiration that he is.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. because welding plays such an important role in our daily lives. our economy. and our defense. I have introduced House Joint Resolution 179. This resolution authorizes and requests the President to designate the month of April in each year as National Welded Products Month. Such a designation will give recognition to the men and the methods that are so vital to us all. Not only are the household tasks of the American family speeded and lightened. by a myriad of welded products and appliances. but our standard of living is based on the inexpensive and safe. land. air. and sea carriers made possible through welding. American industry as it exists today is built upon the use of welded machinery and equipment. The boilers that heat our buildings and the generators that furnish our power are possible only by use of the welding processes. While many skills are required to make the weapons that defend us on the ground. in the air. and in outer space. the one basic process to all is the welding process.",
