The very real interest of the President in the affairs of Alaska has been freshly evidenced by his special message to the Congress under date of May 21. 1948. In this message. of which a copy is enclosed. President Truman. after urging early enactment of legislation granting statehood to the Territory. discussed at some length the trans* portatlon needs of Alaska and outlined several specific steps toward meeting these needs. As you will note the message also recommends other important measures with respect to housing. community facilities. land settlement. agricultural and industrial development. In connection with the broad studies of Alaskan needs and opportunities which are now under way in various Federal agencies the idea of a CanadianAlaskan Railway has been advanced and given such consideration ag present circumstances appear to warrant. It is quite obvious. however. that this project. involving as it would governmental action by both Canada and the United States. requires much more study and analysis before any formal proposal could be placed before legislative bodies for their consideration. It is also felt that from the standpoint of Immediate needs the measures proposed in the enclosed message represent the highest priorities and that their attainment would have important bearing upon final judgment * as to the need. value. and economic merit of the railway project.

We therefore announced that immediately upon convening of the Eightyfirst Congress. we would. if in control of the Senate. take up a proposal to change the rules to apply cloture to all incidental matters. The people in their judgment gave control of the Senate to the Democratic Party. and we were not in a position to direct procedure in this Congress. We urged upon the majority leader that this rule be taken up immediately. On his insistence it could have been taken up by January fifteenth instead of March first. since the whole subject had been thoroughly canvassed 6 months before. During the 6 weeks between these dates. when the Senate had nothing to do the filibuster. in my opinion. could have been broken. When the motion was finally made by the majority leader on February 28 to take up the rule. we urged that every possible method be employed to bring the motion to a vote. and we were. of course. always prepared to furnish plenty of Republican votes to maintain a quorum at all times of day and night. The Republicans have been blamed because a majority of them did not support tho ruling by Vice President BARKLEY which undertook to reverse the very scholarly and logical ruling the Senator from Michigan made last August. A rather trivial attempt was made to distinguish the case from that of last August. but the question was really exactly the same. I happen to agree with the Vice Presidents interpretation of the rule. but most of the Republicans agreed with the President protempore . This is no question of a technicality. If we ever admit that Senators. in voting on rules. should permit their opinion on proposed legislation to determine their vote instead of the meaning of the rules. there would be no rules in the Senate. and we would be subject to the arbitrary wishes of a presiding officer and a majority of those present.",

Most of those ships were sunk during the war. in the service of the United States Government. After the war ended. Finland signed a peace treaty with Russia and allied governments. the treaty providing that Finland would waive all claims of any kind on Russia or its allies. The United States refused to take advantage of that clause in the peace treaty. and specifically cabled the Finns. for whom we have a traditional affection. that we would not hide behind that clause of the treaty. but that we were open to negotiations leading to the settlement of their claim against us.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think a short explanation should be made concerning the matter. It involves approximately $61.000.000. and the Senator from Michigan feels that he should make an explanation on the floor to the able Senator who is chairman of the committee. More than a year ago. during the last session of Congress. the Appropriations Committee sent to the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments an inquiry. and a suggestion that an investigation should be made of this very question. The Senator from Michigan at that time was chairman of a subcommittee. An investigation was started and a report was made to the Appropriations Committee. but the investigation has not been carried on. The Senator from Michigan was not advised that the able Senators committee was making its own investigation. I felt that the time had come when the Appropriations Committee should continue its own investigation. because the service is costing millions of dollars every year. A subsidy is given to an air line to cover any deficit in that air lines expenditures. In other words. no control is had of the air lines by the Congress or by the Federal Government. and if it should go into the red for any reason whateverit may be extravagant in the purchase of land where its ticket offices are located. it may be extravagant in the serving of highpriced meals. it can use the money for any purpose. and after it is used. and it finds itself in the red and that it has been \"deficit spending.\" Congress must appropriate money as a subsidy to pay off the deficit. The Senator from Michigan felt that the time had come when something should be done. The investigating committee had not completed its work. and it was felt that the Appropriations Committee should continue. So I hope the Appropriations Committee will cooperate and allow a continuation of the investigation at an early date. Something should be done. because this situation has been going on for many years under a blind subsidy from the Post Office Department to the air lines.",

Mr. President. if I were thinking only of political benettsespecially since I may be a candidate for reelection next yearI would let this record go unchallenged. The fact that the newspapers and columnists all over the Nation called this a rigid 90percent program has certainly put me in good standing with the people of my State and elsewhere. Now the farmers are calling me a 90percenter. which. politically. is the next best thing to being called a 100percenter. In farm language. To those who may question my thinking on this matter. I merely want to point out that in practically every poll taken recently in the Midwest. and even in the conservative area of the Midwest. fatmers indicated a heavy preference for 100percent supports. Mr. President. the press has been of great service politically in my State by calling this amendment a rigid 90percent program. Again. if it were only for political purposes. I would not challenge this record. However. I want to be absolutely honest with the farmers of my State and Nation. Farmers are the most loyal people in the world. and I would not. for anything. try to deceive them in any way. Only last week the political paper of my colleague the Senator from North Dakota had this to say: Well. now MIT YOUNG is sure getting his neck out pretty far by bucking against the Brannan plan. The farmers want their 100percent parity and MIT he better watch out. I heard the Farmers Union fellow talk on the radio about it the other night. It sounds like sense to me. The heck with this 65 percent stuff. Sixtyfive percent may be enough to suit MILT. but for me. I want 100percent parity like the Brannan plan says. So the press may observe that they did me a real Service. Obviously. Mr. President. it gives me a great deal of pleasure to spoil the argument of my good and respected political opponents In North Dakota. I would be sitting on top of the world politically. if I could only get the press to carry the following statement made by my good friend. the Democratic majority floor leader .

I may circulate that statement all over North Dakota next year. Mr. President. I have had more than a little experience with these 60percent labels. 90percent labels. and 100percent labels. My good friend. Vice President BARKLEY. in the last campaign made a brief visit to Minnesota. and I believe he made two speeches. In those speeches he advocated 90percent supports. The day following those speeches. nearly every farmer in Minnesota was saying. \"BARKLEY is a 90percenter.\" \"BARKLEY is a 90percenter.\" Some of those Minnesota farmers crossed the Red River into North Dakota. and said. \"BARKLEY and Truman are 90percenters. BARKLEY and Truman are 90percenters.\" That gave me a rather hard time. when I was trying to carry my State for the Republican ticket. I. too. was compaigning for 90percent supports. but I believed the Secretary of Agriculture could provide those supports under the Aiken Act. The net result was that North Dakota gave Governor Dewey a bigger vote than he had received 4 years previously. However. I noticed that in Minnesota. with Its good Governor Youngdahland in my opinion he is one of the outstanding governors of the Nationthe two good Republican Senators at that time. and the many good Republican Congressmenit was impossible to overcome the argument Senator BARKLEY made and to stop the farmers from voting the Democratic ticket.",

Heretofore there has been an effort to control his production by the creation of scarcities in corn and wheat through the reduction of production. He was told. \"If you are short of feed. it will influence the production of perishables. and that will result automatically in high prices.\" But that could not be. because the program itself proved to us in the late 1930s that the wheat and corn controls did not in any sense control dairy products. nor did they control pork and beef. So there was a drastic problem facing the producer of perishables. and a drastic problem of rigid controls facing the producer of wheat. corn. and even cotton. because more than a fourth of the crop of wheat was being put under seal at 57 cents a bushel. under a commodity loan. as late as 1940.

We. therefore. believe. on the theory that it is. in fact. an opening step to a point 4 program. that the subject is of such paramount interest that it should be submitted to complete study and investigation by a special commission having authority and prestige. such as has the Hoover Commission. We have proposed a commission which is bipartisan. We hope it will be a commission which can assemble the facts in connection with the subject. which. so far. has been almost completely unexplored. The Secretary of State. when he appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee. said that this is an underlying move for the full point 4 program. He said it is of overriding importance and that it occupies a place of equality with the other three points of the Presidents 4point program. If that be true. we should not be approaching the subject in this glancing sidedoor way. If it is not true. then. Mr. President. because various aspects of the intended functions of the bill are already covered by existing legislation. such as the SmithMundt Act. the Fulbright Act. and a half dozen others which have been described. and it is covered by activities of private organizations. by the ExportImport Bank. the United Nations. there is no point in including a new program of that kind in what we hope is a bill looking to the approaching end of the ECA program.",

I wish to point out that when this matter came up in the Committee on Foreign Relations we definitely did not adopt the point 4 program presented by the Secretary of State. We said that we were not prepared to do that. and attach any such longrange program to the ECA program. Therefore we merely saved the exchange of technical knowledge and skills as provided in the amendment. We provided further that contracts or agreements made under the amendment may not run beyond June 30. 1952. Thus it becomes coextensive with the ECA. The purpose in adopting the amendment was to continue the technical knowledge and skills we were providing in connection with ECA. and so far as I am concerned. if the committee--Connallyamendment can be agreed to. I am perfectly willing to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Massachusetts for a full study of this whole subject. after the ECA is wound up. I think that is in line with what the Senior Senator from Michigan suggested in his letter to Mr. Hoffman. where he recommended that we should have a special nonpartisan committee set up to study what we will do with the whole situation after 1952. I do not think there is any inconsistency in adopting the Connally amendment. and going ahead with the SaltonstallMillikin amendment to set up the investigating committee. I think both should be done if we are to have a complete picture. I emphasize again. that the Connally amendment. which is the committee amendment. will expire. so far as contracts are concerned. in 1952. when the ECA expires. and the whole program provided for in the amendment will expire in 1955.",

It is made up of most amiable and estimable gentlemen. made up of the senior circuit judges of the country. several of them good friends of niine. I hope that after this debate they will continue to be good friends of mine.

I do think when we first authorize the new judgeship we should follow the practice which we have followed in the past almost universally and provide that it shall be temporary. I am frank to say to the Members. and particularly to my friend from Indiana. that this is a stronger case than the Illinois case. but it still does not seem to me to indicate the need for a judge. As was pointed out by the gentleman from Ohio. Indiana is a particularly lawabiding State. The number of criminal cases brought in the Indiana districts is well under the average for the country at large. As appears on page . I. s far as criminal cases are concerned they are terminating and disposing of more criminal cases than are being started. which is an admirable position and somewhat different. I believe. from Kansas City which we will come to later. But. there is an improvement also as the gentleman will observe at the top of page 11 over the year before in the termination of civil cases. and the court. with the two judges. is almost current at the present time. so I feel that the need is not sufficiently established. certainly. to provide for a permanent judge. I feel I shall have to oppose the bill and certainly oppose it unless such an amendment is adopted. I just received some interesting figures which I will go into in more detail on the next judgeship bill. but they indicate this important fact: We are adding to the number of judgeships much faster than our population is increasing. so that the per capita number of persons served by a single judge is decreasing all the time. in other words. all of these average figures which we get. it must be remembered. take account of many areas where there is not a need for the number of judges that are there now. The difficulty with passing all these judgeship bills is that we never get abillat least. I have never seen a bill presented hereto eliminate or cut down the number of judges in an area.",

Of course we felt that one judge could serve a number of districts. and that therefore there would be sufficient and adequate judicial consideration given to the legal matters in a State.

The IRO compiles a file on Hans Schmidt. The facts regarding him are placed in the file. The IRO is not an American organization. it is an international organization. Its employees are not Americans. No displaced person can come to the United States until this foreign organization sends that file to the Displaced Persons Commission. The Senator from New York says this man is screened by the Displaced Persons Commission. The testimony of officials of this Government shows that there is no adequate screening of the displaced persons by them and. furthermore. that they are sent to this country when an investigation has shown that they do not meet the qualifications of the act. or that they. are criminals or are Communists. The file goes to the Displaced Persons Commission. The Senator from New York says the persons are screened by the Displaced Persons Commission. The facts show that Hans Schmidts name goes to the provost marshals office and to the Berlin document center. Senior officials of the Displaced Persons Commission stated that they do not wait for a report from the provost marshals office or from the Berlin document center. They have deliberately taken a calculated risk. because. to wait for the security report would require 2 or 3 weeks and would delay the program. That is the testimony of the officials of that Organization. and the testimony of the officials of the Immigration Service. Let me say that when an adverst report has been put in a mans file he is turned down. However. most of the cases have been overruled from above. The adverse report was taken out of the file by orders of the Displaced Persons Commission when it got to the consular service.",

The great issue before the Senate now is. first. whether we will go on as the Senator from West Virginia. the Senator from New York. and the Senator from Michigan desire. with a system in which the proof shows that displaced persons are selecting displaced persons to come to the United States. or whether we as a Congress will define by legislation who are displaced persons. and set up an agency of the American Government to select them.

At present there is no such thing as peacetime treason. for the Constitution limits the crime to making war on the United States or giving aid to a nation at war with the United States. The constitutional provision should be broadened to cover peacetime treason. by providing that one is a traitor if he gives aid or assistance to an agent of a country seeking to overthrow the United States Government.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment will leave the statute of limitations in the bill as it is written. in other words. 10 years. in reference to the offenses to which that limitation applies. I think there are three in section 2. But it does arrest the running of the statute of limitations in reference to any person who holds an office or.an appointment or is an employee of the United States Government. The philosophy back of the amendment is substantially this: Public .office is a public trust. Any man who holds a position of trust with the Government is also probably in a position to conceal the offense that he might have committed. That is one factor. A second factor is that perhaps he would be in a position of influence so as to prevent the commencement of a prosecution. The statute of limitations. therefore. should not run until after he has vacated the office or position of trust that he held. This language is taken from a bill. H. R. 1759. which I introduced on January 24 of last year. but concerning which. so far as I know. there have been no hearings. At least I have not been informed of any. Ii. seems to me it is a perfectly sound principle that any man who holds a position of public trust should not have the statute of limitations toll as against him so long as he holds that position. That is the philosophy back of this amendment. I think it is sound and should tie adopted.",

Witnesses might disappear. witnesses might die. the defendant might be deprived of a defense he originally had. and thus too great a burden is placed on the individual. This amendment also would discriminate against American citizens as compared with foreign agents possibly. You would have one statute of limitations applicable to American citizens employed by the Government and another one that would apply. for instance. to a foreign agent who came here and violated the law. I do not know offhand whether this amendment would strike at the constitutionality of this act.

I wish the people who are apprehensive about war would quit giving away important military information to our potential enemies. It is not an exaggeration to say that America is giving away a billion dollars worth of information each year to potential enemies. The fact is that with the information which is being made public about the details of our Military Establishment and as to our. future plans. potential enemies can conserve their expenditures and make the best possible application of their funds. Smart football quarterbacks do not give the opposing team all the signals and strategic plans before the game is played. Military people are not the only offenders.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is with deep sorrow and regret that I rise to announce the death this morning of a great Oklahoma statesman. the Honorable Thomas Pryor Gore. one of the first United States Senators from Oklahoma. He passed away this morning after having a cerebral hemorrhage. Senator Gore served the State of Oklahoma as its first Senator. He came to the United States Senate In 1907 and served with great distinction until 1920. He returned to the United States Senate in 1926 and served until 1932. He was accidentally blinded as a child. Despite this almost insuperable handicap he managed to write a record of great and distinguished service in the political life of his country and in his State. Oklahoma deeply mourns and regrets the death of this truly great and courageous statesman. His sense of humor. his sense of fairness. his courage to face defeat for a principle in which he believed without compromise. sets him apart and sets him forward with the great statesmen who have served the United States of America. Senator Gore was 78 years of age when he passed away at 9:50 a. m. today. I would like to incorporate here excerpts from the Washington Evening Star announcing Senator Gores passing: Thomas Pryor Gore was of the breed that turns handicaps into assets. When he was 8 years old. a stick thrown at a cow by a playmate blinded his left eye. Three years later. accidental discharge of a toy gun destroyed the other eye. For the next 5 years. until he was 16. young Tom Gore was without formal schooling. But during those years he was developing the qualities that served him well through three Senate termsa retentive memory. an independence seldom found in the handicapped and a bright philosophy that penetrated the walls of darkness. Before the darkness closed in Mr. Gore had been a page boy in the State senate of his native Mississippi. It was then the germ of politics was planted. It was nurtured along the way. such as the day when he was 16 orized the name of every Senator. and from that time on he knew by heart every congressional roster.",

The gentleman from Oklahoma spoke of Senator Gores sense of humor. I am sure that Senator Gore. if he were with us today. would not object to my telling of this amusing Incident. which bears out what the gentleman just said about his sense of humor. He was debating with a very distinguished Senator many years ago. before he ever left Mississippi. when he was only about 21 years of age. The Senator became infuriated and said. \"I cannot afford to take advantage of the gentlemans handicap. I realize he is blind. But if he was on an equality with me in that respect. I would beat the face off of him.\" Mr. Gore quietly rose and said. \"Mr. Chairman. just blindfold the Senator and lead him around here.\" The laughter that followed almost broke up the meeting. He was not only quick. he was not only witty. he was not only brilliant. but he was one of the most patriotic men who ever graced the Senate of the United States.

Second. the deal not only gives the official sanction of our Government to bilateral trade agreements. but underwrites them with American dollars. Let us look at the situation from these two points of view.",

    "speech": "Yes. I have considerable to say in my prepared speech on that subject. I shall reach it in a few minutes. I characterize that statement as \"jabberwocky.\" The greater part of the wheat in the country is tied up under Government loans. Farmers will not redeem this wheat unless the price reaches a point where the farmer can pay off the loan and the charges. If this point is not reached. the Government will become the owner of a vast quantity of wheat a month or two before the 1950 crop comes In. Becduse of the current surplus. the Secretary of Agriculture on July 14 announced a decrease in the national wheat acreage allotment of some 17 percent. as compared with the acreage allotment last year. This has been modified by recent legislation. Public Law 272. But even allowing for this modification. the national acreage allotment for the coming year is only 68.900.000 acres. as compared to 83.200.000 acres last year. Of course. the only purpose of this reduced allotment is to endeavor to offset the surplus. Our goodneighbor policy has been carried to the point where we are cutting back our own production to give a market to the farmers of other countries. The wheat crop of Canada this year was planted upon an acreage 12 percent greater than last year. Our Government. on the other hand. now Is asking our farmers to cut back their production by accepting an acreag6 allotment 14.300.000 acres less than the acreage In 194849. This reduction in the acreage In the United States necessarily means a reduction In the farmers Income. The Secretary of Agriculture is by law charged with the duty and the responsibility of looking after the interests of the American farmer. Why is it that he is willing to resort to a strained construction of the law to justify a deal which will have the effect of taking money out of the pocket of the same American farmer? If at the recent \"dollar talks\" in Washington It was deemed advisable to do something more for Great Britain. why was our farmer picked out or picked on to pay for it? This is another \"calculated risk.\" It is calculated to destroy the farm pricesupport program. Whatever happens. our farmer will lose.",

To the farmer. who of necessity is a practical person. \"a bird In the hand is worth two in the bush.\" I grant that what the surplus supply situation may be in Canada is a different matter. The Canadian farmers are plagued with a chronic surplus that does not move. They have our sympathy. It Is the heartfelt sympathy of a fellow sufferer. But now that the emphasis is on troubles. what about our troubles? We have our troubles. too. I pose this question: Should not the American situation be the first concern of the American Congress?

Such amendments *as appear desirable should be made by the elected Representatives of our people in Congress assembled. The program should not be choked to death by American. British. and Canadian bureaucrats. sitting in hushhush sessions behind closed doors in the State Department. Section 1. title 1. of the Agricultural Act of 1948. directs the Secretary of Agriculture. by means of \"loans. purchases. or other operations.\" to support prices of wheat at the rate of 90 percent of parity. The Secretary decided to use a loan based on 90 percent of parity. Since then the price for wheat on the market has consistently been below the loan price. For example. wheat prices at Kansas City recently were 16 cents below the loan value. A month before they were 22 cents below. and still are generally under the loan value. Commodity Credit Corporation has bought very little wheat on this crop. If $175.000.000 were to be spent by our Government in the United States in buying wheat for Great Britain. there would be a material advance In the price of American wheat to American producers. In that event. Great Britain would pay more for wheat purchased in the United States. It Is apparent. then. that In the \"dollar talks\" in Washington. important steps were taken to scuttle the existing policy of price supports for American farm products. I am lacking in originality when I say that someone has \"stuck a pitchfork in the farmers back.\" But this is an accurate and graphic description of what has occurred. As the Secretary of Agriculture wielded the fork. he whispered sweet nothings. smooth as butter. in the farmers ear. Mr. President. the Senate Committee on Agriculture should lose no time in making an objective. unprejudiced. and impersonal appraisal of just what was done at these \"dollar talks\" in Washington. Their effect upon the American economy. present and future. should be investigated promptly. carefully. publicly.",

One policeman on the street corner maintains law and order. There Is no parking before water hydrants. There is no parking In areas marked by yellow paint. merely because of the fact that there is one policeman on the block who would notice if there were a violation of the parking regulations. The same would be true of an International police force. The mere presence of such a body to maintain law and order among the nations of the world would go a long way toward preserving peace. The operation of such an agency would be a very simple matter In maintaining law and order and proper conduct on the part of the leaders of the various nations. For that reason I say to the able Senator that I am very much impressed with his remarks. While we may not achieve our objective at this time. I know that with the Senators efforts and the efforts of other Senators who have joined in the various resolutions. we shall achieve what we have all hoped and prayed for. namely. an international policing body In connection with the United Nations Organization. and an international world court which can determine when there are violations of the principles incorporated In the documents of the United Nations Organization.

Instead of our having to do it all. we have been trying to help those countries develop navies so that they could take care of a certain amount of the patrolling duties. During the last wai Brazil and several other countries of South America were a great help to us in that respect. They released a great many of our ships. The purpose of putting that provision in the bill is a part of the hemispheric defense. in order to make it possible to augment their small supply of ships from our excess source of supply. on a cash basis. so that they may help us patrol the sea lanes and not tie up our Navy.

As a matter of fact when we went to conference the House was opposed to the President having any power to put the selectiveservice machinery into effect even when the Congress was not in session. The Senate took the position that the President ought to have the right to put the selectiveservice machinery into effect when the Congress was not in session. But as the bill came from the Senate Committee on Armed Services and was reported to the Senate. It provided that either the President or the Congress could put it into effect at any time regardless of whether the Senate or the House were in session or not. So I think the Chair will ruleand I think the precedents will support the positionthat the Senate conferees were within their rights when they acceded to the House proposition that the Selective Service Act. as is. be extended for the period of 1 year.",

I am not interested in the gamblers on the stock exchanges. I am only interested in every possible way which is honorable in seeing that the producers of agricultural commodities receive a fair price. The House Committee on Banking and Currency did not have an opportunity to have hearings on this provision in the bill. The Senate committee had hearings and voted 10 to I to send it to the Senate Committee on Agriculture for consideration. Our chairman has promised that the House committee would do that. Now. this is intended to be a war measure. It is supposed to be a measure which will increase production to an extent necessary to win the war. That includes textiles. it includes soybeans. It includes wheat and other agricultural commodities and the products thereof. I do not believe. speaking for the thing that I know most about. that the textile mills can buy cotton in quantities from the producers and process it. unless they have the opportunity of the insurance of hedging. I do not believe that the language in the House bill. which simply says it shall not interfere with legitimate hedging. is possible of administration. if. on the other hand. you destroy all speculative buying. I am not interested in the speculator. I am interested in the man who grows the commodity. But I know if you destroy the processor or make it impossible for him to operate. the farmer will soon lose his market. and I know that a mill cannot buy large quantities of farm commodities unless he can hedge against fluctuations in the market while he is processing and selling the products.

We have plenty of eggs. we have plenty of butter. we have plenty of everything to feed the American people. The reason these commodities have risen so in price is because of the fact we have hoarders. Hoarding is the forerunner to a rise in prices.

I offered this identical amendment to the Selective Service Act of 1948 and it was ruled out of order as not being germane. I felt perhaps the same thing would happen today. but I wanted to make the effort because I think we have to tax ourselves as we go along to pay the cost of what we are undertaking in this time of crisis. We are going to have to spend $60.000.000.000 at least in this fiscal year of 1951. We will have an income of perhaps $45.000.000.000. and like my friend the gentleman from Pennsylvania I want to ask you. \"Where are you going to get the money?\"-if not through taxes on us as individuals and if not through excess profits taxes on corporations which can well afford to pay because this amendment would apply only to excess profits which are above normal peacetime profits.

Let us at least try to match the sacrifices being made by our men in Korea.

Why should Congress put one segment to one side and say that this group is untouchable for any controls of inflation? In past years trying to hold down inflation through rent control. from the Republican side of the aisle during every rent control bill we were told how people were selling their existing housing and how we were losing the supply of rental housing. Of course. we were losing that because there was no control over the credit for these old houses. The prices went up and up and your supply of rental houses disappeared. Easy credit helped this inflation. That caused a great deal of difficulty for the people who had to rent quarters in which to live. The gentlemans amendment here will still allow this cycle of upward prices on old housing through easy and uncontrolled credit terms. There is no idea of putting ceilings on the prices. Surely there is some logic and common sense in putting some kind of credit controls on the realestate transactions of these existing houses. If it is sensible to put them on new houses. or veterans houses. if you please. then is it not just as good common sense to put it on the existing houses instead of leaving that segment absolutely untounched?",

For example in Los Angeles. where there will be much aircraft production. the city council the other day voted to remove rent controls.

I was not present during the debate yesterday because I was engaged in a committee hearing when the Senator answered some objections which had been advanced by the National Association of Retail Druggists. who seem to think. according to mail which I have received from them in Connecticut. that this bill is designed to make their life more difficult and their business activities unprofitable. I wrote some of them that we had had some testimony in a committee of which I had the privilege of being a memberthe Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerceand that I had heard some testimony from Connecticut manufacturers which seemed to prove that unless a system of freight absorption was made possible in a clear and obvious manner they would be unable to compete with Middle Western manufacturers. The druggists to whom I wrote along that line replied by saying that apparently I was interested only in manufacturers. not in druggists. The obvious answer is that if there are no manufacturers in Connecticut who employ people there will not be many druggists who will have anybody to sell to. I should like to ask the Senator again to give an assurance which. coming from him. will have great weight. because the Senator from Wyoming has devoted a lifetime to fighting monopoly and has become an expert on the question.

It was only last week that we were having lunch together downstairs and talking about the future. I came to know JOHN LESINSKI very well back in 1941. when I first came to this great legislative body. It has been my privilege to have been a personal friend of JOHN LESINSKI for the past 10 years. not only as a colleague on the floor of the House but off the floor of the House as well. I do not believe I have ever known a cleaner (ompetitor in sports than JOHN LESINSKI. as he has shown himself so well. After a hard days work in the House. going over to the gymnasium. we who have played and competed with him in that gymnasium. on both sides of the aisle. have come to know him as one of the cleanest sportsmen we have ever competed with. He was a man of great character. He was a man of great principle. He was a man who had the courage of his convictions. He was a man whose word was his bond. Not only his wife and family and his colleagues in the United States House of Representatives will miss him but so will the constituents of his own district and the untold millions of underprivileged throughout this country and the world whose cause he championed so well in his 18 years as a Member of this great legislative body.",

I came to know JOHN LESINsI as a man of courage and great resourcefulness in legislative matters. On a committee assignment last November in Puerto Rico Mrs. Velde and I were fortunate to become better acquainted with Mr. LESINSKI and his wife. Estelle. in a social way. His sudden passing recalled to our minds the very pleasant comradeship we enjoyed with Mr. and Mrs. Lesinski on this occasion. I learned to respect Chairman LEsINSKI for his devotion to duty. his integrity. his honesty. and his great love of country. JOHN LESINSKI was a deeply religious man. He was thoroughly endowed with the spirit of Americanism. having risen in esteem and love of his fellowmen by dint of hard work and good business judgment. His tolerance for the opinions of his fellowmen with whom he worked was responsible for their extreme affection and respect. His passing will be mourned by all who had the opportunity of knowing his fine character. Mrs. Velde joins with me in extending to his wife. Estelle. and all the members of his family our deepest sympathy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when my secretary brought me the tragic news last Saturday that JOHN LESINSKI had died. it was hard to believe. Only last week I had spent 3 long hours with our departed friend discussing many matters that were coming before his committee. and discussing many other matters in which we found ourselves in agreement. As usual I had thoroughly enjoyed our discussion. I think all of us recognize that JOHN LzsiNsKi was one of the most genial and most jovial Members of this House. his jovial bantering that all of us recall as he sat at the luncheon table will always be among my fondest memories. JOHN LESINSKI was also a man of deep convictions. and he was willing to fight for his convictions. Having come up from the ranks himself. he appreciated the problems that beset all American citizens. no matter what their economic status might be. I think he fought hard and well for the things he believed in. He backed President Trumans program as he had earlier backed Franklin Roosevelts program. He never hesitated to tell you where he stood. and for that I think all of us respected him. His deep religious faith naturally made him a tremendous foe of Communism throughout the world. I was discussing with him only last Wednesday the problem of the present Communist government in Poland. which he detested as all of us do. He was looking forward. as has been suggested several times on this floor. to the time when the beloved land of his forefathers should once again become a true democratic government. His fame had spread well beyond his district. One matter I was discussing with him last week was an invitation from some citizens of my district to come and speak to them. I urged him to give it every possible consideration. as I knew how very much Americans of Polish descent respected this great fighter for democracy and the rights of the people. I think probably none of us realized the extent to which he had through his intensity been spending his energy. This undoubtedly helped to bring about his untimely death. I. too. want to extend my deepest sympathy to his wife and to the other loved ones that JOHN LESINSKI leaves behind. He was a great person who gave freely of himself. We will all miss him.",

Because of the long hours of work we put in together on the committee I came to know him very well. I was stunned by news of his death. because only last Thursday morning the whole committee met in executive session. Despite the fact that in months gone by the committee has had to deal with many bitter and highly controversial problems. this meeting on Thursday was one of harmony. one in which we completed work on a bill in which JOHN LEsINsKI had great interest. H. R. 7940. I believe the Members of the House would like to know that after the committee finished its work on that bill it reported the bill unanimously. which in our committee. Is something unusual. Mr. LESINSKI was workirg on his job up until almost the time of his death. I want to say here one thing I said about JOHN LESINSKI while he was still alive. and it comes about by reason of my experience serving under him on the committee: I have never known a man as devoid of personal malice as was JOHN LESINSKI. I saw him put to the test many. many times. No matter how bitter and how difficult the debate in the committee became. no matter how many harsh words were said. JOHN LESINSKI always had good will toward everyone on the committee. and as far as I know. toward everyone else that he knew in the world. I think nothing finer could be said of any man. I know from personal experience that JOHN LESINSHI was a man devoid of personal malice. My wife joins me in expressing our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Lesinski and the family.",

Chairman CONNALLY Of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chairman TYDINGS of the Senate Armed Services Committee both turned thumbs down on the proposal made by Senator KNOWLAND. KNOWLAND said he plans to place his request in writing before the armed services group. But TYDiNGs said this was a matter for the Foreign Relations Committee to handle.

CONNALLY told a news conference yesterday the committee might call on the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Johnson for a report on the far eastern strategic situation. But he made it clear this morning he plans no action at present in this direction. \"It would serve no good purpose to call them at this time.\" CONNALLY said. \"I am satisfied the President made his decision with the full knowledge of all the facts involved.\" I should like to ask the Senator whether he knows of any way the Congress of the United States can come to sound decisions in connection with the performance of its constitutional obligations in meeting the defense needs of the Nation and in helping to formulate foreign policy. if the Congress is to be denied information to which it is entitled and upon which it could base those judgments.",

POE: The harvesting of the East Texas sweet potato crop is far along and I believe that with clear weather 2 more weeks will see over 90 percent of the crop out of the ground. Some of the late plantings have been left as long as possible to increase size and weight. Yields of No. 1 potatoes have been very disappointing. I doubt if the average would amount to more than 50 to 60 boxes per acre. This explains why growers are not going the route of selling their crop for schoollunch purposes. The actual cost to them will run at least $75 per acre and at $1.35 per box. they could not afford to lose some $25 per acre. Most of them tell me that they had rather go ahead and gamble on a rising price in future months. The market will no doubt react and we are encouraging farm storage by everyone who has any volume of potatoes. I was hoping that a price of at least $1.75 could be set up to assist the growers during the lowpriced period which would have held the market at somewhere near that level. The small farmer with a 5- to 10acre patch of potatoes has had to sell them at considerable loss in order to get the crop out of ground before frost. It is this type of farmer that surplus programs are designed to aid. Of course. you and I do not have any control over the setting of the price which is offered to farmers. but if it had been set at a reasonable figure we would not have had the losses to the farmers which have occurred this season. We appreciate your fine cooperation which you and your coworkers have given and if we can help you in any way. let us know. Yours truly.",

When I first came to this body in 1928. John McDuffile was one of the first Members that I met. and there developed a very close and strong friendship between us. Those of us who served with John McDuffle will always remember him not only as a legislator but as a man. He was always a gentleman. kind. considerate. and charitable. As a legislator he was outstanding. The respect and confidence that his colleagues had in him is evidenced by the fact that he was Democratic whip for several years. He was at one time a candidate for Speaker. He was defeated only in a very close vote. and as one of our colleagues sitting close by observed just a few moments ago to me and a few of us who were seated near him it was one of the hardestfought contests for Speakership ever waged. John McDuffle rendered outstanding service to his State. and when he came to the Congress. outstanding service to his country in the legislative walk of life and. later. in the judicial branch of our Government. for many years. he rendered equally outstanding service. I am deeply grieved in the passing of John McDuffie. When his death was announced I sent a telegram to his widow conveying to her and the other loved ones left behind the deep sympathy of Mrs. McCormack and myself. which I reiterate and repeat on this occasion.",

I would like to join in paying tribute to his memory and to his services as a Member of the House and district judge of the United States Court for the District of Alabama in which Mobile is located. Judge MeDuffle served in the House of Representatives for eight terms. or 16 years. from March 4. 1919. to March 2. 1935. when he resigned to accept an appointment as United States district judge. When I became a Member of the House on March 4. 1925. John McDuflle was among the first Members of Congress that I met. Our families lived in the same hotel for a number of years. He was a member of the Committee on Rivers and Harbors and supported the improvement of the rivers and harbors of the country. The improvement of the Mississippi River and its tributaries was vital to the people of the district I represent. We thus had many interests in common. John MeDuffle was an able and capable legislator. He was familiar with the science of government. He was a man possessed of wide information and was familiar with the problems and issues of all parts of our common country. He had his political convictions. He was not only a very capable legislator but he was a courageous statesman. He possessed the judicial temperament. While I am more familiar with his record as a legislator than as a judge. he occasionally presided over the district Federal courts in Mississippi and he enjoyed the esteem of the members of the bar for his fairness and ability in the conduct of the court. John MeDuffle was a great patriot. He was devoted to his country. He was a kind husband and father. He had a most successful career in the House of Representatives and on the bench of the district court of the United States. Honor to his memory and peace to his ashes.",

John McDuffie was of the scholarinpolitics type. He served for the purpose of making his country a better place in which to live. He believed the closer the Government was to the people. the better it was for all. He vigorously opposed the trend of an allpowerful bureaucracy.

Things just do not seem the same for a time. His friends were numbered by his acquaintances and he accomplished much in the Congress for his district. his State and his Nation. He became United States judge in Alabama and I continued as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives having jurisdiction over Federal courts. Because of this fact. our friendly relations and mutual interests brought us together occasionally and prompted much correspondence between us. We usually agreed on judicial matters and I always prized his information and suggestions. He had a fine legal mind. was a tireless worker and was intellectually honest. In short. he had the courage of his convictions and the court reports stand as a monument to his sound judgment and his fearlessness.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in all the speculation regarding what is happening in the conferences going on between Prime Minister Attlee and President Truman. it has been frequently reported or suggested that some of the European countries favor our reducing our own efforts in the Far East and our assistance to those who are resisting armed communism in Asia. there seems to be a belief that less aid to Asia will mean more aid to Europe. and that even to let Asia go will improve the prospects of saving Europe. I think our friends in Europe ought to understand that any such belief has a very dubious basis. It is more likely that less aid to Asia will mean less aid to Europe also. Why? Because the loss of Asia to Communist control. thereby freeing Russia to send into Europe all of her own forces and a few million Chinese. too. if needed. will so reduce the prospects of being able to save Europe that it is very doubtful whether the United States would be justified in continuing aid to Europe. To weaken ourselves further without saving them is of no benefit to them any more than to our own country. I say this as one who has supported fully every program of aid to Europe. and who will continue to do so just as long as there is any reasonable possibility of success. But you have heard me express repeatedly during more than 3 years my conviction that our best chances of preventing war with Russia is to keep both Western Europe and China free and capable of resistance so that the Soviets are compelled to divide their strength and attention between two widely separated fronts. We still must find means to prevent her concentrating all of her forces against Europe or there will be no chance of its successful defense. I am convinced as much as ever that to save either Europe. or Asia. both must be kept independent of Soviet control. The loss of either will mean the loss of both. If Western Europe does not help us to the full in Asia. it is not reasonable to expect that we will consider it wise or possible to increase or even to continue our help to them in Europe. I hope that is clearly understood by all in our Government as well in the European countries.",

The House bill also provided that a reorganization plan submitted by the President would go into effect within 60 days of its submission to Congress unless both Houses of Congress adopted a concurrent resolution disapproving the plan within that period of time. The Senate bill contained no onepackage provision. contained no exemptions of any agencies whatsoever. But it provided that either House. by simple resolution. might veto the plan within the 60day period of time. The conferees have agreed. and the House has approved. the elimination of the exemptions and of the onepackage provision. and accepted the Senate version of the bill on that score. The conferees also agreed to accept. and the House has approved. the Senate provision for a oneHouse veto. modified to this extent. that a constitutional majority of one House shall be required to reject a reorganization plan. The virtue of the oneHouse veto. as I see it. is that neither branch of the Congress abdicates its power to disapprove a plan. I think we went a little further. perhaps. than we should. but in order to get an agreement. In order to get the best bill the conferees could agree upon. the Senate conferees yielded to a modification of its oneHouse veto provision to the extent of requiring the veto be by a constitutional majority.",

    "speech": "The House bill had no expiration date. The Senate bill has the date of April 1. 1953. Let me explain the reason why that provision was placed in the bill in the committee and approved by the Senate. I believe that reorganization should be a continuing program. However. if there is no expiration date. Congress. busily occupied as it is. would probably never review the matter to find out how the program was working. So we inserted that provision. which gives full power to the present administration during its present term and to the succeeding administration for the first ensuing Congress. The President would have to submit his plans in about that time by April 1 in order to allow Congress a 60day period in which to reject them. So the expiration date runs over into the next Presidential administration. but cuts off at the end of the first ensuing Congress.",

We are delegating some legislative power. but by having a oneHouse veto. neither House absolutely abrogates its power or renders itself impotent and powerless to veto a plan if it feels that the plan is not good or sound.

We were faced with a rather difficult situation. In view of the fact that the two bills basically did not coincide. They were in extreme conflict. We had the House bill. with the requirement for two vetoes. with exceptions. We had the Senate bill without exceptionsa perfectly clean bill. with a singleHouse veto. The job was to reconcile them. We did reconcile them. and we reconciled them in what I consider to be the soundest manner possible. We simply compromised by keeping the Senate version and requiring that the singleHouse veto to prevent adoption of a reorganization plan be by constitutional majority of either House. In my judgment. the bill now before the Senate is superior to either the bill which was passed by the House or the bill which was passed by the Senate. For once a bill has come out of conference which Is better than the bill passed in either House. and I certainly hope it will receive the full support of the Senate.",

I think it is a very happy day for all those who believe in efficient and economical government. for all who feel that the downfall of popular government in other parts of the world has been due to the fact that government over there became inefficient.

However. at this time I wish to emphasize the importance of the objective of this bill. It will be of great value to private enterprise in our country in enabling it to develop the underdeveloped areas of the world. particularly of those located in the lands of our good neighbors In South America. In turn this activity should result in a greater demand for goods manufactured in this country and an increase in employment opportunities for our own citizens both in this country and abroad. As the underdeveloped areas are put into productive use. additional markets will be created in those areas for many products of our country. and trade between those areas on the one hand and areas in my own State and other States of this Nation on the other hand will be encouraged to our mutual benefit. It should be borne in mind that this program will enable North American private enterprise to aid in reducing the dollar shortage In countries which receive the benefits of this program. Working together to provide the type of development required in the underdeveloped areas. the peoples of all countries involved in the program should be able to improve further our good relations abroad and demonstrate the advantages of democracy in operation.

He was a leader of organized labor of the earlier vintage. He was ever proud of the union as he conceived it and was ever ready to advocate and defend the legitimate objectives of trade unionism. He was not a radical. He called himself a Progressive Republican.

I am of the opinion that the bill may avoid some of the reasons given for the veto in the San Francisco case. However. I think it is worth while that the Senate pass the bill. and if the President finds objection to it he may veto it. This is a private claim bill. growing out of war contracts. The amount involved is $11.540. A small portion of the total. $303. represents items produced by the contractor in excess of the amount called for by the contract. but delivered to and retained by the Government. The rest of the total consists of items for reimbursement of liquidated damages heretofore deducted and retained by the Government. The enactment of this bill is opposed by the Secretary of the Army. The bill was considered by a subcommittee consisting of the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from North Dakota . who reported it favorably to the full committee. and the subcommittee report was accepted. Certain items to which specific objection was voiced by the Secretary of the Army have been stricken from the bill in the House of Representatives. As Senators probably know. the practice of including clauses in Government contracts providing for liquidated damages has been abandoned because it was found that such clauses were unworkable and unfair. Congress has adopted the policy of reimbursing contractors who had been forced to pay liquidated damages where there was no direct fault or negligence on the contractors part. The report of the committee cites several precedents in this regard. among them a payment in the amount of $104.511. which.I believe. is the largest sum previously paid in a single bill of this nature. The committee is informed that this is probably the last claim of this nature which will come before the Congress. in view of the fact that the War Department has not required the inclusion of liquidated damage provisions in its contracts for the past 8 or 9 years.",

Since objection was made the other day to consideration of the bill during the previous call of the calendar. representatives of the Navy have approached me and asked me to try to have this measure taken up by the Senate during this call of the calendar.

I can say to the distinguished Senator from Ohio that there is a great need for the stockpiling of abaci at the present time. Our past supply always came in abundance from the Philippines. but during the war the industry there was disrupted. until today the production of abaci in the Philippines is nowhere near sufficient to meet our requirements and to give us any abaci at all for stockpiling.

Why should we now undertake to have the Government itself fill this shortage. any more than the Government should engage in operations to fill the shortage of any other agricultural commodity which may be difficult to obtain? If we are going to raise abaci. there is no reason to think that it cannot be raised in the Philippines as well as elsewhere. In fact. in connection with the matter of the restoration of the economy of the Philippines. the production of abaci there is a perfectly easy thing to do. for that is where abaci has always been grown. The fact of the matter is that we think abaci will be difficult to obtain from the Philippines in time of war. that is the justification for raising abaci in Central America.

No evidence has been submitted to indicate directly that this is not the case. although the Surgeon General of the United States has expressed the opinion that the ailment from which the claimant was suffering at the time of the operation could itself. and independently of the operation. have resulted in sterility. and has expressed the opinion that it was the ailment rather than the operation which had the result in question. The operation was performed at a station hospital in England. and the records are not available to directly establish the facts. However. the claimant submipted statements from an examining physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. to the effect that prior to his entering the service. while he suffered from prostatitis. he was not sterile. and giving the opinion of this physician that the sterility was definitely the result of the operation performed by the Army medical personnel. This is the only direct medical opinion on the point. the Surgeon Generals opinion having been only hypothetical in nature. The present state of the evidence clearly does not lend itself to a cleancut determination of the issue. but the committee took the view that a preponderance of the evidence favored the claim. and on that basis. recommended that the bill be approved. Ordinarily. in a case of this kind. the committee probably would have sent the bill to a court for determination. but in this case. it appears that the claimant never will be able to produce any more facts than those which were offered to the committee. and can therefore never establish beyond doubt that his version of the case is correct. and that on the other hand. the Department of the Army will be unable to produce any direct evidence in negation of the claim.

Whatever provision might seem to favor them is due to the peculiar situation existing. It is intended in this bill that the various groups should guarantee. where they have their committees. through committees rather than a tribe. Under the Navajo bill. since the question arose I went back and looked it up. and there is no provision there for guarantee. That was an outright rehabilitation bill. I find that in the bills we passed recently two of the bills had the same percentage with reference to grants as does this bill. The testimony before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs showed clearly that a greater portion of the loans would be paid back. It has been the feeling of the committee that it is much better to have loans than grants. and have these loans paid back. It is shown clearly that in one case a loan of $700 was made to an Indian and he was rehabilitated and ultimately deposited in the bank $3.500 the next year. He repaid the loan. A similar provision was made with reference to a loan of $500. where it was paid back and the man had a $1.000 toward the rehabilitation of his farm. I urge the passage of the bill.",

If we are to adopt a policy of changing a bill to meet the Presidents request after it has reached his desk. under the threat of a veto if a change is not made.

I submit to the distinguished Senator that it is just a little silly to have 110 acres allocated to an entire State. According to the reports we are receiving about potatoes. as well as reports on other sections of the farm program. I have no doubt that our lack of information is catching up with us. At the same time. It seems to me that a State should be allocated an acreage which would make sense while in the development stage. According to the amendment which has been offered. potato acreage would be frozen. Apparently acreage is going to be handled from the Senate floor believing that acreage controls the amount of the product. The only thing we forget on the Senate floor is that if we pay enough for potatoes and pigs. in 2 years we will have potatoes and pigs 10 feet deep all the way from Washington. D. C.. to San Francisco. We apparently know very little about what we are doing. and only hope that the taxpayers money holds out until we learn.",

There is only one other portion of the Joint resolution I did not explain. That is section 2. which provides: No price support shall be made available for any Irish potatoes planted after the enactment of this joint resolution unless marketing quotas are in effect with respect to such potatoes. As I recall. there was quite a discussion on that section a few days ago when the distinguished Senator from New Mexico obtained the floor. I desire to say that I believe that one of the most serious mistakes the Senate has made in the enactment of farm legislation was to provide for support prices without any means in the law to curtail production. either by a marketing quota system or on an acreage allotment basis. I do not believe that any kind of a farm program can long survive unless it contains the means of controlling farm production while supporting farm prices. The primary purpose of any type of agricultural adjustment legislation of this kind is to bolster prices and enable farmers to secure a fair market value from their crops. when the program becomes a dole for the farmer. and crop production exceeds all bounds of consumption and demand. the taxpayer will refuse to foot the bill. If the farmer wants to be able to count on his Government to protect him by assuring a minimum price. he should. he must. be willing to agree to controls on his acreage and production. The American farmer may well consider that runaway production under a pricesupport program might kill the goose that lays the golden egg.",

In the debate with the distinguished Senator from Louisiana this morning he indicated he would entertain an amendment to bring the acreage for Nevada at least up to the 1949 acreage. Mr. President. Nevada is a new State. Less than 11/2 percent of its acreage is in cultivation. and it is a growing State. It is necessary to have crop rotation. It probably is not too well known that the southern boundary of Nevada. approximately on the thirtyfifth degree of latitude extends as far south as the northern boundaries of Mississippi and Alabama. It is realized that subsidies naturally call for acreage restriction. but some judgment may be exercised in respect to a sovereign State which is a new State and in a state of development. Therefore I submit the following amendment. to be added to the joint resolution as a new section: SEC. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law there shall be allotted to the State of Nevada for the production of cotton in 1950 not less than 1.160 acres. which is the acreage planted to cotton in Nevada in 1949.

No man can measure its contribution. even if the proposal fails. toward causing a ferment among the people on both sides of the iron curtain who want to have a better way of living than the one they now have. In my opinion one of the reasons the Russian revolution succeeded was that there was just enough apathy concerning the retaining of the old Czarist regime. and enough resurgence toward establishing a new regime. so the new regime was able to seize power because the people of Russia thought it offered a better promise for them. whether it did or did not really do so. I believe that now there is a Godgiven opportunity for leadership by the United States to utilize every agency at its command. to use all its efforts. all its salesmanship ingenuity. all its advertising ingenuity. in sending this simple message out all over the world. It cannot do any harm. It springs from strength. The world knows how strong we are. We defeated one nation almost by ourselves. and contributed materially toward defeating two others. and in doing so we had to go across two great oceans.

It should be remembered that in order to maintain your history as a cotton producer you are required to plant cotton in only 1 of 3 years. The planting on the farm during the 1 or the 2 or the 3 years is important for two reasons only. One is when you plant it on your farm you naturally give the county credit for it and bring that into the county allotment. Secondly. you cannot be allotted more than what you have been planting in the past with some specific exceptions. Consequently under section 3 of the bill. I might say to the gentleman from Texas. the provision is that if an allocation has been made to a farmer who does not intend to plant cotton. either in part or in whole. he may surrender that acreage back to his local county committee for reallocation to other farms within the county. It may then be allocated to other cotton farms in that county on the application of a producer that he has not received an adequate allotment and that he intends to plant the additional acreage if it is allotted to them. That means that such of the surrendered acreage as is allotted to other growers and is planted within the county. the county will get credit for it in future years and thus preserve that acreage for the county.",

The Department says to these farmers. \"You cannot produce peanuts. you cannot produce cotton. you cannot produce any products that you want to produce. because you have no history of previous production.\" We have made provision for such cases. But the law has not been properly interpreted. I call your attention to the fact that in great areas of the West. we are bringing in land for cultivation. new lands. and no man can tell what the production may be or what useful commodities may be produced on those lands. These are factors we must think about as we legislate. Let no one be surprised if we come in with other amendments. for we are not dealing with a static situation. and the law is not final in its present form. I am going to read quickly what certain basic prices were as of January 1. 1948. and give the percentage that represents to the price of last November (New York wholesale prices). For instance. oats per bushel were $1.52 in 1948. last November they were selling for 76 cents a bushel. off about 50 percent. Corn went down from $2.95 a bushel in 1948 to $1.17 as of November 5. 1949. off about 60 percent. Wheat dropped from $3.20 to $2.10. off 331/3 percent. Cotton per pound dropped from 40 cents in 1948 to 30 cents. off 25 percent. Lard was off 74 percent. and cottonseed oil was off 67 percent. yet some Members tell the House that the farmer is swimming in money. that the banks in agricultural sections are full of money and that the farmer has never had such good times as he is now enjoying.

Let me close by quoting further from economic trend line studies. and this goes back to the beginning of my remarks: The forces of nature are uncontrolled and uncontrollable. The farmer. like the animals and birds. tamed and untamed. has learned to adapt himself to Natures fickle face. Before the Nation is another generation older. we will have received again a lesson we have already been given many times and which we -have Ignored. namely. that in dealing with agriculture we must reckon first. not with farmers. not with consumers. not with plans for a welfare state. but with that great and all pervading force called nature. Great and strong and pervasive as the influence of the United States Department of Agriculture may be in agriculture. it cannot deal directly with the natural forces that give to and take away from the farmer. Only the men who can walk into the fields and feel the warmth or the wetness of the soil. who can rub heads of wheat between their hands and know its readiness for harvest. who can perform the exacting farm tasks wth consummate skillonly these men can take from nature the abundance that nature is presently being induced to give. It should never be forgotten that our present bounty rests on the agricultural ability of millions of farmers. Unexercised and.unencouraged under the cold statistical stipulations of a bloodless bureaucracy. this ability to produce abundantly could in one uninstructed farm generation become only a poignant memory. Drastic reductions in farm production are long overdue. but the actual cutting back of individual farm crops and products must be done by the farmers themselves. They alone can trim agricultural production as a unit without injuring any part of its efficiency and without destroying its expansibility. Contraction attempted on a piecemeal basis by the Department of Agriculture. based solely on statistical compilations. can only work incalculable harm to what is undoubtedly our greatest national asset.",

The result would be that the needed housing would be obtained. and taxable property which would benefit the community would be constructed. and the Government would not be in the picture. because such properties would be financed by the local banks. local building and loan companies. ane insurance companies. That would give us the results we desire to have. for. first. we wish to have residential facilities which can be rented or sold. Let me say parenthetically that if the same $15.000 building. which I have used as an analogy. were to come down onethird in price. to $10.000. and if it were later sold at $15.000. the Government would capture the tax on the $5.000 gain in the sale. In the second place. we wish to make sure that more and more property subject to taxation is being constructed in the variious communities. so that they can obtain the taxes they need. In the third place. we wish to make sure that the tenants will be reasonably satisfied with what they are able to obtain in the way of rental properties. At present they cannot buy what they wish. because the cost is entirely out of sight. and thus the Government has to subsidize in order to bring down the cost.

It was the result after the Civil War. so far as that goes. It is and will continue to be the result after World War II. If we say we will not end rent control until the general economic level goes back to the precontrol period we shall never end it. because it will never go back. That is sad. but it is no sadder than everything else that has gone up in price and will never go down to a point as low as was the price before World War I. The Senator poses a very serious question when he asks. \"Under what conditions shall we get rid of rent control?\" The Senator referred earlier in his remarks to the notion of decontrolling by way of steps in the amount of rent paid. That is one of the things to which I had given thought. and which. if I remember. I discussed with the Senator from Indiana. I however. came to the conclusion that a better way to move toward decontrol was by a progressive raising of the ceiling. because it would allow the tenant. or force the tenant. so far as that is concerned. slowly to adjust himself to the new plateau of prices. I gave up the idea of decontrol step by step according to the amount of rent. because the tenant was going to hit a bump. Each successive group of tenants was going to hit a bump. when the time came. I felt that on such a rough road it was a good idea to have a shock absorber. The progressive 5 percent I was suggesting is in the nature of a shock absorber. which. nevertheless. is pointed toward decontrol. and eventually makes decontrol effective.",

It says to the American people. \"We want to get rid of rent control.

The rentcontrol administrator keeps his records on the basis of the amount of rent paid. It is a simple and easy way of doing It. I think it would show good faith on our part.

This is the culmination of a series of other statements on all kinds of farm commodities from wheat to dried eggs. It is especially noteworthy that this statement comes side by side with evidence of rising relief costs in the big cities. For instance. in my own New York City the public assistance case load now provides for 328.469 persons with 387.324 estimated for 1951. and the Federal Governments share of this public assistance relief budget is $44.046.625. Agricultural policy now obviously is not just a problem for farmers. It is time we had a department of consumers in the Federal establishment and consumers legislative committees in both Houses of the Congress to deal with just such problems as that raised by Secretary Brannan in connection with potatoes. Pressure and special interest groups will then have finally brought on their appropriate countereffort in the synthesis of all groups into onefor we are all consumers. Farmers should have a particular interest in aiding consumers at this point because opposition is mounting to the whole agricultural policy in spite of the fact that some farm price support is essential to the countrys economy. It is excesses that city dwellers are worrying about now as shown by the potato. dried egg. and similar programs which have piled up vast surpluses side by side with the existence of vast unsatisfied human needs in our own and other free countries.",

I am informed the Commodity Credit Corporation has approximately 73.000.000 pounds of eggs in storage that are not earmarked for use or disposal. and approximately 170.000.000 pounds of dried milk. Putting it another way. the CCC has on hand. for which it is paying storage. 36.500 tons of dried eggs and 85.000 tons of eried milk. It seems to me that long ago the Department of Agriculture should have arranged and made plans to dispose of these surplus food commodities in an orderly manner. They should be allocated to welfare organizations. schoollunch programs. and all other groups where such commodities are being used at the expense of the taxpayers of this country. There is no excuse or reason why the millions of bushels of potatoes under the control of CCC should not have been allocated to people who are in need of them for food. It is inexcusable and absolutely wrong that food should be destroyed when there are thousands of people in this country who would be glad to have them for food. Mr. Speaker. we are sending millions of dollars worth of food to foreign countries under the Marshall plan.

The Secretary was authorized to pay freight charges for surplus potatoes going to alcohol and starch producers.

An official of the Department of Agriculture is reported to have informed Congress that they have the authority to use funds provided under section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to pay handling and transportation charges to move the surplus food to welfare agencies. Why then has not the directive of this Congress been followed? The Agricultural Act of 1949 was signed by the President on October 1. 1949. Four months have passed and to date only potatoes have been recognized by Secretary Brannan as being in surplus supply. Is it the intention of the author of that doubleedged CIOBrannan plan to wreck our agricultural legislation and force the Congress to accept his scheme because of the accumulation of surplus food stocks? It seems strangely inconsistent for the Secretary of Agriculture to bemoan the declining farm income of our farmers. while by hoarding food stocks he forces further cuts in the farmers income through acreage allotments and marketing controls. Also inconsistent is his policy of making it difficult for the needy to get badly needed food while he advoCates and promotes lower food prices for all. at the expense of all. Mr. Speaker. it would help solve our Nations problems considerably if we raised instead of lowered tariffs on farm products to stop at least some of the great flood of farm products now coming into our ports. especially such as are already in surplus supply. such as corn. wheat. potatoes. and so forth.",

At this time the National Capital Housing Authority has 18.000 lowincome families on its waiting list. more than 5.000 of them families of lowincome veterans. Even if the redevelopment agency were fully implemented. a large part of the redeveloped areas would be redeveloped for uses other than public housing though they will necessarily displace a lowincome population. But because Congress had to adjourn within a few days. the chairman of the Senate conferees said that referring the bill to conference meant its death. Proponents of public hoising therefore acquiesced in accepting the amendments in the hope that Congress would later repeal them. Since then Congress has neither repealed the amendments nor has it implemented the Redevelopment Act. Consequently. If the National Housing Act of 1949 Is passed. the National Capital Housing Authority will be the only public housing agency in the country which cannot take advantage of Its provisions. In order to remove this restriction the amendment is offered.",

In the resignation of Kenneth C. Royall as Secretary of the Army our Government is losing a fine public servant. My high opinion of Secretary Royall is based not only upon his outstanding record of public service. but upon my many contacts with him as a member of the Senate. During 1945 Mr. Royall. who was then a brigadier general. acted as Army liason officer with the Senate War Investigating Committee on which I then served as a minority member. Later as Secretary of War and as Secretary of the Army Mr. Royall on many occasions came before the Investigating Committee of which I was chairman on matters involving the Military Establishment. Mr. Royall was always most cooperative with these investigating committees of Congress. In our efforts to uncover and correct inefficiency. mismanagement. and fraud in the armed services he made a substantial contribution. The MayGarsson case. the General Meyer case. and the recent case of the German war criminal Ilse Koch are but a few of the many instances in which Secretary Royall left no stone unturned to assist the Congress in obtaining the complete and true facts. Likewise. in my other official contacts with Secretary Royall I found him to be extremely well informed and straightforward in all his dealings with Congress. I am firmly convinced that if all officials in the executive departments were to display the same candor and the same sincere attitude of cooperation with Congress which has been demonstrated by Mr. Royall our Government would be a better Government. Mr. Royall has served his country faithfully and with high distinction. and I am honored to have this opportunity to pay him tribute. At this time I wish to pay the same tribute to Secretary of Defense Forrestal on h:s retirement. He was a great public servant. We shall miss both Secretaries from the Military Establishment. This does not detract from those who are entering the service. Mr. Louis Johnson and Mr. Stephen Early. We know that we shall receive fine public service from them also.",

MELVILLE BROUGHTON shocked the Nation and left the State which he loved and served so ably in profound sorrow at the passing of its junior Senator. His death at any time would have been a tragedy. Coming as it did when he was approaching the fullness of his life and the climax of his power to serve his State and Nation. it is most unfortunate. Senator BROUGHTON was a member of a family which has devoted its life to the religious uplift of our State and the installation of those human characteristics which keep men in step with God and enable them to obtain peace and success on earth and that crown in eternity which the faithful secure. North Carolina was proud of MELVILLE BROUGHTON and honored him as but few of its citizens have been honored. He was a wellequipped lawyer and In his profession convinced the people of his great State of his faithfulness and his reliability in every trust committed to him. He was elected Governor of North Carolina and held that position with distinction and afterward was elected to the Senate of the United States. These honors which his great State bestowed upon him do not compel you to forget the many other useful acts of his life. There burns deep in the hearts of all who knew him a shrine to the memory of this man whose life was a mirror of the God he loved. As a United States Senator. Mr. BROUGHTON stood on the threshold of an even more illustrious career and gave certain promise of taking his place among the great men of this Nation as he had already done among those of his native State.",

First. then. gas is a proper matter for regulation. second. the increases in cost which occurred in the coal industry and which the Senator may say were improper. were at least widely distributed amongst several hundrel thousand coal miners and their families. whereas the increases in prices which go to the gas industry go back to a smaller number of persons. Those are at least two differences. and if I had more time. I probably would be able to find other differences.

I shall emphasize over and over again. if I must. that in coal there is competition between buyers. They can switch between one supplier and another. There is a variety of transportation methods. They are not tied together. But the gas main. the distributing line. the gathering line. join gas producers and consumers together. The fact that some gas. a very small quantity. can be put in containers and shipped by truck does not furnish an alternative method of supply or an alternative method of transportation.

I am aware of some of the facts. and as I understand. they are very nearly as stated by the Senator from Wisconsin. I am not at all surprised at the procedure they are following. because it is merely another example of the stupidity of this organization under its present management. That was one of the reasons for my being so insistent on the floor of the Senate during the past 2 days that the control of the Corporation be placed in the hands of an independent board which could be held accountable to Congress. and not placed in the hands of a man whose sole ambition was to further the political fortunes of his party. I put In the RECORD Friday certain records which showed how they had pulled the plugs from under the grain market in the preelection period. which in my opinion was done for the sole purpose of influencing the outcome of the election. It is very significant to note that in Secretary Brannans reply. inserted in the RECORD. he offered no explanation whatever. and made no effort to deny the charge. The reason he made no effort to deny it is. I am sure. he knows I got my information from the records of his own office. If there is a denial. however it may be voluminous. I shall be glad to insert it in the RECORD. I think it is. I shall not say criminal. but inexcusable negligence on the part of the administration to manipulate the markets to the detriment of the farmers. purely in order to gain in many instances nothing but political advantage.",

But we have had a history each year of the rye market being depressed until the rye gets out of the farmers hands and into the hands of speculators. and then the Commodity Credit Corporation promptly takes steps to bring the price of rye up. after they can no longer do the farmer a pennys worth of advantage.

I pointed out how in the month of February. in the week ending February 4. they cut purchases drastically. almost overnight. 93 percent below the preceding week. with the result that the grain market was completely demoralized for 3 or 4 weeks. They stayed out of that market. and in the early weeks of March they entered the market. with heavy buying that shot the market up. I said then that if they did not know any better. it was time we had somebody in the Corporation who did know how to operate. and. if they did know better. it was inexcusable.

In order for the people of the Virgin Islands to transact business. and to do the things that a normal citizenry ordinarily do. there was set up in 1934 the Virgin Islands Company. When that expired. it was reincorporated and the authority for that expires on June 30. 1949. This bill calls for the Incorporation of a new entity to be known as the Virgin Islands Corporation. which encompasses practically everything that was in the former Virgin Islands Company. besides adding a few more powers. I want to especially call to your attention that under this bill the corporation not only reports to the Department of the Interior. but must also report to the President of the United States.

They will not do so if the Government is to be their chief opposition. There are three or four small hotels being built. They will close up if the Government comes in in competition with them. because they cannot borrow money at the same rate. and they will not go into business. There is a lot of opportunity in the Virgin Islands for private business to go in and go to work. and I believe they will if the Government will stay out.

Jessup. has been brought into the present discussion with regard to possible subversive influences in the Department of State. Mr. Jessup and I were both members of the board of directors of the Foreign Policy Association during the period when General Frank McCoy was president of that organization and we participated together in many discussions of our foreign policy. As the time when Mr. Jessup was appointed as our representative to the United Nations Assembly I felt the greatest gratification and confidence that he would ably represent us. and we are now aware of his brilliant record. When he was made chairman by the Secretary of State of the special committee on our fareastern policy I felt confident he would bring to that investigation the same type of clear thinking that he has evidenced in the other work he has done. both for Columbia University and for our Government. While it is true that Mr. Jessup and I may have had differences of opinion on matters of foreign policy. I want to emphasize that such differences are legitimate in our democratic processes working at their best. and in no way reflects on the motives or objectives of either of us. I can see no possible ground for questioning Mr. Jessups unimpeachable integrity or his complete loyalty and patriotic devotion to his country. I should like to add one word. Mr. President. It is my purpose on Monday. when I can receive recognition. to share with my colleagues some thoughts I have on the present rather tangled situation in the State Department.

I wish first to refer briefly to some of the history of the Natural Gas Act. to some of the history of proposed legislation similar to Senate bill S. 1498. and to similar legislation passed last year by the House of Representatives and now on the Senate Calendar. During the first session of the Eightieth Congress. which adjourned July 27. 1947. various bills proposing amendments to the Natural Gas Act were introduced and considered by the Congress. Some of those bills were opposed by the Federal Power Commission and by the President. One bill. however. being House bill 4099. introduced by Representative PRIEST. of Tennessee. was endorsed and its passage was urged unanimously by the Federal Power Commission and by the President of the United States. In a letter dated July 10. 1947. to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. the following language was used: The Federal Power Commission urges the enactment of this bill at this time to make it perfectly clear that independent producers and gatherers of natural gas are exempt from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the jurisdiction of this Commission. The letter further said: The enactment of this bill would dispel the uncertainty regarding the status of such independent producers and gatherers which has been created following the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Interstate case. Such action by the Congress now should dispose of this Important and uncontroversial matter. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter. in full. be inserted at this point in my remarks.",

It reaffirmed the exemption of the production and gathering of natural gas contained in the original Natural Gas Act of 1938. and did nothing more. However. the first session of the Eightieth Congress adjourned without passing House bill 4099.

In view of these circumstances. the Commission urged the immediate adoption of H. R. 4099. the specific and sole purpose of which was to make entirely clear the exemption of the independent production and gathering of natural gas from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. This proposed amendment. however. was not enacted during the closing days of the session of the Congress which has just ended. This brief review of developments in this matter has been presented so that there may be no basis for misunderstanding or continuing expressions of fear and uncertainty regarding this matter which is noncontroversial. Mr. President. I ask Senators to pay particular attention to the following declaration contained in that order of the Commission: The Commission gives its assurance to independent producers and gatherers of natural gas that they can sell at arms length and deliver such gas to interstate pipe lines and can enter into contracts for such sale without apprehension that in so doing they may become subject to assertions of jurisdiction by the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.",

We all know from history that no man was more interested in reorganizing the agencies in the executive department than was the former President of the United States. Mr. Hoover. So on the question of the permanency of the legislation. we have the testimony. in no undecided terms. of the only two mee who have had actual experience. It gives the incoming President the opportunity and the power. as he becomes experienced. to suggest to the Congress any legislation combining agencies and bureaus. or for the reorganization of departments. for the good of the country that presents itself to him. No. 2. reading from page 7 of the report: No executive agency is exempted under this bill. while under the 1945 act a number of agencies were exempted. It is felt that exemptions. even of major regulatory commissions. would seriously hinder the reorganization effort. Many of the regulatory commissions have nonregulatory functions which appropriately might be assigned to a different type of agency. That takes care of what has been one of the great faults In past legislation. The exempting of so many agencies and the inclusion in the bill itself of language which was not capable of clear interpretation prevented the Executive from initiating many reforms that were needed because. in his judgment. if made. it would be the occasion of many lawsuits which might continue through the years.",

It was put in there for budgetary reasons. Instead of having that and a number of other agencies floating around and making up their own budgets. the Bureau of the Budget thought it advisable to put them in with certain other departments. yet maintain an independent status. Some Members of Congress honestly expressed the fear that the independence of the CAA would be taken away. that politics would enter into the matter. that planes would crash on account of lack of safety rules. that the pilots would operate the planes through the skies in a negligent manner.

Ever since I have been in Congress reorganization of the executive branch of our Government has been a subject of keen interest to me. With the Reorganization Act of 1939. and again in 1945. there has been no recommendations of magnitude which would lend toward more efficient and economical operation of the executive branch of our Governm~nt. As at the present time. there is a tremcndous overlapping and duplication of the functions of many of the agencies and bureaus of our Government. I cite just a few: Lending Government funds. 29 agencies. acquisition on land. 24. wildlife preservation. 16. welfare matters. 28. gathering statistics. 65. Is there any wonder that there is a lack of efficiency and economy and overall direction with so many agencies dealing with the same subjects? If we are ever going to curtail the unnecessary expansion of our Government. we must start now to consolidate and abolish those bureaus and agencies which are not necessary to the service of our people. I feel that the President should be given the authority at this time to make whatever recommendations that are necessary for the reorganization of the executive branch of our Government with all agencies and bureaus coming within the scope of this plan. It would. however. exclude the General Accounting Office and the courts of the District of Columbia. I am in wholehearted agreement with the testimony given before our committee by Comptroller General Lindsay Warren. I questioned him as follows: Mr. Warren. I have been greatly impressed today with the sincerity and the earnestness of your presentation with regard to this legislation.

The advisability of segregating youthful first offenders from hardened adult criminals has been frequently and widely discussed in prisonreform discussions. Although youths between 16 and 21 years old make up only 15 percent of our population. they are responsible for about 36 percent of our robberies. 42 percent of our burglaries. and 53 percent of our automobile thefts. Young people from 17 to 21. inclusive. are arrested for major crimeshomicide. robbery. assault. burglary. larceny. and rapein greater numbers than any other 5yearage group. Our existing methods of treating the criminally inclined youths are inadequate. Altogether too large a percentage of those released from existing reformatories and penal institutions ultimately become hardened criminals. Youth mixes with maturity. the novice with the old hand. the impressionable with the hardened. As a result. one sometimes wonders whether some of our penal institutions are not breeding places rather than burial grounds for criminal tendencies.

Under a rule obtaining in the service. one in the service cannot promote or profit from ideas he conceives while he is in the service. After this gentlemans service was terminated he found that other agencies had been experimenting with and had profited from his theory. le then applied for a patent. but certain legal limitations thwarted his desires. In this measure now Colonel Blair is simply given the privilege of appearing before the Patent Commission and requesting that a patent be granted to him so that he may prosecute whatever rights he may have in the premises. It absolves anyone who has heretofore been using the theory from any damages or liabilities by reason of the fact.

He was a very fine administrator when he was chief of naval operations. having charge of a million and a half persons. He was also governor of mandated islands in the Pacific and he knows that picture very thoroughly. I would like to say that I find the people of Massachusetts are much more interested in the security of the State and country from atomic bombs and other types of warfare. and all civilian defense. and also in the security of their children who are fighting in Korea than in anything else. This is the real thing that is paramount in the minds of everybody in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Therefore I believe that Admiral Louis Denfelds ability. his knowledge of the international situation. and his proven desire to protect this country by giving up the great position of chief of naval operations makes him the outstanding candidate for governor at this time. The elections this year in the midst of world war III can well be the most important in the history of our country. It is a fight for our survival. Therefore I shall support Louis Denfeld.",

I am not a poet. but I have enjoyed and approved the sentiments expressed in rhyme by our good friend. the gentleman from Ohio concerning our very distinguished colleague who is voluntarily retiring after 30 years of not only outstanding. but worthwhile. service in the Congress. When I entered Congress in 1919 the gentleman from New York was chairman of the Military Affairs Committee in the Senate. I first met him when I went to the Senate for military information. One conversation was enough to satisfy me that he was a man who knew what he was talking about. Later he came to the House. and we all know the high regard in which he has always been held in the Congress whether serving in the Senate or in the House. After getting acquainted. we soon found we had something in common. I was in my first year in the study of law in Michigan in 1898 when war was declared against Spain. I left my studies and enlisted with the home National Guard company. Mr. WADSWORTH was in Yale in Connecticut and left his studies and enlisted as a volunteer. We served throughout the war as long as our respective outfits were in service and have been close friends since I entered Congress. Mr. Speaker. JIM WADSWORTH is the noble son of a noble sire. and his father was also a noble son of a noble sire. The name Wadsworth is more than a tradition in Geneseo. N. Y. An old. respected and distinguished family of Wadsworths still carry on. There are few men who have ever served in the Congress who were always so forthright. straightforward. and courageous. No one ever doubted for a minute where JIM WADSWORTH stood on any problem. A superior and convincing debater. a sound and logical thinker. he has a standing unsurpassed by any in the Congress and equaled by few. At the end of the Eightyfirst Congress. he is voluntarily retiring to his ancestral estate in New York. and we all wish him many years of health. happiness. and satisfaction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I should like to join with my friend and colleague. the gentleman from Ohio in the tribute which he has just paid the distinguished gentleman from New York who is voluntarily retiring from the Congress at the approaching adjournment of the Eightyfirst Congress. I think I can truthfully say. and without risk of seeming partial. that there is no Member of either the House or the Senate who is more uniformly admired and respected by his colleagues than the able gentle. man from New York. It has been my observation in evaluating the members of the human race that nature is a great equalizer of persons. She does not lavish on any of us all of her virtues. One or more good qualities are given one man. while other good qualities are reserved for others. But in the case of JIM WADSWORTH nature has been most gracious and bountiful in bestowing those virtues cherished by all good men. The expression \"A gentleman and a scholar\" is not trite when applied to the gentleman from New York. Moreover. he is able. studious. conscientious. tolerant. and generous. But among all of his splendid qualities the one which has appealed to me the most of all. in my observation of this distinguished New Yorker. is his patriotism. His love of his country has been exemplified time and time again during his long tenure of service at both ends of the Capitol. JIM WADSWORTH is a Republican by heritage and principle. but JIM WADSWORTH is first an American who places the welfare of our great common country above party lines. When I first came to Congress I soon formed the impression that he was my ideal statesman. After 18 years of service with him. both in committee and on the floor. I have not changed my opinion. Familiarity has not bred contempt. In these crucial days of the Republic that he loves so well. the country can ill afford to lose men of the caliber of JIM WADSWORTH. But the record of his stability. courage. devotion to country. and statesmanship which he has made in both the Senate and the House will not be lost. It will ever be a beacon light beckoning less stalwart patriots on to higher plains of patriotism and statesmanship.",

I believe. the Senator from Nevada can correct me if I am mistakento use in this country some of the members of the Bolivian Air Corps. either for training or for reasons of our own. One of our transport airplanes was on its way with a group of Bolivian oseas. at our instance and request. when the plane crashed. The crash was not the fault of the crew of the airplane. I presume. and certainly was not the fault of the passengers who were our guests. and at that time were under our service. All persons on the plane. including the crew of the plane. were killed. As a result. the women named in the bill became widows. They have children and families. The United States thought it was only proper that some sort of gesture be made to show our good will and good intentions. it was felt that the widows of those Bolivian Air Corps men. who were willing to come to the United States and do our bidding. at least should be recompensed in the amount stated in the bill.

The Department of the Air Force takes the position that there is a moral obligation on the part of this Government to compensate the widows of these officers. The committee did not feel that it could act contrary to the statement of the Department of the Air Force in this regard. although there is clearly no legal obligation involved.

The officials of the latter two organizations made the same objection which the Senator from Louisiana has just made.

One of the amendments provides that. if at the time when the court moves from the present buil&xtg to the new building the old building should be needed for national services. then it would not be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution until that emergency passed.

The first communication received by Mrs. Birch informing the family that Captain Birch had been killed. at that time saying that it had been the result of some stray bullets. A letter of September 28. 1945. from Charles B. Stone I. major general. United States Army. commanding. which gave a little information. but not the full story at that time. I may say. in fairness. that perhaps the commanding officer at that particular time did not have the full story. A letter dated January 8. 1946. to Mrs. Birch. from one of the officers who had served with Captain Birch in China.

His unassuming manner. unswerving loyalty. and personal courage earned him the respect and admiration of officers and enlisted men among both American and Chinese units alike. In recognition of his exceptional accomplishments. he has been recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross.

It is as follows: We have. of course. given thought to suggestions that we should reintroduce an excessprofits tax. but I think members in all parts of the house who had experience with our wartime excessprofits tax will agree that such a tax is not desirable under present circumstances. To be efficient and fair. an excessprofits tax needs a recent base period representing normal operating conditions for various classes of business. and a tax related to the average profits of the last 3 years would not be likely to yield much revenue during the next year or two. But the more important objection at this stage is that an excessprofits tax. particularly one at a high rate. becomes an invitation to extravagance and waste in corporate management. whereas. as I have already said. what we need most urgently now is maximum efficiency and production. I have no doubt that all honorable members know or will have heard of cases of such waste anu extravagance. Furthermore. in spite of our best efforts to make an excessprofits tar as fair as possible. there are bound to be severe inequities under this kind of legislation. Under conditions of total war. many businesses would be compelled to accept these inequities and hardships. I am reluctant. however. to impose this severe type of regulation under present circumstances. The statement by the Finance Minister of Canada is a most pertinent one.",

Should these Territories be admitted into the United States. either today or next year. I would feel bound to fight for their rights as vigorously as I would defend the rights of Georgia or Wyoming. and I do not think I care to be placed in that position when we do not know but that a terrific blow will be leveled at one of those outposts either tomorrow or 6 months from tomorrow. I have also been interested to note that many of those who heretofore have had no interest in States rights. are now vigorously supporting Alaska on the theory that some rights of States are involved. Rights of individual citizens of the United States are involved. but in those Territories no States rights are involved until the Congress wishes to assume the responsibility of creating States out of them and then defending them in their rights. Mr. President. this comment is not personally directed to the Senator from Wyoming. but. to my mind. some of these who most vigorously espouse the cause of statehood. hope that statehood will be achieved for those Territories in order to get more votes in the Congress in order to be able to take away the few rights which now remain to the sovereign States.",

If the long standing and consistent history of America through all the intervening years in her dealings with other nations has not demonstrated and established the fact that she has no imperial designs whatever. certainly we cannot do so by passing a bill granting statehood to Alaska or Hawaii.

Under the present program they can receive nothing. although they have been paying in all during that time.

Before proceeding to that matter. however. let me give you my considered judgment regarding the statement which was made yesterday during consideration of the rule by the gentleman from Nebraska . As I remember his statement he found fault with the action of the committee In reporting the bill H. R. 6000 because the bill now before you. in his opinion. is a step in the direction of a welfare state. We have heard an awful lot in recent months about the development of a welfare state. It is significant that we hear that charge every time any legislation is presented to the Congress which has to do with the welfare of an individual. I challenge the statement that the creation of machinery providing security against need in old age constitutes a welfare state or is in the direction of a welfare state. If we should adopt some of these grandiose schemes which have been submitted to the House in the form of a bill providing for the payment of pensions to Individuals who have reached the age of 65. whether they need those benefits or not. as some of our colleagues have signed a discharge petition to do. we might be proceeding in the direction of a welfare state. But when we call upon the individual duririg his productive years to lay aside. in the form of a contribution. out of his wages and earnings an amount of money which will enable an agency of the Government to provide him with benefits after he becomes 65 years of age. or when he becomes disabled at less than 65 years of age. how can it be said that we are doing something for that individual for nothing? Certainly he is at least entitled to say he is buying and paying for that security against need in his old age.",

This bill reestablishes a rate of taxation which makes this program as sound as actuaries can estimate soundness to be. because the rate of taxation under the bill would eventually go in excess of the level premium cost of the program of 6.15 percent of pay roll. The present program is not sound. and the present rate of taxation provided to maintain that program is not sound. and the gentleman understands that it is not sound. As evidence of the fact that it is not sound. the Congress adopted the socalled Murray amendment a few years ago. In lieu of permitting the tax rate to go up. we adopted the Murray amendment providing that. in the event there were not sufficient funds in this trust fund to pay these insurance benefits. we take such amounts as are needed out of the Federal Treasury and supplement the funds of the trust fund.

I share the view expressed by the gentleman from New Jersey that in time you and I may see the situation where we shall no longer be paying funds out of the general Treasury under the publicassistance program. this will occur because of these retirement benefits and disability payments that we are now talking about which will be paid out of this fund into which workers are making contributions in the form of a tax. That is the hope of the committee. If it were not the hope of the committee. the committee would not have spent these hours. days. weeks. and months in sifting these people that are now outside the program and deciding which should come in. we would have provided one program for $60 a month or $30 a month for everybody and pay for it out of the general funds if we had not had the hope that this program we are talking about now would avoid the necessity of continuing public assistance In the future.

But if we maintain our tax base at $3.000 the program would cost twotenths of 1 percent more of payroll money. One percent of pay roll means $1.250.000.000 per year on a levelpremium basis. Twotenths of 1 percent of pay roll is not a small amount. Let us pass then to the next matter in dispute between the majority and the minority. and that has to do. if you are reading on page 158. with this matter of automatic yearly increase in the benefit. We call It Increment. Under existing law. we provided that a man shall have his benefit. after it has been determined under the formula. increased by 1 percent for each year he is under covered employment. that means. under existing law. if a man is under covered employment for 20 years and his benefit is figured out at $40 under the formula. you give him an extra 20 percent of that benefit. or $8. making his benefit $48 instead of $40. The bill H. R. 6000. by the way. reduces that increment. and this is another compromise made. from 1 percent for each year in covered employment to onehalf percen for each year in covered employment. Let me point out to the committee why. in my opinion. that is necessary. First of all. we have adopted a formula for determining benefits which is extremely weighted for the benefit of those with low incomes. For example. a man who has $100 a month average wage. we give him a monthly basic benefit of $50. but if that mans wage is $150 we only increase his benefit by $5. or to $55. Under the bill. if a man has made $3.600 a year over all of these years as against the other fellows $1.200 over all of these years. he only gets $70 benefit asagainst $50. There is only a spread of $20 of benefit there based upon $2.400 of additional eaxnings. So you can see that under the bill we have heavily weighted that formula for the benefit of this individual who makes the least on down .through the future in average Wage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it seems to me there are two things that should be stated for the record in connection with this case. and what I say in connection with this case will apply to a good many of the other cases being considered. The first thing is with reference to the question of the proceedings of the committee under the principle that a quorum must be present. As a matter of personal knowledge. I know that the committee has acted on the principle that whenever we conducted an inquiry interrogating these people the names of the committee or the subcommittee designated for that particular hearing were made a part of the record and in each case the presence of the members was noted. Further. when we came to take action on the proceedings. we have never acted except where a quorum of that particular subcommittee was present to make its recommendations to the full committee. Again. when action on the subcommittees recommendations was taken by the full committee there always was a quorum determined to be present or we did not act and the records of the committee will so show. I mention this because of the question which was raised by the gentleman from Michigan earlier during the consideration of these various citations. The record should be clear. and the Members of the House should know (1) that we never acted as a subcommittee without a specific designation of the subcommittee. (2) that a quorum has been present at the proceedings. and also (3). that a quorum has been present when the recommendation was made to the full committee. and then (4) when the main committee made its citation. that a quorum of the full committee was present.",

Everyone knows that to be true. There are now on the calendar and ready for action measures which the majority leader will move to have taken up immediately after the pending measure is acted upon. four or five other payincrease bills. calling for the expenditure of around $300.000.000 for salary increases. Furthermore. there are 26 agencies of the Federal Government for which no salary increases are at present provided or called for. They are listed in section 202 of Senate bill 2379. I now ask unanimous consent to have section 202 of that bill printed at this point in the RECORD. so as to show the list of the 26 agencies of the Government for which no salary increases are presently proposed. all of which will be applying for similar salary increases.",

Such a thing could only be done by a man whose mind is diseased and who wants to take the life of the Chief Executive of our country. The gentleman from New York upon revision of his remarks might well include the fact that attempts have been m.de upon the lives of other Presidents who although elected as members of the Democratic Party after election took office as the leader not of their party but as the Chief Executive of the United States of America.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Speaker. this is the conference report on the act extending rent control. It is a unanimous report of the conferees. The amendment of the Senate provided that the act of the governing body of the municipality or local subdivision was not limited to ordinances or other legislative acts. and any resolution heretofore adopted by any local governing body is declared to be effective. This applied not only from the effective date of the act but was retroactive and makes action decontrolling the cities valid if done in conformity with the provisions of this act. The House concurred in this amendment. The Senate bill provided that the Rent Control Act shall be effective until February 28. 1951. the House bill provided an extension of 90 days. or 3 months. to March 31 of next year. The Senate receded and concurred in the House amendment. So. under the act rent control is extended until March 31 of next year. The. House conferees felt that it was essential that the act be extended for 90 days in order that it might be sufficiently considered by the House. We all know that a new Congress takes a long time to organize. there will be vacancies to be filled on the Ways and Means Committee. and. after those vacancies are filled. the Ways and Means Committee will proceed to fill vacancies on various committees. Those committees cannot function until they have been reported to the House and the action of the Ways and Means Committee has been confirmed by this body. We felt therefore that it was absolutely essential that the extension should continue for 3 months in order that proper consideration might be given to this question of the continuation of rent control.",

Under the provision which is written into the bill at this time you deprive those people of that right. You will now permit any local council to deprive the people in the community of the right to a referendum and to review what their city council or local governing body may do.

How it will work out and whether it will work out fairly to the taxpayers. whether it will work out fairly to the carriers. I do not know and I do not think anyone could say.

Mr. McCabe. and the chairman of the subcommittee on Federal Reserve matters of the Committee on Banking and Currency. the distinguished junior Senator from Virginia . we came to the conclusion that it was best at this time. with conditions as they are. to leave reserve ratios in the law as they are at present.

I make this statement so that it will appear in the RECORD. and so that it will be generally known that the hearings on the Federal Reserve System will commence in the subcommittee of the Committee on Banking and Currency presided over by the junior Senator from Virginia around May 15. The bill to provide for supplemental reserve requirements for insured banks. and for other purposes. introduced by Mr. Maybank. was received. read twice by its title. and referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency.",

I ask whether the Senator from Connecticut knows of any instance in the adjudicated law of the Nation which would allow the cost of transporting the girl to the nonpublic school to be paid out of public funds. in view of the fact that some of the States have constitutional provisions against the making of such allowances or payments for such transportation?",

New York. Oregon. Rhode Island. and Washington. Four States give Implicit authorization In their general transportation legislation. They are Connecticut. Louisiana. Maryland. and New Mexico. In the third classification. we find that the courts in California. Kentucky. Maryland. New Jersey. and Washington have upheld the constitutionality of statutes authorizing bus service for nonpublicschool children. The decisions in California and Washington are being appealed. The courts in Delaware. New York. and Oklahoma have declared such statutes unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the transportation of children to nonpublic schools does not violate the first and fourteenth amendments of the Federal Constitution. I wish to say to my good friend the Senator from Idaho that what we are proposing to dispense under this bill are Federal funds. to be paid out of the Federal Treasury.

I want to speak briefly with respect to the theory on which the bill was framed. and to try to explain why the amendment proposed by the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. McMAHONI as well as the amendment to be proposed by the Senator from Missouri . is in conflict with the basic theory of the pending bill. The theory is that of noninterference with the State either In the education It chooses to give its children or in the method by which the State administers its school system. The question relating to parochial schools has always been one of our most difficult problems. Under the Constitution of the United States. the Supreme Court has held that public money may not be spent. either by the Federal Government or by the States. for sectarian educational purposes. But the Supreme Court has said that some of the incidents of education. such as schoolbus trans. portation and. in some respects. school books. perhaps. may be paid for by the States for both types of schools. The decisions are somewhat uncertain. How they will ultimately be resolved I do not know. But what we propose under the pending bill is to say to each school. \"We give you this Federal money. and you may spend it for any purpose for which you spend State money. If you spend State money for schoolbus transportation for parochial and private schools. you may spend Federal money for that purpose also. If you do not spend your own money for that purpose. you may not spend Federal money for that purpose.\" In other words. we try to leave the system exactly as it is. Most of the States prohibit. either by their constitution or by law. the spending of money for bus transportation for private and parochial schools. Therefore. If the amendment were adopted. we should be in effect attempting to nullify the laws of those particular States. If the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Missouri were adopted. we should be taking the opposite position. trying to change the laws of certain of the States that permit the use of their own money for parochial schools. refusing to let them use Federal money for that purpose.",

Health aid has nothing whatever to do with education. Education. under the Constitution. according to the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. must be provided on a public. nonsectarian basis. Health has no relation whatever. as I see it. to that particular principle. which has led to very violent differences of opinion in many States. and also in cases presented to the United States Supreme Court. as to how far Federal aid to education may be extended to parochial schools. I think the health bill was entirely different. .As a matter of fact. 3 years ago. in the hospital bill. we gave aid to private hospitals. including sectarian hospitals of all kinds. The hospital business has grown up largely on the basis. of private sectarian hospitals. There is no question whatever of involving in any way an educational matter with a sectarian matter. I think the health bill follows the principle of the hospital bill. But in the educational field a very different question is involved. When I was a member of the Ohio Legislature I fought very bitterly a bill which attempted to require the reading of the Bible in public schools. because it was felt generally by Catholics and others that the reading of the Bible would be done. in 9 cases out of 10. on a Protestant basis. and would give some sectarian color to education in the public schools. I was required to oppose it because of the provisions of the Ohio Constitution and the Constitution of the United States.

I think that we avoided it for the great power companies of America by the creation of REA. had we not established REA. I think it is fair to suggest that we probably would be suffering from Government ownership of all sources of power today. I think that if we deny this credit to our people today that we will probably find that the demand for this service will result in complete Government ownership of the telephone system. and I say that advisedly. Let me call the attention of the Committee members to the fact that the telephone service is the most vulnerable of all of our services from the standpoint of public ownership. because it is the most monopolistic. monopolistic both in nature and in practice. The greatest monopoly in this world. the largest corporation. is the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. They serve 81 percent of the telephones of America today. whereas they serve but 18 percent of the territory. They serve the most profitable bus:. iness only. Any system. any company which gets into the position of being a monopoly is liable to the threat of public ownership. Only by giving reasonably adequate and cheap service can a program such as the telephone program avoid the threat of public ownership. As one who believes in private ownership. I have submitted this bill. because I believe it is the best insurance that we can offer against public ownership of the telephone system. If we give to the people of the rural areas. of the remote areas where service is not so good. if we give them an adequate service at reasonable prices through private ownership there will be no demand for public ownership.

It simply extends for telephone service exactly the same banking service we now have for electric facilities. but it takes special care to see that those now engaged in telephone service are thoroughly protected. First. it requires the Administrator to make a finding. before he can make a loan. that the loan will probably be paid. I want you to get this because it is not in the provisions for making electrical loans. That finding has to be made and it is appealable to the courts. The Administrator cannot make that finding if there is reasonably good and adequate service in the territory where the new operation proposes to operate. because you know and we all know as a practical matter that you cannot go into a district or into a territory where there is good service and set up a competing telephone service and hope to make it pay out. You have to find some territory where there is practically no service or where the service is very inadequate if you hope to pay it out. That is our first protection to the operator. This bill specifically provides that for the first 6 months of its operation no one except an existing telephone operator who is now giving rural service may even apply for a loan. Is that socialistic? Is that trying to put the Government in business when you say that nobody but the existing telephone operator may even apply for a loan in th. first 6 months?

That something Is a \"sense of distance.\" If I may so term ita vision. and a sense of longrange planning. which the American system of government. with its everchanging leadership. does- not encourage. and indeed rarely encounters. As a result of Mr. Irrs planning activities. Maryland State and local officials have a far better understanding of the problems facing them now and in tho. foreseeable future. together with a general or detailed program for meeting these problems. The commissions studies likewise have gone into the matter of implications of recent economic changes. for guidance of government in meeting and coping with the new problems thus raised. It is. indeed. a fortunate thing for government that executives like Mr. Irr are to be found who are ready to devote their experience and energies to the solution of governments problems in the interest of all the people. Such men deserve the utmost recognition and gratitude. and it is in this spirit that I am bringing to the attention of the Senate the services rendered by Mr. Irr. An editorial in the Baltimore Sun. commenting on Mr. Irrs resignation. states. and I quote: Maryland has lost a highly competent. trustworthy. and nonpolitical public servant at a spot where men of Mr. Irrs type are needed most. I am convinced that all who are conversant with Mr. Irrs activities in the field of planning will concur heartily in this statement.",

The delegation of that authority into the hands of the socalled bureaucrats. of whom we have heard so much from the opposite side of the Chamber. it seems to me should give our Republican colleagues some concern in view of the previous arguments they have made respecting delegation of authority.

Since that time the Congress has increased the salaries of employees of the Forest Service. along with the salaries of all other employees of the Government. by approximately 60 percent.

The Forest Service Implored Congress to give them an exception. along with the lighthouse keepers. but the Congress enacted the 40hour week for the Forest Service and the lighthouse keepers. without taking into consideration the fact that neither forest fires nor storms at sea can be confined by legislative edict to the 40hour week which those employees work. So we have had to expend a great deal more money as a result of the enactment of that act of Congress. But if the Senator will check.

I should like to say that under the huge appropriation which has been made for stock piling. work will be done in respect to strategic materials. But regardless of what is provided in the lawand I am perfectly willing to take the statement of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming regarding its provisionsI wish to say to the distinguished Senator from Nevada It is my opinion that the Secretary of Defense will use that money for the purchase of materials. under longterm contracts. from any sources possible. Under such longterm contracts. the necessary capital would be provided and the necessary equipment and machinery would be paid for. in order to do. either directly or Indirectly. what it is contemplated will be done under the provisions of this bill. so far as concerns making such minerals available. . In other words. the longterm contracts providing for the purchase of the products of such mines will have to be made on the basis of what can be done under existing circumstances. or else the products of those mines will not be obtained. it is said. I am sure that is the argument that is being advanced. In that respect. It seems to me that the acquisition abroad by the Secretary of Defense of metals and minerals for stockpiling purposes will. at least to a great extent. duplicate the domestic operations which will result from the enactment of the pending bill. After all. why cannot the work be done in the United States? Why cannot we build up our own mines? Why cannot we do it with the money which is being allocated in almost unlimited amounts. so far as the House of Representatives is concerned. for the stock piling of these materials? After all. the same materials are involved. and the purpose is apparently the same. namely. for national defense. Why cannot the longterm contracts and the authority to make them be applied to such developments and such work in the United States. whereas apparently at the present time they are to be used outside of the United States?",

The Department of the Interior has always been the agency of our Government through which mineral development has been conducted. and in large measure it has control of mineral development in the United States. The Department of Defense operates in another field entirelynamely. the stockpiling field as far as minerals are concerned. That Department does not operate in the field of mineral development. In the course of two world wars. it has shown great reluctance to enter that field. As a matter of fact. it would not have the necessary personnel or knowledge to participate in work in that field. unless it set up an entirely new agency for the purpose. The committee has carefully investigated the matter. The junior Senator from Nevada is in thorough agreement as to the amount of money necessary for stock piling. But I am cure the Senator from Nebraska is familiar with the understandings and agreements for the purchase of such materials in the Far East and in other foreign lands. under longterm contracts. and the lack of emphasisperhaps due to the reasons I have outlinedon domestic production.

We are sympathetic with stimulating exploration. production. and the conservation of strategic and critical ores. metals. and minerals. both for the national defense and a sound domestic economy. but we believe that subsidization of production of nonferrous metals is at variance with the system that has given the United States the greatest mining industry in the worldthe system known as \"American free enterprise.\" In which competition under free market conditions. regulated by the law of supply and demand. has also resulted in the United States having the highest standard of living In the world.

I believe. I remind the Senator from Tennessee of the language of the Supreme Court in the PanhandleEastern case. in which it called attention to the fact. in language of this sort: Without entering upon another review of its legislative history. suffice it to say that the Natural Gas Act did not envisage Federal regulation of the entire naturalgas field to the limit of constitutional power. rather it contemplated the exercise of Federal power as specified in the act. particularly in that interstate segnient which the States were powerless to regulate because of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission was to complement that of the State regulatory bodies. Accordingly Congress in section 1 (b) of the actI invite the particular attention of Senators to this languagenot only prescribed the intended reach of the Commissions power but also specified the areas into which this power was not to extend. Mr. President. those are not the words of the Senator from Oklahoma. but they are the words of the Supreme Court of the United States. In which it said to the Commission. \"We not only prescribe the field into which you can go with your regulation. but we prescribe the areas Into which your power to regulate does not extend.\"",

Does not the Senator agree that a delayed application of such a regulatory power does not mean that because the power has not previously been used. it has not been granted? Does not the Senator agree that it is not necessary for the regulatory body to apply or exercise such power immediately. in order that there may be a continuing right of the agency to use it? For instance. the Federal Trade Commission has many powers. Among them. under section 2 of the Clayton Act. as amended by the RobinsonPatman Act. the Commission does not put into effect certain orders unless such orders are required to be applied. and under section 7. which provides that one corporation may hot buy the capital stock of another corporation if to do so will create a monopoly. there is no need for the Commission to put such a regulation into effect until such a condition develops. Does the Senator agree? Likewise. section 8 of that act provides that there cannot be interlocking directorates of corporations under such circumstances. HoVaever. until such a situation develops. there is no need for the Commission to exercise that regulatory power. is there? Does not the Senater think the situation in connection with Js .examples I have given is analogous to the situation in connection with the matter now before us. namely. that so long as there is at the production level competition which holds down the price to a reasonable level. there is no necessityas there was none during the first 10 years of the history of the Natural Gas Actfor the Federal Power Commission to put such a regulation into operation? I ask the Senator whether he agrees that the fact that the Commission did not use the power for a certain period of time does not mean that it does not have the power? Does the Senator agree that its nonuse of the power does not constitute a waiver of the power?",

In that decision the Court said: In an analogous situation before the in stitution of this litigation. there had been .uncertainty of opinion in the Commission as to the reach of the act toward sales by independent producers and gatherers to naturalgas companies for transportation in interstata commerce. See reports of the Federal Power Commission ori its Natural Gas Investigation (Docket G580). transmitted to Congress on April 28. 1948. In part IV of the report subscribed to by Commissioners Smith and Wimberly. it is concluded at pages 38 and 40: \"No reasonable basis is found in the act or its legislative history for a conclusion that. although the activities of production and gathering are exempt under section 1 (b)..sales of natural gas which are made at arms length by producers and gatherers .who do not thereafter transport it in interstate commerce may be regulated. Unless such a distinction is specifically disclaimed. doubts and uncertainties will continue to be felt and expressed regarding the possible jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of those who only produce and gather natural gas and then sell it to others transporting such gas in interstate commerce. \"In view of the present unsettled state of this matter. It is desirable. as the Commission has heretofore recommended. that the Congress should adopt appropriate amendatory legislation to make it clear that independent producers or gatherers of natural gas. and their sales thereof to interstate .pipe lines. are not subject to the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Such action will confirm what clearly appears to have been the original intent of Congress when it enacted the Natural Gas Act in 1938.\" I ask the Senator whether the quotation in the Courts latest decision. which I have just read. is not what the pending legislation is calculated to bring about?",

I fully agree with the Senators warning that we are facing this year a deficit of $6.000.000.000. and next year. a deficit of six or seven billion dollars. It seems to me we must cut every phase of Government operation. Certainly there is no reason that I can see for not making a cut in the aid to foreign countries. I can see some reason perhaps for not cutting appropriations for the American armed forces. but aside from that. it seems to me that if those in charge of the Government take the position that this appropriation for a gift to many foreign nations cannot be cut. then I cannot see how we can hope to cut domestic expenditures. It seems to me the place to begin. if we are going to reduce the budget. is hereto begin whenever we come to anything on which we can begin. So I have every sympathy with the Senators desire to cut the budget. I have no desire to destroy the ECA program in any way.

He said: I should like to give to the House the figures on our gold and dollar position for the first quarter of this year. During that period the sterling area earned a net gold and dollar surplus of $40.000.000 compared with a deficit of $31.000.00 in the fourth quarter of 1949. a deficit of $539.003.000 in the third quarter of 1949. and a deficit of $330.000.000 in the correspondingthat is. the firstquarter of 1949. We received assistance under the European recovery program. largely in the form of reimbursement for expenditure already incurred by us. amounting to $229.000.000. and we also drew on the Canadian credit to the extent of $27.00.000. Thus the gold and dollar reserves rose by $296.000.000 during the quarter. so that. on the 31st of March 1950 they stood at $1.984.000.000. compared with $1.688.000.000 on the 31st of December 1949. and $2.241.000.000 on the 31st of March 1948. immediately before the European recovery program was put into operation. The Senator will see that that means that the sterling area. during the 6 months beginning the 1st of October of last year and ending the 1st of April. this year. actually had a net surplus. without assistance from the ECA. of $9.000.000. Because of the devaluation of the pound. therefore. the British Government has balanced its international budget. The question which occurs to me is whether that fact has been taken into account. I think obviously it has not been taken into account by the ECA. I wonder why. if the British Government is able to balance its dollar budget. we should advance anything to the United Kingdom during the following year.",

I was very much interested in the colloquy which ensued between the senior Senator from Ohio and the.junior Senator from Missouri. and how the committee arrived at the amount of money involved in the ECA bill. I should like to ask the Senator from Missouri if he does not believe that the same method of arriving at the amount at this timeand it is admittedly the trade balance deficitwas arrived at in the same way the deficit admittedly was arrived at in March 1948? I have before me a table which was subMarch. 4. 1948. by the junior Senator from Nevada. It shows each of the 16 Marshallplan nations listed alphabetically. It shows their total imports in dollars. their total dollar earnings. and earnings from sources other than the United States. and then the United States funds to be made available to them under the Marshall plan. They add up to a total of $6.860.000.000. I assume the Senator remembers the debate at that time. That amount was for a 15month period. For the 12month period. which was later adopted. the figure corresponding to the $6.860.000.000 was $5.360.000.000. which was the approximate amount of the funds actually appropriated. The tradebalance deficit. clearly. is added up each year. and that must have been the way the present amount was arrived at. I will inquire of the Senator from Missoiri if he agrees with the junior Senator from Nevada. that the fallacy of such an estimate is that we have no control over the purchases of the 16 European Marshallplan countries. In other words. if the beneficiary countries have earned more tha. was estimated. they have simply purchased more goods. The deficit then would remain the same. Would it be a weakness in the whole system. in the judgment of the Senator from Missouri. that we have no control whatever over their purchases. and that if we could theoretically make up the existing balance they could increase them at any time at their own option by additional purchases?",

Mr. Hoffman appeared before the -Committee on Appropriations and said that he was going to buy certain specific quantities of American wheat. Then Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr. Ernest Bevin came to the United States and had their dollar talks with the State Department. As a result. they decided to use $175.000.000 of Marshallplan money to pay for wheat which Great Britain had previously contracted to buy in Canada. There was no mention in the authorization. and there was no mention in the hearings before the Senate Committee on Appropriations. of any authorization of ECA money to pay for wheat bought by Great Britain in Canada. I anticipate that if the Administrator had disclosed to the committee that he intended to use $175.000.000 of American taxpayers money for that purpose. he would have encountered violent opposition. I give the Administrator credit. because I do not think that at the time he appeared before the Committee on Appropriations he had the slightest idea of using $175.000.000 of his funds. or any funds. for the purpose of making payments on wheat contracted to be bought by Great Britain from Canada. Notwithstanding that. and relying on certain weasel words in the appropriations act. the Administrator. in order to assist in the dollar talks. devoted $175.000.000 for that purpose. He allocated $175.000.000 to be used in payment of an obligation of Great Britain to buy wheat from Canada.

I said on that occasion that it could not be cited as a mandate for any specific action on labor legislation in the form of bill A as contrasted with bill B. I think all we can say about it with respect to that Issue is that in a good many States the TaftHartley law was an issue. made so in the campaign as far as State elections were concerned. and as far as the President was concerned. by his references to it. It undoubtedly had its effects on the election. But I certainly think one would be making a misstatement of fact and drawing a false conclusion if he stated and concluded that the election was a mandate given to the Democratic Party for a repeal of the TaftHartley law. I say that as one who believes the TaftHartley law should be repealed. Good Republican policy dictates its repeal. But I do not believe the election was a mandate on the subject. nor do I believe it was a mandate given to the Democratic Party for specific action on any specific bill on any issue. But I hasten to add to my statement to my good friend from Maine that. taking the campaign of the Democrats as a whole. and the issues which they raised in their campaign. in contrast with what I think was a paucity of issues raised in the Republican campaign as far as specific stands on issues were concerned-",

I believe the first time you were to approach the writing of a pay bill you might feel about it as the gentleman from Missouri has. and arrive at some figure. wherever you get it. and fix that as the compensation in the various pay grades as you go through the services. Quite frankly. we did that in 1942 and we did it again in 1946. That is the very reason the Hook Commission was appointed. so that an effort might be made to stabilize the pay scales and have the proper percentage of differentials between the grades and responsibilities. and a study might be made from which you could compare the compensation of the military service with the compensation for like jobs in industry. The Hook Commission spent about a year doing that. They analyzed the pay scales of about 100 industries. In the report of the Hook Commission you will find a graph. or chart. showing the comparable rates of pay in private industry and in the military services. It is significant in this graph. that in the military services the entering wage is a little bit in excess of the entering pay in industry. The military entering wage is a little in excess of the entering wage in industry. When you come to the warrant officers. you will find from that graph that the Commission was unable to find anything in industry comparable to the grade of warrant officer and the graph has no comparison between industry and the services as to warrant officers. When you come to the officers. the lowest grades are a little bit in excess of industry. and it gradually tapers off until finally you find that the highest grade military man is drawing about onehalf the pay drawn by men in industry for handling comparable organizations.",

We have talked about changing its administration. we have gone into some of the technicalities of the matter. but when again you shake it down the 2percent vicious. repressive sales tax still comes to the top. It is the cream on the milk. I inserted in the RECORD during the last debate a weighted comparison of taxes between Washington and other major cities in its class in the United States. We find that Washingtons weighted tax is still $2 whereas most of the cities were far above that. Many of them were at least twice the amount assessed here in Washington. We talk about having upped the property values 2 years ago. But for a period of 10 years every city in the country was adjusting its assessed valuation upward and revaluing its property taxes. while at the same time this city stood still. So we are going to forget the accumulated effect of tax rates in the other cities and start gaging Washington by what took place 2 years ago. May I point out that there is not a city in the United States that I know of that assesses a 2percent sales tax against its people. One or two have i 1percent sales tax. In California I do not know of one that assesses more than onehalfpercent sales tax. But in those cases- these cities- they have exhausted. and fully exhausted. every other means before they have gone to the sales tax. The States. for the most part. have deserved the revenues put on by a sales tax. Personally. I find myself handicapped by lack of information.

In other words. 20 voted for the bill and 5 or 6 against it. As the majority leader said. the committee has given a great deal of thought and study to this matter. They have called in various local people who have testified before the committee. Their testimony has been weighed. Many of the provisions imposing a tax are against certain people or certain groups. in their viewpoints in the District of Columbia. The committee has had the same kind of overall problem that faces the Committee on Appropriations of the House in the matter of appropriations. or that faces the Committee on Ways and Means in dealing with the great revenue problems of the Nation in trying to arrive at what is a fair. a decent. and an equitable fiscal bill. I was one of those who supported the salary increase of the employees of the District of Columbia. the firemen. the teachers. and policemen. To make that $330 pay raise retroactive for the last fiscal year. or to provide an additional $330 per employee for the next fiscal year is impossible without this bill. there is no alternative. Some of the Members who oppose this bill I am sure feel they speak for labor. but I want to speak for labor also. I think our District employees are entitled to that increase.

I made a mistake before when I said that the liquortax increase in my bill would raise $2.000.000.\" I have since checked and found that was on hard liquor. But. on wine and champagne and liquor the revenue would be $4.000.000. So.

He finds the most suitable plan for the ultimate improvement of the two streams between the Bonneville Dam and Lewiston. Idaho. to be a series of 4 locks and dams for complete canalization of the middle Colum.bia between the head of the Bonneville pool and the mouth of the Snake. and a series of 10 locks and dams for complete canalization of the Snake from its mouth to Lewiston. He accordingly finds that the Umatilla Dam and the four dams proposed for the Snake River should be constructed before undertaking slackwater improvement of the Columbia below Umatilla. where a fairly adequate channel already exists. The Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors concurs in the view that the foregoing plans constitute a satisfactory. comprehensive. and integrated program for the initial and ultimate development of the Columbia and Snake Rivers between Bonneville and Lewiston. Idaho. Mr. Chairman. let me point out to the committee that the Columbia River is now navigable all the way up to its confluence with the Snake River at Pasco. *Wash.

This project is very controversial. It has been a matter of controversy for something over a year. On January 27. 1950. Senator KEFAUVER. of Tennessee. Congressman PRIEST.

The Army engineers have wanted to build a low dam for several years. but there has been much controversy in all the counties affected. So on February 2. 1950. the President requested that the TVA make a survey to see what would be inundated and what would be best to recommend to the people. In this appropriation there are $1.800.000 for this project.

Once that project is completed. the Government will take in $1.033.000 a year from hydroelectric power.

The total amount that they eltimated would be required to complete the dam was $1.674.000.

This project proposes to deduct onethird of the immense block of power which is going to be produced at Bridge Canyon for pumping the amount of water which has been mentioned. 1.000 feet. and conducting it 300 miles across the desert. In our opinion. formed by experts of the Federal Power Commission and the Department of Agriculture. that immense block of hydroelectric power would be worth five times as much to the State of Arizona in the production of wealth and employment as in utilizing it to irrigate common. ordinary fieldcrop land for principally cotton and grain. In this matter we think the State of Arizona is making an almost fatal error. if the Congress of the United States and the President should ever say. \"Certainly. you can take this tremendous block of power to irrigate a comparatively meager amount of land.\" We want to see Arizona prosper. We feel she is a sister State. but. unfortunately. she is now using an error of judgment. and we want to prevent her. so far as we can. from being improvident and wasteful of tremendous sums of money in the Federal Treasury. and of tremendous blocks of hydroelectric power.",

I am informed that Lee was turned down for United States citizenship three timesin 1935. 1937. and 1939and that the grounds were. \"Not good character. not attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States. incompetent witnesses.\" My information is that in those years Lees real name was Ephraim Zinovi Liberman. and that he finally won citizenship. on his fourth try. after changing his name to Michael Lee and marrying an Americanborn woman. Lee is said to be the man whom the Chinese blame more than any other individual for deliberately delaying vital shipments of aviation gasoline and other supplies to Nationalist China until the Red hordes took over. It is interesting to note that he recently headed a special governmental mission to Japan and served as adviser on China and the Far East to the United States delegation at the United Nations. Several departments of government have had Lees loyalty and citizenship under investigation. besides which charges of maladministration were recently brought against Lee by other colleagues in the Commerce Department. Yet Lee is protected and kept on in one of the most strategic jobs in the whole Commerce Department. where he is in a position to block shipments to Nationalist China and facilitate shipments to Reddominated areas of the Far East.",

I know the majority leader realizes the difficulty of obtaining the attendance of a quorum of the Senate at 11 oclock in the morning. for the committees are working in the mornings. As a result. very little time is saved by having the Senate convene at 11 a. m. I submit that it is agreeable to me to have the voting begin at 3 oclock ona Monday.

The Committee on Banking and Currency has before it many bills which have for their object assistance to small business. We are working. for instance. on a Reconstruction Finance Corporation bill introduced by the distinguished Senator from Illinois. and bills to extend amortization periods. We hope the committee will report bills whereby Congress can legislate and something tangible can be accomplished in the way of amortization of the obligations of small business. for instance. rather than merely to investigate. We have conducted investigations and we have now reached the stage of reporting constructive legislation to assist independent small business enterprises. Unless after investigation we can legislate. we only muddle the minds of the smallbusiness men. as the Senator has suggested. What I want the Congress to do is to pass a sensible. effective law. It is all right to investigate. but when the investigation is over. we should legislate. according to the results of the investigation or hearings. in the interest of the smallbusiness men.

What I am trying to say to the very distinguished gentleman. and I want him to respond to it. and I am saying it. of course. in no obstreperous mood but rather to be helpful. is that the planes of today. the B36. the most modern thing we have. and possibly the most moder.i thing the world has. a year from now may be as obsolete as the 17 is now.

I said that we can take $800.000.000 for universal military training out of the Presidents overall budget for the National Military Establishment. and we can use that for the Air Force and by doing so not increase the overall cost of the budget one penny. So when the Air Force appropriation bill comes here. I hope the Committee on Appropriations will have augmented the procurement and the authorization of aircraft by the amount of $800.000.000. If they do. then what happens? This Is what happens: If we get this $800.000.000. and if all of it is spent for airplanes. we could then have 1.116 more airplanes than the present budget authorizes. which is 1.668. but It would be folly to use all the money for aircraft procurement if you did not have the pilots and the men to operate the planes. So at least $365.000.000 of the $800.000.000 increase in the appropriation would have to go to servicing and taking care of the additional number of planes that would be made available by the $800.000.000. Therefore. only $435.000.000 of the $800.000.000 could be used for procurement of new aircraft. That would provide 702. Add that 702 to the 1.668 that are now provided for in the budget and you have 2.370 airplanes. which would compare favorably with what Congress did last year. 2.437. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I trust that this authorization bill will be unanimously approved. and that unless the Committee on Appropriations takes care of this 70group air force. when that appropriation bill is submitted an amendment will be adopted to increase the Air Force by $800.000.000.",

Modern science. new methods of rapid transportation and communication have rendered our modern world to a miniature province. Three years ago. coming back from Australia. I was cordially invited by our very genial Delegate from Hawaii to address the chamber of commerce at Honolulu. I spoke to them at noon and the next evening I was having dinner with Mrs. Short here in Washington. We stopped at San Francisco to refuel. Recently I had breakfast in Bermuda. I had lunch here in Washington. then spent 5 hours In my office. and on the same evening I had dinner with my family down in the Ozarks In southwest Missouri. near the KansasOklahoma line.

It is little use now to dwell on them except as unfortunate Incidents In history. It is for the historian to obJectively appraise their damage. What we want now is a way to get peace. despite the handicaps. We cannot go on .forever in the state of uncertainty in -which we now find ourselves. We cannot forever have a Berlin airlift. a nervous Trieste. a shaky Korea and an Austria that must be guarded and protected by us. The fronts and the trouble spots of this struggle are all over the world. China may be the key spot where we must do something to stop the relentless \"peaceful\" penetration which is now going on and which has resulted in 12 countries coming under almost complete slavery. as far as the individual is concerned. The military strength which we provide by this bill should give our representatives at the conference tables much help. We hope they have the skill to use it to harness the moral and legal conscience of the world and thus bring lasting peace and the mechanisms to maintain it.

What will the increase mean to anybody if they are all exempted? Let me point out that under the bill introduced by the gentleman from Texas quite a number of workers will be taken out from the present coverage. The quickest way I know to make a comparison between the two pieces of legislation. the existing law and the bill under consideration. Is to figure the position of the present law that has been on the books since 1938 and see what people are covered by the law. If they are covered by the present law they will be covered by the bill under consideration. If they are not covered by the present law they will not be covered by the proposed law. I believe that is the quickest answer I can give on the question of coverage. Bear in mind there may be three or four fluctuations from the law. but there are some changes in this law that were deemed very necessary. In my consideration of this piece of legislation I am not concerned with the political significance of it. with the significance of who is sponsoring or not 11007 \ufffd sponsoring it. or who is fronting for this organization or that organization. I am asking each and every Member of Congress to thing sincerely and honestly in terms of the little people. these people who have no lobbies. who have no organizations to look after them but must depend upon you. and you. and on me to benefit their present economic condition. and that is iny only motive.",

It has no real excuse for existence. because people who can work ordinarily are employed for what they can earn. They cannot be paid for what they do not produce just because it would be nice to pay a higher wage. or because the worker needs a higher wage. This bill does not provide any measure at all of the productivity of the worker who offers himself for work in the lowerearning category. For example. he comes to you with a basket of apples and says. \"I have a surplus of apples. I have worked hard all summer and I have got to have 75 cents for a half bushel because the law says so.\" and you say. \"No. I can pay only 50. that is all the money I have in the till.\" He says. \"Well then. I must throw my apples away to the hogs.\" A mans labor is nothing but the product of his labor and has no value above the product he produces. It can bring nothing but what the consumer will pay. Yet this law simply presupposes that the employer has the control of what is going to be paid. He Is nothing but an agent of the consumer and can pay nothing that the consumer will not pay. Suppose a southern lumber mill gets an order for a carload of 2 x 4s at $20 a thousand. and the little mill in Georgia says. \"Why. under this law I have to pay 75 cents. I must have $30 a thousand to fill that order.\" So his men go idle because the market offering. the only money there is available. is $20 a thousand. Finally I plead for a positive action and not a retreating actionnot further steps into the management of our economynot further steps into socialism. but a retreat to recover liberalism or true freedom in our economy. Let us do nothing more about encroaching upon freedom than to protect the individual from exploitation which the Lucas bill attempts to do. Let us reject the Lesinski bill which is an out and out efforta child born of the original concept that we must extend and extend to the whole economy the management of our economy by the Government.",

Now. I think if you are continually tinkering with those standards. nobody will know what the situation will be. I think you have to level this thing out. I do not think it would be wise to change this every year. for Instance. The Administrator may attempt to do that. By the time he gets his changes made. and that is reflected back in his cost of goods and his ability to survive in competition and everything else. the whole picture may have changed. It is changing today. The cost of living is going down. and has been for the past 3 months. Therefore. I think if you start out with a minimum. just as the act says. you would spread that out and then you look at it and see what is fair. but you do not give the right to the Administrator to change that thing either by interpretation of rules and regulations or these industry committees that we are discussing.

A 65cent minimum. for example. falls far short of the amount needed for a reasonable minimum standard of living. Even a 75cent minimum with full employment throughout the year would be inadequate to supply the amount needed on the basis of all evidence of reasonable minimum living costs for small families or even for single individuals. A 75cent minimum could be expected to provide no more than $1.500 a year. and with any irregularities of employment the amount may be substantially less. $1.500. however. is less than the cost of the lowest State budget for single women living alone (as compiled by State governments for use in the administration of tleir minimum wage laws). One thousand five hundred dollars is also $200 less per year than the cost of a fourperson family budget on an emergency level. In consequence. it is necessary to reconsider the minimum wage level from time to time. to make it more nearly adequate. either through industry committees or by future sessions of Congress. or both.",

Bills pending before this House to improve their working conditions should also be enacted into law. I trust that this bill will prevail. that it will set a minimum wage of 75 cents an hour and that it will bring under its jurisdiction the largest possible number of American workers.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the pending measure is the motion of the senior Senator from Illinois to make Senate Resolution 15 the unfinished business of the Senate. This Is a legislative body. The legislative process is a continuing one. First a bill or resolution must be introduced. It must be referred to the proper committee. If favorable to the bill or resolution the committee makes its report to the Senate. The bill or resolution then goes on the calendar. Later as part of this process. a motion is made to bring it. in a formal way. before the Senate. As a general rule. this is done without any prolonged discussion on the measure at this point in the legislative process. The bill or resolution is then subject to discussion. debate and vote. For a Senate -resolution. the legislative process- in this chamber is completed at that point. and for a bill. the legislative process continues through the House. at times to the conference committee. back to the House and Senate and on to the President for his approval or veto. If the latter. the process continues until the veto has been acted upon. Websters new international dictionary defines the word \"measure\" as: A step or definite part of a progressive course or policy. a means to an end. I submit. Mr. President. that the motion of the Senator from Illinois fits into that definition. It is my desire to discuss the merits of his motion. When the motion has been favorably acted upon there will be ample time to debate the merits of Resolution 15. Even the adoption of a cloture petition on the Lucas motion would not cut off debate on the resolution. It would only help put the Senate in a position where the debate may properly be on Resolution 15. -The basic issue facing the Senate of the United States for the last 3 days is whether or not the Senate is to be able to function as a legislative body. There is no monopoly in this body of devotion to the Constitution by the group upholding the right of unlimited filibuster.",

Whether we get there or not is in the hands of this body. and so is the responsibility for their action or lack of it.

On legislation. the vote of a Senator from one State can cancel out the vote of a Senator from another when they are on opposite sides.

We cannot subordinate our local development and Improvements. which provide employment and add to our resources. to our dreams of looking across the seas and spending billions of our hardearney taxpayers money to build up the economy of other countries in the world. Projects included in this bill will make America strong. conserve our lands and our natural resources. so that posterity may enjoy some of the things that have been our privilege. For several months I have been endeavoring to have included in this omnibus bill a project in northern California and more specifically described as the Russian River project. It concerns the Russian River Basin affecting two large counties in northern California. and provides for the construction of the Coyote Valley Dam. This is a project long overdue for consideration. The preliminary work and surveys have all been completed. but the report of the engineers came in too late to have this project Included in this pending bill. However. since the hearings on this bill. the California Department of Public Works and Gov. Earl Warren have recommended its adoption. Reports are now in the hands of the various Governmental agencies and may. before the bill passes the Senate. be in the hands of the Senate committee. This Is a multiplepurpose project. The engineers report shows that an anual flood loss in this area amounts to $750.000. A great recreational area along this river is being jeopardized because of the taking of the water from the river for irrigational purposes. Several municipalities within the area are direly in need of domestic and industrial water to support their growing population. Agriculture is becoming more intensified. This is a participating project. where the Federal Government will only be required to advance 40 percent of the cost. the remaining 60 percent to be borne by local interests. While it is impossible for the House at this time to consider this Russian River project. I desire you to be informed because without a doubt. time permitting. it should be ready for inclusion when this bill is considered by the Senate committee.",

Miles Citys flood problem occurs most frequently during the early spring when it often happens that the ice in the Tongue River. a tributary of the Yellowstone. breaks up at an earlier date than the ice in the Yellowstone. The Tongue flows into the Yellowstone at Miles City. and as a result sections of the town are often inundated when an early breakup occurs on the Tongue River. Miles City is a rapidly growing center of business and industry in eastern Montana. It has been called the cow capital of the West because of its importance as the trade center for the vast cattleraising country of eastern Montana. It badly needs the flood protection which would be provided by the relatively inexpensive project we seek to authorize in this bill.

Mr. Chairman. the Judiciary Subcommittee of the Committee on the District of Columbia held hearings for approximately 6 months on this proposed legislation. It was found beyond doubt that we have a shortage of judges for the municipal court in the District of Columbia. The number of judges for that court has not been increased since the population of the District was around 350.000. At the present time the population is approximately 1.000.000. The cases on the docket down there are approximately 18 months behind schedule. I recently had a case called to my attention by a marine officer here in the District of Columbia who had his car torn to pieces about 18 months ago. His case was called for trial only 2 months ago. I am certain that every Member of this House does not care to have that kind of judicial service in the District of Columbia. I am certain. too. that if every Member had the opportunity to read the hearings on this bill he would conclude that additional judges are needed very badly at the present time. I regret very much that objection has been raised to this bill. but. of course. it is the prerogative of any Member to object to a bill if he so desires. As I stated previously.

I think it is a revelation. if you would get a copy of the committee report and turn to the table and see the actual number of cases the 10 Judges of the municipal court of the District of Columbia had to consider during the years 1946. 1947. 1948. It is remarkable how the business that goes before those courts has tremendously increased. and that within itself is ample justification of the action taken by the committee in reporting this bill Increasing the number of municipal judges of the District to 13 instead of the present 10. Mr. Chairman. I was on the committee at the time the Municipal Court Act was adjusted. in 1942. and we gave the District of Columbia 10 judges to which the people here might go and adjudicate their differences. I am very happy over that act. I believe it was a worthy. justifiable action for the Congress to take in order to serve the people of Che District of Columbia. Circumstances have brought about this request for an increase in the number of judgeships. and I really do not believe there is anyone who would seriously contend that they should not be given this additional number of judges. May I say to my good friend from Iowa. Mr. Gross. that the number of criminal cases certainly is important. I believe he will find that in 1946 and 1947 there were more than 46.000 cases disposed in the criminal division alone. In the civil division. to which the resolution adopted by the House the other day does not apply. there were more than 78.000 cases adjudicated by the 10 members of the present municipal court.",

Let me answer my friend from. Ohio. When the Municipal Act was passed a few years ago. we did provide for two members of that court to be nonresidents.

He goes back to practice law.

You and I. however.

With the advance of Communist forces in Asia. and also in Africa and In South America. where they are working full speed. the day is not too far off when there is reason to expect that the Soviets will control many more sources of essential raw materials and any amount of money we may have appropriated will then be unable to buy them. The administration has been concentrating its efforts on western Europe because we are told the 280.000.000 people who live there have our type of civilization. are industrially developed. and have superior technical skills. We must support them first because they are the most advanced peoples and therefore. supposedly most useful to us. But they cannot use their superior productive capacity without raw materials any more than we can. Our side leads in scientific and industrial development. the Soviet side will lead in materials and manpower. They can overtake us in our field. as they have proved by their discovery of the atomic bomb. But we cannot overtake them in the fields where they will lead. if they have control of the areas which Europe and we must increasingly depend on for certain raw materials. The United States Government ought to get a hustle on to stock pile these essential materials. with maximum speed. especially those we will not be able to obtain if certain areas in Asia and in other parts of the world come under the control of the Soviet dictators and their satellites. as we have every reason to believe they will come if our country continues its disastrous policy of wait and see.",

Numerous reductions were made in the bill where they could be made and where under the parliamentary situation reductions could be made in Individual items. For example on subsistence for the Army. the lowest figure in conference was $255.000.000. Army officials assured us that they only needed $242.000.000.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this rule provides for the consideration of House Joint Resolution 334. a resolution which increases the ceilings on the authorization of American contributions to five of the international organizations of which we are members. In the last few years and even months we have passed huge appropriations. running into billions of dollars to build up our own defenses. We had two important votes on that this afternoon. which were practically unanimous. Everybody believes we must spend for that purpose. We have appropriated other billions of dollars to furnish food. machinery. and materials to fill certain critical vacuums in western Europe. We have recently voted another billion or so to furnish arms to those countries In the belief that it will help them protect the investment and their security and. thereby. ours. This resolution is the first time we have been called on in some time to authorize small increases in our contributions to certain organizations that are working positively. constructively. in the building of good health. and better social and economic conditions which are of special interest or importance to ourselves. The total amount involved if the Appropriations Committee were to make the whole increase in authorization available equals but one twentyfive hundredths part of our annual expenditure for foreign assistance alone. it is one twentyfifth of 1 percent of what we have already appropriated in this session for foreign assistance. It is one onesixtieth of 1 percent. or six tenthousandths. of the total annual expenditures of the Federal Government. I should like to explain these proposed increases because the resolution does not give you much idea as to the what and why of them. Let me take them up one by one. and I shall be glad to try to answer any questions so the Members may know exactly what they are voting on.",

    "speech": "Yes. for the present. May I take the items up one by one as we come to them in the resolution? Mr. Speaker. the first item (A) raises from $2.000 to $10.000 a year the ceiling on Americas annual contribution to the American International Institute for the Protection of Childhood. This Is one of the 28 organizations to which we belong in the Western Hemisphere. It was established largely on the initiative of various LatinAmerican countries. Its headquarters are in Uruguay. That country took the leadership in forming the organization right after World War I. It has worked to develop and provide information and advice to the peoples In the Western Hemisphere countries on all questions relating to child welfare. It collects and analyzes statistics. It has done research work. it has answered Inquiries by the various countries as they endeavor to Improve the condition of their children. physical. educational. social. and so forth. Personally. I felt that this organization ought to be merged with the World Health Organization. as you will note in the hearings. Suggestions to that effect were made last year. But some of the LatinAmerican countries are jealous for this organization. They are proud of its work and fearful of its being discontinued. It is one of the few that has come up from them. Most others have been suggested or sort of handed out to them by ourselves. They are in the process. as a result of action taken at the Bogota conference. of surveying all the panAmerican organizations with a view to discontinuing. strengthening. adapting. or merging. as may be appropriate. just as the socalled PanAmerican Sanitary Bureau Is being Incorporated. or at least integrated. into the World Health Organization. Actually. even If this resolution Is passed. the sum of money that we can contribute is bnly $10.000. That amounts to 37.9 percent of the total budget proposed by that organizations controlling body. made up of representatives from all the member countries. As the gentleman from Wisconsin said. In the 3 years since the war. the Institute set up a larger budget. and. according to terms of Its constitution. apportioned the contributions to be made by the respective countries. ours coming to $10.000.",

If we want to pay our full share of the expanded budget. our share being 37.9 percent. we should pay the organization $24.000 for the last 3 years. The ceiling would then continue at $10.000 a year. I do not believe this organization will be in existence with a separate budget more than 3 years longer. It would be extremely undiplomatic and unwise for us to refuse to grant this increase when it is one of the pet organizations of the LatinAmerican countries. established on their own volition and initiative. and when the other countries have paid their increased shares.

Mr. President. in an Associated Press news report from London reference is made to the fact that a British firm transshipped to Russia 50 tons of American molybdenum. a metal used for hardening steel.

There was what lawyers call a stoppage in transitu. in England. on the way to Russia. although at the time direct shipment of the material from the United States to Russia was prohibited under existing law and regulations. which are being rigorously enforced by our Department of Commerce.

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have thus far committed ourselves to an expenditure of more than $21.000.000.000 for war during this fiscal year. There is a definite limit to the ability of our people to pay. The Congress of the United States is responsible to the people of the United States for the taxes collected and expended. for whatever purpose they are used. Many persons believe we have reached the point where the law of diminishing returns has taken over. and that in the future the higher our taxes. the less tax revenues we shall collect. unless we go into greater inflation. Mr. President. we are fully cognizant of the fact that we went approximately $2.000.000.000 in the red last year. and that we are going in the red this year at the rate of more than $1.000.000.000 a month. Many persons believe we shall be $15.000.000.00U in the red as a result of the appropriations already made during the present fiscal year. The amount of money requested in connection with the pending measure is insufficient for any kind of a good job in arming Europe against Russia.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. no matter what we may do in Europe. no matter how energetically we push the program. its implementation would take several decades. That is on the basis that all agree on $20.000.000.000 to $25.000.000.000 now. including the necessary appropriation. and If we follow the French generals instructions. $100.000.000.000 if we really want to arm and really stop Russia. During the time. Europe would still remain open to aggression and doomed to defeat at any time. Moscow would be in position to take over at any time as far as European resistance were concerned. Our own national defense organization would be the only real defense of Europe or any other areaand we are slighting it to arm Europe. Informed people say that the Chief of Staff really recommended $30.000.000.000 for our own defense. and the executive department cut it to $15.000.000.000. In any caso little security would be offered for several years. but would merely put a premium on aggression. The process could of course be speeded up by allout American aid. That of course would have to be so large that it would convert American Industry into an arsenal and strip the United States of its own defensesand of its peacetime liberties. The French general. M. Maure Pettche. estimated that at least $50.000.000.000 would be a moderate calculation of the cost of the United States contribution.",

I have already given the Senate the reasons why I believe it is wise and prudent to pass the pending bill for the sake of our peace and the collective peace of a free world. I rise only to comment briefly upon some of the debates and upon some of the amendments. Mr. President. the primary. overriding purpose of the foreignaid plans which I have supported during the last 3 years has been to rebuild the independent nations of western Europe as a peaceful barrier to Communist aggression and conquest ultimately aimed at us. I deeply believe this is the sanest and the cheapest investment we could make in our own national security. By cheapest I speak in terms of both blood and treasure. I still believe this is the best way to stop world war III before it starts. Certainly it is cheaper to stop it than to fight it. There has been understandable controversy over these foreignaid plansjust as there is today a. we approach this critical vote. I respect the motives of those who differ with me. No man can dogmatically say in this connection: \"I know that I am right.\" But in yesterdays debate those who believe in collective security as the only hopeful approach to peace were identified as \"dogooder internationalists\"-",

That was done with the approval finally of the three branches of the service. They like to be reassured. One branch will have a sort of a patent on a certain function. Then the others want to duplicate that function so that they will not have to use the function of the branch which originally set up this particular performance. After a while the three of them have the function. We will liken it to the use of an automobile. Each branch has an automobile. The Secretary says. \"You fellows dont need three automobiles. You are all going to the same place. I am going to do away with two of these and you can all ride in one vehicle.\" That was all disclosed today. for reasons which cannot be publicized. I have no doubt in the world that by unification many hundreds of men will be turned loose and made free for use in other services. and millions of dollars are going to be saved in equipment and everything else connected with the operation. To read the language. one would almost assume that that could not be done. but I can tell the Senator that to my certain knowledge Secretary Forrestal mace several of these proposals. and gave them no publicity. some of them in the XCV418 classified realm. and already Mr. Johnson has made several. and they are saving men and saving money.

I have known him rather intimately and well for a quarter of a century. yet. I have never known of Jim Forrestal ever doing a mean or a little thing. He had a philosophy of life which was good.

I do not know of a case in Americas history where a public official has more definitely given his life to the country. In our work this year on appropriation bills for the Army. the Navy. and the Air Force it was necessary for us to work very closely with Mr. Forrestal. It was evident to me that he was working too hard. that he was working himself to death. and I told him so. \"Oh.\" he said. \"I can take it. and there is a job to be done.\" I talked on several occasions with some of his coworkers. urging that they persuade Mr. Forrestal not to work so hard. Those intimate friends of his responded that they had undertaken to get the Secretary to take a much slower pace. but that Mr. Forrestal felt that there was a job to be done. and they were not able to restrain him from putting his whole life and soul into his job. He was a man who put the countrys welfare above his own. The newspapers say he was popular with Congress. and the newspapers are correct. He was popular with Congress because of his sterling qualities and because of his readiness and willingness to go to all limits to be of assistance. The last request I made of Mr. Forrestal was. in my opinion. a rather unreasonable one. I requested one day that he appear before our committee the next day at 10 oclock a. m. with the Secretary of the Army. the Secretary of Navy. and the Secretary of the Air Force. Those men had important assignments. I thought at the time that the time given to arrange the appearance of these men was inadequate. but we were struggling with a time limitation. Nevertheless. Mr. Forrestal. as he always did. made every effort and did comply with the congressional request. This was typical of his utter devotion to duty.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the purpose of this bill is to enact into substantive law authorization for certain items that frequently recur in the appropriation act dealing with administrative expenses incurred by the Department of Justice. The bill consists of a total of nine sections. each one of which furnishes the necessary authorization in substantive law to support a specific part of an appropriation. In the past such appropriations have been supported solely by legislative language contained in the annual appropriation act for the Justice Department. Such legislative language in an appropriation bill is always subject to a point of order. The new policy is to put the legislative language on the statute books outside the appropriation bill. This bill passed the House July 10. 1950. with certain amendments which are explained fully in House Report 2309. Only two substantive amendments were made by the House. The first of these is designed to preserve the present authority of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Failure to. include this provision in the bill as originally submitted by the Justice Department to the Senate was an oversight on the part of the Justice Departmnet. and that Department now concedes that this provision should be in the bill. The other substantive amendment made by the House is to strike out section 7 as superfluous. on the ground that the same subject matter is adequately covered by Public Law 285. Eightyfirst Congress. chapter 535. This section was left in the bill as it passed the Senate. because it was believed that the section was slightly broader than Public Law 285. Eightyfirst Congress.

My distinguished friend said \"No. we have already had a hearing on that. on the second day of last November.. There is no need of devoting any time to it.\" It is a heartening thing to me. as It must be to my distinguished friend from Oregon. now to see our friend and colleague from Florida come and tell how much time has -been devoted to the hearings. as indeed time should be devoted to the hearings. I am glad my good friend from Florida has finally been brought around to the Republican point of view that here was a matter of such grave Importance to the people. to everybody in the country. that adequate time should be given for all points of view to at least have a chance for their expression. Mr. President.

I think I am speaking pretty well the sentiment of the majority of the committee when I say that we were just as firmly of that opinion when the hearings concluded as we were when they began.

It is true that the junior Senator from Oregon thought that the hearings should be extended to March 1. When we went into executive session on the matter. the Senator from Florida proposed that they be extended only 2 more days. from February 10 to February 12. That offer of the Senator from Florida alone shows the great cooperation we received from the Senator from Florida. because the final result of the bargaining agreement among us was to extend the hearings not 2 days. but to February 23. I think that was a pretty fair sort of a collectivebargaining agreementor shall I say horse trade? But I do want to make this comment on the statement which the Senator from Florida has made concerning the crossexamination by the Republican members of the committee. I am rather proud of the crossexamination engaged in by Republican members of the committee. The printed record will speak for itself as to whether It was goodfaith crossexamination. It was designed to elicit from the witnesses the facts and the evidence which we believed should be made of record for the use of our colleagues on the floor of the Senate before final labor legislation is passed. I think the Senator from Florida is quite correct about one thing. Certainly the Senator from Florida and most of his Democratic colleagues never changed their opinion on anything from the be. ginning to the end of the hearings. They passed a resolution at the beginning of the hearings to repeal the TaftHartley law. and I think their minds were closed to any evidence we might bring to bear indicating any possible good which might be developed from retaining nny phase of the TaftHartley law. Interestingly enough. even the Thomas bill. which my good friends on the other side of the aisle are going to ask the Senate to approve. has many of the principles of the TaftHartley law in it.",

I hope there will be a careful investigation of all such activities. including the use of Government planes and transportation by those public officials who have been running around the country in the last few months busily engaged in building up pressure groups and pressure influence to control the actions of this Congress on several pieces of very Important legislation. If that assurance Is given. then I think we can all support the resolution.",

Lobbying. In itself. is all right. there is nothing wrong with that if it Is done legitimately. Furthermore. it must be clearly kept in mind that there is a distinction between lobbying and the right of petition. The right of petition is one of the four cornerstones of personal liberty. I do not think any of our businessmen or labor men should be denied the right of petition. My friend from Ohio talked about small business. I also include labor. small business. the farmers. and everyone else. They are not violating any law by writing us or seeing us or contacting us in any way. and certainly none of them need be scared.

I may seem somewhat -unconventional as I proceed for a few moments. in that I shall not mention the name Republican or Democrat. This is a very. very difficult problem. The Congress embarked upon this legislative experiment 2 or 3 years ago with the best of intention. The best information that comes to us is that there is an element of uncertainty in the minds of thousands of people as to just what the present law means and how far it extends. Many persons in reading the law say \"Well. it looks as if I will have to register.\" Other people. perfectly honest. reading the law. reach the conclusion that they do not have to register. I think this hasnever been construed with the degree of certainty that would be desirable. It is pretty hard to say just when a man is a typical lobbyist and when he is not. My conception of the meaning of the word \"lobbyist\" is that he is a person who is paid professionally to represent an interest. The interest in itself may be entirely legitimate. Yet. on the other hand. you may find a concern situated 500 miles from Washington that may say to its vice president or to its head. \"We want you to go to Washington to talk to our Members of Congress and to our Senators and with others whom you may know. about certain legislation. and we will pay your expenses for going to Washington.\" Is he a professional lobbyist?",

The Treasury has the names and figures at its fingertips.\" There have been many such articles in the press in the past.

May I have your permission to advise members of that committee that you are both agreeable to having information referred to above made public? I ask this because in the past the responsible officials in the Treasury Department told me that they were under obligation to the individuals concerned not to make such information public.

To your question. although I cannot speak for others. I give the answer that I shall be perfectly agreeable to making public by the State Department or Treasury Department the factual figures on the personal funds and assets I have in this country based on actual accounts. if this action is judged by them to be pertinent and relovant to the discussion. One point I wish to make clear is that I resigned and retired from public office in China 5 years ago. and I was called to this country 21/2 years ago to be with my wife. owing to her illness.

This is a celebration to be observed in Washington only. There is no occasion. so far as I know. for employees going to their distant homes and no advantage in giving them another day for that fundamental purpose. I see utterly no justification. I do not believe that I shall object to the Senate acting on the resolution. if they care to act on it today. but certainly I see no justification for an extra holiday at public expense on Friday. merely because Saturday happens to follow Friday. and Sunday happens to follow Saturday. and they all three follow the inauguration.

They begin to rent many floors of the big hotels in Washington. Some of them have them even now. as a kind of hangover from the last excessprofits tax. although most of them have been vacated. That is so in the hotel where I happen to live. It directly tends to feed inflation to the extent that any corporate tax can be passed along on goods or services. I do not think we need to deceive ourselves about that. However. not all of the cost of goods and services can be passed on. Generally speaking the corporate tax Is borne by the consumer of the goods and services. An excessprofits tax has an effect upon the incentive. habits. and practices of those who engage in industry. and they become more extravagant and less disposed to save. I do not mean to say that we will not have an excessprofits tax. I frankly said that I think we would.

Are we wise enough to stop the increase at a point where we will not also check the rise of the industrial index? It requires very great wisdom. The great difficulty about formulating an excessprofits tax is in fitting it into present conditions. and in formulating it so as to make practical the relief provision. I assume the Senator has heard of section 722 of the present excessprofits tax. In my opinion. although we worked on it for 2 or 3 monthsand continuously for perhaps a month or 2 monthssection 722 is not an adequate relief measure in an excessprofits tax. and it will have to be reformulated in order to make it effective. We have done our best to make it effective. We have even had a sort of watchdog committee in the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation to visit the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and his tax council. which was set up for the purpose of really effectively administering section 722. and we did not make much headway. and we have not made much headway.",

It is apparent that the bill which has been reported by the Finance Committee will raise only $3.000.000.000 during the fiscal year 1951. whereas the added expenses will be $16.771.000.000. Therefore. the tax bill will fail to meet the added expenses by $13.500.000.000. To this should be added the deficit. which would have existed without these extraordinary war appropriations. of at least $3.000.000.000 and possibly $4.000.000.000. So even with the pending tax bill. if it is not added to. there will be a deficit for the current fiscal year of at least from $16.500.000.000 to $17.000.000.000. Of course. against that could be set up an offset. as the chairman said. of the rising taxable income. But he states that these added receipts will not exceed $3.000.000.000. So if we merely approve this tax bill and do not increase it we are faced with a deficit for the current year of at least $13.500.000.000. I should like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance if that will not force the Treasury to borrow large sums of money from the banks. The banks will then create credit by writing up on their books the amounts against which the Treasury can draw. the total result being an increase in the amount of credit in relationship to the quantity of goods. Because these added amounts of credit will be checked on by the Government in payment for services and materials. Will not the inevitable result be a great increase in credits and inflation. with all the terrible consequences which that brings. first. in its effect on those living on annuities. then on those holding life insurance policies. upon those of the salaried classes. whose incomes are more or less fixed. and of course with the unsettling effect which all this will have upon labor relationships. the cost of living rising more rapidly than the advances in wages? I should like to ask the very eminent chairman of the Finance Committee. whom we deeply respect. whether. in view of all this. should not the tax bill be increased upward very markedly as quickly as possible?

I made a motion. and made it in good faith. that we dismiss 30 percent. take a meat ax and cut off 30 percent. It was the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia who first taught me the fallacy of the argument I was making. When he got the bill through. as the Senator from New Mexico will bear me out. we found we had adopted the LangerByrd amendment. which provided that every 3 months the Bureau of the Budget had to remove a certain definite number of employees. We did a scientific job. I wish to say to the Senator from New Hampshire that the number was reduced from 3.100.000 down to a little more than 2.225.000. Then what happened? The Senate passed a bill. for example. affecting the Veterans Administration. and provided. \"No matter how much help you dismiss. this amendment shall not apply to veterans.\" and there are nearly 300.000 employees now in the Veterans Administration. Then came the Marshall plan. and when the Congress passed the law it provided. \"The LangerByrd amendment shall not apply to the Marshall plan.\" If the distinguished Senator will take the trouble to go into the matter. as the Senator from New Mexico. the Senator from Virginia. and the Senator from North Dakota did. he will find. In comparison with the number of employees we used to have before we got into World War H. that we have cut down very much. but that the Congress came along after World War II. particularly in the matter of the Air Force and the Veterans Administration. and took them out from under the provisions of the LangerByrd amendment.

Mr. President. in certain foreign countries the greatest honor that can come to a man is not to be made a general or to be made an admiral but to be known as a great agriculturalist. He is the man who receives the highest honors in some countries. I may say to my distinguished friend the Senator from New Hampshire that in the matter of agricultural development the United States has fallen back and fallen back. Today. in some other countries. there is wheat grown. for example. that does not have to be seeded each year. It is perennial. We do not have such wheat in the United States. and cannot get It.",

I make the statement after my experience of 8 years as a Member of the Senate Civil Service Committee. The Senator from New Hampshire and other Senators have talked a great deal about economy. Where were they when a few years ago we were trying to cut out the graft in connection with war contracts. The Senator from Michigan and I both delivered addresses and furnished proof on the Senate floor in connection with graft in war contracts. For example. in Kansas there were what were known as the Sunflower cases. Contractors were engaged in building houses on a costplus basis. One contract called for the building of 3.400 houses. To show the graft connected with that work. the builders built one house. but immediately tore it down. They rebuilt it according to the same plans and specifications. and when it was completed tore It down. They rebuilt it a third time. and again tore it down. and finally rebuilt it a fourth time. They were paid for that work. At that time I made the claim that a contractor had bought 1.000.000 lead pencils. to be used in connection with a contract he had with the Government. I was corrected. and told that the number was only 885.000 lead pencilsall on costplus. He pai4l 9 cents a piece for them. The Senator from New Hampshire. the Senator from Michigan or I could have gone out and bought those pencils two for a nickel. During that time one company buried 20 tons of brand new steel. which was afterwards discoveredbut for which they had charged the Government.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like to ask the indulgence of the Senate to speak for a few minutes on what I believe to be the constitutional and legal basis for the action of the President in authorizing the use of our Armed Forces to repel the invasion of southern Korea. While the action of the President in sending our Armed Forces to the aid of southern Korea has been overwhelmingly approved by the people of this country. there have been voices of criticism raised from divergent quarters. The most common charge has been that the Presidents action was unconstitutional. It is alleged that since the Constitution in article I. section 8. gives solely to the Congress the power to declare war. the use of armed force by the President without congressional assent is consequently an abrogation of these powers and therefore a violation of the Constitution. At the root of this argument is. therefore. the contention that for us to use armed force against the persons or forces of other countries is in effect a declaration of war and hence should only be authorized by act of Congress. This issue has been repeatedly debated throughout our history and in all likelihood it will continue to be discussed for a long time to come. If we can judge the future by the past. it will probably be raised in the future about President Trumans present action. In order to produce greater clarity of thought in the present and to decrease possible future bitter controversy. I believe it may be worth while to analyze this contention in a dispassionate manner.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like briefly to explain this measure. During the Eightieth Congress when the appropriation bill for the Department of the Interior was under consideration the Committee on Appropriations. recognizing the great importance of development in the Territory of Alaska. provided an appropriation of $150.000 to enable the Bureau of Reclamation to make a study of electricpower development in the Territory. As a result of that appropriation. and an additional appropriation which was made in the first session of the Eightyfirst Congress. the Bureau of Reclamation filed a report for the socalled Eklutna project. which is located about 37 miles north of the city of Anchorage. which is now the largest city in Alaska. In 1939 its population was about 3.500 or 3.600. According to the last report the population exceeds 36.000. The city is now being served by a makeshift electricalproducing plant. A merchant vessel which went on the rocks has been salvaged and the engine section rf the vessel is now producing what little electric power and electric energy which this growing community has available to it. The pending bill would authorize the construction of a 30.000watt plant. It would take a year and a half or two years to build it. The authorization is for the expenditure of less than $20.500.000. The bill was thoroughly analyzed in the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. and a subcommittee on which the senior Senator from Oregon and the present speaker served drafted the bill. The bill came from the House with very much broader provisions in it than it now contains. The House bill would have authorized broad studies and broad development. but the Senate committee has amended the bill to provide solely for the construction of this single project. The Senator from Oregon. after the bill had been reported to the Senate. suggested to me that he would like to propose a special amendment. I am entirely willing to accept the amendment. and on behalf of the Senator from Oregon I offer to the committee amendment the amendment which I send to the desk.",

Last year. in October and November. a Bureau of Reclamation employee. William I. Gardner. assisted us for a -period of 2 months on the preliminary work for this project. The major program is now about to start and over a million dollars worth of equipment is now on route by ship. Thirtytwo of our own engineers have already left this country and are expected to arrive in Formosa Ahortly. As you probably already know. Formosa depends largely upon its production of sugar for survival. It has already been estimated that unless this irrigation project. which we are just beginning. is under way in early July. 60 percent or more curtailment in sugar production is expected next year. If such a curtailment would come about. Formosa would collapse economically. In order to expedite this program. we now ask that you release Mr. William I. Gardner on leave of absence for a two month period beginning on or about July 15. so that he may further assist Johnston International on this important undertaking. With Mr. Gardners previous experience and knowledge of this work. it is felt that our entire program would be expedited and it is for this reason that we specifically request his services. This matter has been discussed with the Department of State. and a letter was directed to the Honorable Dean Rusk on June 15.

Wright. president of the Boston Wool Trade Association. made before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. in which he pointed outThe business of buying and selling wool is practically at a standstill today. and many wool mills are either shut down or are running at curtailed capacity. resulting in much unemployment. He goes on to attribute the reason for that to the fact that we get practically twothirds of our wool from outside. chiefly from Australia. approximating 1.000.000.000 pounds. for which we are obliged to pay. under the existing regulations in buying British pounds sterling at $4.02. while our European competitors are able to buy. with American money advanced by us under ECA. British pounds sterling in the free market at $3.20. giving them a 20percent advantage with which. with their lower production costs. they are able to funnel wool into our markets. and secure more American dollars. buy more cheap British pounds. and continue an endless cycle. As M?. Wright says in his conclusion: I cannot bring to the attention of this committee too forcibly the fact that unemployment and further deterioration in our wooltextile industry will continue and become more acute until the advantage enjoyed by certain European nationals who have access to free market sterling. is also made available to American business.

Mr. Finletter. who represents our Government. speaks In that fashion. The longterm program is very specific. Mr. Chairman. in saying that if they can increase their exports to the Western Hemisphere. they will increase their imports from the Western Hemisphere. This is not a rigid plan. This is only the best judgment that these men can bring to bear as to what they think is possible. I repeat that that is the key to this problem of imports from the dollar area. They have committed themselves in unmistakable language to increase their imports from this area above the program level if they can Increase their dollar earnings during the period. On exports we run up against a very difficult problem. I have said that their policy must be to increase exports. and here we run up against one very difficult figure. The overall program is to increase exports by 50 percent over prewar. but in the Westerp Hemisphere. the target is even higher. It is 183 percent. Here is probably the most critical figure of the whole British program of recovery. Can they make this figure of 183 percent of what they exported to the Western Hemisphere prewar?

The fact that the administration has asked for increases in taxes in the amount of $4.000.000.000 shows exactly how this administration feels about the budget and what it proposes to do about it. Of course it has a perfect right to take that position. But as to the second point suggested by the distinguished majority leader. when he made the observation that Members of Congress have declined to vote for cuts in the appropriation bills. and now have dumped the responsibility in the Presidents lap. let me ask the distinguished Senator if it is not true that from time to time in the debates on the JUiNE 21 floor of the Senate on motions to cut the appropriations 5 or 10 percent. many Senators have stated that they did not feel that the proper way to make reductions in appropriations was by means of a 5 percent or a 10 percent cut. but that they would wait until the end of the session and then would join in a recission resolution directing the President to have the executive agencies themselves make that cut at the direction of Congress.

Are not we wholly within our rights when we do that. just as a State legislature is when it directs or requires the governor to do thus and so? So I am sure that although the administration does not wish to have the budget cut. but wishes to have taxes increased $4.000.000.000and of course it has a right to take that positionnevertheless that position is not in keeping with the provisions of the joint resolution because under the joint resolution the Congress will not abdicate its responsibility. but will be taking full responsibility for having 5percent or 10percent cuts made. and will be merely directing the executive agencies to make the cuts where they themselves choose to make them.",

There is a reasonable background. in my opinion. to the idea of an FEPC bill without the use of compulsion and in this connection I would like to read from the hearings on the Federal Fair Employment Practice Act before I proceed with the description of the amendment. During the hearings the gentleman from New York made the statement to Senator IvEs along this line: \"The first actual FEPC law placed on the statute books anywhere in the United States was the Ives bill.\" That is the FEPC legislation in New York. A little later on Senator IVES. who was the author of the first FEPC legislation in the United States. made this statement: I happen to be one that is convinced that if you have to enforce this kind of undertaking by punitive measures. by legal compulsion. it is going to fail. Unless you can convince the rank and file of people that it is inherently right. which it is. and get them to cooperate in backing it up. your undertaking cannot succeed.

Further. may I also give you an example from the city of Chicago. The city of Chicago has an FEPC with no enforcement power. This is the report of the fllinois InterRacial Commission last year. reporting on the FEPC: With few exceptions. the 91 firms analyzed. which supplied goods and services to the city of Chicago on a contract basis. violate their signed pledge to adhere to lairemployment practice.

Second. the powers of Federal National Mortgage Association are broadened and liberalized In two ways: A. Direct loans can be made if such loans are insured by FHA. B. Loans may be purchased In excess of the statutory $10.000 ceiling. and more than 50 percent of the mortgages held by any mortgagee can be purchased. Third. the Alaskan Housing Authority. with the consent of the Alaska Legislature. Is permitted to make loans for either sale or rental housing. It is also permitted to make small or character loans. Fourth. the FNMA would have the power to purchase from the Alaska Housing Authority. notes up to $15.000.000. These notes are interestbearing and would have a 40year maturity. The reason the bill was favorably considered by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency is that circumstances and conditions pertaining to Alaska will not be found anywhere else under the American flag.",

The bill would allow the Alaskan Housing Authority to make small character loans to the extent of from $100 to $200 to the Eskimos. who fish in the summer and have money at that time. so that they may build floors in their camps and tents.

The Federal courts never did provide compensation to attorneys in such cases. The result has been that If an attorney had previously been a United States district attorney. or had been an assistant in that office. and he went to court on arraignment day. he would return with about six impoverished clients. The bill reported by the Committee on the Judiciary has the endorsement of all bar associations. I may suggest to the Senator from Wisconsin that. In order that the two bills may conform. the amount to be applied in the District of Columbia for preparation of a case be limited to a flat sum of $20. and the sum of $20 per diem for each day the attorney appears In court in the trial of a felony case. I think that will meet the approval of all bar associations and all persons who have studied the matter.

Most of us are members of the bar and try to contribute to the ethics of the bar. but there are. unfortunately. some lawyers who might string out for a period of several days a case which should be tried in 35 or 40 minutes. That might result in the development in the courts of the land of what are called filibusters. which would place a very heavy and unjust charge upon the Government. Some of the finest representations I have ever witnessed in a courtroom have been by attorneys who were appointed by the court to defend individuals charged with crime. for which the attorneys did not receive a dime. or for which they did not have the hope of ever receiving any compensation.

I do not care to get into a discussion of relative degrees of lowness to which anybody might stoop. but when the gentleman says that he would not stoop low enough to accept a payment under the Brannan plan. and then demands that we have a 90 percent parity. I must feel constrained to say that his remarks fail to squareup with the situation. Any parity plan is a subsidy which is operated indirectly by the Government taking products off the market in order to create an artificial scarcity and to maintain high prices. Thereby. inevitably it takes food out of the mouths of people who do not have the necessary income to pay these high prices. In many instances. this food is allowed to deteriorate or sometimes has to be destroyed because it can no longer be preserved. The Brannan plan. as I understand it. simply advocates using this same money. if it is necessary. to make direct payments to the farmer and to allow prices to find a common level so that the lowincome groups can participate in the purchasing of farm products. It seems to me that this is the first successful. downtoearth. commonsense approach to the farm problem that has been offered within my memory. I think that probably the only objection the two gentlemen who preceded me could possibly have to this program is that my party is sponsoring it instead of the party of which they are members. As a farmer. I hope that I can always keep in mind the interests of the farmers. of not only my district. but of the entire United States. without losing sight of the fact that without the consumer. who is able to afford to buy farm products. the American farmer would be in dire straits.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the fact remains that what the gentleman from Pennsylvania said is correct. and it has not been denied by my friend from Indiana. It was the last Congress that made the war excise taxes permanent. President Truman recommended their extension for 1 year. The Republican Congress. after they passed the tax bill. made them permanent. and then promised that before the last Congress was over they would consider these taxes and they would be repealed. The fact is that the tax bill of 2 years ago reduced the income of the Government over $4.000.000.000. It was the most radical vote that any Member could make. in my opinion. because it was a vote against the financial integrity of our country. If it were not for that tax bill we now would have over a $3.000.000.000 surplus. and we would be able to make a substantial payment on the national debt. which is a matter of vital importance. The indisputable fact remains that the statement of the gentleman from Pennsylvania is correct. If my friend. the gentleman from Massachusetts introduces a bill to repeal the war excise taxes and at the same time imposes new taxes to raise the money in the light of the present situation brought about by the Eightieth Republican Congress. it would be a consistent position to take. The gentleman. however. wants to repeal taxes and then not take the responsibility of imposing additional taxes to recover the lost revenue.",

Perhaps the most significant testimonial to General Persons work has come from General Marshall during World War II when he denied all requests from overseas commanders for General Persons services despite General Persons great desire for combat duty. In turning down one such request Marshall has written. \"There are few men in the Army whom I consider irreplaceable and Persons is one of them.\" Since the war.

However. it is thought desirable to express them in statutory language instead of relying upon judicial interpretation. I do not see that there is any special harm in expressly inserting these limitations in the law to emphasize the purpose and intent of the committee. and to show that we are not trying to justify a scheme for the distribution of earnings and profits of shareholders for any purposes of tax evasion. While I will concede that under existing law the same thing can be done indirectly which this amendment permits to be done directly. at the same time. when we legalize a direct step. it does not seem to me to be particularly harmful to put in these qualifying provisions. Therefore. I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Virginia.

There are instances where a man has distributed his estate to his wife and children. with no intention of doing it at all for the purpose of avoiding the payment of an inheritance tax. The Government can go back as far as 12 years and say. \"Oh. yes. you knew 12 years ago that you were going to die and you made the gifts because you thought you were going to die. We will not let you get by with it. We will put an inheritance tax on it.\" Therefore we want the same statute of limitation to apply. A man may look forward 3 years to the day when he thinks he is going to die. However. if he makes some distribution of his property to his wife and children and pays a gift tax on it the Government cannot come in later and harass his widow and children. I realize that it has been said it may apply to a former Member of the Senate. I merely say that it shall not apply to future deaths where the distribution was made more than 3 years before the death or to any pending case which has not been settled. That is the whole issue. If we are to make it apply to the man who dies 1 day after the President signs the bill and not go back more than 3 years in his case. why should we make it apply to the man who dies 1 day before he signs the bill? I do not see the necessity for that kind of close distinction in the treatment of a fundamental principle of justice. Mr. President.

It merely raises the surtax on corporations by 5 percentage points. and it would raise an additional $1.500.000.000 a year in revenue. We constantly must keep in mind the fact that the Government is going to be committed to a tremendous scale of expenditures during the coming year. for which the Finance Committee has not provided adequate revenue. and unless we raise the total amounts collected in taxation. the Government is going to be compelled to borrow from the banks. with consequent great inflation. and consequent great increase in prices. As I have said. this is a proposal to raise $1.500.00.000 more than is provided in the bill submitted by the committee. If the amendment is successful. I then intend to propose another amendment raising an additional $1.000.000.000 a year by a Ipercentpoint increase in the personal income tax rates. because I think we need to raise at least $2.500.000.00 more than the committee has provided in this bill. and probably more next year. Mr. President. the amendment was drafted with the help of Treasury experts and the experts of the Senates legislative counsel staff.

We have tried. for instance. in the case of Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations. doing business in foreign countries of this hemisphere. to limit the special tax benefit given these corporations to their present level. This was done on the recommendation of the Treasury. This amendment would throw these credits out of balance. and require us to formulate different credits in every instance. I do not believe the amendment should be approved at this time. because we made the increase recommended by the Treasury. although we did not make it applicable to the full year 1950. So far as the corporate rates are concerned. what I said a while ago is certainly pertinent. This is bringing the corporate rates practically up to 50 percent. Then. with the 2 percent rate in consolidated returns and the addition which must be made for intercompany dividends and for social security. to say nothing about State rates. the taxes which would have to be paid by corporations would run to nearly 60 percent in the ordinary State which imposes as much as 7 percent. which. as I pointed out. is true in my State of Georgia.

Remember that every time a dividend recipient pays his tax on his dividend. and somebody else does not pay his tax on his dividend. it is a compelling incentive to increase the tax rate. I hope we will see to it that we do not penalize those who are honestly and honorably paying their taxes on their dividends and at the same time excuse those who are not. or taking legal action later on. which is an expensive process.

It makes it clear that taxable patronage dividends include not only those received in cash but also those which are held to be the equivalent of cash. Mr. President. I also wish to point out that the record before the committee is clear and concise in stating that millions of dollars of tax payments are avoided in this situation. If the Treasury can handle with dispatch refunds to 9.000.000 wage earners. totaling approximately $400.000.000. and can do so without any great confusion or without any material complaint on the part of the wage earners. I see no reason in the world why the recipients of dividends cannot be placed under the same requirement. To be sure. there will be difficulties. as there are in connection with the collection of any kind of tax. However. this matter has been thoroughly considered and worked out. It teems to me that we must now tighten up the loopholes to the best of our ability. in order to obtain the revenue which it is possible for the Government to obtain if it will go out and get it.

On yesterday the gentleman from Iowa made this statement on the floor of the House: I am very much concerned about the present decline in our cow population. It has declined 2.731.000 head since 1945. only a period of 4 years.

Down through the war years. with 10 percent of the population in the armed services. Iowa produced 10 percent of the food of the United States. It would be trite to call attention to the fact that food was as important to the war effort as weapons. The Poage amendment. whatever else may be said about it. in the last analysis comes down to this point: The Poage bill is an effort to legalize the sale of colored oleomargarine as a butter substitute. in other words. to sell colored oleomargarine.. however wholesome and pure and rich in vitamins it may or may not be. to the people disguised as butter. In other words. people appear to want oleomargarine when it has the appearance of butter. but do not want it in its natural color. Oleomargarine finally is nothing more or less than a butter substitute. It should be sold legally. but should not have the appearance of butter so that people are deceived in eating the substitute and think they are eating a pure product of the dairy farms. The dairy industry is vital to this country. and the dairymen are not asking very much. The dairy people have consented to the removal of all taxes. and all they ask is to be protected from a butter substitute that has the appearance of butter and is disguised as butter. but is not actually butter. The dairymen whom I know do not favor the Poage bill and make no mistake about this: the farmer is no fool. He knows his business and knows what he wants. The Iowa legislature has consistently maintained its position against the sale of colored oleomargarine in the State of Iowa. This position has been maintained through the years and was recently reaffirmed by the present fiftythird general assembly now in session.

Instead. the earlier provisions of the amendment were intended to be mandatory upon our people. and the last portion of the amendment was included simply to give assurance that there was no disposition to prevent membership in a labor union or a reliance upon collective bargaining. except insofar as the earlier portion of the amendment may have provided for the governance of relations between employers and employees in the State of Florida.",

I am extremely sorry that the Senator from Alabama is not willing to remember that that has been his position in another class of matters under the socalled civilrights program. and I regret that he does not see fit to give such solemn expressions of at least 18 sovereign States the same kind of recognition and regard that he insists upon having given to similar declarations of the good people of the State of Alabama.

Trigg. head of the Commodity Credit Corporation. which runs the price program. told Congress yesterday that on February 28 the total was $4.336.175.453 invested in farmprice supports. Was that the figure that was brought out?",

Each time a delay occurs the agencies set up their work for the period of the extension and the taxpayer pays the bill. We have had a demonstration of this in the Deficiency Subcommittee when the housing bill was before us. for funds to implement the bill recently passed. I said. \"How long has this been in operation?\" \"Thirty days.\" \"Well. what are you doing now?\" \"Well. we have it in operation now for 30 days more.\" With every such setup there is an involvement of bookkeeping and expense to the Government. That is No. 1. Now. twice we have set a time limit. and today is the dead line on the second time limit. I blame no one in this body for being very provoked at the dilatory tactics of another body. They had their opportunity earlier in the year to limit debate but they preferred to cling to old customs. They are now the victims of their decision and we are the victims with them this year for the delay so effected. But I see no reason why we should not proceed to pass this resolution. regardless of whether or not we have projects in our individual districts which fact may be somewhat Influencing our decisions. The nobility of proper action in this regard was demonstrated today in the Appropriations Committee by the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina. the Honorable JOHN KERR. chairman of the Subcommittee on Deficiencies. when he moved that we proceed to pass this resolution.

The farreaching effects are so serious that it is impossible to catalog them at this time. There is no alternative to a continuing resolution. If this motion should be defeated. we must then apply to the Committee on Rules. which has until tomorrow to bring in a resolution. which will only require a majority vote. I might say also. Mr. Speaker. that the indefinite date has its practical value. We have discovered by two experiences that establishing a date is ineffective if we do not have cooperation from the other side. But in addition to that all departments of the Government affected have been for the last 6 weeks living from hour to hour. They have to readjust their schedules after each one of these resolutions. it means a tremendous change and a lot of extra bookkeeping.

It took away from administrative expenses $600.000. The result was that Mr. Wickard found himself with not enough money to pay his engineers and his other help. As I now remember. 172 were released. or quit. or were not paid enough money and did not remain. As a consequence. all over the Great Plains area. which includes Kansas. Nebraska. Wyoming. North and South Dakota. and Montana. the REA work was at a standstill. One reason why there is $528.00.000 available in approved loans today is because of the action of the Eightieth Congress which cut $600.000 from the administrative expense appropriation. so that no engineers were available.

It is not fair. in my judgment. for anyone to say that the farmer has as much money now or even more than he had a year or 2 or 3 years ago. Does not the Senator realize that the REA is now loaning money to farmers to wire their houses? We have more than 6.000.000 farmers In submarginal areas. The testimony given a few days ago was that 2.000.000 of them make in the neighborhood of four or five hundred to six hundred dollars a year. They have no money with which to wire their houses. I read from a letter I received from Mr. Wickard a short time ago: This is in response to your letter dated February 14. 1949. regarding an inquiry which you have received from Mr. Leo Otte. Verona. N. Dak.. concerning the possibilities of obtaining a loan to finance the costs of wiring his farmstead for electric service. Why should not a farmer be able to borrow money to wire his house? Mr. Wickard continued in his letter: The Congress. in passing the Rural Electrification Act of 1939 and subsequent amendments to the act. charged REA with the responsibility of lending funds to rural people through its borrowers at lowinterest rates. to speed the wiring of rural farmsteads and the purchase of plumbing and electrical equipment. Loans made to borrowers for this purpose bear the same rate of interest as all other REA loans. 2 percent. The Rural Electrification Administration has set 4 percent as the interest rate which its borrowers may charge members on all installation loans. Installation loans approved by the borrower to its members are subject to the following terms: So. in addition to all the other things REA has done in the past. we find that they are now lending farmers who are poor and destitute. who live on submarginal lands. many of whom are broke. some of whom we know have not had a crop in 5 yearsthey are lending them money so they can get electricity and power in their homes and live like decent human beings.",
