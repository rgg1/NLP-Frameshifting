    "speech": "Leader PELOSI. thank you for your kind words. Members of the House. the Senate. my wife Debbie. who is with us todaythankfully the girls are workingand all of you and our fellow countrymen. we meet again at democracys great port of call. Every 2 years. at this hour. the Constitution brings a new order to this House. and its an interlude for reflection. a glimpse of old truths. To our new Members and their families. let me just say \"welcome.\" I know youre feeling a bit awestruck at this moment. History runs through this building. Now youre among a select few to share in this privilege. For those of you who are returning. whove walked these aisles before. maybe its time we get a little awestruck again. The way our Founders envisioned it. the Republic would be led by citizens who recognize the blessings that we receive by governing ourselves. and it requires that we give something of ourselves. Everything depended on this. So they made each other and their successors swear an oath of allegiance. In a few moments. Ill take this oath for the 12th time as the representative from the Eighth District of Ohio. It is word for word the same oath that we all take. Note that it makes no mention of party or faction or title. It contains no reference to agendas or to platforms. only to the Constitution. The one addition we dare make. as George Washington did at the very first inaugural. is to invoke the assistance of our Heavenly Father. This covenant makes us servants of posterity. It calls us to refuse the pull of passing interest and follow the fixed star of a more perfect union. Put simply. were sent here not to be something. but to do something. Or as I like to call it. \"doing the right thing.\" Its a big job. and it comes with big challenges. Our government has built up too much debt. Our economy is not producing enough jobs. And these are not separate problems. At $16 trillion and rising. our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state. The American Dream is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt. Break its hold. and we begin to set our economy free. jobs will come home. and confidence will come back. We do this not just to boost GDP or reduce unemployment. but to secure for our children a future of freedom and opportunity. and. frankly. nothing is more important. As Washington wrote in his farewell address. \"We should not throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\" Well. that burden is ours. and so is the opportunity. Theres no substitute for the wisdom of the people. We here are their servants. As Speaker. I pledge to listen and to do all I can to help all of you carry out your oath of office that were all about to take. Because in our hearts we know its wrong to pass this debt on to our kids and our grandkids. Now. we have to be willing. truly willing to make this problem right. Public service was never meant to be an easy living. Extraordinary challenges demand extraordinary leadership. So if youve come here to see your name in the lights or to pass off a political victory as some accomplishment. youve come to the wrong place. The door is right behind you. If you come here humbled by the opportunity to serve. if youve come here to be the determined voice of the people. if youve come here to carry the standard of leadership demanded not by our constituents but by the times. then youve come to the right place. There is a time for every purpose under Heaven. For the 113th Congress. it is a time to rise. When the day is over and the verdict is read. maybe its said that we well and faithfully did our duty to ensure that freedom will endure and prevail. so help us God. I am now ready to take the oath of office. I ask the Dean of the House of Representatives. the Honorable JOHN D. DINGELL of Michigan. to administer the oath of office.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it is a privilege to sponsor House Resolution 5. the rules package for the 113th Congress. This rules package is straightforward and builds upon the reforms and transparency implemented in the 112th Congress to address job creation and the economy. control the growth of government. and limit wasteful spending. We have incorporated a number of significant improvements. including a proposal from the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. JAMES LANKFORD. the gentleman from Oklahoma. to identify duplicative programs and examine the usefulness of existing government programs. This will help ensure that hardworking taxpayers dollars are not wasted and that we remain focused on making the Federal Government smarter and more efficient. Similarly. two proposals from the gentleman from Michigan. Congressman JUSTIN AMASH. will improve transparency of the legislative process by making it easier to see how proposed legislation would interact with existing law. Additional proposals from the Republican Study Committee chairman. STEVE SCALISE. the gentleman from Louisiana. will help bring more transparency to the regulatory process. American families and small businessmen and -women already suffer from too much red tape coming out of Washington. This proposal will ensure that the regulatory burden of any proposed bill is part of our deliberations. Under the current administration. Madam Speaker. we have also seen an explosion in spending for welfare programs. For the first time. we will require our annual budget resolutions include information about the growth of meanstested and nonmeanstested entitlement programs. This important reform will allow us to begin to responsibly control the growth of these welfare programs and ensure they can help those who need them most. I look forward to a productive 113th Congress where we can work together to produce results and make life work for more Americans.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I want to begin by congratulating my colleague. Mr. SESSIONS. on his new role as chair of the Rules Committee. Ive worked with Mr. SESSIONS now for many years. and I look forward to working with him even more closely in the months and years to come. And we will welcome the new class of legislators. as well. today. and we go through the traditions and procedures that have governed our Nation since Thomas Jefferson first wrote his manual. Im pleased to welcome our newest colleagues and welcome back old friends. Its a great honor to be chosen by our fellow Americans to represent them in Congress. Our neighbors have placed their trust in us. and we must never take such an honor for granted. With this honor comes a solemn responsibility. Starting today. we have the opportunity to move our Nation forward. and in the words of our Nations Founders provide for our common defense. promote our general welfare. and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and for our posterity. Our work begins today. and one of the first orders of business is considering the rules package for the incoming Congress. During the last Congress. we were promised an open and transparent process. but we unfortunately fell short. Under the majoritys leadership. more than onethird of the rules were completely closed. and at times brinksmanship endangered our economy. Today provides an opportunity for the majority to put these behind them and govern in an open. collaborative. and bipartisan way. and we are willing to meet them every step of the way. With this goal in mind. though. of this Rules Committee. I must say that I look at it with a little bit of trepidation. The most troubling for me is the proposal to. once again. adopt the Ryan budget. Doing so will keep alive dangerous budget proposals. including the repeal of parts of the Affordable Care Act. In addition. todays resolution makes it easier for Members of Congress to use private planes. and Im puzzled by that. I dont think Members should be flying around in corporate jets. And it continues the politically motivated campaign over the socalled Fast and Furious operation. To begin by loosening the ethics restrictions and advancing politically motivated campaigns should not be the priorities of Congress. Finally. with todays resolution. the majority continues their efforts to oppose marriage equality before the courts. In an age where marriage equality is recognized by Americans across the country of plurality. this Chamber should not be using taxpayer money to be standing on the wrong side of history. We could start our new beginning by joining all the Democratic colleagues and me in finally reforming our broken election laws. and I know everyone wants to do that. In the years since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in the Citizens United case. unlimited amounts of money from billionaires and hidden special interests have flooded our elections. Led by secret political spending that is hidden from public view. wealthy special interests have tried to buy our airwaves. to fund outrageously expensive campaigns. and to launch dishonest political attacks to persuade the outcome of countless elections. The Sunlight Foundation reports that during the 2012 election cycle alone. super PACs. as they are called. spent more than $620 million to affect the Federal elections. Nobody believes that corporations are people. and they should not be able to use unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections. At the end of this debate. my Democratic colleagues and I will provide the House with an opportunity to consider a constitutional amendment to overturn the flawed Citizens United decision. If approved. this amendment would finally remove the unlimited and untracked political donations from our electoral system. In addition to addressing the uncontrolled money in our political process. the Congress should be ensuring that every American citizen can easily exercise their right to vote. Voting is fundamental to what it means to be an American. but in recent years. weve seen a concerted effort to discourage voters from casting a ballot. Under the cover of a cynical and untruthful claim that voter fraud is a serious threat to our democracy. political operatives in States across the country have methodically advanced a number of discriminatory and dangerous pieces of legislation. Their methods range from enacting voter ID laws to reducing the number of voting machines in lowincome neighborhoods. Unfortunately. these discriminatory practices have indeed made it harder for our citizens to vote. This past November. there were numerous reports of voters being turned away from the polls. Many of those who did manage to vote had to wait in line for hoursand sometimes as many as 8 hoursbefore they could cast a ballot. It is clear as day that keeping people waiting in long lines is purely intended to make them give up and go home. Later today. my Democratic colleagues and I will ask the House to bring to the floor the Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early Voting Act. or SIMPLE Voting Act. This legislation would guarantee that no voter would have to wait more than 1 hour to cast their ballot and require that every polling station in the country have the resources it needs to run a smooth and fair election. When taken together. the overwhelming influence of money in politics and the discriminatory attacks on Americans right to vote. they have distorted our electoral system and helped to create a broken legislative process that is failing to serve the American public. As we open the 113th Congress. my colleagues and I stand ready to work with the majority on fixing our broken electoral system and getting back to a bipartisan legislative process worthy of the citizens who sent us here. I couldnt be happier or more honored to serve in the 113th Congress. I look forward to serving with all of my colleagues. and it is my sincere hope that well have an open. transparent. and bipartisan House so that we can produce meaningful results for those whom we represent. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Rochester. New York. I look forward to our time where we will work together day and night. perhaps. with the committee that she will be the ranking member for and I will be the chairman of. I told the gentlewoman before today that it will be my hope and her hope that we will not only work for the betterment of the institution. but also the Members. to ensure that they stand a better chance to make sure that our committee. the Rules Committee. is one that we can both look at each other and know that we have done a job that would be fair and appropriate on behalf of the minority leader. the majority leader. and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and all of our Members. The rules package before us today will continue the effort by our Republican majority to make the work of the House as open. transparent. and streamlined as possible. This work began in the 112th Congress under the leadership of former Chairman DAVID DREIER. When a number of important reforms were implemented. DAVID DREIER made sure that they worked. Today. we will continue the tradition of that transparency initiated by Chairman DREIER. The nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation recently praised our endeavors in that effort by saying: It is clear that the House has become a more transparent institution over the last 2 years. The accolades there go to the gentleman from California. DAVID DREIER. This body is wholeheartedly committed to advancing that reform process. and I am as its new chairman. Our work must begin and must always be directed to accountability. to the people who granted us the privilege of serving in this body. But the imperative for accountability is never higher than when we face tough economic times. economic times that each of us bring to the floor because of the demand upon people that we represent. As our national debt skyrockets. our economy limps sluggishly along. and unemployment remains predictably high. the need for a fully transparent and accountable process in this institution to help in that effort of unemployment in this country and to gain more jobs is one of the things which this Rules Committee and the work of the floor should be about. The rules package that we focus on today for the 113th Congress will help us to achieve that goal. It preserves the important reforms that we made in the previous Congress. while adding a few perfecting amendments and several other ideas. One such amendment in section 2 will help to streamline and expedite floor voting procedures. It is important to note. however. that these procedures are intended to be used to expedite consideration of questions of the House while ensuring that no Member is denied an adequate opportunity to vote. Section 2 also makes several improvements and clarifications in the Congressional Code of Conduct in order to more efficiently hold each Member of this body accountable. For example. it expands the current nepotism rule to conform to current law and to add grandchildren to the rule. who are not currently covered under House rules or current law. This is a strongly held bipartisan measure that has received praise from a number of transparency groups. including the Sunlight Foundation. as I mentioned at the outset. This rules package also amends the restrictions on the use of private aircraft contained in the Code of Conduct so as to harmonize House and Senate rules. These changes provide more flexibility to Members whose districts. including rural and remote locations. are not easily reached by car and do not have scheduled air service. They will also facilitate travel during extraordinary circumstances. such as in an emergency or in the aftermath of a natural disaster. At the same time. the revised rules keep in place safeguards to help ensure that such travel is fully consistent with House and ethics guidelines and rules. The new rules will simply ensure that Members pay a fair market rate for air travel. regardless of the type of aircraft that is used. Together. the amendments and the clarifications to the Code of Conduct contained in this resolution will better ensure that elective representatives. officials. and employees of the House can execute their official duties in an efficient. ethical. and transparent way. Section 3 of the rules package makes a number of separate orders. The most significant among them eliminates provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act that limit the ability of the House to respond to recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Now. House Republicans have made it very clear that we oppose ObamaCare. We have acted repeatedly to repeal and to replace this controversial law. But regardless of where any Member may stand on this issue. the question of preserving the prerogative of the House of Representatives to its work and its will without dispute or controversy must be achieved. Article I. section 5 of the Constitution very clearly states that this body has the right and the responsibility to determine the rules of its proceedings. This provision will ensure that. as we proceed with the issue of health care reform. the ability of the House to respond to the Independent Payment Advisory Board is not abridged. Sections 3 and 4 go on to make a number of adjustments that enhance our budgetary process. preserve our oversight rules. and strengthen our ethics procedures. Finally. section 5 allows the Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day through January 15. 2013. Every Member of this body has sworn an oath today to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is a very worthwhile endeavor to spend time in the first few days of this new Congress. and perhaps any Congress. to review the inspiring words of our Nations founding document. The rules package that I have just outlined for you will better enable each of us. as an institution. to perform our constitutional duties and obligations with integrity. transparency. and accountability. while streamlining its operations. Presenting this package to Hi1 the House is my first official act as chairman of the Rules Committee for the 113th Congress. and I think it exemplifies our commitment to an open and deliberative process that empowers the majority to work its will while preserving the ability of individual Members. particularly those in the minority. to present their ideas and engage in meaningful debate. I urge my colleagues to support this rules package. and I will insert. for the RECORD. a sectionbysection analysis of the resolution. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Despite bipartisan agreement in the Budget Control Act. the continuing resolution and. just this week. on the fiscal cliff. this rules package returns to the partisan stance that Republicans brought to the last Congress on fiscal issues and particularly on the budget. It deems the amounts in the Ryan budget to be the default funding levels this year. levels well below this weeks compromised agreement. We saw that in the last budget process as well. We made an agreement. and lo and behold. the budget came out with numbers substantially below that agreement.",

I will try and do my very best within the limits and constraints that I have. but my attitude is always to be stellar. and I hope that he knows that he can count on that also. I thank the gentleman very much. I would also extend that to other Members who are here. Madam Speaker. who have come down to express their ideas. Their ideas about how to make this a better place are always important. The Republican Conference. the majority. had a vigorous time yesterday afternoon as we debated the House rules. as we offered our ideas. as we debated how we could make this a better place. not just transparent but really work to the efficiency of the people who sent us here. I must say that Im fresh from that wonderful and invigorating time in which we talked about the ideas. we defended what we did and changed the things that needed to be done. Our Members all were accorded. not just equal time. but a chance to bring their ideas forth. perhaps from back home from a season of election. perhaps from their experiences that they had back home. It was really a good time for not just me as a Member but. I think. for all of us in our body. Today. we enjoy that same opportunity as we come together. Democrats and Republicans. on the floor to talk about the rules of the House. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the ranking member for yielding me the time. Madam Speaker. today is a day of great pride for every Member who has just been sworn in. particularly our newly elected Members. It is a great honor to be elected to serve in this body. On Election Day. our constituents went to their polling places and voted for us. We should be thankful for that. particularly so when. for far too many of our constituents. regardless of their political leanings. voting on Election Day was an unnecessarily burdensome. timeconsuming. and unpleasant experience. In my home county in South Carolina. voters reported waiting in line for over 4 hours. One young voter thought ahead of time. He brought an iPad. and watched the entire \"Hunger Games\" movie while in line. Others. understandably. didnt have 3 hours to spare on a workday. In Detroit. Michigan. Gina Porter waited in line for more than 3 hours before giving up. Danielle Wilkins voted after waiting for 4 hours. In Lee County. Florida. Angela DeFranciesco went to her polling place in the morning with her infant son. Seeing a 3hour line. she decided to come back later. After finding a babysitter. she returned in the afternoon. at which point the line had grown to 51/2 hours. Unable to be away from her infant son that long. she left without voting. As President Obama said on election night. \"We have to fix that.\" As we take our places in this Congress that we earned on Election Day. now is the time to fix it. This motion to commit would ensure that no voter has to wait longer than an hour to cast a ballot. We have a long history of struggle over the right to vote in this country. Yet. time and again. we have reaffirmed the principle that every eligible American has an equal right to cast a ballot without facing discrimination. A 3hour wait is discrimination against those who have to work. those who have to take care of their kids and those whose health prevents them from waiting in line for such a long time. Long lines are the 21st century version of poll taxes and literacy tests. disenfranchising the least advantaged and the most vulnerable citizens. We have an obligation to ensure that every American has an equal opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to vote.",

I am hopeful that the 113th Congress will be more productive. collaborative. and civil than the 112th. Im not particularly optimistic. but Im always hopefulhopeful that we can return to some semblance of regular order with committees doing their work. bills coming to the floor under an open amendment process. and Members having the opportunity to reflect the will of their constituents. At the very least. I hope that the outrageous. partisan and closed process we saw during the fiscal cliff crisis is not repeated. That is no way to legislate. and its no wonder after that bit of theater that the American people have so little regard for Congress. One of the best ways that we can help the country is to improve the way we conduct our elections because bad elections lead to bad lawmaking. If 2012 taught us anything. its that we desperately need campaign finance reform. If the previous question is defeated on this rule. Democrats will amend the resolution to give the House a vote on a constitutional amendment to control the corrupting influence of money in politics. The Supreme Courts terrible decision in the Citizens United case opened the flood gates. and our election system is now awash in a sea of millions of dollars of unregulated money. drowning out the voices of individual citizens. Politicians are increasingly beholden to wealthy special interests. A multinational oil company that doesnt like a particular Member of Congress can now simply write a big checkundisclosed checkto Americans for Apple Pie and Puppies and watch the negative advertising work their magic. There are a variety of ways to tackle this problem. In the last Congress. I introduced the peoples rights amendment which would overturn Citizens United and put a stop to the corporate personhood nonsense that it represents. Despite what Governor Romney said on the campaign trail. corporations are not people and they do not deserve the same constitutional rights as American citizens. Other Members will have other ideas. But at the very least. we need to have this debate. and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question.",

I was appalled on this past election day by widespread reports across the country of voters forced to wait in hourslong lines simply to exercise one of our most fundamental rightsthe right to vote. Even in some States with early voting. voters were forced to choose between waiting for hours or missing work or taking care of their children in order to cast their vote. or giving up their right to vote altogether. At some precincts in Miami. hundreds of voters stood in line for over 4 hours. past the 7 oclock closing time of the polls. even after President Obama had been declared the winner of the election. It offends our basic values that Americans would be denied the right to vote because of a lastminute illness or change in the work schedule. the need to pick up a child from school. or some other unavoidable emergency. meaning that they could not afford to wait in line for several hours simply to exercise that right. The motion to commit in the House will make two important changes. First. it will require in Federal elections that every State provide for at least 15 days early voting. and. two. it would require the State to provide adequate resources. staff. and machines at polling places in Federal elections to ensure that voters are not forced to wait in line for more than an hour. There are numerous changes that need to be made to adequately protect the rights of all Americans to their right to vote. and I support the comprehensive approach to voter protections that has been developed by Mr. LEWIS and Mr. CLYBURN. However. today we have a chance to take a very simple step to make sure that voting is simple for Americans so they can exercise their right. a right that we broadcast to the rest of the world about how we choose our leaders and how we exercise our democracy. But that right and that democracy is now being thwarted by efforts at the local and State levels to make voting more difficult. to prohibit people from voting. We can change all of that in the motion to commit today in this rules package. and I would urge my colleagues to support that. I want to thank Mr. CLYBURN and Mr. LEWIS for their leadership. Im very sorry that Mr. LEWIS is unable to be here today with the untimely death of his wife. Lillian.",

Section 4 of the resolution continues to authorize the expenditure of taxpayers money to defend. in court. the unconstitutional and discriminatory socalled \"Defense of Marriage Act.\" It goes further to state that this partisan effort \"speaks for and articulates the institutional positions of the House.\" That is simply not true. The original decision to defend DOMA was taken by a partyline vote of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. and all further decisions have been taken by the Republican leadership alone. some in secret. So far. the Republican leadership has authorized the expenditure of $2 million of taxpayers money to defend this discriminatory law. This defense is not supported by the entire House. 145 Members of the House have signed a brief arguing that DOMA should be declared unconstitutional and struck down. So far. every court that decided this question has agreed that DOMA is unconstitutional. We have repeatedly asked the Speaker for a briefing from the lawyers retained by the Republican majority. The Speaker hasnt even seen fit to give us the courtesy of a response. If these highpriced lawyers really represent the House. they should at least have the courtesy to meet with their alleged clients to answer questions about that representation. The time has come to call a halt to this farce.

I represent 3.7 million U.S. citizens. more than any House member and 44 senators. My fellow delegates represent about one million people. Our constituents are part of the American family. They fightand many have diedin defense of our nation. The rules package demeans their sacrifice. In November. a referendum in Puerto Rico showed a clear majority wants to end the Islands undemocratic status. and that more voters support statehood than any other status option. Todays rules demonstrate why the status quo mustand willend. I look forward to the day when Puerto Rico will have equal representation in the government that makes its national laws. rather than having to plead for the reinstatement of a limited and largely symbolic vote.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition to the Rules Package which once again denies the opportunity for Delegates to Congress and the Resident Commissioner to vote on amendments in the Committee of the Whole. We were privileged to have this right first in the 103rd Congress and then again in the 110th and 111th. Mr. Speaker. the over 4 million citizens in the U.S. territories are among the most patriotic Americans you will find anywhere in our country. They have served and died for their country in every war and conflict since the First World War including the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Much like their fellow citizens on the mainland they are a diverse group of individuals. Some were born in the territories under the American flag. some have migrated there and embraced our culture and our values before naturalization. and others were born in the states and have chosen by virtue of their chosen occupation or by love of our islands to make the territories their home. All are Americans in every sense of the word. except for full representation in the House of Representatives and the ability to vote for the President of the United States. We had hoped and expected that our colleagues in the House would recognize the contributions of their fellow American insular residents and afford their representatives the opportunity to participate more fully in the decisions of the \"peoples House\". unfortunately however the rules package being voted on has once again proven to us that we still have a long way to go to ensure equality and justice for all. It is ironic and sad. that the United States is the leading voice calling for people around the world to have more. not less say in the governance of their countries. while the rules of the House of Representatives disenfranchise the representatives of American citizens living in U.S. Insular Areas and the District of Colombia.

    "speech": "The House has adopted a revision to the rule regarding the admission to the floor and the rooms leading thereto. Clause 4 of rule IV provides that a former Member. Delegate or Resident Commissioner or a former Parliamentarian of the House. or a former elected officer of the House or a former minority employee nominated as an elected officer of the House shall not be entitled to the privilege of admission to the Hall of the House and the rooms extending thereto if he or she is a registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal. has any direct personal pecuniary interest in any legislative measure pending before the House. or reported by a committee. or is in the employ of or represents any party or organization for the purpose of influencing. directly or indirectly. the passage. defeat. or amendment of any legislative proposal. This restriction extends not only to the House floor but adjacent rooms. the cloakrooms and the Speakers lobby. Clause 4 of rule IV also allows the Speaker to exempt ceremonial and educational functions from the restrictions of this clause. These restrictions shall not apply to attendance at joint meetings or joint sessions. Former Members Day proceedings. educational tours. and other occasions as the Speaker may designate. Members who have reason to know that a person is on the floor inconsistent with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the SergeantatArms promptly. 2. Introduction of Bills and Resolutions The policy that the Chair announced on January 3. 1983. with respect to the introduction and reference of bills and resolutions will continue to apply in the 113th Congress. The Chair has advised all officers and employees of the House who are involved in the processing of bills that every bill. resolution. memorial. petition or other material that is placed in the hopper must bear the signature of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is jointly sponsored. the signature must be that of the Member first named thereon. The bill clerk is instructed to return to the Member any bill which appears in the hopper without an original signature. This procedure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It has worked well. and the Chair thinks that it is essential to continue this practice to insure the integrity of the process by which legislation is introduced in the House. 3. UnanimousConsent Requests for the Consideration of Legislation The policy the Chair announced on January 6. 1999. with respect to recognition for unanimousconsent requests for the consideration of certain legislative measures will continue to apply in the 113th Congress. The Speaker will continue to follow the guidelines recorded in section 956 of the House Rules and Manual conferring recognition for unanimousconsent requests for the consideration of bills. resolutions. and other measures only when assured that the majority and minority floor leadership and the relevant committee chairs and ranking minority members have no objection. Consistent with those guidelines and with the Chairs inherent power of recognition under clause 2 of rule XVII. the Chair. and any occupant of the chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore pursuant to clause 8 of rule I. will decline recognition for the unanimous- consent requests chronicled in section 956 without assurances that the request has been so cleared. This denial of recognition by the Chair will not reflect necessarily any personal opposition on the part of the Chair to orderly consideration of the matter in question. but will reflect the determination upon the part of the Chair that orderly procedures will be followed. that is. procedures involving consultation and agreement between floor and committee leadership on both sides of the aisle. 4.

    "speech": "Madam President. it is my pleasure to convene the 113th Congress. I welcome back all my colleagues to a place that we love. the U.S. Senate. But in particular. I would like to welcome Illinois Senator MARK KIRK. He has been away from us for a year recovering from an illness. We are all grateful for his recovery. He has been an inspiration to us. Today. on the east front of the Capitol. to see him walk up those steps said it all. So we are very proud of him and glad he is back with us. I also offer a special welcome to the 13 new Members of the Senate. I am confident that each Senator will treasure their memories in this historic legislative body. and that each will serve their State and our Nation with distinction. All of the Members of this freshman class are accomplished in their own right. I can remember many years ago30 years ago. Madam Presidentbeing a new Member of the House. Speaker ONeill called us in. in small groups. to talk to us. And he said to each of us: All of you are accomplished or you would not be here. You are all politicians. It is not a bad word. And I say that to all our Senatorsthe new Senatorsthat they are all accomplished or they would not be here. and they should all understand that. They should have confidence in moving into this body because they are just as experienced as the rest of us. I trust that serving in the Senate will be the most rewarding experience of their lives. In this Chamber the 113th Congress will face the most significant challenges of our careersnot just the new Members. all of us. To turn those challenges into triumphs. I urge all Senatorsnew and experiencedto draw not only on our varied experience at every level of government and public service. but also on each others experience. regardless of political party. Daniel Webster said: \"We are all agents of the same supreme power. the people.\" Today. as we begin a new Congress. we are afforded the opportunity to reflect upon the successes and failures of past Congresses. It has been said that the 112th Congress was characterized by some of the sharpest political divisions in memory. But during the last Congress. there were also many commendable examples of compromise. The recent effort to avert the fiscal cliff was an example of both the divisions and the collaborations that mark a moment in historyand it was a moment in history. Although the process of resolving some of the fiscal issues facing this country was extremely difficult and protracted. in the end our two parties came together to protect Americas middle class. That is something of which we should all be proud. As we advance the debate over the best way to strengthen our economy and reduce our deficit during this Congress. the 113th. Democrats will continue to stand strong for the principle of balance. I am hopeful and confident my Republican colleagues will do the same. Any future budget agreements must balance the need for thoughtful spending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among us and closing wasteful tax loopholes. The 112th Congress. unfortunately. showed that we had some political differences. and these differences prevented us from accomplishing as much as we had hoped during the Congress that was just completed. But we also passed very important legislation. such as the transportation jobs bill. This was important because it kept 2 million people working. and we began the restoration. with that legislation. of our crumbling infrastructure. We made strides to reduce the Nations deficit and prevented a tax increase for 98 percent of American families and 97 percent of small businesses. I guess I should have started. Madam President. by telling everyone that the marks that people see on my facethat has nothing to do with the fiscal cliff or the disagreements that Speaker BOEHNER and I had. It is from being very pale and living in the desert most of my life. We were able to accomplish. as I indicated. many things to reduce the deficit and prevent a tax increase for American families and small businesses. We reformed our patent system for the first time in six decades. gave small business owners access to the capital they need to compete. and reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration. keeping 300.000 workers employed. Not a single piece of that legislation became law without the votes of both Democrats and Republicans. All those legislative initiatives I just talked about were bipartisan. Unfortunately. many other worthy measures that passed the Senate with strong. bipartisan support then languished. awaiting action by the House of Representatives. In the 113th Congress. it will be incumbent upon the House Republican leadership to allow bipartisan bills passed by the Senate to come to a vote before the full House of Representativesnot before the Republican Members only but before Democrats and Republicans. all 435 Members of the House. Too many good pieces of legislation died over the last 2 years because House Republican leaders insisted on passing legislation with a majority of the majority. that is. only Republicans. Democrats were ignored most of the time. For example. postal reform. the Violence Against Women Act. the farm bill. and relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy all passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis after extensive deliberation and debate. Yet the House failed to act on all four of these measures. and there were others. As Speaker BOEHNER saw on New Years Day. when he allows every Member of the House to vote and not only Republican Members of the House to vote. Congress can enact bills into law. No legislation can pass the Senate without both Democrats and Republicans. During the 113th Congress. the Speaker should strive to make that the rule of the House of Representatives as well. Still. it is true that the 112th Congress left much undone. That is why we resolve to pick up where we left off in just a few weeks. The first crucial matter we will address will be the longoverdue aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy. I am hopeful that the House will act. as they said. on the 15th. Then when we get back here. we will move on it very quickly. We need to strive to be more productive. and we will do little if we dont address a major reason for our inefficiency. Simply. the Senate is not working as it should. That is why in the last Congress I made plain that Democrats would do something to fix those issues. The beginning of a new Congress is customarily a time that the Senate addresses changes to its rules. In the last Congress. Democratic Senators JEFF",

    "speech": "Madam President. I would like to welcome everybody back after what we all realized was a somewhat abbreviated recess. In fact. I believe you would have to go back to 1970 to find the last time the Senate was in session and voting between Christmas and New Years. In particular. I want to welcome back Senator MARK KIRK. He has made a brilliant recovery since suffering a debilitating stroke almost a year ago. The fact that MARK is here today says a lot about his tenacity. his dedication. and his commitment to the people of Illinois. I am told that about twothirds of the patients in the facility where he has been recovering over the past year dont return to work. but true to form MARK opted for an experimental rehabilitation program so grueling. it has been compared to military boot camp. His staff counted 45 steps from the parking lot to the front door of the Senate. and during his treatment he made walking those steps his goal. Today he did it. He did it. So we admire him for his spirit. and we applaud his achievement. It is wonderful to have him back and ready to work. I would also like to welcome the new Members who take their oaths of office today. particularly the four new Members of the Republican conference: Senator FLAKE of Arizona. Senator FISCHER of Nebraska. Senator CRuz of Texas. and Senator SCOTT of South Carolina. Congratulations to you all. We welcome the energy and intelligence each of you brings to the challenges we face and especially to the transcendent challenge of our time: a Federal debt so huge. so huge it threatens to permanently alter an economy that has provided generations of Americans the opportunity to fulfill their dreams of a better life. Four straight years of trilliondollar deficits and projected spending that no realistic amount of tax revenue could cover have put us at a crossroads. Either we tackle our Nations spending problem or it is going to tackle us. It is that simple. and there is no better time to do the work we need to do than right now. The bipartisan agreement we reached earlier this week was imperfect. I am the first to admit itespecially the process. But aside from shielding 99 percent of my constituents and many of yours from the painful effects of a middleclass tax hikethe President seemed all too willing. by the way. to impose thatit gave us something else: It settled the revenue debate for good. The revenue debate is over. President Obama declared the other night that those he calls rich are now paying their \"fair share.\" so it is time to move on. The President got his revenue. and now it is time to turn squarely to the real problem. which we all know is spending. We all knew that the tax hikes the President campaigned on were never going to solve the problem. Now that he has gotten them. he has a responsibility to put his preoccupation with taxes behind him and to work with us to actually solve the problem at hand. It is time to face up to the fact that our Nation is in grave fiscal dangergrave fiscal dangerand that it has everything to do with spending. This is a debate the American people want us to have. The President liked to point out on the campaign trail that most Americans supported the idea of taxing the rich. What he conveniently left out is that even more Americans support the idea of cutting spending. One recent survey I saw said that about threefourths of all Americans say they want to see major spending cuts in Washington. When you look at some of the things Washington has been wasting their dollars on. it is no wonder. I mean. if we cant stop spending taxpayer dollars on robosquirrels. dancing robot DJs. or hot air balloon rides for Smokey the Bear. then there is no hope at all because if we cant fix the easy stuff. the robosquirrels and the robot DJs. the things most of us agree on. how are we ever going to get at the hard stuff? That is why the first step in this debate is for Democrats to get over their fanatical commitment to guarding every single dime the government ever got its hands on. This has to stop. The best time to stop it is now. There is actually no better time for this debate. In a couple of months the President will ask us to raise the Nations debt limit. We cannot agree to increase that borrowing limit without agreeing to reforms that lower the avalanche of spending that is creating this debt in the first place. It is not fair to the American people. and it is not fair to our children. whom we are asking to foot the bill. The health of our economy requires it. so now is the time to get serious about spending. If the past few weeks have taught us anything at all. it means the President needs to show up early this time. The American people will not tolerate the kinds of lastminute crises that we have seen again and again over the last 4 years as a result of this Presidents chronic inactivity and refusal to lead on the pressing issues of our time. We dont need speeches. we need action. and we need it now. We need courage because the only way we are going to address the spending that is at the root of our Nations fiscal problems is if the President is willing to bring the members of his party to the table and get them to rise above the partisan voices on the left. who treat every single penny of government spending as sacred. Hopefully. that kind of cooperation will be forthcoming but. if not. we will have several opportunities in the coming months to force the conversation Washington needs to have. The first such opportunity. as I have said. surrounds the Presidents upcoming request of us to raise the debt ceiling. After that. there is the continuing resolution. But let me be clear. there is no need for dramano need for dramaand we dont want any. The President knows as well as I do what needs to be done. He can either engage now to significantly cut government spending or force a crisis later. It is his call. But for the sake of the country we must have this debate now. So today I call on my friend the majority leader and the rest of my Democratic colleagues to start working with us right nownot 1 hour. 1 day. or 1 week before we hit the debt limit but ahead of time for once so we can pass a bipartisan solution on spending that everyone will have an opportunity to weigh in on in early February. We need a plan that can pass the House and actually begin to get Washington spending under control. If we are serious. we will get one done. With taxes now off the table. the only way to achieve a balanced plan is to focus on the spending side of the equation. particularly. as the President pointed out. health care entitlement programs because. as I said. taxes simply cant go high enough to keep pace with the amount of money we have projected to spend on them without crushing our economy. The best way to reform these programs is to make them work better. The debt isnt exploding because these programs exist. it is exploding because they are inefficient. They were created in a different erathe era of blackandwhite TV. They should be updated for the age of the iPad. and we should want to fix them not just because we want to lower the debt but because we want to strengthen and improve these programs themselves. Over the next few months it will be up to the President and his party to work with us to deliver the same kind of bipartisan resolution on spending that we have now achieved on taxes. but it needs to happen before the eleventh hour. For that to happen. the President needs to show up this time. The President claims to want a balanced approach. Now that he has the tax rates he wants. his calls for \"balance\" means he needs to join us in the effort to achieve meaningful spending reform. The President may not want to have this debate. but it is the one he is going to have because the country needs it. Republicans are ready to tackle the spending problem. and we start today.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I know he is working diligently and we have some very positive things happening. Madam President. as we begin the 113th Congress. I have submitted on behalf of myself and Senators MERKLEY and HARKIN a resolution to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate. Our proposal to reform the rules is simple. it is limited. and it is fair. Again. we are not ending the filibuster. We preserve the rights of the minority. We are only proposing the following: No. 1. an end to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead. Senators would be required to go to the floor and actually tell the American people why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a filibuster. No. 2. debate on motions to proceed to a bill. or to send a bill to conference. would be limited to two hours. and No. 3. postcloture debate on a nomineeother than a justice to the Supreme Courtwould be limited to 2 hours. rather than the current limit of 30 hours. These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live with if we are in the minority. And yet. we are warned that these simple reforms will transform the very character of the Senate. Will leave the minority without a voice. These arguments are covers for continued abuse of the rules. The reforms are modest. Some would say too modest. But they would discourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the right to filibuster. but not the right to do so by simply making an announcement and then going out to dinner or. more likely. to a fundraiser. Let me just say again: Senators MERKLEY. HARKIN. and I are not talking about taking away the rights of the minority. We are not abolishing the right to debate or to filibuster. But there must be change. The unprecedented use. and abuse. of the filibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate from doing its job. We are no longer \"the worlds greatest deliberative body.\" In fact. we barely deliberate at all. For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly. But. in recent years. what was rare has become routine. The exception has become the norm. Everything is filibusteredevery procedural step of the waywith paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the process. not send it into a deep freeze. Since the Democratic majority came into the upper chamber in 2007. the Senates of the 110th. 111th. and current 112th Congress have witnessed the three highest totals of filibusters ever recorded. A recent report found the current Senate has passed a recordlow 2.8 percent of bills introduced. That is a 66 percent decrease from the last Republican majority in 20052006. and a 90 percent decrease from the high in 1955I have listened with great interest to the arguments against rules reform by the other side. Each day. my Republican colleagues have come to the floor and made very impassioned statements in opposition to amending our rules at the beginning of the new Congress. They say that the rules can only be changed with a twothirds supermajority. as the current filibuster rule requires. And they have repeatedly said any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" This simply is not true. The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article I Section 5 of the Constitution states that. \"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. punish its Members for disorderly Behavior. and. with the Concurrence of two thirds. expel a Member.\" When the Framers required a supermajority. they explicitly stated so. as they did for expelling a member. On all other matters. such as determining the Chambers rules. a majority requirement is clearly implied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents. sitting as President of the Senate. on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it applies to the Senate. In 1957. Vice President Nixon ruled definitively: [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another. the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules. stemming as it does from the Constitution itself. cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is. in the opinion of the Chair. unconstitutional. VicePresidents Rockefeller and Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses. I have heard many of my Republican colleagues quote Senator Robert Byrds last statement to the Senate Rules Committee. I was at that hearing. and have great respect for Senator Byrd and know that he was one of the great Senate historians and deeply loved this institution. But we should also consider Senator Byrds other statements. as well as steps he took as Majority Leader to reform this body. In 1979. when others were arguing that the rules could only be amended in accordance with the previous Senates rules. Majority Leader Byrd said the following on the floor: There is no higher law. insofar as our Government is concerned. than the Constitution. The Senate rules are subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution in Article I. Section 5. says that each House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past. In addition to the clear language of the Constitution. there is also a longstanding common law principle. upheld in the Supreme Court. that one legislature cannot bind its successors. For example. if the Senate passed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in the future. that would violate this principle and be unconstitutional. Similarly. the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules that a majority of the Senate in the future cannot amend or repeal. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For example. in 2003 Senator JOHN CORNYN wrote in a law review article: Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote. one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power. after all. would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another. So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" It is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules. and that when there is a conflict between them. we follow the Constitution. I find some of the rhetoric about amending our rules particularly troubling. We have heard comments that any such reforms. if done by a majority. would \"destroy the Senate.\" Again. I can turn to my Republican colleagues to answer this accusation. In 2005. the Republican Policy Committee released a memo entitled \"The Constitutional Option: The Senates Power to Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote.\" Not only does the memo support all of the same arguments I make today in support of reform by a majority. but it also refutes many of the recent claims about how the Senate will be permanently damaged. In a section of the memo titled. \"Common Misunderstandings of the Constitutional Option.\" it responds to the misunderstanding that \"the essential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the constitutional option is exercised\" with the following: When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and precedents. those illustrative exercises of the option did little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed. many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger today in a body that still allows for extensive debate. full consideration. and careful deliberation of all matters with which it is presented. What is more important about the Republican memo is the reason they believed a change to the rules by a majority was justified. Back then it was about the filibuster of judicial nomineesand what Republicans saw as a break in longstanding Senate tradition. They claimed they werent using the constitutional option as a power grab. but as a means of restoring the Senate to its historical norm. The memo states the following: The Senate is a relatively stable institution. but its norms of conduct have sometimes been violated. In some instances. a minority of Senators has rejected past practices and bipartisan understandings and exploited heretofore \"off limits\" opportunities to obstruct the Senates business. At other times. a minority of Senators has abused the rules and precedents in a manner that violates Senators reasonable expectations of proper procedural parameters. These are efforts to change Senate norms and practices. but they do not necessarily have the support of a majority. Such situations create institutional conundrums: what should be done when a mere minority of Senators changes accepted institutional norms? One option is to acquiesce and allow \"rule by the minority\" so that the minoritys norm becomes the Senates new norm. But another option has been for the majority of Senators to deny the legitimacy of the minority Senators effort to shift the norms of the entire body. And to do that. it has been necessary for the majority to act independently to restore the previous Senate norms of conduct. This is exactly where we find ourselves today. Back then. the Republicans argued the constitutional option should be used because 10 of President Bushs judicial nominees were threatened with a filibuster. I believe the departure from Senate tradition we see today is far worse. Since Democrats became the majority party in the Senate in 2007. we have faced the highest number of opposition filibusters ever recorded. Lyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate Majority Leader. In the same span of time HARRY REID has faced over 385. So. as the Republicans argued in 2005. \"[a]n exercise of the constitutional option under the current circumstances would be an act of restoration.\" We must return the Senate to a time when every procedural step was not filibustered. But if my Republican colleagues really believe using the constitutional option would be so harmful to the Senate. there is an alternative. We dont have to reform the rules with only a majority vote. That is up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Each time the filibuster rule has been amended in the past. a bipartisan group of senators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with the inevitability of a majority vote on the reforms looming. enough Members agreed on a compromise and they passed the changes with twothirds in favor. We could do that again this month. I know many of my Republican colleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. I said 2 years ago that I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next Congressregardless of which party was in the majority. At the time. many people believed the Democrats would lose their majority. So let me be clear. If Leader MCCONNELL had become the new majority leader today. on the first day of the 113th Congress. I would ask him to work with me on implementing these same reforms. I will say again. The proposed changes will reform the abuse of the filibuster. not trample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I am willing to live with all of the changes we are proposing. whether I am in the majority or minority. The other side has suggested that a change in the rules is an affront to the American public. But the real affront would be to allow the abuse of the filibuster to continue. We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is time for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and the things that matter to American families. That was the message we were sent in the election. and we would do well to listen to it. Under the abuse of the current rules. all it takes to filibuster is one senator picking up the phone. Period. It doesnt even require going on the floor to defend it. Just a phone call by one senator. No muss. no fuss. no inconvenience. Except for the American public. Except for a nation that expects and needs a government that worksa government that actually works together and finds common ground. Some of my colleagues may believe the Senate is working as it should. that everything is fine. Well. Madam President. we do not take that view. It isnt working. It needs to change. The American people. of all political persuasions. are clamoring for a government that actually gets something done. The challenges are too great. the stakes are too high. for a government of gridlock to continue.",

I am honored to tell my colleagues about my friend. R. Stanley Lowe. In 1943. Stan was in college and had been deferred from the draft because of his studies. But. at age 19. he wanted to do his part to protect our great Nation. He enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine. He served on five ships in the Pacific and Atlantic. each voyage lasting several months. Stan became a staff officer. in charge of personnel and payroll. He was also a chaplain and medical officer. called a pharmacists mate and purser. Stan served from 1943 to 1946. seeing things that would have a life long impact on him. The Merchant Marine had the highest rate of casualties of any service. dying at a rate of 1 in 26. and Stan was there to help the injured and comfort the dying. Following his service. he returned to Wyoming to complete his law degree and then practice law in Rawlins. It was there he met the love of his life. Anne \"Pat\" Kirtland Selden Lowe. while they were skiing. She was remarkable. too. Pat was among the first female geologistsand a scholarship in her name continues to support students pursuing degrees in geology at the University of Wyoming. Wyoming has benefited immensely from Stans career. He served in the State House of Representatives and was elected to be the county and prosecuting attorney for Carbon County. He spent the majority of his distinguished career as general counsel for True Oil. In 1985. Stan led a delegation of American lawyers on a goodwill tour to China. The legal profession benefited from his wisdom through his service as counsel for the American Judicature Society. While practicing law. he never forgot about his service and his fellow veterans. Stan was appointed to the Wyoming Veterans Affairs Commission by Governor Mike Sullivan in 1991 and upon his retirement he was named chair emeritus. In 2003. Stan was awarded the Civilian Meritorious Service Medal. Stan has led the efforts to expand Wyomings only Veterans Cemetery. His passion for history paved the ground for the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum. Stan served in supportive and leadership roles in multiple veterans organizations. Stan is a 3 year district commander of the American Legion. He was recently honored with the title of Honorary Past Department Commander. a title only given four other times in the history of the Wyoming American Legion. Stan continues to highlight veterans events and issues through his weekly article in the Casper Journal and attends almost every troop homecoming and veterans event. Wyomings veterans have benefitted immensely from Stan Lowes wisdom and leadership. Stan will turn 90 this year. Wyoming continues to look to Stan as the voice for veterans. My wife. Bobbi. and I are happy to have Stan as our friend. and veterans all over Wyoming are fortunate because Stan chose to serve.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the \"Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2013.\" permits a bankruptcy judge to reduce the principal amount of an underwater mortgage to the fair market value of the home. which will encourage homeowners to make their mortgage payments and help stop the endless cycle of foreclosures which further depresses home values. It also authorizes the mortgages repayment period to be extended so that monthly mortgage payments are more affordable. In addition. the bill permits exorbitant mortgage interest rates to be reduced to a level that will keep the mortgage affordable over the longterm. And. it authorizes the waiver of prepayment penalties and excessive fees. Further. the bill would allow hidden fees and unauthorized costs to be eliminated. This bill addresses the fundamental problem with every privatelysponsored and government program that has previously been developed to deal with the home foreclosure crisis. Unlike every other government program. this legislation empowers a homeowner to force the lender to modify the terms of the mortgage by allowing the principal amount of the mortgage to be reduced to the homes fair market value. which numerous economists and housing experts agree is the most effective way to respond to the foreclosure crisis. And. unlike every other government program. the implementation of this measure will not cost taxpayers a single penny. This legislation is identical to H.R. 1587. which was introduced in the 112th Congress. and contains similar provisions included in H.R. 1106. which the House passed nearly three years ago. Unfortunately. those provisions were taken out in the Senate and not included in the final version of the bill that was subsequently enacted into law.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. a bill that would implement the findings of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. Since being elected to the House of Representatives ten years ago. I have introduced a version of this legislation in each Congress. Over the last several Congresses. H.R. 44 passed the House on five separate occasions. This bill would implement the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. which was appointed by Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and established by an Act of the 107th Congress (Public Law 107333). The Review Commission. in a unanimous report to Congress in June 2004. found that there were significant disparities in the treatment of war claims for the people of Guam as compared with war claims for other Americans. The Review Commission also found that the occupation of Guam was especially brutal due to the unfailing loyalty of the people of Guam to the United States of America. The people of Guam were subjected to forced labor. forced marches. internment. beatings. rapes and executions. including public beheadings. The Review Commission recommended that Congress remedy this injustice through the enactment of legislation to authorize payment of claims in amounts specified. Specifically. the bill would authorize discretionary spending to pay claims consistent with the recommendations of the commission. It is important to note that the Review Commission found that the United States Government seized Japanese assets during the war and that the record shows that settlement of claims was meant to be paid from these forfeitures. Furthermore. the United States signed a Treaty of Peace with Japan on September 8. 1951. which precludes Americans from making claims against Japan for war reparations. The treaty closed any legal mechanism for seeking redress from the Government of Japan. and the United States Government has settled claims for U.S. citizens and other nationals through various claims programs authorized by Congress. The text that I introduce in this Congress addresses concerns that have been raised about the legislation. First. the text reflects a compromise that was reached with the Senate when they considered the legislation as a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. That compromise removes payment of claims to heirs of survivors who suffered personal injury during the enemy occupation. The bill continues to provide payment of claims to survivors of the occupation as well as to heirs of citizens of Guam who died during the occupation. The compromise continues to uphold the intent of recognizing the people of Guam for their loyalty to the United States during World War II. Further. the bill that I introduce today contains an offset for the estimated cost of the bill. I understood the concerns express by some of my colleagues in a July 14. 2011 hearing on this legislation. My colleagues expressed concern that there was no offset to pay for the cost of the bill. Guam war claims has a very simple offset that will pay for the cost of the legislation over time. The bill would be paid by section 30 funding remitted to Guam through the U.S. Department of Interior at any level above section 30 funds that were remitted to Guam in fiscal year 2012. With the impending relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam as well as additional Navy and Air Force personnel relocating to Guam it is expected that Guam will receive additional section 30 funds. Claims would then be paid out over time based off the additional amounts that were made available in any given year. Not only does this offset address payment of claims but it only impacts my jurisdiction and is a credible source of funding that will ensure that claims will be paid. Congressional passage of this bill has a direct impact on the future success of the military buildup. The need for Guam War Claims was brought about because of mishandling of war claims immediately following World War II by the Department of the Navy. The longstanding inequity with how Guam was treated for war reparations lingers today. If we do not bring this matter to a close I believe that support for the military buildup will erode and impact the readiness of our forces and the bilateral relationship with Japan. Mr. Speaker. resolving this issue is a matter of justice. This carefully crafted compromise legislation addresses the concerns of the Senate and fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives. This bill represents a unique opportunity to right a wrong because many of the survivors of the occupation are nearing the end of their lives. It is important that the Congress act on the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission to finally resolve this longstanding injustice for the people of Guam.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Joes Stone Crab on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. Established in 1913 by Hungarianborn Joseph \"Joe\" Weiss. Joes Stone Crab has since gone from being a small lunch counter in a quiet. backwater town to a beloved institution in the Miami Beach community. The story of Joes Stone Crab is truly an American one. Joe and his wife Jennie were both Hungarian immigrants living in New York when their son Jesse was born in 1907. At the time. Joe was a waiter and Jennie cooked in small restaurants. Suffering from asthma. Joes doctors told him that a change of climate was the only remedy. According to Jesse. his father borrowed fifty dollars on his life insurance policy and left his family in New York to try his luck in Florida. After one night in Miami. Joe took the ferry boat to Miami Beach. where he was able to breathe. He stayed there and started running a lunch stand at Smiths bathing casino in 1913. serving topnotch fish sandwiches and fries. That was the beginning of the restaurant that would later grow to become Joes. Joe sent for his wife and son to join him in Florida. In 1918. Joe and Jennie bought a bungalow near the casino on Biscayne Street. They moved into the back. set up seven or eight tables on the front porch. and called it Joes Restaurant. Jennie waited on tables. Joe cooked. and everything grew from there. For about eight years. Joes was the only restaurant on the beach. serving snapper. pompano. mackerel. and meat dishes all day long. Joes Restaurant was a hit. but stone crabs were still yet to come. At the time. no one knew that the local crustacean was even edible. In 1921. James Allison. Fishers partner in the Speedway. built an aquarium at the foot of the bay and Fifth Street. He invited a Harvard ichthyologist down to do research. who gave Joe the idea to serve stone crab. After much thought. Joe threw the stone crabs into boiling water and the rest was history. They served them cracked with hash brown potatoes. coleslaw. and mayonnaise. and they became an instant success. Although his parents started Joes. Jesse Weiss became its face and brought in the VIPs. from movie stars to journalists to politicians. athletes. and gangsters. He knew everyone. and everyone who came into Joes wanted to see him. At the age of 75. Miami anchorwoman Ann Bishop spent many hours recording his memories. particularly the love and support of his family in keeping Joes Stone Crab going through the years. Anyone who is anyone. from anywhere in the world. would stop in at Joes if they were in Miami Beach. Notable guests include Al Capone. Will Rogers. Amelia Earhart. the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Gloria Swanson and Joseph Kennedy. J. Edgar Hoover. Walter Winchell. and Damon Runyon. Mr. Speaker. Joes Stone Crab is a monument to the people who built it and those who continue its legacy: Joe and Jennie Weiss. their son Jesse. granddaughter Jo Ann. and the entire Joes family. I have frequented Joes on numerous occasions and always enjoyed a marvelous meal. Please join me in congratulating the entire Joes Stone Crab family on this momentous occasion. I wish them another 100 years of success and. of course. great food and company.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I introduced the Rehab and Ahmed Amer Foster Care Improvement Act of 2013. which is substantively identical to a bill I introduced in the 112th Congress. It will enhance the existing federal policy of encouraging state foster care programs to place children in the care of willing and able relatives. This legislation accomplishes that goal by requiring States that receive federal funding for foster care programs to add certain procedural enhancements to their foster care programs so as to ensure a more fair placement decisionmaking process. Specifically. my bill requires that. within 90 days after a State makes a foster care placement decision. the State must provide notice of such decision to the following affected parties: the childs parents. relatives who have informed the State of their interest in caring for the child. the guardian. the guardian ad litem of the child. the attorney for the child. the attorney for each parent of the child. the prosecutor involved. and the child if he or she is able to express an opinion regarding placement. Additionally. States must establish procedures that: allow any of the parties who receive notice of the States placement decision to request. within five days after receipt of the notice. documentation of the reasons for the States decision. allow the childs attorney to petition the court involved to review the decision. and require the court to commence such review within seven days after receipt of the petition and conduct such review on the record. The harrowing story of Rehab and Ahmed Amer of Dearborn. Michigan prompted me to craft this bill. In 1985. the Amers lost two of their children to Michigans foster care system after Rehab had been subject to criminal charges related to the death of her twoyearold son Samier. who died because of head injuries resulting from a fall in a bathtub. Although Rehab had been acquitted in August 1986 of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Samiers death. the State refused to return the Amers other two children to them and. in fact. removed a third child from the Amers custody four months after Rehabs acquittal. As a temporary alternative. Rehabs brother petitioned to be a foster parent to the Amers three children. but was denied his petition even though he had previously served as a foster parent for other children. It is important to note that the Amers are Muslim. Nevertheless. the State. rather than placing the Amers children with a foster family of the same faith and cultural background. sent them to live with an evangelical Christian family. which renamed the Amers childrenMohamed Ali. Sueheir. and Zinabewith Christian names and raised them as Christians. Today. only the oldest of the Amers three living children. Mohamed Ali. now known as Adam. communicates with them. In reaction to the Amers story. Michigan enacted what became known as the Amer Law. That law requires foster care placement agencies in Michigan to consider and give special preference for relatives when making a foster care placement decision. The Amer Law is consistent with federal foster care policy. which also seeks to give preference to a childs relatives and. for Native American children. a family of the same cultural background as the child. when making placement decisions. The Amer Law. however. has several provisions that go beyond current federal law to ensure due process. In sum. this law gives parents. relatives. guardians. and the child in certain cases additional procedural rights. including the right to written notice and an explanation of a placement decision. In addition. it authorizes judicial review of a placement decision by a foster care agency. My legislation simply adds these enhanced due process features of the Amer Law to existing federal foster care law. The best interests of the child should always be the overriding consideration when making foster care placement decisions. That standard should also require foster care agencies to give special preference to placing a child with relatives. where the child can be raised in the same culture or religion as his or her own. all other things being equal. I thank Rehab and Ahmed Amer for bringing this issue to light and for their tireless efforts to make the foster care placement process fairer for everyone. first in Michigan. and. now. nationally.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to reintroduce legislation that will amend the United States Constitution to force Congress to rein in spending by balancing the federal budget. We have a spending addiction in Washington. D.C.. and it has proven to be an addiction that Congress cannot control on its own and which is bringing dire consequences. We have gone in a few short years from a deficit of billions of dollars to a deficit of trillions of dollars. We are printing money at an unprecedented pace. which presents serious risks of massive inflation. Our national debt recently surpassed an astonishing $16 trillion and continues to rapidly increase. along with the waste associated with paying the interest on that debt. Our first Secretary of State. Thomas Jefferson. warned of the consequences of outofcontrol debt when he wrote: \"To preserve [the] independence [of the people.] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty. or profusion and servitude.\" Unfortunately. it increasingly appears that Congress has chosen the latter path. Our current Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton. issued a similar warning when she recently declared: \"I think that our rising debt levels [sic] poses a national security threat. and it poses a national security threat in two ways. It undermines our capacity to act in our own interest. and it does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable. And it also sends a message of weakness internationally.\" Despite these warnings. Congress has refused to address this crisis. Congress spending addiction is not a partisan one. It reaches across the aisle and afflicts both parties. which is why neither party has been able to master it. We need outside help. We need pressure from outside Congress to force Congress to rein in this outofcontrol behavior. We need a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. That is why I am introducing this legislationa commonsense. 3part balanced budget Constitutional amendment which garnered the support of 133 bipartisan cosponsors last Congress. This bill would (1) amend the Constitution to require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. (2) require that bills to raise revenues pass each House of Congress by a 3/5 majority. and (3) establish an annual spending cap such that total federal spending could not exceed 1/5 of the economic output of the United States. The bill would also require a 3/5 majority vote for any increases in the debt limit. The legislation provides an exception in times of war and during military conflicts that pose imminent and serious military threats to national security. Our federal government must be lean. efficient and responsible with the dollars that our nations citizens worked so hard to earn. We must work to both eliminate every cent of waste and squeeze every cent of value out of each dollar our citizens entrust to us. Families all across our nation understand what it means to make tough decisions each day about what they can and cannot afford and government officials should be required to exercise similar restraint when spending the hardearned dollars of our nations citizens. By amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget. establish measurable spending limits. and make it harder to raise taxes. we can force the Congress to control spending. paving the way for a return to surpluses and ultimately paying down the national debt. rather than allow big spenders to lead us further down the road of chronic deficits and in doing so leave our children and grandchildren saddled with debt that is not their own. 49 out of 50 states have a balanced budget requirement. and it is time that the federal government had one too. Our nation faces many difficult decisions in the coming years. and Congress will face great pressure to spend beyond its means rather than to make the difficult decisions about spending priorities. Unless Congress is forced to make the decisions necessary to create a balanced budget. it will always have the alltootempting option of shirking this responsibility. A Constitutional balanced budget requirement. combined with the spending and tax limitations in this legislation. will set our nations fiscal policies on the right path. This is a common sense approach to ensure that Congress is bound by the same fiscal principles that guide Americas families each day. I urge support of this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout our Nations history. hardworking American men and women have labored to make our businesses become the most productive and dynamic in the world. Unfortunately. when some of these businesses encounter financial difficulties and seek to reorganize their debts under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. these very same workers and retirees are often asked to make major sacrifices through lost job protections. lower wages. and the elimination of hardwon pension and health benefits. while the executives and managers of these business are not required to make comparable sacrifices. Particularly now. as our economy continues to struggle and more businesses falter. we must do more to ensure that Americas most important resourceworkers and retireesare treated more fairly when these businesses seek to reorganize their financial affairs under the protection of our bankruptcy laws. The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2013 accomplishes this goal by amending the Bankruptcy Code in several respects. First. it improves recoveries for employees and retirees by: (1) increasing the amount of worker claims entitled to priority payment for unpaid wages and contributions to employee benefit plans up to $20.000. (2) eliminating the difficult to prove restriction in current law that wage and benefit claims must be earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing in order to be entitled to priority payment. (3) allowing employees to assert claims for losses in certain defined contribution plans when such losses result from employer fraud or breach of fiduciary duty. (4) establishing a new priority administrative expense for workers severance pay. and (5) clarifying that back pay awards for WARN Act damages are entitled to the same priority as back pay for other legal violations. Second. the legislation reduces employees and retirees losses by: (1) restricting the conditions under which collective bargaining agreements and commitments to fund retiree pensions and health benefits may be eliminated or adversely affected. (2) preventing companies from singling out nonmanagement retirees for concessions. (3) requiring a court to consider the impact a bidders offer to purchase a companys assets would have on maintaining existing jobs and preserving retiree pension and health benefits. and (4) clarifying that the principal purpose of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the preservation ofjobs to the maximum extent possible. Third. the bill restricts excessive executive compensation programs by: (1) requiring full disclosure and court approval of executive compensation packages. (2) restricting the payment of bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation to senior officers and others. and (3) ensuring that insiders cannot receive retiree benefits if workers have lost their retirement or health benefits. This legislation is identical to H.R. 6117. which was introduced in the prior Congress. It is supported by the AFLCIO and many of its largest affiliates. and the United Steelworkers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I reintroduced a bill to amend and reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. Conservation of coral reef ecosystems is essential to protect public health. promote environmental sustainability. and ensure longterm economic progress for the jurisdictions we represent in Congress. The sovereign waters of the United States off the coast of Guam. and in the Pacific region as a whole. contain a majority of the shallowwater coral reefs in the United States. as well as some of the worlds greatest coral reef biodiversity. These reefs. and reefs around the world. provide habitat and shelter for fisheries. provide food and recreation for our residents. and are the basis for marine tourism industries. Coral reefs also provide important mitigation from extreme weather events. including hurricanes and typhoons. by absorbing up to 90% of wave energy. mitigating some of the most costly aspects of severe storms. Coastal storms account for 71% of annual disaster losses. Healthy reef systems may protect an estimated $47.000 of property value for every meter of reef during severe weather events. Today. however. various pressures on the worlds reefs threaten to destroy them and the numerous ecosystem services. valued at over $8 billion. which they provide. These threats have led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to propose that 54 species be listed as threatened and 12 species be listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Unless the United States acts in conjunction with the global community to support focused. prolonged action on coral reef education. research. and management. the condition of our coral reefs will continue to degrade. Since its enactment in 2000. the Coral Reef Conservation Act has stimulated a greater commitment to protect. conserve. and restore coral reef resources within jurisdictional waters of the United States. As a result. we now have a much better grasp of the condition of our coral reefs. and more focused management capability than at any time in our history. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization and Enhancement Amendments of 2013 expands emergency response mechanisms. establishes a new communitybased planning grants program. promotes international cooperation. and recognizes the important contributions of the U.S. Department of the Interior in coral reef management and conservation efforts. The bill does not authorize any new funding. This bill would also codify the United States Coral Reef Task Force established in 1998 by President Clinton through Executive Order 13089. The work of the Task Force and its mission to coordinate the efforts of the United States in promoting conservation and the sustainable use of coral reefs internationally is vital to our interests. Since 1998. the Task Force has acted to facilitate and support better management and conservation of coral reef resources at the local level. Many beneficial efforts. such as the development and implementation of local action strategies to address threats to our reefs. are underway thanks to the work of the Task Force and its member agencies. I would like to thank Reps. PIERLUISI. FARR. CHRISTENSEN. and WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for joining me as original cosponsors and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation to enhance our capacity for the conservation and restoration of healthy and diverse coral reef ecosystems.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am pleased to introduce the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2013. This bill would level the playing field between health care professionals and insurance companies in the health care industry and improve the quality of patient care. The Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2013 would eliminate the antitrust immunity provided under the McCarranFerguson Act for price fixing. bid rigging. and market allocation by health insurance issuers or medical malpractice insurers. The bill would also repeal the McCarranFerguson exemption for the business of health insurance and enable enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. The purpose of this bill is to extend antitrust enforcement over health insurers and medical malpractice insurance issuers. which currently enjoy broad antitrust immunity under the McCarranFerguson Act. This immunity can serve as a shield for activities that might otherwise violate federal law. This bill will end the mistake Congress made in 1945 when it added an antitrust exemption for insurance companies into the McCarranFerguson Act. The blanket antitrust exemption created by the 1945 bill has shielded health insurance companies from legal accountability for decades. Our nations antitrust laws exist to protect freemarket competition and this bill will restore competition to the health insurance marketplace. The House Judiciary Committee held extensive hearings on the effects of the insurance industrys antitrust exemption throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. It became clear that the exemption was not needed to enable the insurance industry to provide any service to their policyholders. and that policyholders and the economy in general would benefit from increased competition among insurance providers. I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it would prohibit price fixing. bid rigging. and market allocation. pernicious practices that are detrimental to competition and result in fewer options and higher prices for consumers. The bill I introduce today is intended to root out unlawful activity in an industry that has grown complacent by decades of protection from antitrust oversight. In doing so. we aim to make health insurance more affordable to more Americans.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate our ally and friend. the Republic of slovakia. on her 20th anniversary of independence. In two brief decades. Slovakia has dramatically transitioned to an independent. democratic and economically viable free nation. As some of my colleagues may know. my great grandparents emigrated from Slovakia to the United States at the turn of the last century. Like so many others. my family was drawn to America by the promises of freedom and opportunity. My ancestors would be proud to see both the progress of America over that century and the positive development of the Slovak Republic in its 20 years of independence. For a millennia. the Slovak people were ruled or governed by others. After centuries of power shifts and realignments. in 1989. the Velvet Revolution brought down the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Democracy came to that nation as formerly jailed dissident and political activist Vaclav Havel was elected to the presidency. However. the Slovak peoples yearning for selfgovernance was not realized until 1993. Following the peaceful separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics. January 1. 1993 marks the birth of the Second Slovak Republic. As fate would have it. days later I was sworn in as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. As one of the Members of Congress with Slovak ancestry. I have been proud to work with many who have been so successful in strengthening U.S.-Slovak relations and to aid in the political and economic development of the Slovak Republic. Like any new democracy. the Slovak Republic has experienced some growing pains. After President Michal Kovdcs service as the first president. my good friend and former Kosice Mayor Rudolf Schuster was elected president after a constitutional amendment changed the presidency to a directly elected position. His successor is now President Ivan Gasparovic. I commend these and all the other Slovak leaders who have helped fashion a new era for their people. Even with many difficult challenges as a new nation. the Slovak Republic made outstanding progress over the last 20 years. and I am proud to have played a very small part in its history. In 2000. Slovakia became a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in 2004. joined both NATO and the European Union. The Republic of Slovakia and its people continue to provide international leadership both in Europe and throughout the world. For the United States and the American people. we are fortunate to have such a strong ally and friend in the family of nations. So today we salute and congratulate the Slovak Republic on the special occasion of their 20th anniversary of independence. We wish them every continued future success as they mark this historic milestone. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Slovak Republic and look forward to peace and prosperity for both of our countries for decades to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to reintroduce H.R. 40. the Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for AfricanAmericans Act. Since I first introduced H.R. 40 in 1989. we have made substantial progress in elevating this issue in the national consciousness. Through legislation. state and local resolutions and litigation. we are moving closer to a full dialogue on the role of slavery in building this country. In the 110th Congress. the House passed a slavery apology bill on July 29. 2008. in which the House issued a formal apology for slavery. The Senate followed on July 18. 2009. with the passage of S. Con. Res. 26 which was sponsored by Tom Harkin of Iowa. In recognition of the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade on January 1. 1808. both the House and Senate passed legislation creating a commemoration commission. which was signed into law on February 5. 2008. I believe that such Federal efforts are significant steps toward proper acknowledgment and understanding of slavery and its implications. but our responsibilities on this matter are even greater. The establishment of a commission to study the institution of slavery in the United States. as well as its consequences that reach into modern day society. is our responsibility. This concept of a commission to address historical wrongs is not unprecedented. In fact. in recent Congresses. commission bills have been put forward. In 1983. a Presidential Commission determined that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was racist and inhumane. and as a result. the 1988 Civil Liberties Act provided redress for those injured by the internment. However. the internment of Japanese Latin Americans in the United States during World War II was not examined by the Commission. resulting in legislation calling for a commission to examine this oversight. Legislation establishing a commission to review the injustices suffered by European Americans. European Latin Americans. and Jewish refugees during World War II has also been proposed. H.R. 40 is no different than these other commission bills. H.R. 40 establishes a commission to examine the institution of slavery and its legacy. like racial disparities in education. housing. and healthcare. Following this examination. the commission would recommend appropriate remedies to Congress. As I have indicated before. remedies do not equate to monetary compensation. In the 110th Congress. I convened the first Congressional hearing on H.R. 40. With witnesses that included Professor Charles Ogletree. Episcopal Bishop M. Thomas Shaw. and Detroit City Councilwoman JoAnn Watson. we began a formal dialogue on the legacy of the transatlantic slave trade. This Congress. I look forward to continuing this conversation so that our nation can better understand this part of our history. E1O Attempts to eradicate todays racial discrimination and disparities will be successful when we understand the pasts racial injustices and inequities. A commission can take us into this dark past and bring us into a brighter future. As in years past. I welcome open and constructive discourse on H.R. 40 and the creation of this commission in the 113th Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I reintroduce legislation to strengthen enforcement mechanisms to stop illegal. unreported. and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Illegal fishing threatens the economic and social infrastructure of fishing communities. and the security of the United States and our allies around the world. by decreasing opportunities for legitimate and conscientious fishermen. Guam. and the other Pacific islands. host rich fisheries resources. including pristine reefs. diverse communities of reef fish. and large populations of sharks and valuable tuna. important economic and cultural assets for the islands. IUU fishing threatens these resources. There have been several incidents of foreign fishing vessels operating within the United States EEZ with impunitya significant national security and economic risk to our country. This problem can be particularly acute in places like Guam. where the EEZ is vast. and where the United States Coast Guard. despite its best efforts. has insufficient resources to patrol all of our waters. The United States Pacific lands represent 43% of the EEZ. Our focus should be on the posture of our Coast Guard in the AsiaPacific region. The Navy and Coast Guard have recognized the economic and security threats posed by illegal fishing in Oceania and it is incumbent on the Administration and Congress to put resources towards these requirements. The loss of economic opportunity weakens our allies in the Pacific and strengthens resource conflicts in the region. Recent reports have documented that IUU fishing accounts for between 10 and 22% of the reported global fish catch. or $924 billion in gross revenues each year (MRAG. 2009. Sumaila et al.. 2006 and Agnew et al.. 2009). The Coast Guard estimates that over $1.7 billion is lost annually to IUU fishing in the Pacific Islands. Additional action is needed from Congress if we are to be successful in combating IUU fishing and the depletion of fish stocks worldwide. This bill will help to provide our Coast Guard with the tools to better enforce regulations throughout the sector. The \"Illegal. Unreported. Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2013.\" which I introduced today. further enhances the enforcement authority of NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard to regulate IUU fishing. This bill would amend international and regional fishery management organization (RFMO) agreements to incorporate the civil penalties. permit sanctions. criminal offenses. civil forfeitures and enforcement sections of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. It would strengthen enforcement authority of NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect conveyances. facilities. and records involving the storage. processing. transport and trade of fish and fish products. and to detain fish and fish products for up to five days while an investigation is ongoing. In addition. this bill makes technical adjustments allowing NOAA to more effectively carry out current IUU identification mandates. including extending the duration of time for identification of violators from the preceding two years to the preceding three years. This bill broadens data sharing authority to enable NOAA to share information with foreign governments and clarifies that all information collected may be shared with international organizations and foreign governments for the purpose of conducting enforcement. This bill would also establish an international cooperation and assistance program to provide technical expertise to other nations to help them address IUU fishing. This bill. however. does not authorize new funding or appropriations. The bill is a cost neutral measure that would enhance our nations security. Finally. this bill implements the Antigua Convention. an important international agreement that provides critical updates to the principles. functions. and processes of the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) to manage fisheries in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The Antigua Convention modernizes the IATTC and increases its capacity to combat IUU fishing and illegal imports of tuna product. Without implementing legislation. the U.S. does not have the authorities necessary to satisfy its commitments under the Antigua Convention. including addressing IUU in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Increased enforcement increases stability among our allies in the Western Pacific. Many nations depend upon fishing as a vital component of their national economy. Fishing communities are the lifeblood of Guam. part of a cultural history extending back centuries. Protecting our fishermen from illegal fishing enhances economic opportunities and protects cultural and natural resources that our communities rely upon. IUU fishermen are \"free riders\" who benefit unfairly from the sacrifices made by U.S. fishermen and others for the sake of proper fisheries conservation and management. I would like to thank Reps. MARKEY. SABLAN. PIERLUISI. and CHRISTENSEN for joining me as original cosponsors and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this important bill through the legislative process.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as Congress approached the final hours before going over the socalled \"fiscal cliff.\" the House was faced with a difficult choice. It could amend the controversial Senate plan and return it to them or the House could accept or reject it. Amending the plan was not a viable option because the Senate had refused to consider any changes. Thus it became a \"take it or leave it\" vote. I was elected to come to Washington to reduce the size of government and decrease spending. therefore. I voted against the flawed Senate plan. In summary: although the legislation had certain positive attributes. the principal effect of the bill raised taxes. increased spending and only promised future spending cuts. It failed to address our longterm debt problem and looks nothing like the balanced approach promised by President Obama. America is now burdened with more than $16 trillion of debt. and Congress has failed to cut spending that it promised the public. Lets have a splash of reality: America is facing another $1.2 trillion deficit for this year as it has for the past four years. This solution adopted by Congress not only does not reduce this years deficit. but it adds to it. According to the official estimate by the Congressional Budget Office. the Senate deal includes more than $330 billion in new deficit spending over the next decade. Additionally. the bill calls for $620 billion in increased tax revenues over ten years but incredibly includes only $15 billion in spending reductions. That equates to a ratio of $1 in spending cuts to $41 in increased tax revenue. even though the President promised $2.50 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue during his campaign. The highly touted SimpsonBowles Commission recommended a 3:1 ratio. It should be selfevident that the $60 billion in new revenue annually is woefully insufficient to pay down the deficit. Where will we find the remaining $1.14 trillion to eliminate the deficit? We have a spending problem in Washington. not a taxing problem. I had been willing to support a compromise that included additional. but limited. tax revenue if the plan also had included significant spending reductions and commonsense entitlement reforms. However the bill lacked that balance. These concerns were not limited to conservatives. Senator MICHAEL BENNET (DCO) also opposed the plan on these same grounds. saying. \"We want a plan that materially reduces the deficit. This proposal does not meet that standard and does not put in place a real process to reduce the debt down the road.\" In a similar statement. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke called the current levels of spending \"unsustainable.\" and cautioned that \"fiscal policy must be placed on a sustainable path that eventually results in a stable or declining ratio of federal debt to GDP.\" This plan does nothing to put us on that sustainable path. Americans once again are being promised spending cuts in the future in exchange for immediate increases in taxes. Weve seen this movie beforethe spending cuts unfortunately never happen. This has played out twice with similar results: In 1982. Congress promised President Reagan $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax hikes but the spending cuts never happened. In 1990. President George H.W. Bush reluctantly agreed to $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases but none of those cuts occurred either. Ell The frustration of this process takes its toll. The final bill was presented in the Senate in the early morning hours and hastily cobbled together. Senators had only minutes to review the legislation before voting on it. According to one Senate aide. their office was emailed a copy of the legislation at 1:36 a.m. and the vote began nine minutes later at 1:45 a.m. The Senate obviously was not given sufficient time to read the bill that was over 150 pages long. For the Senate to agree to legislation in the wee hours of the morning without a thorough review is not how the process should work. It reminds me of the quote from NANCY PELOSI during the debate over ObamaCare when she said. \"we have to pass the bill to find out whats in it.\" With more time to review the bill. we found that not only does it increase taxes with almost no spending cuts. but it also includes other questionable provisions such as: $12.1 billion in tax breaks for wind energy. $222 million in loopholes for Puerto Rican rum producers. $248 million in incentives for Hollywood studios. and $62 million in tax breaks for American Samoa businesses. America cant afford this. As my record reflects. I have already voted to extend the Bushera tax rates for all Americans and $5.5 trillion in spending cutsboth of which were opposed by the Senate. I will continue to fight to maintain the lowest tax burden for middle class families and small businesses and work to stop Washingtons addiction to spending. The Senate sent us a bill that contained tax increases. no significant spending cuts. increased the federal debt and then refused to consider any changes from the House. Therefore I had no other recourse but to oppose the final plan. I am hopeful in the coming months we can move past this endofyear mess and turn our attention to stopping outofcontrol spending. Congress needs to address the real problem facing our countryexcessive government spending that will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to reintroduce the John Hope Franklin TulsaGreenwood Riot Accountability Act. This legislation will create a federal cause of action to allow the survivors of the TulsaGreenwood Riot of 1921 to seek a determination on the merits of their civil rights and other claims against the perpetrators of the riot in a federal court of law. This legislation is named in honor of the late Dr. John Hope Franklin. the noted historian. who was a firsthand witness to the destructive impact that the riot had on the AfricanAmerican community of Tulsa. Dr. Franklin made numerous scholarly contributions to the understanding of the long term effects of the riot on the city and worked to keep the issue alive in history and on the minds of policymakers. On April 24. 2007. he served as a witness. testifying in favor of the legislation. and its passage would be a fitting tribute to his memory and to a community that has never received its fair day in court. The Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa. Oklahoma. was one of the Nations most prosperous AfricanAmerican communities entering the decade of the Nineteen Twenties. Serving over 8000 residents. the community boasted two newspapers. over a dozen churches. and hundreds of AfricanAmericanowned businesses. with the commercial district known nationally as the \"Negro Wall Street.\" In May 1921. all that came to an end as 42 square blocks of the community were burned to the ground and up to 300 of its residents were killed by a racist mob. In the wake of the violence. the State and local governments quashed claims for redress and effectively erased the incident from official memory. The 1921 Tulsa Race Riot was one of the most destructive and costly attacks upon an American community in our Nations history. However. no convictions were obtained for the incidents of murder. arson or larceny connected with the riot. and none of the more than 100 contemporaneously filed lawsuits by residents and property owners were successful in recovering damages from insurance companies to assist in the reconstruction of the community. The case of the TulsaGreenwood Riot victims is worthy of congressional attention because substantial evidence suggests that governmental officials deputized and armed the mob and that the National Guard joined in the destruction. The report commissioned by the Oklahoma State Legislature in 1997. and published in 2001. uncovered new information and detailed. for the first time. the extent of the involvement by the State and city government in prosecuting and erasing evidence of the riot. This new evidence was crucial for the formulation of a substantial case. but its timeliness raised issues at law. and resulted in a dismissal on statute of limitation grounds. In dismissing the survivors claims. however. the Court found that extraordinary circumstances might support extending the statute of limitations. but that Congress did not establish rules applicable to the case at bar. With this legislation. we have the opportunity to provide closure for a group of claimantsmany over 100 years oldand to close the book on a tragic chapter in history. Racism. and its violent manifestations. are part of our Nations past that we cannot avoid. With the prosecution of historic civil rights claims. both civil and criminal. we encourage a process of truth and reconciliation that can heal historic wounds. In this case. the Court took \"no great comfort\" in finding that there was no legal avenue through which the plaintiffs could bring their claims. The \"TulsaGreenwood Riot Accountability Act\" would simply give Tulsans and all Oklahomans. white and black. victims and nonvictims. their day in court. Without that opportunity. we will all continue to be victims of our past.",

Minority Whip STENY HOYER of Maryland. to restore the voting rights for the Delegates and Resident Commissioner during Committee of the Whole proceedings. The ability to cast a vote is the most basic of rights in our representative democracy. In the peoples House. votes cast by members of Congress make us accountable to our constituents and allow them to understand where we stand on important issues. The rules that have been adopted by the 113th Congress once again remove voting rights for members from the territories and the District of Columbia and continue to make this body less transparent and less responsive to the more than four million Americans who live in our districts. These votes are wholly symbolicthey cannot change the outcome of legislation or amendments considered on the floor of this House. But these votes allow us to ensure that the needs of our constituents are addressed in legislation considered by this body. Further. many men and women in uniform come from the territories and the District of Columbia. These dedicated servicemembers sacrifice much for our country. and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom. In fact. the per capita death rate for servicemembers from the territories is higher than most states. Unfortunately our majority has determined that despite their service. and the many contributions of the territories and District of Columbia. our constituents will be less represented in the House. Mr. Speaker. giving the Delegates and Resident Commissioner the ability to vote during Committee of the Whole proceedings will allow our voices to be heard during legislation considered by the full House. It will give us parity with other members and strengthen the longcherished values of this body. E12 Thursday. January 3. 2013 Daily Digest",

This storm has left literally millions without power. thousands without homes. and the total area is destroyed. So the piece of legislation before us today is very simple.

Emergency bills like this should not come to the floor without offsets to pay for it or structural reforms to ensure that taxpayer bailouts are never needed again. Regrettably. less than 24 hours into a new Congress. there is simply not time for this. As many in this body know. I have long been critical of the National Flood Insurance Program. For more than four decades. this experiment in governmentprovided flood insurance has proven to be ineffective. inefficient. and indisputably costly to hardworking American taxpayers.

That help is. embarrassingly. overdue. Right now. if we fail to act and do not pass this bill. theres a total of 120.000 flood insurance claim payments that will be delayed and not paid.

This legislation is the first necessary step thats needed to provide the assistance and relief and aid that the people of New York. New Jersey. and Connecticut require after the most devastating storm in the history of our region. in many ways. one of the top two or three. unfortunately. most severe storms in the history of our Nation. This legislation is essential because people are suffering. and the suffering increases each day. And as I said. this is the first major step that were taking. Hopefully. this process will be completed on January 15. I want to thank the leadership of both parties for coming together on this. I want to emphasize that this legislation is vital. This is not a handout. This is not something were looking for as a favor. What were asking for is to be treated the same as victims in all other storms. all other natural disasters have been treated. Also. I think its important to lay out. because this is part of a process. that. in the legislation that was originally going to be introduced in this House. there was never an earmark in the bill. there was never any extraneous spending the bill. I think its important for the Members in both parties to realize that. The House of Representatives bill was always targeted toward victims of Hurricane Sandy. It does not go beyond that. Its important to lay that out. Its also important to realize that. again. as we are talking here today and as the vote goes forward and as we go forward toward January 15. the real suffering is out there. My own neighborhood in Seaford. homes are devastated. Theres a woman who lost two sons in 9/11. She lost her home now. This is a crisis of unimaginable proportions unless youre there. The national media is not following it. but if you went to these homes. if you saw the suffering thats going on. if you saw the people who dont have food and shelter. you would realize how horrible this is.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. Id like to just take 15 seconds to tell Chairman GARRETT how much I appreciate his bringing this bill to the floor today. He and his wife came to my district. He came to Midland Beach and was in one of the homes. several of the homes. that were completely devastated. pulling out moldy sheetrock and bringing a little hope to people in complete despair. For that. I will eternally be grateful. And I really do thank my chairman for that compassion in letting the people. even outside of his own district. know that hes there and he cares about them. I would also like to share with you: I called someone this morning from Staten Island that lives in New Dorp Beach. They have a teenaged son named Dylan. And they havent been back in their home since the storm. And I asked. \"How are your two sons doing?\" And they said. \"They are doing great. but Dylan. he hasnt gone back to the house to help with the construction because he gets choked up.\" And its that that I want to emphasize here. These are human beingshuman beings. childrenthat have been completely displaced. And its up to us to get them back on their feet. So today is one of those steps that Im proud to be a part of and tell Dylan that hes going to be okay. were getting him back in his house. And I would ask that as we go forward with the other parts of Sandy relief that my colleagues will stand with me and tell Dylan that hes going to be okay and were going to get him back in his house. With that. again. I want to thank all of my colleagues across the aisle. Its been a pleasure to work with you. and we have a lot of work to do. And I want to thank Chairman GARRETT one more time. Thank you. Chairman.",

    "speech": "I thank the distinguished. distinguished ranking member. Mr. MEEKS. for your eloquence. as always. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of this legislation. and I would like to thank Chairman GARRETT for introducing this legislation and for his efforts to bring it to the floor with bipartisan support. The National Flood Insurance Program has hit its limit. Without an increase in borrowing authority. it will be unable to pay for claims as early as next week. And that means that 120.000 flood insurance claims payments will be delayed. nearly all of which are due to Hurricane Sandy. However. this bill is just not enough. Its not adequate. In December. the Senate passed an emergency assistance package to aid in the Sandy recovery. which included this legislation. Earlier this week. I expected. as did my colleagues. that the House would vote on a complete emergency assistance package to aid those in Connecticut. New Jersey. and New York who have lost homes. businesses. and their livelihoods. Sadly. the 112th Congress ended without action. and now we are starting over on important legislation which is absolutely critical to help stormaffected areas that should have and could have been signed. We know that theres no reason it wasnt signed in 2012. However. we have now been promised a vote on the Sandy emergency assistance package by January 15. and families in my district and throughout the region are looking to Congress and asking. \"Why are you making it so difficult for us to rebuild? Why are you making us wait to rebuild?\" Todays legislation is a start. but only a first step. toward providing relief for those who suffered as a result of Hurricane Sandy. We dont need a piecemeal approach. That is not the way that Congress acts. We need a comprehensive Sandy recovery bill passed today. We hold you to your commitment of January 15 and not a day later. We need this complete bill.",

Madam Speaker. its been 68 days since Hurricane Sandy devastated the Northeast and over 2 months of suffering for my constituents. While it is unfortunately long overdue. Im pleased that were finally here acting to help the people of New Jersey recover. This hurricane has caused billions of dollars in damage. uprooting individuals and families from their homes. forcing businesses to close and resulting in job loss and revenue loss. My constituents need help now recovering. Ive witnessed firsthand the devastation in places like Seaside Heights. Normandy Beach. Lavallette and Silverton. and I can honestly say that these places look like war zones after the storm. Whole communities have been wiped out. Governor Christie estimated the damage in New Jersey to be over $36 billion. I applaud his swift action on Sandy recovery and join him and all local. State. and Federal leaders in New Jersey to ensure that all relief funds get to New Jersey families and businesses as quickly as possible. This includes adequate funding for the flood insurance program we are voting on today. and I urge passage of this essential legislation.",

    "speech": "You would think. Madam Chair. that were having a Sadie Hawkins dance here today and were patting each other on the back. The real sponsor of this legislation are the people who have been hurt. And lets be honest about it. It took only 10 days after Katrina until President Bush signed $60 billion in Katrina aid passed by the Congress of the United States. How dare you come to this floor and make people think everything is okay. In fact. one of the gentlemen from New Jersey said that weve not waited at all. Well. the insurance runs out in 1 week. What were we going to do. wait for 1 week and then act? We wouldnt even be here. Who the heck are you kidding? So we all come together very nicely this morning for breakfast and eggs. And we know what has happened over the last 10 days. This is a total. total disaster in helping those people that we are pompously saying today and pontificating about were helping them. Isnt that wonderful? What are our jobs? Were not doing anybody favors. Thats why we were sent here. Try it once in a while. Democracyyou may like it. Madam Speaker. its now been 68 days since Hurricane Sandy landed. By the time the rest of the $60 billion in aid requested by Govs. Christie and Cuomo comes up for a vote. as the Speaker has promised. on Jan. 15th. it will be nearly 80. Who knows how much longer after that until the new Senate gives their approval? $60 billion in Katrina aid was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush just 10 days after that storm. Why is there a double standard? People in New Jersey. in my district. are suffering and they cannot afford to wait a day longer for the aid that they are entitled to as taxpayers of this nation? If we had just voted on Wednesday. it could already be on the way. Im pleased that today we are approving more funding for the National Flood Insurance Program. which is going to run dry within a week. but we need to approve the rest of this aid as soon as possible. To not do so would be cruel and unconscionable. But this is only the beginning of rebuilding the most important economic region of our country. Two weeks after Katrina. this House passed a serious tax relief measure dedicated to helping those that our disaster aid programs cannot reach. on a voice vote. I and many bipartisan cosponsors. introduced similar measure in the last Congress. I call upon the Speaker to bring this legislation up for a vote as soon as possible. There are thousands of individuals. small businesses. municipalities and utilities that need our help to rebuild. and its our responsibility to deliver.",

    "speech": "I want to thank the chairman for recognizing me. I just want to say that I support this bill not because I support the increased borrowing that we are doing for our flood insurance program of $9.7 billion. but it is a contractual agreement that we owe to these policyholders to pay these claims. Its not their fault that we in the government are not good managers of our money. In 1968. when this policy and this program was put into place. it had a borrowing authority of $1.5 billion. It wasnt until Katrina that we raised that borrowing authority up to $20 billion. We still owe $20 billion. Were now raising that borrowing authority to $30 billion. In 2017. which is 412 years away. the borrowing authority goes back to $1.5 billion. Now Im sure well address that at 11:59 on September 30 of 2017. But Id like to ask both sides. on both sides of the aisle. lets start working on that now. This cost to the government is $17.063 for every policyholder who has flood insurance. The average premium is about $600. We have paid people 10 and 20 and 30 times for claims that live in the same house in the same floodplain. I had an amendment to the flood insurance bill that said if you had two claims due to flood and you did not take the payout. then you would have to pay a ratebased premium. It didnt pass. Weve got to get into reality what this flood insurance program is for. Its mandatory. If you have a governmentbacked loan and you live in a floodplain thats likely to flood in 100 years. you have to have the insurance.",

Of course. the Constitution says the other body has to vote too. They have to start all over again. and then the President has to sign the bill. It is my strong hope that the leadership between now and January 15 will reach out to the leadership of the other body and try to prenegotiate a bill that the Senate would quickly and expeditiously take up so we can solve this problem.

We lost thousands and thousands and thousands from hurricanes. Hurricane Ike saw this Congress give us $3 billion. I stand here today to remind you that a police officer died. a 13yearold died from debris falling on her. and a mother saw her two children drawn from her hands and drowned in Hurricane Sandy. It is long overdue. I stand here as someone who has been a beneficiary. who has cried with those who have lost. I demand that this money be passed today. but more importantly. I demand that we pass the total amount of money right now. today. Lets help the American people. Lets help those impacted by Sandy. Lets help my fellow Americans. Madam Speaker. I rise today to support H.R. 41. \"To Temporarily Increase The Borrowing Authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for Carrying Out National Flood Insurance Program.\" I urge this new 113th Congress to start the New Year off right by acting swiftly in support of legislation to fund disaster relief assistance for the victims of Superstorm Sandy. Since this historic storm devastated the east coast in late October. the people impacted by the storm. particularly those in the TriState area of New Jersey. New York. and Connecticut. have been waiting patiently for the federal government to act as they continue to engage in efforts to rebuild their communities. However. the time for patience has long since expired. and these Americans can no longer wait for Congress to act. 68 days have passed since the storm surged onto the shores of Atlantic City. New Jersey. It has been a long 67 days for families without a home. and for businesses without a storefront or customers. For 67 days. these neighborhoods have struggled to pick up the pieces and put their communities back together. and Congress must step inimmediatelyto lend a helping hand. As the representative for the 18th District in Texas. I know the massive and protracted destruction that storms like this can cause both to property and. more importantly. to the lives of citizens who are left to rebuild their lives and restore all that they have lost. After the initial disaster response and search and rescue phases. we must begin to rebuild. a process that calls for a longterm commitment from officials in state. local. and federal government. We can all recall Hurricane Ike in 2008. which heavily impacted many constituents in my district. At least 74 people lost their lives in the State of Texas. with 28 in Harris County and 17 in Galveston. Over 200.000 homes in the HoustonGalveston region were left damaged or destroyed as a result of Ike. Congress appropriated $3 billion to Texas to help finance the infrastructure and housing recovery. which included individual and household assistance. disaster unemployment assistance. public assistance grants to state and local government and nonprofit organizations to pay for debris removal. emergency protective measures and road repairs. and lowinterest disaster loans provided by the Small Business Administration. My visits to the affected areas fundamentally evidenced the need for longterm recovery and to get people back on their feet. My constituents and others in the affected areas needed and greatly appreciated the federal assistance they received. and so now that Americans in other parts of our nation need our help. we must move in a bipartisan fashion to provide it. As a nation. we continue to mourn the loss of at least 125 people in the United States and a total of 253 people due to Superstorm Sandy (60 in New York. 48 New York City. 34 in New Jersey. 16 in Pennsylvania. 7 in West Virginia). As devastating as Hurricane Ike was. the damage to property it caused (an estimated $29.5 billion) the costs associated with Superstorm Sandy are expected to be significantly higher. While we do not yet know the final numbers. the total amount of property damage resulting from Superstorm Sandy exceeds $62 billion. In terms of dollars of property destruction. this ranks Superstorm Sandy second only to Hurricane Katrina ($128 billion. adjusted for inflation)(note: Hurricane Ike ranks 3rd). Food. shelter and clothing are basic necessities. and right now far too many people are without access to them during these holidays and in brutally cold weather. With more cold weather in sight. things are not going to get any easier for residents of those communities. Economic conditions in many affected communities are stagnant. stalled because the federal government has yet to provide funding. It took 10 days for Congress to approve roughly $50 billion in aid for Katrina. but Congress has not provided aid for those affected by Sandy for more than two months. We need to restore a sense of calm and stability in the lives of people affected by Superstorm Sandy. We need to ensure that small businesses in the affected areas are able to rebound as expeditiously as possible so that they can get the local economies moving again. I am encouraged that relief for Superstorm Sandy has received bipartisan support. but now we must follow through with action. We know that disasters affect all of us at one point or another. and we must come together as one nation to give people access to relief that. realistically. only the federal government can provide. However. this should have been done no less than 5 days after the horrible Hurricane Sandynow we are only during half waylets vote today on the full 60 billion dollars in relief today. Lets not watch people died and people are suffering after hurricane! We can not wait until January 15. 2013now is the time to help the people suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.",

For those of us who live in the affected area. our heart goes out to the familiesthe moms. the dads. the little children. the senior citizenswho have lost everything: homes that have just been inundated with water so theyre not recognizable anymore. homes that have to be totally knocked down or homes that have to be totally refurbished. stripped down to their studs and started from the foundations back up again to rebuild them. homes that have been simply washed out to sea and will never be seen again. homes that have been destroyed. trees that have crashed through homes. electricity that has been out for weeks. Our heart goes out to the people who have suffered so much and for so long and who continue to suffer. I commend Members from both sides of the aisle for coming to the floor today to support this legislation. I also thank those people. the volunteers. who took it upon themselves without any government mandate or edict or pay. or what have you. to go out and to rescue these people and to work for these people day in and day outfrom the very beginning. the OEM people. the management people. the fire department. the rescue squad. and just rankandfile folks who came out and tried to help and continue to do so. Theyve run the food banks. groups liked Samaritans Purse. Theyve been out there on the front lines and have supported these people in their hours of need. And I extend an invitation to every single Member of Congress who has come to the floor and said that they. too. support these people. to put on their work shoes and their work boots and their jackets and to get out of this Congress and to get out of this city and to go into the affected area. and not just give speeches and not just pass legislation of other peoples money. but to actually come to our State and to join us in the field and actually do the work thats necessary to get done. And so I extend that invitation to each and every one. and I look forward to hearing from each and every one of you. and I ask for your support of this legislation. I extend an invitation to Ms. WATERS to work further on the legislation with regard to flood insurance because we heard the number earlierthis is a nonsustainable program. Were taking in something like 75 cents and were paying out about a buck in claims. That cant go on. We need to work together on this. and I look forward to that. and I look for a \"yes\" vote on this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.",

FEMA announced yesterday that its ability to pay claims under the National Flood Insurance Program would be exhausted by the second week of January. Congress must act now to approve additional borrowing authority and bring muchneeded relief to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have suffered in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy floodrelated damages to their homes and property. While I strongly support passage of H.R. 41. I want to reiterate that our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Sandy have already waited far too long for help from Congress. In other natural disasters. such as Hurricane Katrina. Congress acted swiftly. and aid reached those in need. And yet earlier this week. the 112th Congress adjourned before passing a muchneeded disaster relief package. The Senate had already acted to pass a wellconstructed aid package bill. The only reason that this bill is not law today is that House leadership refused to act. This devastating storm has left many people hurting in many different waysshopkeepers. homeowners. fisherman. hotel and restaurant ownersand has damaged the entire economy. The Senatepassed Sandy relief package responds to this variety of needs and concerns. I urge Speaker BOEHNER to bring the Senate disaster relief package to the floor without delay.",

I rise today to ask all of my colleagues to support H.R. 41. a bipartisan proposal to replenish the National Flood Insurance Fund which will increase its borrowing authority and allow the program to continue paying claims from those affected by Hurricane Sandy. Without the enactment of this bill. the NFIP might reach its ceiling and could no longer pay out claims. The families in my district and the States of New York. New Jersey and Connecticut are suffering. Even as I am excited that we are considering this bill today. I am disappointed that there were seventy days of inaction by Congress. Congress has a history of providing assistance to the American people in times of disaster and devastationin this country. we help our neighbors. Since 1989. Congress has approved $290 billion in disaster relief aid. Indeed. only two weeks after Hurricane Katrina devastated parts of the Gulf Coast. Congress appropriated $62 billion in disaster aid. Those impacted by Superstorm Sandy have been waiting for more than two months. and cannot afford to wait any longer. The recovery depends on this emergency funding. Again. I ask that all of my colleagues support the first portion of the Superstorm Sandy Disaster Relief package. Through enactment of this critical bill. many home and business owners flooded out by Superstorm Sandy will soon be able to get flood insurance payments.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of HR 41. a measure to increase by $9.7 billion the borrowing authority of the National Flood Insurance Program. enabling the program to continue paying the tens of thousands of claims related to the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy. Across this country from the Appalachians to the Great Lakes to northern coast of Maine. dozens of people have lost their lives. the homes of thousands of families were destroyed and millions of people have suffered from the cold and exposure of winter because they lost power. The suffering touched the people of my state of Maryland as wellhitting hardest the county of Somerset. where the poverty rate is among the highest in the State and where more than 500 homes were affected by the storm. After more than two months of waiting. it is only now that the House has chosen to act. And by only considering a bill to increase the Flood Insurance Programs borrowing authority by $9.7 billion. we are only making a down payment on the problem. There are estimates that the full cost of recovery will be more than $60 billion. I had hoped that we would have voted for a relief package during the last Congress. But it is only now that the House Leadership is bringing Sandy legislation to the floor. In the meantime. the people affected by the hurricane have had to wait and will continue waiting as the Senate passes what we pass here today. Delaying for months the aid for the victims of Hurricane Sandy is unjust and I am disappointed that we are not meeting today to consider a bill to address the full cost of the Hurricanes destruction. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the swift passage of this bill so that those suffering around the country can get the relief they so desperately need. I also hope the Republican leadership follows through on its promise to consider additional legislation on this subject when the Congress reconvenes later this month.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the legislation we are about to vote on that will provide an additional $9.7 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. Without these funds. the program would have run out of money next week. leaving over 100.000 victims of Hurricane Sandy in the lurch. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing this vote to go forward. They have acted honorably. The good news is the House passed this bill this morning and the Senate will pass it in a few minutes. With the passage of this bill. hurricane victims from Staten Island to east Long Island. as well as in New Jersey. can rest assured their flood insurance will have enough money to pay out claims. We had no choice but to pass this provision because the Federal Government is obligated to reimburse when people have floods if they have paid in their flood insurance. While this bill is important. it is something we were almost obligated to do. and we should not have parades down the street because this bill has passed. The major work of helping the victims of Sandy is still ahead of us. The bad news is we even had to go through this dogandpony show in the first place. Last month. the Senate passed a good. strong bill to help all victims of Hurricane Sandy. and the House simply could have taken it up and passed it. In fact. they promised to vote on a similar provision before the last Congress ended. Unfortunately. this changed at the last moment. We do not need to get into the whys right now. we just want it to happen. and we are worried the second major portion of this relief bill will not get through the House in the form it should. We need the House to pass not only the $9 billion they passed this morning but the $51 billion that contains the bulk of the aid people need. without which we will not be able to recover. To be a bride and left at the altar once is bad enough. To be left twice would be unconscionable. As I said. this is a good step that we are going to pass this $9 billion flood insurance bill. This is a good but small first step. It is a small downpayment on the much larger amount of aid we need to get through Congress. Let me tell you what is not in this bill. What is not in this bill is help for every homeowner who does not have flood insurance and lost their home or suffered major damage. Homeowners are waiting for Congress to pass relief the way we did for Irene and Katrina and so many other disasters so they can get a contractor to sign a contract. get a bank to make a loan until they know that the Federal Government will be there to reimburse. as it always has in the past. What is not in this bill is aid to small businesses. small businesspeople who are hanging by their fingernails. who might not be able to restart their businesses unless there is Federal aid. which was already in the Senate bill. Unless it comes back from the House and we are able to pass it in the Senate. they will be hurt. What is not in this bill is dollars to rebuild our highways and. most importantly. our mass transit systems that were flood. damaged. The MTA alone has taken out a $5 billion loan. but it will be in real financial jeopardy unless it is assured that it will be reimbursed for all the damage that Sandy caused to our railroads and our tunnels and our mass transit systemour amazing mass transit system that brings 31/2 million people off and on Manhattan Island every single day. What is not in this bill is help to bring the electricity system back up to snuff so there will not be major blackouts. so people can be assured of their electricity. What is not in this bill is help for all of the communities that laid out hundreds of millions and billions of dollars for the cleanup. Their taxpayers will foot the bill unless Congress does what it has always done: step to the plate when a major disaster occurs and have the Federal Government help the locality. There has been a wisdom for 100 years that when an area is afflicted by a disaster. we unite as a nation and come together and help that part of the country whether it is New Mexico or California or Louisiana or Florida or Missouri or North Dakota or New York or New Jersey. This bill is a first step to deal with flood insurance. It is the easiest part. The hard stuff is still ahead of us. We await the House returning in a week and a half. and we hope and expect. in fact. that they will vote the full $51 billion remainder. We hope and expect. in fact. that they will not put in legislative language that prevents money from getting to homeowners and communities that need it desperately right away. The draft we have seen contains some major changes from the Senate bill that would make it very difficult for NIH. the Army Corps. and other parts of the government to spend the dollars that are needed efficiently and quickly and to place them where they go. We beseech the House to finish its business. to finish the major part of its business. and approve the $51 billion that will make up the rest of the $60. We beseech them not to hamstring the local homeowners and businesses and governments with language that would prevent recovery. We beseech them to move quickly. Of course. the ideal would be for them to pass the same bill that the Senate passed in the waning hours of the last session. If they cannot. we will have to get legislation through the body again. But through the generosity of the majority leader. he has assured us it will be the first order of business when we return. So we have to move forward. As we have seen. this is not going to be easy. There are many bumps in the road and obstacles that we cannot yet see. For sure they will arise and for sure we will have to grapple with them. This vote needs to be the beginning of the process. It cannot certainly be the end. and it certainly cannot be the middle. We cannot just pass the $9 billion bill and then say that is it. We cannot let the House pass this and rest on its laurels. We in New York and New Jersey cannot let our guard down. Not until the full $60 billion arrives in New York and New Jersey can we stop working. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and then alert them to keep the victims of Sandy in New York. New Jersey. and elsewhere in their thoughts so that we can continue to support the region when we return. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I have learned over the years there is nothing more important than people working hard. You have to be tenacious to get legislation passed. The leader of passing Sandy over hereand I am confident when we get back in a couple of weeks after the House works on theirs. the same dynamic will be herethe senior Senator from New York has worked tirelessly to get legislation passed. He has led a team effort of Senators from New Jersey and his partner. Senator GILLIBRAND. but the leader. the quarterback. has been the Senator from New York. The work he has done not only in the Senate. but having the many years of experience he had in the House of Representatives. the Presiding Officer. the senior Senator from New York. worked day and night making phone calls. personal contacts with people in New York and New Jersey who could call House Members and have them pass this legislation. On the way back from the joint session dealing with the electoral vote count. he walked up and grabbed medid not grab me. but we talked for several minutes walking back to the Senatethe majority leader from the House of Representatives. He worked extremely hard on this. He worked hard on it. I indicated to him that I had received calls from people in New York who appreciated very much his efforts to try to get this thing passed. I really do believe it is important that I have the record reflect the reason we have gotten as far as we have on Sandy is because of the senior Senator from New York. It is too bad that it has taken so long. When we had that devastation from Katrina. we were there within days taking care of Mississippi. Alabama. and especially Louisianawithin days. We are now past 2 months with the people of New York and New Jersey. The people of New Orleans and that area. they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New Jersey. Almost 1 million people have lost their homes. 1 million people lost their homes. That is homes. that is not people in those homes. So I think it is just unfortunate that we do not have the relief for New York and New Jersey and the rest already. It has to be done. We have to meet the needs of the American people when an act of God occurs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today marks my 28th time here on the Senate floor to talk about the Production Tax Credit for wind energy. Twentyseven other times I stood hereoftentimes joined by likeminded colleagues from around the countryto urge Congress to extend this vital tax credit. which has helped the wind industry create tens of thousands of jobs and spur tens of billions of dollars in investment. And Coloradans have been with me the whole way. Well. Mr. President. 27 must be a lucky numberbecause today. I am thrilled to use my time to thank my colleagues for making the extension of the PTC a reality. Earlier this week. Congress came together across party lines to do the right thing to assist our fragile economic recovery. Throughout my previous efforts here on the floor. I talked a lot about jobs. From Colorado to Kansas. Oregon and Maine and the Carolinas. my remarks always came back to one simple but true statement: the PTC equals jobs. These are goodpaying jobs for hardworking Americans. From gearboxes in Georgia to wind blades in Rhode Island to towers in Colorado. the construction of wind turbines has invigorated an entire supply chain. Factories in the Midwest have been retooled to make steel components that are shipped to places like Iowa. where cutting edge composite materials are used to make state of the art blades for turbines that ultimately create wind farms built with labor from local construction workers. Thats thousands of jobs across this country. Wind generates clean. renewable energy. which helps move our country toward a more secure energy future. This is clean. American energy that does not produce carbon dioxide pollutionand by making it here at home. it helps us become less reliant on foreign nations for our energy security. These wind farms are also paying dividends to towns and counties across America. benefitting the families who live there and the small businesses that operate there. The tax revenues from wind turbines have allowed communities to build new schools and roads. as well as provide other basic services. These additional sources of income have been especially important during the recent economic downturn. where the budgets of many states and rural communities have been stretched thin. Quite simply. wind energy jobs have a positive ripple effect wherever they are. I am relieved that after months of uncertainty as to whether or not the PTC would be extended. Congress has finally done the commonsense thing. making sure we did not lose this vital tax credit. Although it was my preference to have Congress act much sooner and prevent the thousands of layoffs that resulted from the uncertainty Congress created. I am pleased that we have finally acted for the good of our constituents. With the passage of the PTC. the wind industry can get back to doing the important work of moving America toward a clean energy future. a direction that will benefit middleclass American workers and ensure America leads the world in clean energy manufacturing. even as foreign competitors like China work to surpass us. And the final language passed by Congress will have an immediate and positive impact on the construction of new wind farms. This year. projects will be eligible to take advantage of the PTC if construction begins before the end of 2013. rather than racing to complete the project by the end of the year. This commonsense change in the law will encourage larger. longerterm projects over the course of the next few years as opposed to just in 2013. which is particularly important since Congress did not pass the extension until the very last minute. I was not alone in this fight. Coloradans motivated me to keep up the battle the entire time. And many of my colleaguesboth Republicans and Democratsjoined me. In particular. I would like to thank Senator GRASSLEY of Iowathe \"father of the wind PTC\"-for his efforts to get this done. Senator BAUCUS and Senator BINGAMAN have also been longtime champions of the PTC on the Finance Committee. and were an integral part of the fight to extend it. My good friend and colleague from Colorado Senator BENNET has also been a strong supporter of the PTC. joining me in speeches. letters. and legislation. Senator MORAN of Kansas has been right there with us as well. And many more members from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol supported these efforts. The broadly bipartisan and bicameral group was driven by a mutual commitment to creating jobs. simultaneously improving our economy and economic competitiveness while moving us toward a more secure energy future. Despite the importance of the wind PTC extension. there is still much more work to do. This extension only lasts until the end of 2013. So. although we might want to take a breather. we cannot. Instead. we must begin work today on a path forward that will give the wind industry muchneeded certainty over the long term. Without certainty. businesses cannot do the longterm planning that is necessary to robustly grow and add goodpaying American jobs. And. this time. we cannot wait until the last minute to do it. We must work together to find a plan that allows this industry to reach maturity and thrive while also being fiscally responsible. Yes. that means a gradual phaseout of the wind PTC in the coming yearsbut my goal is to get Congress to also work together on comprehensive energy legislation that creates longterm certainty for all energy sources. I strongly believe that any national energy policy we develop should reflect the success Colorado has had as an alloftheabove energy State. Again. I want to thank my colleagues who worked alongside me to push the wind PTC extension over the finish line. This is hugely important to maintaining American jobs. manufacturing prowess. and energy security. Its a win for Colorado and its a win for us all.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to talk about the dysfunction of the Senate. the rules of this governing body. and what we need to do to change them in order to take on the big challenges we face as a Nation. These last 2 years have created an unprecedented sense among the American people that Congress isnt measuring up to the needs of our time. This is especially troubling when we are up against tremendous challenges: the most profound jobs crisis in a generation. skyrocketing income inequality. and a tax system that unfairly rewards the wealthy and wellconnected over working Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. But unfortunately. we cant tackle this jobs crisis or the problem of inequality until this body. our revered Senate. restores the ability to debate. deliberate and decide on strategies to take our Nation forward. I believe that reforming the filibuster is one of the most critical steps we can take to repair the Senate and rebuild confidence in Congresss ability to govern. When I first came to the Senate. it was 1976. What I saw then could hardly have been farther from the Senate of today. Routine use of the \"filibuster\"or to put it differently. a routine use of an objection to a simple majority votehas turned the U.S. Senate into a supermajority body. In short. the U.S. Senate. which once claimed to be \"the worlds greatest deliberative body.\" has possibly become \"the worlds least deliberative body.\" The institution of the Senate will not function again until we end the abuse of the filibuster. We must put an end to the silent. secret filibuster that is paralyzing the Senate. The use of this objection has expanded dramatically in recent decades. What was once used only to block legislation that conflicted with deep. personal principles is now used as a routine political strategy for deliberate paralysis. In the 6 years Lyndon Baines Johnson was majority leader. he dealt with one filibuster. Leader REID during his 6 years as majority leader: 391. One casualty of the partisan filibuster is executive branch and judicial nominations. The Senates power to advise and consent. as provided in the Constitution. was never intended to enable the legislators to inflict deep harm on the other branches of government. Yet that is exactly what has happened. Nearly one out of every eleven judgeships is vacanttriple the rate of 8 years ago. Our court systems are severely strained. with 27 vacancies rated as \"judicial emergencies\" at the end of 2012. This is deeply damaging. for several reasons. It prevents the legislature from responding to the Nations pressing problems and severely hampers the executive and judicial branches. which rely on the Senate to confirm their leaders. Because the Senate is unable to fulfill. on a timely basis. its constitutional responsibility to \"advise and consent\" to nominations. judgeships and executive branch management positions simply go unfilled. Now. you may wonder. if this system is so dysfunctional. why did our Founding Fathers ever design the Senate like this? The answer is that they didnt. The Founders envisioned the Senate and House passing legislation and confirming nominations by a simple majority. reserving supermajority for special purposes such as constitutional amendments and overriding a veto. Alexander Hamilton. in fact. foresaw the current state of affairs in the Federalist Papers. observing that a supermajority requirement would have the \"tendency to embarrass the operations of government.\" and would create \"tedious delays. continual negotiation and intrigue. [and] contemptible compromises of the public good.\" As a result of the Senates silent filibuster. the Senate failed to pass almost all of the appropriations bills in the last Congress. The number of bills the Senate passes has hit new lows. with fewer than 3 percent of bills introduced in the last Senate ever passing. That is why yesterday. with my partner. Senator TOM UDALL. I introduced a resolution that will enhance debate and limit obstruction. Core to these reforms is the \"talking filibuster.\" A Senator can still object but she or he must be continuously on the floor maintaining a debate on the subject. This still allows Senators to block a simple majority vote on a bill of profound consequence. but they have to spend a lot of time and energy to do so. This reform would have two major consequences. By requiring time and energy to filibuster. it would strip away filibusters on noncontroversial issues that are currently used just to obstruct and delay. allowing the Senate to debate and decide issues. Second. it puts the filibuster on display before the American people. increasing transparency and accountability. If you filibuster. you must make your case before your colleagues and the public. so they know who is obstructing and what your arguments are. and allow the people to judge if you are a hero or a bum. Senate dysfunction is compromising the Senates ability to respond to major issues facing our Nation. I want to thank Leader REID for reserving the right to not adopt the rules of the previous Congress. so we can have this important debate on the rules of this body when we come back from the State work period.",

It is a day that we set aside to remember. and express our gratitude to. the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. It is a day to honor the heroes among us. and those who. sadly. have left us. Today I wish to pay tribute to an American hero. Army SGT Clinton K. Ruiz. Sergeant Ruiz died on October 25 while on patrol in Uruzgan Province. Afghanistan. from injuries sustained from small arms fire. He was just 22 years old. He leaves behind a wife. Kira. and a baby son. Caleb. As we face the tragedy of this brave young soldiers death. it is important too that we remember his life. Sergeant Ruizs journey on this Earth ended far too soon. but his memory among those whose lives he touched. and in a nations gratitude. will endure. Clinton Ruiz was born on March 14. 1990. He graduated from Murrieta Valley High School in Murrieta. CA. and enlisted with the Army in 2009. He was assigned to A Company. 9th Military Information Support Battalion. 8th Military Information Support Group. Sergeant Ruiz was deployed to Afghanistan in September. In the decade that our military has been fighting in Afghanistan. thousands of our fellow citizens have volunteered to serve. These courageous men and women risk their own safety to protect the safety of others. They leave their homes and their loved ones to defend the freedoms that we hold dear. Over 2.000 of these heroes have paid the ultimate price. for our freedoms. in Afghanistan. Words cannot lessen the sorrow of the loved ones who grieve for Sergeant Ruiz now. Words cannot fully express the gratitude our Nation owes this valiant soldier. We can only remember. indeed we must never forget. the sacrifice that SGT Clinton Ruiz made in service to our country. President Kennedy said that \"stories of past courage . . . can teach. they can offer hope. they can provide inspiration. But. they cannot supply courage itself. For this. each man must look into his own soul.\" Sergeant Clinton Ruiz had such courage. In the face of great danger. at great risk to himself. he went where his country sent him. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He kept the promise he had made to serve. Our Nation is forever in his debt. Sergeant Ruiz loved his family. He loved his country. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending it. To Sergeant Ruizs family. I offer my deepest sympathies. We honor Sergeant Ruizs courage. We remember his sacrifice. And we mourn your loss.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Ben Eiseman. a worldrenowned surgeon. a true American and a great friend of mine. Dr. Eiseman was an accomplished man in every sense of the word and is survived by his wife of 67 years. his four children and five grandchildren. Dr. Eiseman was an incredibly intelligent individual and an avid selflearner. He graduated from Yale University in 1939 and went on to receive his Medical Degree from Harvard University in 1943. Dr. Eiseman possessed extraordinary scientific ingenuity that led him to discover an astonishing number of medical complications and cures. In addition to these discoveries. Dr. Eiseman also authored and coauthored over 450 scientific papers. was principal editor of seven books on general surgery and was a retired Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy Reserveshe was very proud of his service to his country. Whenever I mentioned Dr. Eiseman to other surgeons. whether they live in another State or another country. he or she would instantly know his name. I worked with Dr. Eiseman during my time as Executive Director of the Colorado Outward Bound School. At that time he was chairman of the Board of Trustees. and he was a major influence in my life. an incredible friend. and a wise mentor. One of the reasons Dr. Eiseman and I were so close had much to do with our shared love for the great outdoors. He was one of the few people I knew who had climbed all of the mountains in Colorado over 14.000 feet. I recall a time almost three decades agowhile I was still with Outward Boundwhen Dr. Eiseman accompanied me on a winter climbing trip for advanced climbers. He was always asking us to think through each and every step. In asking the right questions and challenging us along the way. he made me a stronger leader. One reason we all respected Dr. Eiseman was because we all admired his unassuming ruggedness. On this trip. where it was at least 10 degrees below zero. none of us were surprised as Dr. Eiseman walked around comfortably in his Converse hightops while the rest of us muddled around. freezing in our hightech. insulated boots. When it was time to rest for the night. most of the team rolled out their latest and greatest sleeping bags. while Dr. Eiseman pulled out the equivalent of a lawn chair cushion to curl up on for the night. Always the task master. Dr. Eiseman was the first one up in the morning to make sure that everyone. including myself. was thoroughly prepared to take on whatever was in store for us each day. It was just the way he was tough. rugged and focused. Dr. Eiseman inspired me by the way he commanded respect from all who interacted with him. Sure. he was seen as intimidating by some. but for those who knew him. they were treated to his wonderful sense of humor. He was a dedicated community leader. outdoorsman. and patriot. I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Ben Eiseman. but I know that his work here on this Earth changed the lives of thousands and that his legacy will not be forgotten. May his memory live on for years to come.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. just a few weeks ago our Nation commemorated Veterans Day. It is above all a day of remembrance and gratitude. A time to remember the courage and sacrifice of the brave men and women who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces. It is a day when we pay tribute to the heroes among us. And to those who are no longer with us. Today I wish to honor one of those heroes. On Tuesday. October 30. our Nation lost a great American. Navajo Code Talker George Smith. Mr. Smith was born on June 15. 1922. in Mariano Lake. NM. and was Salt People Clan. born for Black Streak Wood People Clan. In 1943. he enlisted with the Marines. He was trained as a Navajo Code Talker and achieved the rank of corporal while serving in the Pacific. Corporal Smith fought in battles in Saipan. Tinian. Ryukyu Islands. He also served in Okinawa. Hawaii. and Japan. His brother. Albert Smith. also trained as a Code Talker. and served with him. The Marines who constituted the Navajo Code Talkers were small in number. but monumental in significance. Their skills were crucial to American victory in the Pacific during World War II. They turned their language into an unbreakable code. In battle after battle. in the thick of ferocious combat. they used that code as a powerful weapon in securing Allied victory. Our Nation will never forget what George Smith. and his brother. Albert Smith. and all of their fellow Code Talkers accomplished. Their service is all the more poignant in that they fought for freedom in a world that did not always accord freedom to them. When America entered World War II. the U.S. government had only recognized Native Americans as citizens for 17 years. In some places. tribal members still did not have the right to vote. 45.000 of the 350.000 Native Americans in the U.S. at that time served in the war. This tradition of military service by Native Americans continues to this day. Native Americans have the highest rate of service of any ethnic group. Mr. Smith was awarded the Congressional Silver Medal. After the war. Code Talker Smith returned home and dedicated himself to his family and community. He worked at Fort Wingate in disposing of old ammunition. and then as a mechanic at Fort Wingate Trading Post. Eventually. he went to Fort Defiance. where he served as a shop foreman. He later worked as a heavy equipment mechanic in Shiprock. Code Talker George Smith was blessed with a long life. When he passed away last month. he was 90 years old. He will be missed by his family. his friends. and his community. and he will always be remembered by a grateful nation. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. We are forever in his debt. I hope that those who mourn him now will find comfort in all that he accomplished. His life made a difference. His invaluable service during World War II saved lives. Our Nation is free because of heroes like Code Talker George Smith.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in the annals of our Nations military history. the story of the defenders of Bataan will long live in our collective memory. One of those great defenders. Mr. Virgil Wallace. recently passed away at the age of 99. Mr. Wallace survived the 4 month battle. the infamous Bataan Death March. and 3 years of horrendous captivity. He was the State of New Mexicos oldest Bataan veteran. Our Nation is forever in debt to the extraordinary courage and sacrifice that Mr. Wallace and the \"Battling Bastards of Bataan\" demonstrated in the early days of World War II. Their heroic resistance helped slow the Japanese advance. allowing crucial time for the Allied forces to reorganize and eventually reverse Japans progress. They played a crucial role in our Nations history. I am proud to have sponsored legislation to award these valiant soldiers the Congressional Gold Medal. The Japanese attack on the Philippines in December. 1941. just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. led to 4 months of intense combat. Outnumbered. outgunned. Mr. Wallace and his fellow soldiers put up a desperate fight. For 4 months. they struggled. they valiantly fought. against impossible odds. and without hope of resupply. until they finally surrendered. Their suffering was only just beginning. The brutal Bataan Death March was followed by terrible conditions in Japanese prisons and work camps. Starvation. Torture. Forced work. And. for so many of these brave men. death. By the time they were rescued. toward the end of the war. half of New Mexicos 1.800 soldiers serving in Bataan had died. Another 300 would die from complications related to their captivity within a year of returning to the U.S. Mr. Wallace was held captive for more than 3 horrific years. Virgil Wallace was awarded the Bronze Star and numerous other commendations for his heroic service. After the war. he returned to New Mexico. where he worked for the Department of Transportation and later Carrie Tingley Hospital in Truth or Consequences. Our Nation will long remember this courageous soldier. a man who gave so much in service to his country. Mr. Wallace is one of the last of a legendary band of brothers. who represented the very best of who we are. In the dark days of the beginning of World War II. they showed Americas fighting spirit and inspired a nation. I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Wallaces family and friends. I hope that you will find comfort in your memories of his long. and distinguished. life. We honor his valor and his example. and we mourn your loss.*",

Sheriff Wellington will be retiring this year after serving the Ohio Mahoning County with distinction during a career that spanned seven decades. After serving as a Sergeant in the United States Army during the Korean War. Sheriff Wellington joined the Youngstown Police Force as a cadet in 1957. He was later promoted to Sergeant in 1966. Vice Squad Chief in 1970. Lieutenant in 1972. Captain in 1973. and Police Chief in 1984. After four decades serving the people of the Mahoning County and its largest city. Youngstown. Mr. Wellington became the County Sheriff on August 28. 1999. Sheriff Wellington. who is affectionately known as a softspoken. but firm leader. has many achievements to accompany his long and distinguished career.

I want to extend my warmest thanks to Sheriff Wellington for his lifelong devotion to protecting and serving the people of Mahoning County.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we begin a new Congress with many disappointments behind us and many challenges before us. Id like to take a moment to note legislation that has proven successful beyond all expectationsthe Orphan Drug Act. And Id also like to note the recent passing of one that bills first championsJack Klugman. Before 1983. people suffering from a rare disease had little or no hope that a treatment or cure would be developed. despite the fact that many potential treatments for those diseases existed. By definition. the market for a drug for rare disease was too small to attract drug companies to do the research and go through the approval process. It was a classic case of market failure. And. for better or for worse. pharmaceutical research usually depends on the market. So we had to invent an incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to do something that was squarely in the public interest. We had to make the development of orphan treatments something companies themselves wanted to do. To do so. we created incentives: intellectualproperty protections. tax benefits. and regulatory advantages. But. like many good bills on complicated issues. the Orphan Drug Act got bogged down. And thats when the unexpected champion emergedthe Hollywood actor Jack Klugman. He was a big star and he had read about the problems of people with rare diseases. He used his television show. Quincy. to highlight the issue. (The show even hired people with rare diseases to serve as extras in a fictional demonstration outside the Capitol.) He was a witness before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. which I chaired. He went on to bring national attention to this problem that affected many. many peoplebut people in groups so small that they could never on their own get the help they needed. The bill passed the House. Ultimately. with the help of my friend and colleague. Senator Orrin Hatch. it also passed the Senate. President Reagan signed it into law on January 4. And the rest. as they say. is historygood history. The Act has been very successful. Over the thirty years between then and now. hundreds of orphan drugs have been approved and millions of Americans with rare diseases have been helped. There is still a lot to be done. There are thousands of rare diseases without treatments. The cost of many orphan drugs and many other drugs is still far too high. But this Act and the amendments made to it since then have made great progress. Im sad to say that Jack Klugman died last week. Hed had a great career in entertainment and he will be remembered for that. But we can also all be grateful to him for his starring role in bringing this bill to the public and helping it become law. And we in the Congress can be proud of what the Orphan Drug Act has done.",

He has mentored countless people who have gone to be great successes in the San Diego community. Perhaps most striking was Murrays deep care for the city of San Diego and how translated that into political and charitable action. Murray was not involved in politics to be a power broker or to push an ambitious partisan agenda. Murray wanted to support whoever he thought would make the city stronger for the long haul. He really cared who was in office and supported people from the very beginning. He was a leading Democrat but he crossed the aisle and supported Republicans when he thought that was the right thing to do. Murray was such a great listener. And he was supportive and insightful. And he was funny. He was warm and witty and never shy about telling it like it is. I never had a conversation with Murray that I didnt walk away from feeling generally better. Originally from Minnesota. Murray never lost his Midwestern sensibility.

We have an opportunity to look forward. to end the partisanship that has undermined efforts to secure our future as a nation. I am disappointed to say that I can hardly imagine a worse end to a session of Congress than the one we have just witnessed. In our labored efforts to avoid a disastrous tumble over the \"fiscal cliff.\" we lost sight of a far less figurative disaster. The families harmed by Hurricane Sandythose people whose homes and businesses were threatened by the stormhave the right to demand action from this Congress. Yet. this Congress was unable to enact a proposal for relief. to provide the assistance people need to start the recovery. I call on my colleagues to support emergency supplemental appropriations for areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Fixing the mistakes of yesterday. however. will be only part of the solution. We have a more important responsibility in this 113th Congressto demonstrate to the American people that these failures were not examples of a serious problem within the Congress itself that prevents us from working with each other to fulfill our responsibilities. We have opportunities in this session of Congress to work together. as Democrats and Republicans. but more importantly. as Americans. to resolve the issues that are important to people in every community in this nation. As the tragedy in Newtown demonstrated. we must enact gun control laws that prevent mass murder and reinstitute the ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines. We must end gun trafficking. It is my hope that we address immigration reform. specifically the enactment of the DREAM Act. This act. which provides legal status and a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors. will benefit every person in our society. This act will allow millions of young Americans to participate in our economy. our system of higher education. and the society more generally. Other legislation of importance that must be addressed immediately is the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. the Farm Bill. postal reform. cybersecurity. and sequestration legislation. Let us come together. in this 113th Congress. to fulfill our duties as representatives of the people of the United States.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor the memory and the heroic example of Rita LeviMontalcini. Nobel Laureate in Medicine and SenatorforLife of the Republic of Italy. My constituents in our districts universities. research institutes and teaching hospitals join me in this homage. Dr. Allen Mitchell. Professor of Epidemiology and Pediatrics at Boston University. studied with her and with her mentor. Victor Hamburger. Everyone. he remembered. recognized the \"enormity of her contributions.\" \"But.\" he continued. \"those of us privileged to interact directly with her saw Dr. Rita LeviMontalcini as a role model who combined scientific passion and rigor with a great sense of humanity.\" Edward A. Kravitz. George Packer Berry Professor of Neurobiology at the Harvard Medical School recalled that Dr. LeviMontalcini was unfailingly kind and gracious to young researchers. welcoming them to her lab and her circle of distinguished colleagues. He was touched by her warmth and inspired by her eagerness always to know more. Rita LeviMontalcini was born in Turin in 1909. one of four children of an educated family. her father an engineer and mathematician. her mother. like her twin sister Paola. a gifted painter. The arts were thought appropriate pastimes for young ladies. but science was not. and her first struggle was convincing her father to let her study medicine. She graduated. summa cum laude. in Medicine and Surgery in 1936 and began a specialization in neurology and psychiatry. Two years later. Mussolini promulgated racial laws based on those already in effect in Nazi Germany. barring Jews from universities. Rita LeviMontalcinis second and most remarkable struggle was to continue her research alone and in secret. She cultivated chick embryos in her bedroom and studied them closely. Her inspiration. she always acknowledged. came from a paper by Victor Hamburger. pioneer of experimental embryology. Hamburger. like many of the most prominent German and Italian scientists. was at that time already in the United States. She chose to remain in Italy. confident that her country would return to its democratic principles. She was associated with the struggle for Liberation and. in the time of greatest danger. moved her laboratory into the countryside where she and her family found refuge. When Florence was freed. she practiced medicine. for the only time in her E14 life. among refugees fleeing the fighting that still raged in northern Italy. After the war. Dr. LeviMontalcini joined Hamburger at Washington University in St. Louis. There began her collaboration with Dr. Stanley Cohen with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986. Together they studied the biochemistry of nerve growth and revolutionized the study of cell growth and development. She flourished at Washington University but always maintained close ties to Italy and to a new generation of Italian scientists. She helped found the Institute of Cell Biology in Rome and became its first director. She died in Rome on December 30 at the age of 103. She continues to inspire us. and we do well to remember her brave advice. \"Above all. do not fear difficult moments. The best comes from them.\"",

It is critical that this nations elected leaders lead by example in the quest to reduce our debt and put this nation on sound financial footing. Responsible. accountable leadership is required in Washington if this train of fiscal disaster is ever going to get rerouted onto a track toward prosperity and economic growth. That is why I am a cosponsor of legislation that would halt the pay increase for Members of Congress under the Presidents December 27. 2012 Executive Order and legislation to stop the a utomatic pay increase for members of Congress. However. I also want to make absolutely clear my opposition to any efforts to unfairly target our civilian federal workforce for deficit reduction purposes. Americas First District is full of hardworking and dedicated citizens who serve the people of this nation every day. such as on the front lines of the War on Terror or in support roles for our military. Still others provide valuable service at places like VA hospitals. cancer research laboratories. and the FBI. And yet since 2010. federal civilian employees have seen their pay frozen and their benefits reduced on multiple occasions. I voted against the initial twoyear pay freeze in December of 2010. and on the first day of 2013. I voted against H.R. 6726. which would have extended this pay freeze for an additional year. I am fully ready and willing to cut my own salary. benefits. and office budget. but we must stop singling out federal employees simply because Congress fails to address the outofcontrol spending. There is no question that our nation must get its spending in order. and federal employees are certainly eager to do their part to help in this effort. Their daily contributions to their fellow citizens and to the cause of freedom are simply innumerable. and yet during the deficit reduction debate over the last few years. federal employees have been asked to contribute more than their fair share. Our federal civilian employees live a life of selfless service. and they deserve our appreciation. I am hopeful that deficit reduction efforts going forward will focus more realistically on addressing the true drivers of our debt. rather than targeting those who are trying simply to serve their nation each and every day.",

Many of our fellow and most economically vulnerable Americans are now in a free fall. How far they fall and for how long will be up to Congress. The House of Representatives should be deciding now. and by that I mean today. whether to pass the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012. which was passed in the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan 898 vote. If the House of Representatives fumbles this opportunity. it wont matter to these Americans which political party tells them that they did or did not cut taxes. or which party held more closely to its campaign promises. What matters to the 2 million Americans who are currently unemployed is why are their unemployment benefits being held hostage to provide tax cuts for employed and more welloff Americans? The deal agreed to in the Senate provides a strong enough platform for our countrys continued progress and economic recovery. That package will generate a good deal of the increased tax revenues that our U.S. Treasury needs to operate the government. The Senates package assures millions of students and unemployed and poor Americans that they will have the basics to carry out their daily lives and to advance their educational and career goals. Among other things. the Senate deal would also authorize the Farm Bill through September of this year. Extending earned income and child care tax credits and benefits. as the Senate deal would do. may not mean much for middle class families and individuals. But guess what? Those credits and benefits are hugely important. for example. to a family of four under the poverty level. which on average makes only $21.000 per year. The Senates proposal. which the Majority should bring up immediately for a vote is a good compromise. It wont give Republicans everything that they want. Similarly. Democrats are not getting all of what they want in this package. And rightly soneither party has all the answers to the plethora of very complex fiscal problems we are facing. Compromise is the solution. just as compromise will be the solution when we come up against sequestration. the debt ceiling. and passing a continuing budget resolution. I strongly urged you. Mr. Speaker. to call up H.R. 8. the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act. as amended and passed by the Senate for a vote in this House.

His knowledge and years of experience on these issues have been critical to crafting this legislation and bringing it before the House for consideration today. I also want to thank Ranking Member NORTON. Ranking Member RAHALL. and former Chairman MICA for all of their work and support for these reforms. H.R. 219. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. will save money and help devastated communities rebuild much faster than under current programs. However. in order to help those communities impacted by Sandy. the FEMA Administrator has made it very clear that these reforms must be signed into law by March 1. Many of these reforms were already passed by the House in September as part of H.R. 2903. There is also widespread and bipartisan support for these reforms in the Senate. In addition. this bill has strong support from key stakeholders and experts. representing emergency managers. State and local officials. and tribal communities. We know these reforms work. Chairman SHUSTER laid the groundwork in 2006 when his postKatrina reform act authorized FEMA to conduct a number of recovery pilot programs. The results are very clear. In each case. costs were dramatically reduced. projects were completed faster. and their process was much more efficient. For example. without making permanent the debris removal pilot program the taxpayer could end up paying six times the cost for debris removal. and it will take much longer. The individuals and households pilot program incorporated in this bill would reduce costs by a similar amount and make temporary housing available faster. In hearing after hearing before our committee. experts. FEMA. and the Office of the Inspector General have all testified communities will be rebuilt faster and taxpayers will save hundreds of millions of dollars with this bill. We know the current process is broken. and we finally know how to fix it. but we have to change the law by March or it will be too late to apply those lessons to the Sandy recovery. It has been nearly 8 years since Hurricane Katrina. and there are still projects that are unresolved. We dont want to have the same mistakes happen with Hurricane Sandy. These reforms will help address those programs. streamline the process. allow communities to rebuild faster and smarter. and save money. The provisions of H.R. 219 are proven and commonsense reforms that have bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. RAHALL. and my good friend Mr. DENHAM for their very important work to bring this matter to the floor so soon after the recess. Im sure everyone appreciates it. and I certainly associate myself with the remarks of Mr. DENHAM. He and I worked on the very passages he quoted. I. therefore. rise in support of H.R. 219. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. This bipartisan measure consists of reforms to expedite the recovery process for those communities that received disaster declarations for Hurricane Sandy as well as for future Presidentially declared disasters. I do believe this may be the first time that some of these reforms with any significant event have been tested because many of the provisions included in the bill are matters that we have long worked for and that were incorporated into similar legislation in past Congresses. Several of the provisions will streamline the rebuilding process to provide jobs in the region and to achieve full recovery. The measure is also supported by the International Association of Emergency Managers. the Association of State Floodplain Managers. the National League of Cities. and more. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Congress enacted two pilot programs: one for debris removal and another allowing FEMA to make limited repairs instead of lease payments to provide housing when cheaper than using temporary trailers. Both pilot programs were successful and resulted in savings for the Federal Government. Local governments and emergency management professionals have discussed the need to make the debris removal program permanent in order to expedite debris recovery. The housing program will be especially useful in large urban areas. such as in New York City. where temporary trailers simply are not an option. This bill would codify both expired pilot programs. providing additional tools for FEMA to help communities recover. This measure would also authorize FEMA to use fixed grants based on cost estimates at the request of the local communityanother favorite we have been pressing for years. Although Congress authorized FEMA to use cost estimating 12 years ago. which is the way the insurance industry does it. for example. FEMA has not done so. The new authorization includes incentives for the local communities to use cost estimating by allowing them to rebuild according to todays needs and by eliminating long delays in the recovery process caused by cost disputes. Moreover. this provision explicitly authorizes FEMA and the applicant to mutually agree on a professionally licensed expert to prepare a cost estimate to be relied upon by FEMA instead of using an adversarial process in which both hire their own cost estimators. paid for by the Federal Government. and then get into a dispute as to which one is the best to use. This process alone will eliminate one of the most inefficient uses of Federal funds I have ever heard of in which FEMA pays for the States experts to submit competing estimates of the costs of repair to the governments experts. No more of that. No more waste from that. Finally. the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held an oversight hearing last month on the preparedness. response to. and recovery from Hurricane Sandy. At that hearing. I questioned FEMA Administrator Fugate about the need to expedite the dispute resolution process. I am pleased to state that this bill includes a 3year dispute resolution pilot program for FEMA to draft procedures in order to expedite project closure and to decrease recovery costs caused by project delays. Madam Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "from Mississippi. who offered important suggestions to improve this legislation. Im proud to be a cosponsor. These bipartisan Federal Emergency Management Agency and disaster recovery improvements will speed up and streamline Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. And they will also. importantly. reduce costs. We worked to target improvements that will specifically help communities in the immediate aftermath of Sandy. These are critical. bipartisan reforms supported by FEMA and key experts and stakeholders. We understand from FEMA Administrator Fugate that these reforms must be enacted by March 1 to help the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. I have worked on these issues since serving as chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Management. as I mentioned. with the gentlelady from Washington. 8 years ago. At that time. I witnessed the devastation following Hurricane Katrina. We saw how our emergency management capability broke down. and significant reforms were needed. We crafted legislation to put FEMA back together again within the Department of Homeland Security. reformed and strengthened our response capability and created pilot programs to test out innovative ways to improve our recovery process. While we have made significant improvements in disaster preparedness and response since Katrina. there is so much red tape in the recovery programs that rebuilding takes several years longer than it should. The longer communities take to rebuild. the higher the economic losses to those communities and the more it costs the taxpayers. The pilot programs we created after Katrina laid the foundation for many of these reforms. From the debris removal and public assistance pilot program to the individual and household pilot programs. the savings were significant. and in some cases up to six times less expensive. And these pilot programs did not just save money. but they actually got things done faster. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act builds on the important work we started after Hurricane Katrina. Specifically. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act will: streamline environmental review procedures. allow greater flexibility to reduce rebuilding time and lower costs. reduce debris removal costs. provide flexibility and less expensive housing costs. and call for recommendations for reducing costs for future disasters. As the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I look forward to working on a FEMA reauthorization bill in the future and moving other important FEMA reforms later in Congress. However. today I know FEMA needs these reforms. and so I urge all my colleagues to support this in order for us to save hundreds of millions of dollars in Sandy recovery.",

Im told that the appropriators. in the legislation coming to the floor tomorrow. are showing unusual respect for House rules and wont use their supplemental appropriations bill to change legislation but only to appropriate funds. so that the standard 65/35 Army Corps of Engineers formula will not be changed. In other words. towns must put up 35 percent of the project cost for the Corps of Engineers to make the repairs that they would make. The construction costs are high. Many towns in my State will not be able to come up with the 35 percent cost share match for a multimillion dollar construction project. But the appropriators arent authorizers. they say. Well. what we have before us now is coming from the authorizing committee. They could have fixed this. and I wish this bill had been brought up in such a way that we could fix this match. as the President had asked in his request for the emergency funds. This bill should streamline the process. but we should have a 90/10 match so that these towns that are strapped for funds because of the damage of Hurricane Sandy and because theyve exceeded their borrowing limits would be able to come up with a smaller amount of money so that the construction by the Corps of Engineers could get underway. Im happy to see this streamlined process that will get aid to individuals and municipalities in the wake of future storms like Hurricane Sandy. I wish that we could have used this opportunity to fix the 65/35 match and make it a 90/10 match. as the President had requested. That certainly would have helped the towns in New Jersey and Connecticut and New York. I thank the gentlelady for yielding me the time.",

Even though the Presidents own appointee. Director Fugate. has been asking for this bill. it has been sitting. So were looking forward to a bipartisan solution that gets done before March so we can actually help out the Sandy relief fund. I would just like to point to a couple quick facts. The New Orleans Youth Study Center project. as an example. as youll see from this chart. Katrina was in 2005. Heres what the Governors office has put together. This one project isnt going to be done until 2016. After 182 meetings and 7 years of bureaucratic red tape. this one project wont be done until 2016. and thats if all goes well. thats when Louisiana hopes to finish this. Thats 11 years after Hurricane Katrina. The single biggest factor in cost increases is time. and these delays will almost double the project from $15 million to $28 million. FEMA has spent almost $5 million on a temporary facility alone. There are literally thousands of projects like this across the gulf coast. and there will be thousands more of budgetbusting projects in New York and New Jersey if we dont get these reforms signed into law. At this time. Madam Speaker. Id like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi .",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER. Congressman DENHAM. and the entire Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their work to bring this very important piece of disaster relief reform legislation to the floor this week. Last Tuesday. I had the opportunity to travel to the hardest hit areas of New York and New Jersey to see firsthand the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. It immediately reminded me of the devastation we in Mississippi experienced after Hurricane Katrina just 7 years ago. When you look at the response to hurricanes such as Sandy and Katrina and other superstorms that have hit in recent years. there is no doubt in my mind that we have a broken system. Last week. I took a vote against propping up a bankrupt and broken system without any serious reforms. and today. I proudly stand before this body to advocate for some commonsense reforms on how we administer disaster relief. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 scheduled for consideration today is the first step in a much longer process of reforming our disaster relief system. Improving resiliency. increasing mitigation efforts. and changing the way we pay for disaster relief will be key to this discussion. Im especially grateful for the committees work in adding my language to this bill which will require FEMA to develop recommendations to Congress for a national strategy to reduce future costs and loss of life associated with these extreme weather events. Make no mistake. the Northeast needs our help now in ensuring the victims of Sandy receive the relief they so desperately require and need. and I want to encourage my colleagues to join me in support of both todays bill and the remaining Sandy relief measures we will take up this week. But I also believe theres no better time to address the very real needs of our broken disaster relief system. We must not only build back. we must build forward. Thats why Im proud to support this legislation to improve and streamline disaster relief in our country.",

I thank very much the gentlelady from the District of Columbia for her clarification. and I. frankly. thank you for having the wisdom in months and years back to have these corrections and these improvements in FEMA. and I know they welcome it. I am a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and served as the ranking member on Transportation Security. but know firsthand. as the committee that shares jurisdiction over FEMA. firsthand. in living color. the catastrophe and tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. both in my visits and almost living in New Orleans. as many of our Members did. and then in welcoming over a quarter of a millionplus of New Orleanians into Houston. Texas. being there inside the Astrodome. and seeing eons and eons and layers of beds of people who are Americans and who were Americans who. one could not call them broken. those survivors. if you will. from Hurricane Katrina were not broken. They were people who had worked and had homes and paid taxes. And so today. Madam Speaker. those who are survivors of Hurricane Sandy are not broken. They are not the cornerstone of the fault of bureaucracy or misuse. They are. in fact. survivors. They are Americans who need our help. And Id like to add to this discussion. certainly. I join and want to comment on one or two of the changes here. In particular. the individual assistance factors. I think. will be very helpful to expedite the declaration process for individuals. Im very grateful that one of the changes they made. thank goodness. and this is what happened to our seniors. fixing their homes instead of putting them in FEMA trailers. What a celebration. How many had to stay in FEMA trailers down in the gulf forever and ever and ever while they watched their homes deteriorate because a few simple repairs could not be made. That is a muchneeded step. But I join my colleague from New Jersey and say. how can people who are broken and who are in need come up with 35 percent? And I hope that this will be one that is reconsidered. Let me quickly suggest that I am in support of the $5.4 billion for FEMA disaster relief. Im in support for the $5.4 billion for the Department of Transportation. Anybody whos been on the east coast and seen the transportation corridor and the congestion and the synergism between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Connecticut and New York realizes that this is crucial. The $3.9 billion for community block grant. I am told that there are Hurricane Sandy islanders. people on Staten Island. people on Coney Island. who are living in New York downtown hotels. Im sure in a better day they would enjoy living in highrise. highclass hotels. but they are people that want to go back to their home. and Im delighted that well have that. And then I want to support the additional amendment that calls for. the gentleman from New Jersey. $33 billion unfettered dollars that will help additional resources.",

But I know that my colleagues will be reading the Constitution tomorrow. so let me read from article I. section 8: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes. duties. imposts and excises. to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. My God. my God. can we provide for the general welfare of those Hurricane Sandy survivors who are not victims but have lost loved ones and. in fact. are the second mostcostly hurricane in Americas history. Katrina. Sandy. and Hurricane Ike. I speak from what I know. I beg of this Congress to vote for the New Jersey amendment for $33 billion and. as well. the others. and let us be able to look back on their needs and go back to the table to help them if they are in need. The Constitution asks us to do that. Madam Speaker. I rise today to support H.R. 219. \"the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013.\" this bill is designed to speed up disaster relief granted through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) it amends Title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to Expedite hazard mitigation projects by streamlining the environmental review and requires the President to establish an expedited review for environmental and historic requirements for rebuilding damage infrastructure. Further. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act will give local governments greater flexibility to consolidate or rebuild facilities by allowing FEMA to issue fixed price grants on the basis of damaged estimates instead of a traditional entitlement guarantee to cover all cost increases over time. Last month. the Administration requested $60.4 billion in federal aid to provide financial assistance to homeowners and businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy. In the 112th Congress. on December 28. 2012. the Senate passed a $61 billion comprehensive aid package for the victims and communities by a vote of 6232. I am pleased that this body was able to pass H.R. 41. $9.7 billion bill which temporarily increased the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program. Now that the President has signed H.R. 41. victims of Superstorm Sandy are finally able to receive some muchneeded relief from the federal government. However. the relief that H.R. 41 granted was limited in scope and insufficient to address the entirety of the situation faced by residents of the affected areas. The House must finish the job. Again the measure before us today does not appropriate additional funds. but it does attempt to address the backlog. This bill would: Cut debris removal costs dramatically by utilizing reforms from a successful 2006 Debris Removal Pilot program that enable operations to be conducted in a more costeffective manner and incentivize the completion of projects ontime and under budget. Save money. as demonstrated by a 2006 pilot program. by authorizing FEMA to make limited repairs to existing housing structures when those repairs cost less than a lease payment for traditional FEMA trailers. Adjudicate claim disputes quicker and avoid cost overruns. the bill establishes a limited dispute resolution pilot. Require FEMA to review and update factors for individual assistance disaster declarations to make them less subjective. Provides for disaster declarations for tribal communities. Direct FEMA to submit recommendations to Congress for the development of national strategy to reduce future costs. loss of life. and injuries associated with extreme disaster events. Since this historic storm devastated the east coast in late October. the people impacted by the storm. particularly those in the TriState area of New Jersey. New York. and Connecticut. have been waiting patiently for the federal government to act as they continue to engage in efforts to rebuild their communities. However. the time for patience has long since expired. and these Americans can no longer wait for Congress to act to provide comprehensive relief. For families without a home. and for businesses without a storefront or customers. this situation has been an ongoing nightmare. These families and businesses have been waiting for Congress to join them in their struggle to pick up the pieces and put their communities back together. The proposal before us is our opportunity to step up and help to restore these suffering communities. that is the role of the federal government. Every state in this country is. at any given moment in time. at risk for experiencing a devastating and costly natural or manmade disaster. When state and local governments face overwhelming challenges that are too big and too expensive to ever hope to resolve in isolation. the federal government should be there to quickly assist them in their recovery. That is what makes us strong as a nation. that we can come together when necessary to prevent the pieces of our country from crumbling individually.",

It will allow greater flexibility to reduce rebuilding time and lower costs. This gives the local governments greater flexibility to consolidate or rebuild facilities by allowing FEMA to issue fixed grants on the basis of damage estimates. instead of a traditional reimbursement program. Why thats importantin my area. in the Central Valley of California. we had huge flooding. and as any emergency. youre not prepared. You didnt anticipate it. especially where we have such a huge shortage of water in the Central Valley. When the flooding hit. there was a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding among local. State and Federal Government. who pays for what. a lot of delays and waiting. With these cost estimates up front. we basically just say spend the money on those estimates. and the FEMA money is there immediately.

I believe it is. was of a magnitude of what we experienced for the first time at the gulf coast. We are going to come around. and were going to do what were supposed to do at times like this. But when we have a major event like this. it does not pay to simply go along doing things the way we have always done them. This is when things get corrected. This bill is a good step toward correcting what our committee and our subcommittee have tried to do for years now. I appreciate all the effort of my friends and colleagues on the other side and. of course. Mr. RAHALL and our friends who have also. in a bipartisan fashion. pushed for these changes and now have an opportunity to see how they work in a laboratory that is a very big one indeed. one far larger than we expected. but one from which we will also learn what is yet still to be learned about these major disasters.

This is with Sandy. had a 30day pilot program. where in New Jersey. utilizing the pilot program. they removed debris for $19 per cubic yard. In Long Island. using the Army Corps of Engineers. it was $129 per yard. That is a huge significant savings. one that. in the debris removal part of this. the 30day pilot. its time for it to move along and become part of law. We need to do this now.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 219. the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. This bipartisan bill would improve how the Federal Government helps state. tribal and local communities respond to and recover from disasters by expediting the delivery of Federal assistance. The provisions will have an immediate impact in helping to expedite recovery in those areas that suffered damage from Hurricane Sandy and will help all communities that may experience future disasters. We must continue to improve our disaster response programs to ensure that timely assistance is provided to individuals in need. At my request. this bill would require. within one year. the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to review and update its criteria for issuing Individual Assistance. in order to clarify the eligibility requirements. expedite the Federal governments decisionmaking process. and minimize bureaucratic delays. Last year. the State of West Virginia received four Presidential disaster declarations. the last two in response to Hurricane Sandy and Derecho Storms. In both cases. West Virginians had to endure extended and widespread power outages. lasting weeks in some cases. as well as physical damage to their homes and businesses. The emotional trauma was severe with some areas were literally cut off from basic necessities like food. water. and medicine. These disasters proved costly and expensive and dwarfed the limited means of individuals. many of them seniors on fixed incomes who have been pummeled by multiple storms. to absorb uninsured costs on their own. In both cases. FEMA denied my States initial request for Individual Assistance. forcing the State to redo its damage assessments and appeal FEMAs decision. FEMA later reversed itself and awarded Individual Assistance to some. but not all. of the requesting West Virginia counties in regard to the Derecho Storm. so far. the appeal related to Sandy is still pending. These delays leave uninsured disaster victims in limbo for weeks. unable to begin home repairs because they do not know what costs are reimbursable. State emergency officials need better guidance from FEMA about eligibility criteria for Individual Assistance. so that these delays can be avoided. Similarly. the criteria must be flexible enough to ensure that the Individual Assistance program accomplishes what it was created to do. which is to make financial assistance for uninsured losses available to families and individuals unable to recover on their own. Another important provision of this bill is one that recognizes tribal sovereignty by authorizing all federally recognized Indian tribes to directly request that the President declare a disaster or emergency. This provision is based on a bill. H.R. 1953. that I introduced last Congress after consulting with Indian country and Indian organizations. It would treat all federally recognized Indian tribes as the sovereign governments that they are and creates a mechanism that affords all tribes the option to request a disaster declaration when a State in which they are located fails to do so. This important measure is necessary because current law limits FEMAs ability to work directly with all Indian tribes when major disasters or emergency situations occurred. This language would improve federal emergency response and recovery efforts on Indian reservations and would amend the Stafford Act to align with the Federal Governments trust responsibilities. For more than a decade. tribal governments have sought this authorization to work directly with FEMA on emergency and disaster declarations from the President. My bill. and this provision. is supported by Indian Country and the Administration without qualification. I appreciate the manner in which this bipartisan bill was developed and look forward to working with my Republican colleagues on other issues in a similar manner. I urge my colleagues to support this measu re.",

Sadly. it appears that the Russian Government is playing politics with children and is destroying the dreams of many Americans already in the process of adopting. Last year alone. nearly 1.000 Russian children were adopted by American families. and many of these children struggled with physical disabilities. Every child deserves the opportunity to be raised in a caring environment. Over the past 20 years. almost 60.000 Russian children have been welcomed into the United States. Many of these children have found loving parents in my congressional district. Regrettably. President Putins new law now takes away this possibility. This law not only prohibits future adoptions. but even more disturbingly. it attempts to put a halt to those already in progress. Among those impacted is a family from my district. Marc and April Pongitory. Theyre in the process of adopting two children from Russia. After months of paperwork. background checks and interviews. this familys dreams are now crushed. and there are dozens of cases out there just like the Pongitorys. It is truly disturbing that the Russian Government would punish parentless children in retaliation for an entirely unrelated American law. We all know that the wellbeing of children should not be used as a bargaining chip for diplomatic means. This week. I will be introducing a House resolution to right this wrong.

I rise today to congratulate the North Dakota State University Bison and head coach Craig Bohl on winning another FCS national championship on January 5 this year in Frisco. Texas. NDSU is well known as a studentfocused. land grant research university with more than 14.000 students. offering over 100 majors. covering everything from architecture. pharmacy. food science and engineering. to business. biotechnology. music and interior design. The victory over Sam Houston State was the Bisons second consecutive national championship. an accomplishment even more impressive when considering the Thundering Herd became a Division I program only 8 short years ago. I look forward to following the Bison on many more championship runs and am pleased that Coach Bohl has agreed to a multiyear contract extension rather than pursuing a career in politics.",

My name is MARCIA FUDGE. and I represent the 11th Congressional District of Ohio. and Im currently the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. CBC Members stand firm as the voice of the people and as the conscience of the Congress. We are dedicated to providing focused services to the citizens who elected us to these offices. Tonight. the CBC will focus its attention on the culture of violence. With no end in sight. the culture of violence continues to permeate and define our society. Mr. Speaker. We cannot hide from it. It is everywhere we go. MerriamWebster defines an epidemic as \"something affecting or tending to affect a disproportionately large number of individuals within a population. community. or region at the same time.\" It is clear the culture of violence is an American epidemic. It is time for us to face the music. We are complicit in the violence that takes place in our Nation if we fail to strengthen our gun laws. if we fail to invest more resources into our mental health services. and address the issue of bullying. We must take meaningful and immediate action to eradicate the culture of violence in our country. Mr. Speaker. this evening I am joined by a number of members of the Congressional Black Caucus. and I now yield to the gentleman from Illinois.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus for not only anchoring this hour. but also providing an opportunity for the rest of us. I had decided to develop a statement. but then I had 16 young students visit me this afternoon from Oak Park. Illinois. and they presented to me their statement. Their statement was so similar to my statement that I told them that their statement was better than mine and I would use it. So Im going to read it as they presented it to me. They said: Hello. my name is Joey Cofsky. and my name is Sebastian Torero. and we are here on behalf of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism to talk about gun violence prevention. We hope that you will offer support for the Fix Gun Checks Act when it is introduced. Unfortunately. it took an inconceivable amount of gunrelated tragedies. and a recent catastrophic elementary school massacre. to once again raise awareness of the need for stricter gun laws. Nearly every day. I hear on the news that a common child has been shot to death in my very own city. Statistics furthermore illuminate this occurrence as eight young Americans die each day under the age of 19 from gun violence. By June of 2012. 228 people were killed in the city of Chicago. In that same period of time. 144 United States soldiers had been killed in Afghanistan. Instead of continuously cringing at these statistics in disbelief every time we read them. it is time to curb the pattern of violence that has made the innercity streets more violent than our very own battlefields. Today marks the month anniversary of one of the most horrific mass shootings in our Nations history. On this day. I personally think about the innocent 20 children whose lives were prematurely taken at a peaceful elementary school. I wonder about the difference in the world those 20 children could have made. That day. we all seemed to realize we had seen this too many times before. Mass shootings grab our Nation by surprise. and after every one. we feel a sense of deja vu. At first. peoples passion for change is reignited. and the driving force of action is full throttle. but as the weeks go by. the clamor dies down. The memory of the victims fades from our consciousness. that is. until another shooting occurs. I. and the people of this country. have grieved over too many caskets. It is time to match our words with actions. In the Talmud. a collection of Jewish laws and lessons. we are taught that he who takes one life. it is as though he has destroyed a universe. And he who saves a life. it is as though he has saved a universe. As a Jew. and as a person. this quotation resonates strongly with me. It tells me that it is not only important to save lives in immediate danger. but to prevent the loss of life in general. It has become clear to many of us. and for some it has been clear for quite some time. that an effective way to prevent death in our country and in essence save a universe is to enact a policy that would stem the flow of gun violence. Gun violence in our country takes 12 times the amount of lives that it does in the other 25 wealthiest nations combined. It is clear that in our Nation. guns are a major problem. We are told to save lives. and we can do that. So I would urge every American to know that lives saved is like saving a universe. Hello. my name is Joey Cofsky. and my name is Sebastian Torero and we are here on the behalf of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism to talk about Gun Violence Prevention. We hope that you will offer support for the Fix Gun Checks Act when it is introduced. Unfortunately. it took an inconceivable amount of gun related tragedies. and a recent catastrophic elementary school massacre. to once again raise awareness of the need for stricter gun control laws.

Gun violence in our country takes 12 times the amount of lives that it does in the other 25 wealthiest nations combined. It is clear that. in our nation. guns are a major problem. Jews are told to save lives. and laws that will prevent gun violence serve that purpose. In America. an average of 30.000 lives are lost to gun violence each year. This. and all we have said before it. explicitly demonstrates how dangerous guns can be. yet it can be easier to obtain a gun than it is to vote. 4 out of 10 guns are sold by unlicensed sellers with no background check conducted. Because of the Gun Show Loophole. anyone can walk up to a private set at a gun show. purchase a gun. and carry it out of the event. Domestic violence abusers. convicted felons. people with mental illnesses. and terrorists can purchase guns because of this loophole. 30% of illegally trafficked guns are connected to gun shows. Actions must be taken to prevent guns from falling into the hands of people who would not pass a background check. but can obtain a firearm because of this loophole. The Fix Gun Checks Act would eliminate this loophole by requiring background checks for any gun sales event that provides a venue for the sale or transaction of firearms. We thank you for cosponsoring this bill. and hope you will continue to support it in the future.",

    "speech": "First. let me thank you. Congresswoman FUDGE. our new chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. for bringing us here together tonight to discuss this important issue. Also. I wanted to say that Congresswoman FUDGE is such a tremendous leader and now. as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. has really chartered a very powerful course for equity. justice. and for nonviolence. So thank you very much for your leadership. I can think of no more important subject than the culture of violence which Congresswoman FUDGE has brought us here together to discuss tonight. and specifically gun violence that has been destroying communities. taking lives. and injuring too many people for much too long across America. As President Obama so eloquently said the Sunday after the tragedy in Newtown which shook the conscience of this country. and which we all still continue to mourn and offer our condolences to the families and friends and the entire community. We cannot accept this violence. the President said. This is visited on children year after year. and somehow is the price of freedom. We cannot accept this. We cannot accept one more innocent life being lost to violence. not one in Newtown. not one in Chicago or Cleveland. not one in Oakland. California. not one in any town. in any city. in any school. in any theater or in any place of worship. in any mall. or in any of our neighborhoods. We have an obligation to our children to ensure that Newtown marks a turning point that made us finally say enough is enough. We must come together to build an America where our children do not have to live in fear and where they do have a future. Last week I was at an event in my district in west Oakland. It was the unveiling of a mural painted by several talented young artists. This Tree of Life mural depicted the hope and the faith that my young people have for a future without violence. Yet theyve seen and experienced so much gun violence in their communities throughout their young lives. Just over the weekend. 11 people were tragically shot in my congressional district. Too many of my constituents have been affected by gun violence. have pleaded for help in protecting their children from the horrors of gun violence. only to see the status quo continue at the Federal level. Mr. Speaker. we need to take some serious action that includes commonsense measures such as Federal gun buyback programs. banning highcapacity magazines. expanding the 24hour gun background check. closing the gun show loophole. and reinstituting the assault weapon ban. We need to do this immediately. But we also need to work to end domestic violence in our homes and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. For whatever reason. unfortunately. it got stuck last Congress. We need to do this right away. We also must seek input from our young people. community stakeholders. faith communities and others. We can work together to identify the root causes of this Nations more than 16.000 homicides a year. Let me call to your attention the work of a magnificent communitybased organization in my district that I actually am very proud of that I helped found in the early nineties called the Martin Luther King. Jr. Freedom Center. These young people continue to work on conflict resolution and violence prevention efforts day and night. but they constantly tell us that their work is thwarted due to too many guns in the streets. Finally. we must recognize gun violence as a critical public health crisis and continue to support comprehensive violence prevention plans. This week. Congresswoman DELAURO and myself. were offering an amendment that would end a prohibition. mind youand Congresswoman FUDGE. this is mindboggling when you see that we have a prohibition at the Department of Health and Human Services that would not allow us to analyze gun violence in terms of public health. We have a prohibition against that. So were trying to offer an amendment that would take away this prohibition. As a psychiatric social worker by profession and someone who founded a community mental health center when the psychiatric facilities began to shut down in California. I understand firsthand why we need to help people struggling with mental illness. give them the treatment they need. and reduce the stigma associated with seeking help. So Im going to introduce. once again. my bill to add mental health counselors to our schools. which will help children and families struggling with emotional issues who could actually be on the brink. but if we had mental health counselors there. they could really help steer them away from whatever tragedy that could occur. So we cant allow the status quo to continue. to allow our children and grandchildren to grow up in this culture of violence. in a world where violence threatens our schools. our homes. and our communities. Let me thank again Congresswoman FUDGE for gathering us here tonight to discuss this very important issue. I just want to remind us that next Monday we will once again celebrate the birthday of our great drum major for justice. the prince of peace. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. We must rededicate our lives and our work to the principles of nonviolence. which are more important now more than ever. Dr. King reminded us that violence should never be an option if we really want a world worthy of our children and grandchildren. Yes. as a major part of this. it does mean getting guns off the streets and working for a culture of peace and security. Thank you again.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. the gentlelady from Ohio . for summoning us to be a part of this Special Order this evening. It is quite timely as we mark the 1month anniversary of the slaughter of the innocents in Newtown. Connecticut. as we all reflect on the many challenges that we face within our own neighborhoods. our own communities. of longstanding reckless gun violence. Mr. Speaker. just last week a 90yearold woman by the name of Gloria Johnson. 90 years old. was shot twice as she walked to the laundromat in East New York. Brooklyn. She lived 90 years to be gunned down in Brooklyn. New York. Two weeks ago. AK47 shells were found in Queens. New York. at the scene of the murder of a 17yearold childAK 47. You find those types of shells in Iraq. in Afghanistan. not in Queens. New York. But theres a new reality that we are all facing. and that is assault weapons in an urban environment. And this summer a young 13yearold boy named Ronald Wallace III was shot in the back by a barrage of gunfire in the streets of Brownsville. Brooklyn. within my own district. Although New York City has some of the strictest gun laws in the Nation. senseless crimes like these occur all too frequently in my district and across New York City and in other urban communities across the United States. In 2012. the New York City Police Department reported 226 incidents of handgun violence in Brooklyn. New York. alone. Illegal gun trafficking and gaping holes in Federal background check requirements are to blame for many of these incidents. Eightyfive percent of the guns used in crimes in New York City are first purchased in States like Virginia and Georgia that do not extend the background check to purchase limitation requirements for private sellers. Mr. Speaker. I stand with my fellow lawmakers in Congress. with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and with Governor Cuomo. in demanding Federal legislation that specifically addresses illegal trafficking of guns across State lines and the requirement of background checks in all gun purchase transactions. To truly put an end to the random gun violence that plagues New York City and other urban areas. however. we must also address other policy areas that have profound effects on the level of gun violence that we see. Yes. I agree that mental health and mental illness are important factors that have to be explored and addressed when trying to mitigate against gun violence. however. theres some additional factors that contribute to what has become tantamount to a public health crisis. One such factor is poor educational outcomes. According to the American Economic Review. a 1year increase in the average years of education completed reduces violent crime by nearly 30 percent. In fact. between 2000 and 2005. New York State increased its higher education expenditures by roughly 40 percent. During the same period. the State violent crime rate decreased by roughly 20 percent. These statistics are an indication that there is a direct correlation between investment in education and the reduction of violent crime. specifically gun crime. It is my hope that any legislative measure brought to the floor for consideration also takes into account true and real investment in the inadequate or ineffectual educational systems across this Nation. By bolstering our educational institutions. we help set our children on a path to success instead of one that leads to violent crime. death. and incarceration. Gun violence is not an inevitable part of life. yet it continues to plague our communities. We are not helpless in this endeavor. We owe it to our constituents. to our Nation. and to future generations to act with urgency and conviction to put an end to the senseless pattern of gun violence. not only in suburban America. but in every community across this Nation. urban America as well. Mr. Speaker. my colleagues. I look forward to working with you in whatever capacity necessary to save another family from the hurt. the harm. and the trauma of the senseless acts of violence that take place in our communities across this Nation due to illegal handguns and gun trafficking. With that. Madam Chair. I thank you for yielding.",

I rise to take my first opportunity to address my colleagues from the House floor. to participate in a discussion on an issue that I find very troubling. at a crisis point for our Nation. But first let me thank our chairwoman. MARCIA FUDGE. for her outstanding leadership and for organizing the Special Order hour to address the issue of the senseless violence facing our Nation. Our country. more than ever. is facing a culture of violence. Unfortunately. we are now living in a society where mass killings have gone from being an extremely rare occurrence to a common occurrence. According to Harvard Health Policy Review. each year approximately 30.000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire. and about 80.000 people are wounded. We are faced with living in a culture where. now. more than 6.6 million violent crimesmurder. rape. assault. and robberyare committed each year. We are living in a culture of violence where our children see 8.000 murders and 100.000 other acts of violence in media and in their communities at a very early age. Colleagues. these statistics are too many. and it is time for action now. This problem must be fixed. We must remember. when we talk about rights. children have a right to be safe. So I applaud President Obama and Vice President BIDEN for proactively taking the necessary steps to address this critical issue. Its going to take all of us united. regardless of party affiliation or our differing views on constitutional rights. to stem this tide of violence. More importantly. we must take a hard look at funding for mental health services and other services. we must look at synching technology to ensure proper and tighter access to firearms. we must place adequate controls on ammunition. Bottom line: We must protect our schools. our communities. Children and families must be safe. I respectfully ask my colleagues to make this issue of violence a priority and to support our Nations leadership as they work through resolving this challenge. which should not be difficult if we compromise and keep focusing on saving lives. Madam Chair. I pledge to support you and to support all my other colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus to make a difficult task safe and to protect the lives of our children and families from gunfire and a culture of violence.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me first begin by thanking my good friend and colleague. my chairwoman. Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE from the State of Ohio. for anchoring this evenings Special Order on the culture of violence. Coming together to address gun violence and bullying in America is long overdue. There must be something extraordinary done to truly curb these atrocities from occurring in our communities. Too many innocent men. women. and children have died because of the ease of access to illegal firearms. Fifteen of the 25 worst mass shootings in our history have occurred in America in the last 50 years. Harvard Injury Control Research Center studies indicate that in homes. cities. States. and regions in the U.S. where there are guns. both men and women are at a higher risk for homicide. particularly from firearms. These statistics are tragic. We must do something. and we must do something now. On the issue of bullying. bullying is also a major concern in our Nation. Who will be able to tell what will become of the next generation if statistics continue to rise with each national report on bullying? Im very sensitive to this issue because I have three young children at home. and I perish the thought that they would be subjected to such actions. We are losing our next generation of poets. musicians. doctors. lawyers. scientists. and athletes to senseless gun violence and aggressive bullying. One out of every four teenagers is bullied and. furthermore. deterred from their academic potential. 282.000 students are physically bullied in secondary schools each month. One out of 10 children drop out of school because of bullying. We must take measures to protect our Nations future generations. From the mass murder at the movie theater in Colorado. to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. to the schoolyard killings at Mount Vernon Elementary School in Newark. New Jerseyfour youngsters with their whole futures ahead of them were violently murdered by a gang behind a schoolI have seen what damage guns can do in the wrong hands. Let us be steadfast in making sure that events like these never happen again. Gun violence and bullying in America are not just problems. they are national health issues. What are the solutions? Well. Federal action is yielding some progress. The Brady law of 1994 has blocked the sale of firearms to over 1.6 million felons. fugitives. and other individuals. Still. more is needed. Proactive approaches include renewing the assault weapons ban. closing the gun show loophole. mandating installation of trigger locks. and eliminating influxes of cheaply made weapons. This does not infringe on anyones right to bear arms in this Nation. but we have to do things that make common sense. There are guns that have been outlawed in this Nations history. You cannot get a submachine gun. You cannot get a sawedoff shotgun. Why shouldnt assault weapons be added to that group? Also. gun buyback programs in my district and my State have removed hundreds of guns from the streets. and I am considering offering legislation to bring these programs to scale on the Federal level to help stem the tide of violence. These measures would undoubtedly save lives. Enough is enough. It is time to take action. Thank you. Madam Chairwoman.",

    "speech": "Thank you so much. I thank the gentleman. I certainly am pleased to know how supportive you are of efforts to make this a safer country for our young people. Mr. Speaker. each year. in its Uniform Crime Report. the FBI compiles a list of the cities with the most murders per capita. According to the most recent report. which uses data from 2011. there were over 3.300 murders that occurred in just 15 cities. There were 515 murders in New York City in 2011. 431 in Chicago. Illinois. 344 in Detroit. Michigan. 324 in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. 297 in Los Angeles. California. 200 in New Orleans. Louisiana. 198 in Houston. Texas. 196 in Baltimore. Maryland. 133 in Dallas. Texas. 117 in Memphis. Tennessee. 116 in Phoenix. Arizona. 113 in St. Louis. Missouri. 108 in Washington. D.C.. 108 in Kansas City. Missouri. and 104 in Oakland. California. Now. some people may think that violence is only prevalent in urban America. but that is just not true. Recent mass murders have occurred in places like Tucson. Arizona. Aurora. Colorado. Oak Creek. Wisconsin. and Newtown. Connecticut. Violence is truly all around us. It is at our movie theaters. our shopping centers. colleges. places of worship. and even our elementary schools. During the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy in Newtown. Connecticut. a gunman took the lives of 26 people. including 20 children as young as the age of 5. The victims of this heinous crime were killed at a place that we all consider to be safe. Since 1982. there have been more than 60 mass murders carried out with firearms across this country. We have had 19 mass shootings in the last 5 years alone. That is a rate of more than one every 4 months. The uptick in these types of crimes should be enough to push our Nation forward on reassessing our gun laws. Unfortunately. our country appears to be at a standstill. Each year. 30.000 Americans lose their lives as a result of gunfire. and about 80.000 Americans were wounded in that same period of time. The number of gun crimes continues to be high. and yet. we. as a Nation. are hesitant to take immediate action to address this issue. Thirtythree Americans are murdered with guns every single day. Our Nation has the distinction of having the highest rate of firearm violence in the world. Proponents of gun rights say that there is an absolute right to bear arms. Mr. Speaker. I disagree. All rights are subject to reasonable restrictions. One can support the Second Amendment while also advocating for policies that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous people. We must act immediately on creating a comprehensive. national gun policy that eliminates loopholes in the laws. bans assault weapons. and places limits on highcapacity magazines. Under current Federal law. background checks are only required for gun sales at licensed dealers. According to Mayors Against Illegal Guns. approximately 6.6 million guns are sold each year in America by unlicensed private sellers. That translates to 40 percent of all U.S. gun sales. These transactions typically occur online or at gun shows without the buyer having to pass a background check. Federal law carves out a broad exception for private gun sellers who only make what are called \"occasional sales\" or who sell from a \"personal collection.\" What is problematic about this is that theres no set standard for what is considered an \"occasional\" sale. In a national survey of inmateslisten to thisin a national survey of inmates conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. it was found that nearly 80 percent of those who used a handgun in a crime acquired it in a private transfer. In another troubling statistic. a 2009 New York City undercover investigation at seven gun shows in three States found that 63 percent of private sellers at those shows were willing to sell to someone who admitted that he couldnt pass a background check. The privatesale loophole has made it far too easy for criminals to exploit the system to obtain guns. For example. in October 2012. Radcliffe Haughton was able to purchase a gun from a private seller even though he was federally prohibited from doing so. His wife had initiated a restraining order against him. He used the gun that he purchased online to go to a spa where his wife worked. He killed her and two other people and injured four other people before killing himself. Requiring uniform. criminal background checks for every gun sale is something that has garnered broad support. A 2012 survey by Republican pollster Frank Luntz revealed that 82 percent of gun owners. including 74 percent of National Rifle Association members. support requiring criminal background checks for potential gun owners. This is a prime example of a sensible gun regulation that should be implemented now. Failing to fully enforce current laws can be just as bad as not having any laws at all. Mr. Speaker. Since its creation in 1999. the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. better known as NICS. has prevented more than 1.7 million permit applications and gun sales to felons. The seriously mentally ill and drug abusers have also been stopped in some instances. But despite its success. NICS has a number of gaps and limitations that still enable firearms to be sold to dangerous people. Many prohibited purchasers are able to get their hands on guns because NICS is missing millions of relevant records due to lax reporting by State and Federal agencies. Twentythree States and the District of Columbia have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to NICS100. Seventeen States have submitted fewer than 10 mental health records. and four States have not submitted any mental health records at all. State substance abuse records have always been significantly underreported. Fortyfour States have submitted fewer than 10 records to the Federal database. and 33 States have not submitted any records at all. Federal agencies have also dragged their feet in fulfilling their reporting responsibilities. Despite being required to do so. many Federal agencies have shared very few mental health records. Only nine of the 60 Federal agencies listed in relevant FBI data have submitted any mental health records. Incomplete records have allowed dangerous killers to purchase guns. In 2007. Seung Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people at Virginia Tech before taking his own life. Cho had been found mentally ill by a judge. and. as a result. he should have been prohibited from buying a gun. He was able to slip through the cracks and pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer because his mental health records were never submitted to NICS. It is clear that our background check system is broken and needs to be fixed. The prevalence of assault weapons is another issue that raises great concern for me. These militarystyle weapons with highcapacity magazines tend to be the weapon of choice in mass shootings and police murders. Those kinds of weapons have been used to inflict the greatest amount of pain in the shortest amount of time. In a study of highprofile shootings over the past 4 years. Mayors Against Illegal Guns has found that at least onethird of those shootings involved assault weapons and/or highcapacity magazines. They were used in Newtown. Connecticut. on December 14. 2012. to kill 26 people. in Oak Creek. Wisconsin. on August 5 to kill six people and wound three others. in Aurora. Colorado. on July 20. 2012. to kill 12 people and injure 58 others. in Tucson. Arizona. on January 8. 2011. to kill six people and wound 13 others. in Fort Hood. Texas. on November 5. 2009. to kill 13 people and wound 34 others. and in Binghamton. New York. on April 3. 2009. to kill 13 people and injure four others. Assault weapons are also a threat to our local law enforcement. On June 8. 2009. in Chesapeake. Virginia. a gun man shot two police officers with a semiautomatic AK47 assault weapon. firing at least 30 rounds. In St. Louis. Missouri. on January 7. 2010. Timothy Hendron entered the ABB. Inc. factory with two handguns. a shotgun. and a semiautomatic AK47 rifle with highcapacity ammunition magazines. He fired approximately 115 rounds. killing three and wounding five before taking his own life. After the shooting. the police chief of St. Louis. Daniel Isom. said: Our officers didnt have sufficient weapons systems to engage a person with an AK 47. On January 26. 2011. in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma. a police officer was ambushed by a teenager who fired a semiautomatic weapon 26 times. Responding to the crime. Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty stated: There are just more and more assault rifles out there. and it is becoming a bigger threat to law enforcement each day. They are outgunned. Reinstating the assault weapon ban must be a priority for our Nation. It is estimated that there are nearly 18 million assault weapons in circulation in the United States. A 2010 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum revealed that there has been an increase in criminal use of assault weapons since the Federal ban expired in 2004. Thirtyseven percent of police agencies have reported noticeable increases. Weapons with the ability to carry out such deadly force do not belong on our streets. Mr. Speaker. There is no justification for the use of these weapons anywhere but on the battlefield for which they were designed. I firmly support banning assault weapons of all types. A ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines has been endorsed by several organizations. including Mayors Against Illegal Guns. the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Major Cities Chiefs Association. the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives. the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. the Police Executive Research Forum. the Police Foundation. and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. The culture of violence doesnt necessarily start with guns. It can often be traced back to mental health concerns and bullying. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations 2009 national survey on drug use and health. there were an estimated 45.1 million U.S. adults living with a mental illness. That is 20 percent of all American adults. Sadly. only 17 million of these adults received services to address their illness. A significant number of the countrys inmates also have mental health problems. According to the Department of Justices 2004 survey of inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities and its 2002 surveys in local jails. nearly 45 percent of all inmates in Federal prison have a mental health problem. over 55 percent of the inmates in State prison have a mental health problem. and nearly 65 percent of inmates in local jails have a mental problem. We cannot continue to ignore the fact that we need to do more to address the issue of mental health. Turning our back on this problem will not make it go away. The issue of bullying has become rampant in our society. Too many of our children are being bullied during and after school and on the Internet. According to Stomp Out Bullying. it is estimated that one out of four teens is bullied during their lifetime. Fiftyeight percent of kids admit someone has said mean or hurtful things to them online. More than 40 percent say it has happened to them more than once. Fiftythree percent of kids admit having said something mean or hurtful to another person online. and more than one in three has done it more than once. Fiftyeight percent have not told their parents or an adult about something mean or hurtful that happened to them online. Many believe that bullying is a right of passage. Im here to tell you that it is not. Bullying is intentional. it is cruel. and abusive. It can set the tone for a lifetime of hurt. Many people are never the same after being bullied. Depression. anxiety. and many other psychological problems can result from bullying. Some turn to substance abuse. even suicide. Bullying is no joking matter. It is not something to be taken lightly. We must inform our children of the consequences of bullying. We must be attentive and listen to their cries for help. How many of our children need to fall victim to this cruel behavior before we are moved to act? We must address this issue now. Mr. Speaker. as I close. it is very clear that we live in a culture of violence. The culture of violence has ravaged our communities. taking the lives of innocent Americans. ripping apart American families. and destroying families along the way. We must act now because our Nation is depending on us. Anyone who believes that it is okay to use a gun in an open theater is not really thinking very rationally. Someone who believes that you can put a police officer at every single entrance into a school is really not thinking very rationally. We have to do something. No matter what our personal beliefs are. we are all here to work for the American public. not ourselves. We may have a personal opinion as to what should be done about guns. but the people of America are speaking. and we need to listen to them. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my serious concerns about the recent acts of violence throughout the United States. The tragedy that struck the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Connecticut. last month was a devastating loss for the families and friends of the students and educators who were killed. As the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. the Newtown tragedy has underscored the fundamental need to reevaluate our approach to gun violence and mental illness. Any strategy to reduce gun violence must be inclusive in its approach to finding a solution. Every viable consideration must be on the table as we look to enact comprehensive legislation at the federal level. With the total number of privately owned firearms in circulation estimated to be more than 270 million. we must take reasonable steps to ensure that these firearms do not fall into the wrong hands. while also protecting the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners. The topic of mental illness is one that is neglected. particularly in regard to its connection to gun violence. In 2009. approximately 11 million adults in the United States had a serious mental illness. Forty percent of those adults did not receive any type of treatment for that illness. We now know that each of the shooters in the most recent incidents suffered from mental illness. Addressing mental illness can be a critical component of a comprehensive approach to reducing violence in our schools and other public places. Mr. Speaker. we must take deliberate steps going forward to prevent another tragedy from occurring. There is absolutely no place for violence in our schools. and we are compelled to do everything within our power to avert future catastrophe. There is a large mental health component to this debate that needs greater consideration. and I hope that my colleagues will continue to take a holistic approach during this process.",

Chief Gobble. a lifelong resident of the community he serves. heads an all volunteer fire department in Ripley. WV. a small town in my district. On the morning of December 29. 2012. Ripleys Mayor received an anonymous letter detailing a heroic event that happened the week earlier. just before the Christmas holiday. The letters anonymous author had been traveling down Route 33 when he witnessed a frightening car wreck. in which the vehicle left the road and landed in the frigid waters of a nearby creek. The first emergency responder on the scene was a man from the fire department. who. according to the anonymous author. waded into the cold waters without hesitation to help the trapped motorist. The fireman successfully retrieved the elderly man from his almost completely submerged car and helped him to shore. reassuring him along the way that everything would be alright. By the time the fireman helped the elderly man to the creek bank. other members of the fire department. paramedics. and police had arrived on the scene to assist. Once the elderly man was safe from the frigid waters and receiving medical treatment from paramedics. the letters anonymous author asked a member of the fire department for the name of the fireman that risked hypothermia to save the motorist. The fireman responded. \"Thats our chief!\" It was Ripleys volunteer fire chief. Richard Gobble. who had rescued the man from the frozen creek and saved his life. Mr. Speaker. the level of devotion to community by Chief Gobble is one deserving of great respect and recognition. I wish to thank Chief Gobble for his service to his community.

Since 1912. the club has called Selby Avenue in Saint Paul. Minnesota its home. Today. it is the largest curling club in the United States with more than 1.200 members. The sport of curling has a deep and rich history in Minnesotas capital city. In 1885 two clubs formed under the names of the Saint Paul Curling Club and the Nushka Curling Club. The first games were played on the frozen Mississippi River near Raspberry Island in downtown St. Paul. In 1904 the first Saint Paul Curling Club closed and the Capitol City Curling Club was formed the following year. In 1912 the Capitol City and Nushka Curling Clubs merged to form the current Saint Paul Curling Club and the new club took up residence in its current home on Selby Avenue. During its century on Selby Avenue. the Saint Paul Curling Club has witnessed many changesseasonal outdoor ice sheets have been upgraded to year round indoor refrigerated rinks. financial woes and declining membership in past decades have given way to booming times and a surge in membership. and a neighborhood in decline has been reborn. Throughout all these changes and more. the Saint Paul Curling Club has remained at 470 Selby Avenue. It has not only survived. it has invested in painstaking restoration as well as expansion of its historic home. Throughout its history on Selby Avenue. the Saint Paul Curling Club has served as a foundation for this neighborhood. which is once again a thriving residential community and bustling destination for dining. shopping. and socializing. Central to the Saint Paul Curling Club is the sport of curling. Not only is it the largest curling club in the U.S.. it has frequently played host to both national and international competitions. The club has hosted numerous bonspiels. which are curling tournaments. and in 1988 they hosted the USCA Mens Championship. The club is also home to former Olympians from the 2010 Vancouver games.

Highland Village was voted into existence by approximately 100 residents on February 14. 1963. with 53 supporting votes and seven opposed. Over the subsequent 50 years the 5.5 squaremile city has transitioned from a small population and weekenders from Dallas to the lakeside community that is now home for almost 16.000 permanent residents. Highland Village has a long history that includes its role as a hideout in the 1870s for the notorious highwayman. Sam Bass. who was drawn to the privacy of the trees and hills that are unique to much of north Texas. The same natural beauty that attracted the infamous also beckoned wealthy Dallasites seeking respite from the city. The growth continued and development by groups such as Mobil Land Development Corporation transformed the small. rural town into a suburban city in the 1970s. It eventually became a Home Rule City in 1986 as its population surpassed 5.000. Residential expansion led to improvements in infrastructure and economic growth. Diversification of the communitys revenue base through commercial development led to the citys current vibrant retail market. Roadway improvements to FM 407 and the extension of FM 2499 as a major north south route which will eventually connect DFW Airport with Denton residents has also fostered the communitys prosperity. Managing its growth in a conservatively fiscal manner. Highland Village prioritized services that would enhance and preserve the quality of life for residents. As a result. current residents enjoy living in a municipality identified as the \"Safest City in Texas\". with fulltime fire and emergency services. an extensive system of community trails and membership in the Denton County Transportation Authority with nearby rail connectivity to the international commerce hub of Dallas. As Highland Village celebrates their 50th anniversary. I salute the unique community that I and my family have also known as home. It is my privilege today to represent the City of Highland Village and its residents in the U.S. House of Representatives.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the agreement Congress reached to prevent automatic tax hikes and the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. After tenuous negotiations which skirted the entire legislative process. the agreement. officially known as H.R. 8. the American Taxpayer Relief Act. is neither balanced. nor comprehensive. Instead. it adds nearly $3.97 trillion to the national debt while leaving some of the most pressing tax and spending issues facing our country unresolved. For these reasons. I opposed H.R. 8. I will continue to work hard in the hopes that my colleagues can be persuaded to avoid a repeat performance less than two months from now. H.R. 8 fails to address our unfavorable fiscal situation. and merely delays important decisions that should have already been made. Thus. I have grave concerns that its enactment will result in other fevered negotiations by the few that will produce new \"compromises\" that are harmful to middle class families. With both the debt ceiling and sequestration still looming. I share Sen. HARKINs concern that the passage of H.R. 8 may put pressure on achieving deficit reductions through spending programs that Americans have earned. As Sen. HARKIN stated. \"Every dollar that wealthy taxpayers do not pay under this deal. we will eventually ask Americans of modest means to forgo in Social Security. Medicare. or Medicaid benefits.\" I am also absolutely appalled that the legislative process has been completely ignored throughout this process. We have known for 24 months that Bushera tax cuts would expire at the end of 2012. We have known for 17 months that the indiscriminate. acrosstheboard spending cuts known as sequestration would take effect at the beginning of this year. Yet for all intents and purposes. serious negotiations did not start until after the 2012 election. leaving just under two months to craft a solution to a massive and complex set of problems. To make matters worse. essentially five elected officialsfirst President Obama and House Speaker BOEHNER. and later Vice President BIDEN. Senate Majority Leader REID. and Senate Minority Leader MCCONNELLnegotiated the socalled compromise. even though it affects every American across this nation. Our constituents deserve to have their interests represented by their Congressional Representatives and Senatorsthe officials who they have specifically chosen to represent their individual interests. This is a dreadful way to legislate. and I sincerely hope that the process is not repeated. I am extremely frustrated that H.R. 8 is yet another unbalanced and ineffective attempt to bring our fiscal house in order. I have long maintained that the solutions to our nations fiscal problems must be comprehensive and fair. It is the only way we can truly provide a sound economy and future for the next generation. H.R. 8 accomplishes neither of these goals. While the law will raise an estimated $620 billion over ten years compared to what the tax code would have generated if we had simply extended all of the Bushera tax cuts. it will ultimately add $3.97 trillion to our debt over the next ten years. according to the Congressional Budget Office. Achieving $620 billion in new revenue while adding nearly $4 trillion to our debt is not effective or proportional. I also object to this law because it does nothing to reduce spending. When our budget was balanced and we had surpluses for four years under President Clinton from Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 to FY 2001. spending represented around 18.5 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP). the overall size of the economy. and tax revenues represented around 20 percent. In 2012 however. spending represented an estimated 22.9 percent of E21 GDP and tax revenues represented 15.7 percent. Clearly. these two extremes cannot continue if we are to balance the budget and provide for a sound economy for future generations. While we do not currently have Congressional Budget Office estimates on how this law will effect spending and revenue as a percent of GDP for FY 2013. we do know that it will increase spending by over $332 billion. pushing us even farther in the opposite direction of where we need to go. Additionally. while I do recognize the law will increase tax revenue by $620 billion over ten yearsnot an insubstantial amountthe effort was done with little apparent regard to the limited impact this decision will have on the trillion dollar deficits we face. I urge my colleagues to have the intestinal fortitude to make tough decisions regarding federal spending and taxes. and to take our cue from the 1990s in order to truly put this country on the right path. Beyond spending and tax issues. I am further frustrated that the agreement is incomplete. kicking the can down the road on a number of issues. For example. it only extends Farm Bill provisions for an additional nine months. Additionally. while I am pleased that the law prevents a 27 percent cut in the Medicare reimbursement rate for doctors. the provision expires in one year. I have been working to find a permanent solution to the current formula used to determine doctor reimbursements under the Medicare program for over a decade. I am abjectly disappointed that Congress has again missed an opportunity to permanently address this important issue. Another failure is the laws inability to permanently address the indiscriminate automatic spending cuts known as sequestration by making discrete value judgments on the cuts that need to be made. The law only delays sequestration for an additional two months. and partially pays for this delay by requiring Congress to find an additional $12 billion in unspecified discretionary cuts. Specifically. the law lowers the discretionary cap Congress previously agreed to by $4 billion in FY 2013 and by $8 billion in FY 2014. We are now three months into FY 2013 and this is the third change we have made to our spending allocations. As an appropriator. I am dismayed. In conclusion Mr. Speaker. I am disappointed in the Congress for agreeing to a woefully inadequate measure that fails to meaningfully address our structural deficit. As in the past. I am committed to working to ensure a balanced. thoughtful approach. and I encourage my colleagues to join me in being actively engaged to ensure such legislation is allencompassing. It is paramount that we come together as a country to make the substantive and difficult decisions that are necessary to provide for a strong nation. a robust economy. and a bright future for the next generation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Elaine Roscella Lehman. Her character exemplified the very best of what our Nation has to offershe was thoughtful. generous. and possessed a strong work ethic. Elaines longtime commitment to service began early in her life when she joined the United States Navy and served in the WAVES (Women Accepted to Volunteer Emergency Service) division during World War II. Elaine began her service in Philadelphia as a medical operating room assistant. and she was later stationed at Pearl Harbor Navy Hospital. She served our country proudly during a time in history that forever changed our Nation and the world. After the war ended. Elaine moved to Central California with her brothers. Shortly after arriving in the Golden State. she met her lifelong partner. Henry Lehman. and married him in 1947. Elaine and Henry had four children: Rick. Janet. David. and Charles. Together. they maintained and operated a successful family farm. Elaines service was not exclusive to times of war. She was also deeply involved in her community and became a wellknown figure in Sanger. California and surrounding cities. She was president of Wilson Elementary School PTA. served as a Cub Scout Den Mother. and also volunteered as a Room Mother. In 1979. Elaines work and dedication was recognized when she was honored as Sangers Mother of the Year. After an unfortunate automobile accident that resulted in the tragic death of her child Charlie. Elaine decided that she would go back to school for her nursing degree. She worked as an LVN at Valley Medical Center and at the Sanger Convalescent Hospital. Elaine genuinely cared for the wellbeing of others. so being a nurse suited her well. Elaine consistently went above and beyond for her patients. For years. she drove cancer patients to their treatments as a member of Angels on Wheels. using her own vehicle and gas. Elaines legacy will undoubtedly live on through her kind and generous acts. Elaine supported her family members wholeheartedly in times of distress and in times when they were working to fulfill their goals. When Henry was diagnosed with cancer. Elaine retired to stay with him and provide fulltime care. When Rick ran for election in 1976. she was with him every step of the way until the end of his political career. Rick served with distinction in the California State Legislature and as a member of the House of Representatives from 1983 to 1994. Her daughter Janet served as a teacher. while her son David works as a structural engineer. In addition to her family. Elaines faith was also extremely important to her. and she taught Sunday school for over 20 years. She leaves behind her three children and two grandchildren: Carrie Beedle and Stephanie Lehman. Mr. Speaker. it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to the life of an amazing woman. Elaine Roscella Lehman. Her positive attitude and overwhelming love for others will be greatly missed.",

Huell was known to so many Californians as the friendly host of Californias Gold. the long running public television program from which he retired late last year. Huells southern accent made it clear that he wasnt a native Californian. He was born in Tennessee but moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to become a reporter for KCBS. He fell in love with his new home and created his own television show dedicated to life in California. The premise was simple. He. a cameraman. and a handheld microphone traveled across the state. visiting everything from national parks to little known momandpop shops. in search of California stories. He found them. His folksy charm was disarming and his impromptu interviews were lighthearted and friendly. He talked to nearly everyone he met and found the most incredible stories ranging from tragic and touching to obscure and wonderful. But regardless of where he was visiting. his genuine enthusiasm stole the show. He was known for his \"geewiz\" demeanor and being completely fascinated with everything he stumbled upon. often exclaiming \"Thats amazing!\" The LA Times once called him \"magnificently unslick.\" Many Californians have mastered their own impression of him. with love of course. Californias Gold ran on public television for 19 years. It became many Californians \"comfort television.\" Huell Howser was always a pleasure to watch. Each episode would show you everything you ever wanted to know about a place. and perhaps a little more. He was a personal friend and I will always have fond memories of our Thanksgivings together at my brother Jims home in San Pedro. I will never forget listening to Huell and my mother Ramona share stories of Nashville where she attended high school. Since his passing. there has been an outpouring of tributes from his fans across the state who remember him for his optimism and sincerity. He is truly irreplaceable.",

I had the great fortune of meeting her through her work at the Fort Ord Reuse Authority. where I often encountered her during meetings or events related to the reuse of Fort Ord. At FORA. Charlotte was the ever present cheerful voice on the phone or steady presence at sometimes heated public meetings. I know that all of us who have worked with FORA. either as community leaders. members of the public. or her colleagues. will miss her very much. Charlotte was born in Carmel. California. on January 5. 1953. Her family lived in Seaside. California. at the time. but moved to nearby Prunedale in 1954. Her father was a painter and foreman of a glass shop on Fort Ord and was eventually promoted as Engineer of the Presidio of Monterey. She attended Echo Valley Elementary School in Prunedale and graduated from Watsonville High School in the class of 1970. Charlotte was a lifelong member of the Las Lomas Full Gospel Church in Watsonville. where she married Kenneth Ellsworth. a soldier at Fort Ord. in 1974. In 1975. Charlotte and Ken moved to Castroville. where she lived until her passing. Charlotte and Ken welcomed a son. Kenneth Jr.. in 1976. Kenneth Jr. and his wife.

On January 7. 2013. the University of Alabama Crimson Tide captured the BCS National Championship with a decisive 42 to 14 victory over the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. By clinching their third BCS national championship in four years. the Crimson Tide has cemented their place in college football history and prompted some to ask if this remarkable team might be unequalled in the storied annals of the game. As Kevin Scarbinsky of the Birmingham News observed in a January 8 oped. All the while Notre Dame was reliving history. Alabama was making it. All over the golden domes of the Fighting Irish. Only one team played like a champion Monday in the BCS National Championship Game. Only one team shook down the thunder with oldschool football and woke up the echoes of the greatest dynasties in the sport. Yea Alabama. The Crimson Tide became the third program in the poll era of college football history to win a third national championship in four years by taking apart the first program to do it. The Notre Dame champions of 1946. 1947 and 1949 would appreciate the Alabama champions of 2009. 2011 and 2012 because Alabamas third title came at Notre Dames expense. right in Notre Dames face. Given that Alabama plays in a Southeastern Conference thats won seven straight BCS titles. in a state with a rival in Auburn that interrupted this parade with its own championship. were witnessing the greatest run in college football history. Greater than Notre Dame in the 1940s. Alabama in the 1970s or Nebraska in the 1990s. To win it again Monday was special. To do it against Notre Dame. Alabamas historical nemesis. was memorable. To leave no doubt on the scoreboard leaves no doubt in the debate. This was history. This is a dynasty. The best weve ever seen. The best theres ever been.

Connecticutalong with the rest of the countryis still reeling from the inconceivable tragedy that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14. 2012. our hearts still ache with sadness and disbelief for the families and loved ones of the children and women who lost their lives in this senseless act of violence. As the Founder and CoChair of the Congressional Childrens Caucus and a senior Member of the Judiciary Committee. I have listened to the tragic testimony of individuals who have survived or lost loved ones as a result of gun violence. In the words of President Obama after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. \"Were going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. regardless of the politics.\" While it is certainly true that violent crime and homicide rates in this country have been declining in recent years. they are still far above those in other industrialized nations. Moreover. in America. there exists a pernicious culture of violence. a subculture that with todays technologically advanced weaponry is far more dangerous to public safety than ever before. At no point in our nations history has a single human been more capable of inflicting massive death and misery. and our society is producing more individuals who wish to employ such means to carry out their ill intentions. Far too often. the tool of choice for wouldbe killers is a firearm. Moreover. militarystyle assault weapons with highcapacity magazines are not just in the hands of our men and women in the armed services. they on our streets. Many of them are in the wrong hands. and end up being the highly efficient tools of criminals and mass murderers. Today marks a month since the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. In that time. at least 836 more people in America have died from gun violence and accidental shootings. This isnt a fluke. every day. on average. 33 Americans are murdered with guns. amounting to more than 12.000 people a year. In addressing this issue. I recognize and respect other cultures that exist in America. lawabiding citizens who are responsible in their ownership of firearms. Many of these citizens are reasonable with respect to the lethal capacity of their firearms. opting not to obtain assault weapons or to equip assault weapons with 30. 50. 75. or 100round magazines. Our reaction to. God forbid. the next time a madman enters a crowded movie theatre with the intent to kill. cannot simply be to wish that there was an armed good Samaritan in the audience who had the courage. opportunity and ability to stop a psychopathic shooter wielding a semiautomatic weapon equipped with a highcapacity magazine. I commend the President for convening a Gun Violence Task Force. and Vice President Biden for his outstanding leadership. As the President develops policy recommendations. as Members of Congress. we need to act as well.",

    "speech": "program authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to states and units of local government to strengthen their juvenile justice systems and foster accountability within their juvenile populations. The program focuses resources on holding juveniles accountable for their actions and building up the juvenile justice system in the states. It also essentially signifies the highwater mark of the federal governments movement away from an emphasis on rehabilitating juveniles and toward the idea that juveniles need to be punished for their crimes. indeed. the only core mandate of the JABG program is that states must begin to implement a system of graduated sanctions in order to be eligible for funding. Many of the deadly cases of bullying arise when children are teased and tormented simply for being different. There has been a recent upswing of suicides amongst lesbian. gay. bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) teens as a result of bullying. Almost 85 percent of LGBT teenagers are harassed in high school because of their sexual orientation. with 61 percent of gay youth reporting that they felt unsafe in school and 30% staying home to avoid bullying. By law. we require our children to go to school. Therefore. we have a duty to maintain a safe and healthy environment for children. one in which they should not be afraid. It is important that our children know that bullying will not be taken lightly. and that there will be consequences for such actions. E25 Thirty percent (30%) of U.S. students in grades six through ten are involved in moderate or frequent bullyingas bullies. as victims. or as bothaccording to the results of the first national survey on this subject. I held a LocalFederal Hearing on Bullying in Houston. Texas and hearings on Bullying in Washington. DC. I heard testimony from law enforcement officials about some of the difficulties they faced when combating bullying. Over 40 advocates and victims from across the country also testified. Last year. I invited the Director of the movie Bully. Lee Hirch and other experts to screen the movie Bully and for a Briefing on the issue of Bullying. When the MPAA threaten to rate the movie with an R rating. I requested that they reconsider. the movie literally follows to lives of several children who are bullied in schools and needed to be seen by children. I was pleased with the MPAA relented and gave the movie a PG13 rating. I have read the accounts of bullying victims and indeed the language from those accounts is often graphic and deeply moving. This is the type of language that our children hear and the behavior that they have witness in their classrooms and on their playgrounds. Bullying has become a crucial issue of epidemic proportions affecting millions of children and countless schools across our country. Studies show that 1 out of 4 children have been physically bullied. and the percentages grow exponentially when one considers the number of children affected emotionally and psychologically. and those who have bullied other children. Lately. instances of bullying have taken a deadly turn all over the country. We must utilize all the resources we have available to us to address this dangerous trend. My bill is intended to address this epidemic. This Congress we must focus on finding ways to address this culture of violence. I implore each of you to address gun safety. to limit access to certain types of guns. to support legislation that addresses bullying amongst our nations children.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this morning. for only the second time in the history of the House of Representatives. we will read aloud the full text of the Constitution of the United States. We hope this reading will inspire many more Americans to read the Constitution. We also hope that this reading will help demonstrate to the American people that the House of Representatives is dedicated to the Constitution and the system it establishes for limited government and the protection of individual liberty. The text we are reading today reflects the changes to the document made by the 27 amendments to it. Those portions superseded by amendment will not be read. In order to ensure fairness to all those interested in participating. we have asked Members to line up to be recognized on a firstcome. firstserved basis. I will recognize Members based on this guidance. Each Member will approach the podium and read the passage laid out for him or her. In order to ensure relative parity and fairness. I may recognize Members out of order to ensure bipartisanship and balance. Additionally. because of his longterm leadership on civil rights issues. I will recognize Congressman JOHN LEWIS of Georgia out of order to read the Thirteenth Amendment. I thank the Members of both parties in advance for their participation in this historic event. and I will begin this historic reading by reading the preamble to the Constitution: \"We the People of the United States. in order to form a more perfect Union. establish justice. insure domestic tranquility. provide for the common defense. promote the general welfare. and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\" It is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Illinois .",

The first opportunity will be raising the debt limit. The President doesnt create the debt limit. we do. We authorize the President to spend that money. We put him out there and say. Spend it. and we must give him the ability to pay the bills that we have incurred by our actions. So it shouldnt be a trench warfare issue. There are some bigger issues. those issues of the debt and how we deal with the major crises before us in health care costs. Those issues can be debated in the regular order. Committees can come up with bills about how we should reduce the costs. whether it be in defense or it be in health care. But that should be developed and worked out in a regular order in the House.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. all of us know that the 112th Congress was one of the least productive legislative sessions in our history. Even as our country faced significant challenges. partisan posturing and political brinksmanship dominated the debate in Washington and created an unprecedented level of gridlock that kept real work from getting done. As we begin the work of the 113th Congress. it is critical that both Democrats and Republicans commit to working with their colleagues across the aisle and putting the longterm interests of our country ahead of their own shortterm political goals. Thats why I have decided to join a group of Democrats. Independents. and Republicans in an organization called No Labels as a problemsolver which will meet regularly to build trust and cooperation between members of both parties and get Washington back to a place where Democrats and Republicans working together is the rule rather than the exception. We need leaders in Congress who are serious about finding solutions to the challenges we face both at home and abroad. I am convinced that there is no challenge so great that we cannot solve by working together. and No Labels is offering a venue for Republicans. Democrats. and Independents to do exactly that. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today for the first time in this Chamber to urge the President and Congress to get serious about addressing the outofcontrol borrowing and spending that is jeopardizing the American Dream for our children and grandchildren. The President has said that the debt ceiling debate is not the time to tackle Washingtons spending addiction and has called for more taxes. more spending and more borrowing in return for any future spending reforms. Yesterday he said. \"We cant finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone.\" But the last Congress already raised taxes. Now its time to tackle Washingtons binge spending. The fundamental question to be answered in the upcoming debate is whether Washington should take more than it already confiscates from hardworking. taxpaying Americans. The answer is no. Washington doesnt tax too little. It spends too much. Mr. Speaker. the new freshman Republican Members of the House are holding a Special Order after todays legislative business to highlight the urgency of the upcoming debt ceiling debate. I hope as many of my colleagues who can will join this effort and explain to the American people why we owe it to our children to stop spending and borrowing and start controlling our debt.",

Americans have been very clear about what the priorities of Congress should be. At the forefront of these priorities is to get people back to work and to revitalize our economy. There is no doubt there has been some progress. Thirtyfour consecutive months of private sector job growth is evidence of that. However. with 12 million people still unemployed. more must be done. If Congress is serious about addressing the deficit. then we must have a plansuch as the Make It in America agendato create jobs. Job creation leads to deficit reduction and is necessary for a full economic recovery. I am confident that with a new year will come a renewed focus to do the work of the American people. It is really time to put aside the dysfunction of the 112th Congress and to come together to address the problems facing our Nation.",

I rise today to honor two chiefs of police from my district. both of whom are retiring after many years of dedicated service to the district: Chief Jack Jones from Morrisville Borough and Chief Joseph Gura from Perkasie Borough. Chief Jones has served in law enforcement for the past 45 years. After three decades of service. he worked his way up to become chief in Morrisville in 2003. Jack knew the Morrisville community inside and out and has been loved by those who live there. Upon his retirement. he looks forward to spending time with his three daughters and seven grandchildren. Chief Gura has spent 33 years in the Perkasie Borough police force. During his three decades. the boroughs force has grown from eight officers to 18. Chief Gura has dealt with everything from bears to undercover narcotics investigations and even spent a brief time working for the Olympics. For years. Joseph has not only portrayed a top of the line work ethic but has also displayed great pride. integrity. and courage. Both of these public servants have devoted their lives to making the community a safer place to live. work and raise a family. I am honored to speak on their behalf today. and I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress. I wish both Jack and Joseph many years of continued success and a happy retirement.

Its one thing to read it and its another thing to really understand it. And to understand it youve got to understand the court decisions and how the courts have interpreted the Constitution. The courts have recognized the Constitution as a living evolving document and that its not perfect. Congress had to pass an amendment to formally abolish slavery. It took the Supreme Court in the Topeka Board of Education v. Brown case to abolish Jim Crow. the stepchild of slavery and a great stain on this countrys history. Thanks to Roe v. Wade women have a fundamental right to make medical decisions about their own bodies. a right that continues to be threatened by this Congress. And while the Constitution grants great freedoms. the courts recognize that they come with reasonable limitations. The First Amendment gives us freedom of speech but doesnt allow us to yell fire in a theater or to libel somebody. And the Second Amendment. while it gives you the right to bear arms. has limitations as well. You cant carry a gun on an airplane or in a courtroom. and we need to remember that. So just reading the Constitution is one thing. but understanding is another. I hope we will understand it and live it and see that we have a more perfect union.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Monday. the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 152. the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of The rule is a structured rule that allows the House to work its will and decide the appropriate amount of aid for the devastation as a result of Hurricane Sandy. It allows for an upordown vote on the first $17 billion in aid. along with an amendment by Mr. MULVANEY which would offset the cost. Additionally. the rule allows the House to consider Mr. FRELINGHUYSENS amendment for an additional $33 billion. The rule also makes in order 11 other amendments. Additionally. this rule directs the Clerk of the House to add H.R. 219. a bill to improve and streamline disaster assistance for Hurricane Sandy. which passed the House yesterday by a vote of 4030. as a new matter at the end of H.R. 152. Mr. Speaker. as I review the rule and the underlying legislation. my own opinion is shaped by a variety facts: First. theres no question that an enormous disaster has taken place and hit the northeastern portion of the United States and that the dimensions of that disaster are truly extraordinary. Theres a lot of different estimates that are floating around about how much. but one is as high as $85 billion. and that doesnt begin to calculate the human suffering in addition to the enormous financial cost. Second. theres clearly a Federal responsibility to act in this case. Weve always acted after disasters. We acted quickly after Hurricane Katrina. after the Oklahoma City bombing. and after the horror of 9/11. In countless other instances where a Federal response was in order. weve quickly moved to that responsibility. and we need to do so again in this case. Third. frankly. and I think this is too often overlooked in this discussion. we have a national interest in getting this region on its feet as quickly as possible. not only because its the right thing to do. and it certainly is that. but because its the smart thing to do. Over 13 percent of our citizens lived in the four most affected States that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy. and collectively. they produce over 17 percent of the wealth of this country. Having that area up. operational. and prosperous is critical to the prosperity of the entire country. As an American and as an Oklahoman. I know that my State has often benefited from Federal disaster relief in the past. I think of the Oklahoma City bombing in particular. where I served as Secretary of State and chief liaison to the Federal Government. and know firsthand how critical it is and how helpful it is to have the resources of the Federal Government at hand when youre dealing with an unanticipated disaster. Again. its pretty unusual in my State to go through a year without a tornado disaster. and its pretty unusual to go through a year without a drought disaster. Each time. weve come and asked for help from the Federal Government. each time. we received that help. Undoubtedly. well be doing that again in the near future. It would be hypocritical. in my view. to fail to do for people in the affected region what I and. I know. many others have routinely asked for our own regions. I do think. as I look forward. we should do a better job in budgeting for disasters. and frankly. weve taken steps in that direction. To the credit of this body and the executive branch. under the Budget Control Act. we actually set aside money for disaster relief. and had we not had the disaster of Hurricane Sandy. we would have actually finished the year with a surplus in that account. This disaster. though. was so large and so sweeping that it used all that surplus and still demands more. So going forward. I hope we can look at different mechanisms to budget in a more responsible and consistent manner. However. to not allow whatever shortcomings are in the mechanisms of disaster relief. to stand by and allow Americans to suffer while we sort all that through. we have never done that in the past during a disaster. we certainly shouldnt do so now. In closing. I want to admit a personal debt to the Frelinghuysen family. I owe them a great deal. Almost 183 years ago today. in April. actually. of 1830. one of RODNEY FRELINGHUYSENS distinguished forebears. Theodore Frelinghuysen. rose on the floor of the Senate to protest Indian removal. removal of my tribe from Mississippi and many other tribes to whats now Oklahoma. And he held the floor for 3 days defending a people that had no right to vote. had no ability to defend themselves. and tried valiantly to make sure that they were allowed to retain their homeland. retain their identity and their rights. He wasnt successful in that fight. but he fought it nonetheless. And. frankly. it would be incredibly ungrateful for me now not to. at the time of his peoples greatest need. return the favor. So I urge the passage of the rule. I urge the passage of the Rogers bill. and I urge the passage of the Frelinghuysen amendment to that bill. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. I really appreciate the words of my colleague and the generositywe were very happy last night at the Rules Committee that all members of the Rules Committee recognized that this is America in need. Its a fascinating story. and knowing RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN. no one could be surprised about the action of his ancestor. Of course. we all apologize for what happened to you. That should not have happened to your ancestors. But throughout our modern history. the United States Congress has always responded swiftly to help the victims of natural disasters. It is today 78 days since Hurricane Sandy absolutely devastated the Northeast. We never hesitated as Americans because we know that all of us are in it together and that when any American is hurt. we all hurt. and when communities are devastated by earthquakes. tornadoes. or hurricanes. we all feel our duty to respond. When Sandy plunged communities into darkness and left them without power or water for weeks. countless Americans volunteered their own resources to help the victims of Sandy. just as they had helped the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the victims of the Joplin tornado. Yet. no matter the generosity of our Nations people. there is no replacement for a swift and wellorganized Federal response. From militarygrade trucks. helicopters. and supply planes. to Federally backed small business loans. our Federal Government is absolutely vital to rebuilding efforts. That is why we were so sad. all of us from the Northeast. that it took so long for the House to respond. While the Senate acted soon after Sandy occurred to pass a comprehensive aid package. there was nothing done in this House for months. This Congress responded to Hurricane Katrina in 10 days. As I pointed out. its been 79 days for Sandy. When the majority did act. they passed a partial aid package that could be described as a starting point at best. And while we appreciate that were taking action to help Sandy victims. the piecemeal approach has hurt our disaster response efforts. Without knowing whether more aid is absolutely going to come. the governors and the mayors cant sign contracts with construction companies. cant complete their plans. and cannot prioritize repair efforts and provide effective aid. It simply does not do to give out money in tranches without a guarantee of the actual money needed to be coming. In addition. the majoritys demands that any Federal aid include offsets has delayed and endangered the aid from getting into the hands of those who need it. Yesterday. the Rules Committee was presented with almost 100 amendments for inclusion in todays bill . More than 40 of those 100 amendments proposed by the majority attempted to cut. hinder. and offset the aid that is contained in todays bill. Many of the amendments contained extreme and ideological proposals that should never have been considered for inclusion in a disaster aid bill. Mr. Speaker. it is now entering the cold parts of winter. There are families up and down the eastern seaboard who are still homeless. while thousands more are still working to get back on their feet. and many small businesses and restaurants have been forced to close because of the slowness of aid. Meanwhile. important institutions such as the NYU hospital in New York City struggle to repair the flood damage. and countless restaurants. as Ive said. have been forced to close. After being battered and bruised by natural disaster. the victims of Sandy are now at the mercy of the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues to show fundamental humanity and pass the bill today that does not include unnecessary amendments that are little more than political ransom for the majority. Its time the Chamber passes a bill that can and will be signed into law and gives the victims of Sandy the help they need to rebuild. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

These are two adjoining suburban counties with almost $8 billion in recovery costs. I was here in 2005 for Katrina. In fact. I had become chairman of the Homeland Security Committee just several weeks after Katrina. Within days of being chairman. I went to Louisiana with Ranking Member THOMPSON and to Mississippi.

Four days after that. another bill came up for the balance of the $63 billion. which passed the House by a vote of 41011. was passed unanimously by the Senate and was signed by the President in one day. Now. 11 weeks have gone by. Theres a lot of reasons for that. For one thing. Governor Cuomo. Governor Christie. and Mayor Bloomberg. they submitted the most detailed summaries ever. the most detailed accounting ever. It took them about 30 days to get that in.

Mr. Speaker. this rule brings a suspending package of more than $50 billion that is supposed to be for emergency repairs in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. That averages about $450 from every household in America. These families have a right to expect that this money will be used for genuine emergency relief. but its not. According to the Congressional Budget Office. more than 90 percent of this money wont even be spent this year. Thats not emergency relief. There is $16 billion to quintuple the size of the Community Development Block Grant program. Thats the slush fund that pays for such dubious projects as doggy day care centers. and it doesnt even have to be spent in the hurricane area. Two billion dollars is for highway repairs anywhere in the country. including up to $20 million each for Guam. American Samoa. and the Northern Mariana Islands that arent even in the same ocean as Hurricane Sandy. I offered amendments to restrict funding for emergency relief this year. Futureyear expenditures should be included in the normal appropriations process where they can be given scrutiny and be evaluated in relation to all of the other demands on spending. These amendments were refused. Worse. this rule overrides the House rules requiring spending offsets against unauthorized appropriations and. most telling of all. against mixing nonemergency funding in an emergency bill. A tragedy like Hurricane Sandy shouldnt be used as an excuse for a grab bag of spending having nothing to do with emergency relief. At the Rules Committee hearing. I was told.

So the Community Development Block Grant in Sea Bright will be used to help those businesses come back. It will be grants to the businesses and grants to the homeowners so that they can rebuild. The same is true of the Army Corps of Engineers projects. We need the Rogers amendment. We also need the Frelinghuysen amendment because the Frelinghuysen amendment has all of the Army Corps projects as well as those of the Community Development Block Grant. Those Army Corps projects basically let us put back the beaches. put back the dunes. put back the flood control devices so that we dont have another storm in the future. which could happen at any moment. that would destroy the towns again and wreck even more of our businesses or our homes. Also. the money thats in the $17 million initially is the public assistance money that allows us to rebuild our boardwalks. bring back our tourism. We cant delay any longer because. if we dont get our tourism industry back in placeour businesses. our homes. our boardwalks. our infrastructure back in placeby Memorial Day. then the jobs and the economy that are linked to tourism will be gone. We need this entire package.",

    "speech": "I thank my good friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the rule. When emergencies strike. large or small. Americans can always be counted on to assist and to support the victims. At our core. we are a Nation of Good Samaritans. After Superstorm Sandy came ashore in New Jersey and devastated the region. first responders courageously rescued people trapped in homes and cars. They often had minimal regard for their own personal welfare. safety and wellbeing. Everyone rallied around the clock. Governor Chris Christie. Emergency Management personnel. the National Guard. police and fire. elected officials. the Monmouth County OEM director Sheriff Shaun Golden were absolutely tenacious and effective. and our local mayors were like NFL quarterbacksrunning the plays. making calls day by day. hour by hour. Faithbased organizations helped feed and clothe and shelter. Private voluntary organizations were on the scene in droves. Our neighbors to the north. west. and south poured in to the State to help restore power and remove fallen trees. Words are inadequate to convey myourappreciation. Within weeks. however. the emergency phase seamlessly matriculated into the recovery phasethe flip side of the same coin. Now the big question is this: will the feds have our backs as we strive to recover? It is an absolutely arduous process. I believe that we will. Any delay in appropriating sufficient funds will likely stall a comprehensive and robust recovery. Sandy was the most destructive storm ever in our region and. arguably. the second or third most costly in Americas history. The Governors office has estimated the damage in my State alone to be $36.9 billion. Homes like this one22.000 homes like this onecompletely and totally destroyed. Another 324.000 homes damaged. 41.000 people cant return to those homestheyre still not fixed. Businesses also took it on the chin: 19.000 New Jersey businesses suffered damage of a quarter of a million dollars or more.",

No wonder 100.000 stormrelated unemployment claims have been filed. The Governors office points out that public facilities and infrastructure sustained the same losses of some $7 billion. Boardwalks were snapped like toothpicks. beaches have eroded. and some have been radically reconfigured. Significantly more funds are needed if New Jersey and our good friends in New York and other Sandy impacted areas are to recover. The Frelinghuysen amendment is absolutely crucial. We are not crying wolf here. I say to my colleagues. There are huge gaps. People who have filed for insurance claims find insurance has covered only this much. How do they ever recover? The same goes for the infrastructure in New Jersey. 860.000 people every single day use New Jersey transit. That infrastructure has been demolishedlocomotives. cars. tracks as well as stations. Critical Army Corps projects need to be reconstructed and repaired. while new initiatives need to be funded. We need this money. And we need it now.",

Im particularly disappointed that my amendment was not even allowed a vote. as it would ensure that all States that received a major disaster declaration due to Hurricane Sandy are able to receive EPA State and tribal assistance grants. The failure of the House bill to provide this assistance to every State receiving a Presidential disaster declaration following Sandy is troubling and. quite frankly. extremely disappointing. The refusal of the majority to allow this amendment to come for a vote is even worse. The Senate passed a fair and balanced relief package last year providing assistance for all of our communities and industries affected by a major disaster declaration. including our fishing industry. Im deeply disappointed that this legislation before us reverses course. denying assistance to certain communities affected by Sandy. particularly after the House Republicans have delayed nearly 3 months in bringing even this flawed bill to the floor. In this Congress. weve made it clear that we help our communities when theyre in need when disaster strikes. and this bill doesnt adequately address assistance to all communities that have been impacted. For these reasons. I will vote against the rule in the hope that we can improve the overall bill to include these critical amendments. But with that being said. should that rule pass. as flawed as it is. I wont let the perfect be the enemy of the good. and I would urge my colleagues to act in good faith and pass the disaster assistance bill free from additional legislative gimmicks that will only further imperil its success.

I rise in support of the Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations bill. and the Frelinghuysen amendment to provide the funds necessary to start rebuilding and recovering from the storm. Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast almost 3 months ago. Never before has the House of Representatives taken so long to meet its obligations following a major disaster. Im relieved that were finally considering this bill today. but Im disappointed. once again. that some are still playing politics by trying to add poison pills and offsets that jeopardize this aid package. As the current debate over the pending sequestration shows. finding offsets is no easy task. and it makes no sense to put that on the back of emergency aid. It defies the very nature of emergency aid. and it impedes the Federal Government from doing its most important job. protecting its citizens when calamity strikes. On the surface. Mr. Speaker. New York City appears to be back up and running. but many people are still homeless. and the lack of longterm housing is a problem for which we do not have an adequate answer. The restoration of heat and power remains a challenge. There are increasing reports of people. including small children. getting sick from exposure to toxic mold. sewage. or other hazardous substances. Entire neighborhoods are still dark and largely abandoned. Many small businesses in Lower Manhattan are still paying off disaster assistance loans secured after the attack on the World Trade Center 10 years ago. Many of these businesses were already operating on thin profit margins. Now theyve been hit again. and without additional resources and a faster rebuilding process. many of these small businesses may close for good. The needs are great. and yet the House has still failed to act. Back in December. the Senate passed a $60.4 billion disaster aid package that tracked very closely to the administrations request. which was based on conservative assessments of the needs across the region. The House should have passed the Senate bill back then. There is simply no justifiable reason for the delay. unless you believe that when disaster strikes we are all on our own. Let us. once and for all. reject that notion and meet our obligations to get emergency aid in the hands of those who need it urgently. I urge my colleagues to end this madness and vote for the underlying bill. for the Frelinghuysen amendment. and against all restrictive amendments.",

First of all. the Congress always has and always will respond to disasters. and it is important in the Northeast superstorm that we do so. and we do so responsibly. Anyone who says that we did not act responsibly. the Republicans didnt act or our leadership. is wrong. First of all. let me recount. After the disaster. our committee. Transportation and Infrastructure. which oversees FEMA. we went to New York. We met with officials. We assessed the damage. We came back and we did a hearing and hauled in FEMA personnel. We asked specifically. Is there enough funding available to provide disaster relief? The answer was yes. There was $6 billion in the continuing resolution that Congress had passed and another $1 billion left from the previous year. a total of $7 billion. The question at that time is how much would be spent. They said approximately $3 billion. leaving $4 billion. that would take usin the disaster relief fund accounttill February. We worked with the Senate and others in trying to look at reforms. because the last word from Mayor Bloomberg and the President of the Staten Island borough when I left them was. Can you help me get money from Hurricane Irene. which they still couldnt get reimbursed because of the bureaucracy and red tape from current FEMA policy. Yesterday the Congressand we passed it twice beforepassed those reforms that are so necessary so that New York and New Jersey and the others affected wont have the same problems in securing that money. So. first. there was enough money and is enough money available in the disaster relief fund. There wasnt enough money in the flood insurance account. and that is a reimbursable. It will come back. Before we left. we put $7 billion to ensure that they would be taken care of. and they are taken care of. There was enough money. there is enough money. and there will be enough money. This rule is constructed because. when the Senate passed their bill over to us at the last minute and the last hour. they porked it down. They put things in there that didnt need to be in there. thinking that they could pull one over on the House of Representatives and slide in with disaster relief a whole host of earmarks. and I wont go into the details to embarrass anyone. The record will reflect that. So we acted responsibly. our leadership acted in a responsible fashion. and today this committee. the Rules Committee. is bringing this out in. also. a responsible fashion to deal with the disaster.

I heard comments over there from the chairman of the Rules Committee and others about how this was a fair rule and a fair process and how its one nation under God and everybody trying to help everybody out. how they believe theres an opportunity for every Member to consider the matters that are in this bill. That is simply not the reality that was expressed for the nine States that suffered from fishing quota failures and threats to their fishing that were declared disasters back in 2012. when the Commerce Department said that the fishery disaster in those nine States was leading to people losing their job and the collapse of an industry. one of the oldest and most historic industries in our country. There was an opportunity for this bill to allow an amendment to be brought before the floor for a discussion about whether or not we ought not to do what the Senate did. which is put $150 million in that bill specifically for those States. specifically to deal with that aspect of disaster and move forward with that relief. This Rules Committee in this House decided that Members would not have the opportunity to take that vote. The Members in this House would not be able to work. Republicans and Democrats and Independents. to discuss a disaster that cut across at least nine States. that dealt with people who were going to lose their job. lose their industry and shatter communities. Instead. they would do this on a partisan basis. Although this was a bipartisan amendment that was proposed to the Rules Committee. and although every one of those communities that are in that disasterdeclared area have Republicans and Democrats. and although they have mayors and Governors that are from both parties. the Rules Committee. on a straight partyline vote. decided that this Congress would not have the opportunity to even consider and debate and discuss and then vote on whether or not we would follow the path of the Senate and allow for $150 million in disaster relief to those communities. This is not acceptable. This is not acting like there is one country under God.

The gentleman from New York . a Republican. and I and other members of our delegation have worked with Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie and with Mayor Bloomberg to move forward. despite the politics and despite the political winds. We have our two county executives from Long IslandCounty Executive Bellone and County Executive Manganoin Washington today. with residents who are Democrats. Republicans. conservatives. liberals. and independents. This isnt about party. this is about solutions. This is not the time for recriminations about what went wrong. It is the time for recovery. about how to get this right. This is not the time for partisan posturing. It is a time for solutions. We are cautiously optimistic that in a few hours both the political storm and the weather storm will finally be behind us. that the help will come. the assistance will be provided. that all Americans will provide the help that we provide them when times get tough for them. and that people back home who are counting on us will get the help they need.

And to those three amendments. the House Republicans said no. no. no. The House Republicans have cut a lifeline to our struggling Massachusetts fishermen. The Republicans in Congress are telling Massachusetts fishermen to take a long walk off a short pier. The economic disaster declared for parts of the New England fishery industry last year was in large part a result of the same forces that made Superstorm Sandy so damagingthe forces of climate change. It hit New York. it hit New Jersey. it hit Massachusetts. Climate change is increasing temperatures. its raising sea levels. its strengthening storms. That means more stress on New Englands iconic cod and other species. I support getting help to the people of New Jersey and New York and Connecticut. but we cannot forget the other Americans who suffered last year. The fishermen of Massachusetts. the fishermen of our country cannot be forgotten. This bill says no to them. no to their needs. I urge a \"no\" vote on the rule.",

These amendments would have given houses of worship the same chance for aid that other private nonprofit facilities receive. Superstorm Sandy was an exceptionally rare event with immense destructive force. and these establishments provided extraordinary service to the community during the hurricane. It would be unfair not to give them FEMA support and an opportunity to rebuild. Because of the severe crisis experienced by Queens and the rest of New York. houses of worship should be able to receive the same consideration for aid that other private nonprofits do. I am grateful that the Committee is allowing us to consider the Frelinghuysen amendment. which would provide thirtythree billion dollars in much needed aid to the states devastated by Sandy.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I yield myself such time as may consume. Madam Chairman. I rise to present legislation providing emergency supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy relief and recovery. The base bill totals $17 billion in crucial funding to meet immediate needs for the victims. businesses. and communities devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Since this terrible storm hit. weve come to realize that recovery is going to take months and years. not days and weeks. This legislation puts the region on the path to recovery by providing the aid needed for immediate relief. We are also analyzing the justifications for further financial aid for longterm relief that would come in a later supplemental or a regular appropriations bill. A significant portion of the funding in this bill will go to the most direct source of relief and recovery funding available to the victims of the storm. the FEMA disaster relief fund. which will provide individual and community assistance throughout the affected region. The bill also will support critical housing and infrastructure needs. ensure repairs to damaged veterans medical facilities. and help keep the economy moving by funding necessary transit repairs. small business loans. and recovery aid for businesses of all sizes. My committee thoroughly examined the emergency request. listened to the needs of the people in the region. and assessed the most pressing needs to determine the funding levels made in this bill. We crafted this legislation responsibly. giving the administrations request and the Senatepassed bill a hard scrub to eliminate unnecessary spending. We have removed objectionable provisions added by the Senate and have adjusted funding levels to make the best use of taxpayer dollars. As we know. we face precarious fiscal times. and it is essential that Congress make responsible decisions to ensure efficient and effective spending. Taking cues from previous efforts. we have included important oversight measures to prevent abuse and ensure that Federal agencies are using these funds effectively and appropriately. This is not the first major natural disaster nor unfortunately will it be the last. One of the great attributes of the American people has been our ability and willingness to come together time and time again to help victims of catastrophes recover. Weve seen the havoc that Sandy has wrought on the residents of our Northeast region. and it is once again our duty to help our people get back on their feet. I urge our colleagues to support this legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time. Emergency Conservation Program (emergency) ..................

    "speech": "and all of our colleagues from affected States to provide long overdue assistance to our region. Sandy devastated much of the Northeast and is one of the costliest natural disasters in our Nations history. One hundred ten Americans lost their lives. 8.1 million homes were without power. beaches across New York and New Jersey were destroyed. and more than 650.000 homes were damaged beyond repair. Sandy ground regional commerce to a halt by making tunnels and other transportation networks impassable. Two hundred sixtyfive thousand businesses in New York alone were severely affected by Sandy. costing jobs. paychecks. and billions lost in economic output. There is no excuse for the House not passing the Senate bill last Congress. but I am very pleased that the first order of business in the 113th Congress may be passing this emergency disaster relief package. Along with the $9.7 billion flood insurance bill the House passed 2 weeks ago. the Rogers and Frelinghuysen amendments would provide $60 billion of the $80 billion in needs identified by our Governors. There are a number of provisions I would like to highlight: $16 billion for community development block grants to help communities and businesses rebuild. $13 billion to repair and harden transportation infrastructure. $5.35 billion to repair damages and bolster Army Corps projects to protect against costly future disasters. $11.5 billion for the FEMA disaster relief fund. which not only helps provide public assistance in the Northeast but also allows FEMA to continue helping victims of other disasters. $780 million to help businesses open their doors through SBA loans. and $800 million for Health and Human Services initiatives. including repairing Head Start centers and biomedical research facilities. While I strongly support it. the package is still not perfect. It does not fully fund the administrations request for community development block grants. does not include superior Senate language on the flexibility and cost share of Army Corps projects. and limits funding for health facilities that lost tens of millions of dollars due to the storm. Finally. opponents of the legislation who claim that the bill is riddled with socalled \"pork\" and unnecessary provisions are just plain wrong. Frankly. anyone who has really read the bill knows there are no earmarks. and those who have toured the damage know that aid is desperately needed. My colleagues. there were 146 major disaster declarations in the last 2 years. There isnt a region of the country immune to catastrophe. This package was written with the core belief that when one region suffers destruction by a natural disaster. Americans are proud to help their fellow citizens recover and rebuild. It is imperative that we support this package today and reject amendments that weaken the bill and prevent the region from recovering as quickly as possible. Madam Chair.

I also want to thank Chairman HAL ROGERS and the Appropriations Committee for their assistance. One of the untold chapters of this postSandy story has been the hard work of the chairman and his staff in preparing both his amendment and mine. which follows. Most importantly. I want to thank the chairman for his eloquent statement in the Rules Committee last night. His heartfelt recognition of the hardship and misery suffered by our constituents in the Northeast meant a great deal to me personally and to our New Jersey. New York. and Connecticut delegations. I also want to offer some words of appreciation to my colleagues from New Jersey and New York. Their bipartisan diligence and dedication and that of our staffs over the past several weeks should make all of our constituents proud. And then there is Governor Christie. my constituent from Morris County. whose tireless work has helped us get to this day and will help us get this bill across the finish line. As he always does. he put a very human face on the devastation suffered by families and communities in New Jersey and our neighbors in New York and Connecticut. My colleagues. people are hurting this afternoon in New Jersey. New York. and Connecticut and other areas of the Northeast. The suffering and damage are real and their needs are great. According to many estimates. New Jersey. New York. Connecticut. and the rest of the east coast sustained nearly $100 billion worth of damage. The destruction is staggering. 346.000 household units were damaged in New Jersey alone. Tens of thousands of our fellow Americans are still displaced from their homes and their apartments. Municipalities are struggling to provide services. Many are still under emergency declarations. and some municipalities are not habitable. Small businesses are decimated. Many small business men and women are trying to decide whether they can survive and keep their employees on the payroll. Madam Chairman. the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our Nations economy. It makes good sense. economic and fiscal. to get our region back on its feet as soon as it can. I urge support of the Rogers amendment and the Frelinghuysen amendment. Without these vital measures. our constituents in the Northeast face nothing but more delay. more uncertainty. more unemployment. and more misery.",

I think both of these together meet our responsibilities in responding to one of the most historic and damaging storms to hit the countrynot only the Northeast. but the country. People throughout New York. New Jersey. Connecticut. and the whole midAtlantic region are still struggling to pick up the pieces after the most devastating storm in years. and Congress has a duty to help. As Ive said before. its never too late to do the right thing. I thought we might do this previously. but now is a good time to act. and hopefully today we will act. Earlier this month. we took action to help ensure that flood insurance benefits will be available for those still recovering from Sandy. Today. however. we must finish our work and take action on the comprehensive aid package that communities in the Northeast need to rebuild. This is not a moment for partisan difference or gimmicks. Amending these relief bills will make it harder to get aid to those who need it as soon as possible. The American people. especially those impacted by Sandy. will not look kindly on such delay. Congress appropriated $62.3 billion in emergency relief less than 2 weeks after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and the gulf coast in 2005. I voted for that. that was the right thing to do. As it was then. it is now the right thing to do. Theres no reason why the people of New York. New Jersey. and affected areas should have to wait any longer. This is a bipartisan effort. When Americans are in trouble. in pain. at risk. we respond. not as Republicans. not as Democrats. but as Americans. to their needs. We must pass these relief bills. So I urge my colleagues on both sides to oppose any amendments that diminish our ability to provide this muchneeded assistance. Only by setting party aside and coming together as fellow Americans and fellow Representatives can we achieve this goal. I urge all my colleagues. not only on my side of the aisle. but on the other side of the aisle. to join together to make sure that the relief necessary is given this day to this region for this storm.",

I note that DHS would receive $5.5 billion within the base $17 billion provision. accounting for only 54 percent of the administrations request for the Department. Also absent are $6.1 billion in emergency disaster relief and $300 million in disaster loans. Madam Chairman. without this additional $6.1 billion. FEMA estimates that the Disaster Relief Fund will run out of money in May of 2013. halting longterm rebuilding in places like Joplin and Tuscaloosa. Adopting only the $17 billion proposal does not even fully fund current Sandy estimates and. astonishingly. provides no funding for further disasters in 2013. The $17 billion package also shortchanges the Coast Guard by about half the request and doesnt include funding requested for CBP. ICE. or the Secret Service. Now. my Republican colleagues say that the supplementary $33 billion package will address my concerns. but requiring separate votes is designed either to doom the second bill or to pass it on the backs of Democrats while Tea Partiers are free to vote \"no.\" This is another example of Republicans playing politics with disaster aidthumbing their nose at the members of the Coast Guard decimated by Sandy and at the firefighters in Breezy Point trying to rebuild their devastated community.

In every year since 1997. with two exceptions. the Congress has recognized the need for emergency funds to respond to the impacts of natural disasters on the Nations water resource infrastructure. This year should be no different. The Frelinghuysen amendment includes a total of $5.35 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Of that. about $1.8 billion will be used to repair existing Federal facilities that were damaged in the storm and to restore projects to design standards. The roughly $3.4 billion remaining will be used by the Corps for the construction of projects intended to reduce future flood risk. Additionally. the Frelinghuysen amendment provides $88.3 million to repair facility and equipment damage to Department of Defense facilities in several States along the eastern seaboard. This is what we should be doing as a Nation. It is far less expensive to invest in preventing damage than it is to clean it up. We need to fund projects that result in the longterm sustainability of the impacted communities and reduce the economic costs and risks associated with disasters. Madam Chair. our country has provided billions of dollars in infrastructure funding for dams. schools and roads in Iraq and Afghanistan on an emergency basis.

While Im glad that were considering this bill today. it is a travesty that it has taken this long for the House of Representatives to allow a vote on disasterresponse funding. The money in this bill and the Frelinghuysen amendment is the minimum that New York. New Jersey. and elsewhere need for their recovery process. Im very concerned that there are several amendments that will be considered today that seek to cut further funding from the bill. At least one amendment seeks to offset the cost of this bill. Our Nation has never before attempted to offset the cost of disaster assistance. The Appropriations Committee and the House have always come together to help Americans in times of need without regard to costs. To offset costs here would effectively kill this bill in the Senate and further delay assistance that is desperately needed to New York City and elsewhere. The twostep process is the proper way to go. I just may add in closing that we in New York have always seen images of disasters in other areas. but we never imagine anything like this happening in our area. We understand what other folks have gone through. and I hope you understand the need we have to recover. The pain. the suffering. and the despair that people in our community feel is beyond anything we can imagine or we can imagine in New York. And so this aid will. at the minimum. immediately send a message that we care and we want something to happen positive and. in fact. people will be begin to recover. So I thank Mr. ROGERS and Mrs. LOWEY for bringing the bill to the floor. and I will ask folks to vote for both amendments and for the bill in general.",

Madam Chair. let me first start by saying thank you to the many. many colleagues on both sides of the aisle that have been working tirelessly. and a special thank you to their staff. not only the Rules Committee. but Appropriations and all those from New York and New Jersey. Many. many staffers have stayed up more than 24 hours to make this happen. I am indebted to them. and I know that the people of Staten Island are very. very grateful. This is a time that is unique in our history. We just started tearing down the homes in Staten Island. New York is tearing down 200. and they started in Staten Island. When I was there this past weekend. a mother came up to me. I asked her how she was doing. She said. Well. Im doing okay. but Im worried about my children. I said why. She said. Because they start crying hysterically when it rains. They cry when it rains because they think theres going to be another flood. and theyre scared. So at the end of the day when we debate the various amendments in the bill and its merits. all I ask is that everyone in this blessed Chamber remember that there are real peoplehuman beingsthat are behind all of this. and at the end of the day. if it were our families. I know that they would want them to be safe and healthy with the support of the entire country behind them. So. with that. I thank. again. my colleagues that have worked tirelessly.

Superstorm Sandy displaced thousands of children from their homes. leaving them homeless and struggling to regain stability in their lives. Many of these children were forced to move out of their school districts. while others could not return to their schools because of stormrelated damage. These children face the prospect of educational disruption. compounding the upheaval and trauma theyve already experienced. Fortunately. under the current law. the McKinneyVento Homeless Assistance Act. homeless students. including those displaced by disasters. are entitled to important educational protections and services. including transportation to stay in the same school. Public schools in New York. New Jersey. and Connecticut are working tirelessly to support uninterrupted education of displaced children through the McKinneyVento program. yet these schools face significant unexpected costs associated with the increased number of homeless students. Congress has appropriated supplemental funds. to help defer the costs associated with these increases. from past disasters. Mr. Chairman. if I might. given that the bill before us today does not contain direct funding for McKinneyVento. is it your understanding and intention that the Department of Health and Human Services and that the Department of Education work with the States of New York. New Jersey. and Connecticut to assist the school districts affected by Superstorm Sandy to access funds under the social services block grant to support the education of students displaced by the storm. including transportation. counseling. and supplies?",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise in favor of the Sandy relief packages being considered today. I want to thank Chairman ROGERS and the Appropriations Committee for their work to bring this bill to the floor in a responsible manner and address many of the concerns that some in this body have. I also want to take this opportunity once more to thank my colleagues for their work on yesterdays Sandy Relief Improvement Act that brought muchneeded reforms for our disaster relief systems. This bill that passed the House unanimously is a good first step in streamlining the disaster relief process and saving the country money and lives. These are the kinds of commonsense reforms that must continue to be a part of the disaster relief conversation. A little over a week ago. I voted against adding more debt to a failing system without reforms. Many of my colleagues joined me in that vote. and I know some still have reservations about the package before the House today. I have spoken to many of these colleagues. I understand concerns about the fiscal state of our Nation. I understand your position. and I respect your vote. But while we continue to do the responsible thing by looking for ways to pay for future disaster relief. we must do what is necessary to help those in the Northeast. and we must do it now. Let me just say. a vote for yesterdays reform package would pass the House unanimously. and a vote for todays relief package allows us to move forward in a way that begins to address muchneeded reforms while at the same time providing the immediate relief that Sandy victims so desperately need. I saw those needs up close and personal when I visited some of the hardest hit areas of New Jersey and New York last week. It brought back vivid images of Hurricane Katrina and the destruction that my home State of Mississippi experienced 7 years ago. Districts like those of my friends Congressman RUNYAN and Congressman GRIMM are similar to those along the gulf coast after Katrina. Their constituents experienced a terrible natural disaster. and they need our help. Today. we consider provisions that provide immediate relief for Sandy victims while allowing them to build forward. not just back. and that will strengthen these communities in the face of future storms. We cannot wait another 7 years. and we cannot wait until the next disaster before we take up these reforms. Todays vote for immediate relief is about giving the Sandy victims the help they need now. It is vital to the recovery efforts of the Northeast. it is vital to making our communities more resilient. and it is vital to ensuring better preparedness and response to future storms. So I urge my colleagues to support the disaster relief package.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Chairman ROGERS. Last week. I offered an amendment in the House Rules Committee to add additional funding for an Emergency Watershed Protection program to be used for any area that had a designated major natural disaster. Its an important program that allows for watershed and infrastructure restoration. Many parts of the western United States were devastated by wildfires last summer. including areas in my district. the Hyde Park fire near Colorado Springs and the Waldo Canyon fire. In Colorado alone. there were over 100.000 acres of land burned on both private and Federal land. as well as over 600 homes destroyed in these fires. The EWP program will help communities in other areas of the United States to rebuild and prevent future damage to people and property. Unfortunately. this bipartisan amendment offered with other members of the Colorado delegation did not get through the Rules Committee process. and so it will not be considered on the House floor today. The tragedy caused by Hurricane Sandy necessitates assistance from the Federal Government. but its also important that disaster assistance be available to other areas that experience natural disasters. particularly those when it comes to Federal lands. I ask the chairman to consider working with me and other Members for wildfire restoration.",

Mrs. LOWEY who. as good fortune would have it. also hails from New York and fully understands whats involved here. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Thats what all the Members of this body should have in their minds today themselves. If they were in the situation of the States that were so severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy. how would they vote? The fact is that natural disasters are occurring with more frequency and with greater severity. so there is a very good chance that in nearly every congressional district in this country this may happen to you. and of course. when it does. property values will go way down. In fact. billions of dollars can be lost. They certainly were with Hurricane Sandy. So where does the municipality get the money to repair? Likewise with the State. The only place you can turn to is the Federal Government. Thats why we are here. E pluribus unum. Were in this together. This is not about the Northeast versus the rest of the country. One part of our body. if you will. our body of States. has been severely injured. We need to repair that damage. Now. within the Interior and Environment appropriations. there is money for safe drinking water and sewer treatment projects. things that have to be done. We have to provide that money. I think we have about $1.5 billion to do that. We should accept the RogersFrelinghuysen amendment. This bill is whole with that amendment. We should strongly support it. There is an amendment to take away Mr. FRELINGHUYSENs effort to allow a waiver on historic preservation. Well. yes. it should be done. These localities dont have that kind of money. and a lot of the revenue that has traditionally come into these economies has come from tourism. Many tourists come to see historic structures. They come to see the way that many parts of the Northeast were when we were building the foundation of this country. That money should be made available in whole with Federal dollars. Mr. FRELINGHUYSENS amendment is right on point. It needs to be included. I do have a good speech written by Rick Healy. Thank you. Mr. Healy. Weve got wonderful staff.

    "speech": "I thank my friend for yielding. and I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my friend for working together to bring this product to the floor. Ive heard two objections to this bill. The first is that money is spent in the wrong places. and the second is the amount of money altogether is too costly. Let me try to address those objections. As to the money being spent in the wrong places. I would respectfully request that Members who have that objection read the legislation because. throughout the legislation. when it refers to the money to be spent. it says that the moneys are to be spent on necessary funds related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy. Now. there is one exception to this that Ive read. and it is limited to situations in which there were prior disasters that are not yet cleaned up. So this is a bill that deals almost exclusively with the Sandy disaster. and to the extent it does not. it deals with lingering problems in other parts of the country from those disasters. To those who would argue that the amount of money in the bill is just too much to begin with. I would offer you this question: If you were running a business and had 100 manufacturing plants and sales offices around the country and 15 of them were shut down by a stormso 15 percent of your available revenue was no longer available to youwhat would you do? Youd repair those 15 manufacturing facilities and sales offices as quickly as you could in order to restore the health of your company and the growth of your revenues. That is exactly what this bill does. The taxpayers of New York. Connecticut. and New Jerseythree Statescontribute more than 15 percent of the individual and corporate tax revenues collected in the United States of America15 percent from three States. If you shut down that engine of production. the whole country suffers. This is an occasion for the House of Representatives to rise above normal parochial politics.",

I congratulate her on assuming the ranking position on the Appropriations Committee and how good it is for our country and for the people affected by Superstorm Sandy that Congresswoman LOWEY. now Ranking Member LOWEY. is in the position she is to fight for their needs as the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. Thank you for your leadership. and thank you. Mr. ROGERS. for yours as well. This should be a day that we shed all of our disagreement about political differences and the rest and come together to prayerfully meet the needs of the people of our country. Whether its California with the earthquakes. drought. fire. floods. whatever. whether its Iowa with the floods. Joplin. Missouri. was so affected. of course the challenge of Katrina is emblazoned in our mind. and Hurricane Ike on the heels of that. all across our country we have experienced natural disasters which have had a direct impact on the lives of the American people. I really do believe that for all of the purposes that people send us to Congress or elect us to public office. whether it is a county executive or a Member of Congress. they expect us to do what is right for them when they are most in need of our help. Many things we can do for ourselves. but some things are just beyond the most determined. resourceful operational person to do. and that is when a natural disaster strikes. So while we have had our conversations about what should be in the bill and how the bill should be bifurcated. or in this case trifurcated and the rest of it. let us hope when we have this bill today. it will sweep away some of the concerns that people have about whether this assistance is going to actually show up. Seventynine days. Its been 79 days since Hurricane Sandy struck the region. Its been a onetwo punch. Last year it was Irene that struck much of the same area. and some of the people havent really fully recovered from that. whether it was a small business owner or homeowner. whatever. And now Sandy hit with just tremendous force. Others have talked about how do you mitigate for such a thing. how do we address issues that relate to climate change. Well save that conversation for another day. but recognize it is important in this discussion. How do you mitigate for rebuilding. and thats important in terms of the resources that were putting to bear on this problem. So let us today try to extract from the minds and the hearts and souls of the people who are affected any thought that the assistance will not be there. They know theres a lot of making up they have to do to restore the lives and businesses and homes that they had before. They should also know that when we say let us pray for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. were not just saying a prayer and saying that should be a substitute for us honoring our commitment as a country to our people. but that our prayers are accompanied by our best intentions and our best actionsactions. not just wordsfor them. This is one of the longest delays in congressional action in response to a major natural disaster in recent history. For many of us who have seen or can confirm the aftermath of a hurricane. tornado. earthquake. whatever. we know that every single day is too long to wait. Hope can never come fast enough. We cannot let another moment. hour. day go by without giving the biggest possible vote of confidence and hope to the people of New York. New Jersey. Connecticut. and some. I understand. in Pennsylvania. So weve had our say. Weve made our points known. The justification has been established. The documentation of need is clear. The bipartisan support of the Governor of New Jersey. the Governor of New York. the Governor of Connecticut and others stand ready to implement these resources with the most integrity. the most effectiveness. certainly the most speed. Witness the actions of the mayor of New York. I smile when I say that because mayors just like to get a job done. and Governors. too. So let us. as these executives and county executives and the rest weigh in. let us do our part to honor the social compact that we have with the American people that the Federal Government will be there in time of natural disasters. that this is an emergency and we recognize it as such. and that we honor the hopes. dreams. and aspirations of the people affected by it. I hope that we can have an overwhelming bipartisan vote. because from a practical standpoint. I think ideally. our sense of idealism. that would be the right thing to do. But as a practical matter. you just never know what Mother Nature may have in store for you in your region. and you would certainly want the embrace of the entire Nation around you and your area for your constituents. for your communities. for our country. So I urge a very strong bipartisan vote. I thank our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for making this vote today possible. Again. I urge an \"aye\" vote.",

While many were not able to see the destruction firsthand. everyone could see the devastating images and footage on TV. in newspapers. and over the Internet. Everyone was astonished by the magnitude of the damage.

Westchester to Long Island. from the coasts of New Jersey to Connecticut. so many peoples lives were wrecked by this powerful storm. While kind words are one thing. actions backing up those words are another. And today. finally. we have the opportunity to act. 79 days later. and after far too much politics. Congress is doing what the people of these communities needand what the American people demand: taking action. I am thankful this Congress is finally taking action to help the people of my district and all the millions of people hit hard by this hurricane. I want to thank all of my colleagues from New York. New Jersey. Connecticut. and Pennsylvania for our shared commitment to getting this done and never letting partisanship surrounding this debate divide us.

This is a good bill. and it deserves full bipartisan support of the entire House. I would urge any Democrat or Republican who is thinking about voting against any portion of this aid package to reconsider. For a moment. please put yourself in our shoesthe shoes of every family. every American who lost or suffered as a result of Hurricane Sandy. I do not wish what happened in my State on anyone. but the reality is the devastation that occurred in my backyard. throughout my district. across my State and to my constituents could happen anywhere at any time. If it does. you will want us. as a Congress. to stand together. to put aside politics and help your constituents. hardworking Americans. get back on their feet. Today. lets stand with our fellow Americans who are rebuilding by voting for the underlying bill and the Frelinghuysen amendment. Together. the passage of these two measures will ensure the U.S. Congress is providing real helpand not just lip serviceto all those hurt by this devastating hurricane.",

Those fights on those issues should be left for another day. It shouldnt be intermixed with the fight to get aid to the Superstorm Sandy victims. They should not be innocent pawns in this fight that we have in Congress. Ive been in this Congress for a while now. and I have voted for aid for all regions of our country. be it Katrina. be it floods and tornados. We didnt even think twice because that is what Americans do. We help our communities. help other Americans when there are natural disasters. New York is a donor State. We actually send more money to the Federal Government than we get back. and we do it because its the thing that we have to do. But now its our turn. Now we need help. and so now we say to the rest of America. please help us the way we helped you in your hour of need. The constituents in my district. in West Chester and the Bronx. and my former district in Rockland County are hurting very. very much. These are real people with real lives and real difficulties. So I beg my colleagues. please. dont vote for any poison pills that will kill this legislation.

New Jersey. Connecticut. and Pennsylvania. Its just not right. We can argue what role the Federal Government should play. whether its too big or too small or whatever. but no one should argue against the fact that. when Americans are in need. the Federal Government has a role in stepping in and helping them and providing for their needs.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. there is no doubt that Hurricane Sandy rendered unspeakable damage to lives and property on our East Coast. It truly represents one of the great natural disasters of recent history. For millions of our fellow citizens. the devastation has been unfathomable. We are a compassionate nation. and that is why the House of Representatives is taking up its second Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Sadly. Hurricane Sandy isnt the only disaster we face as a nation. The tragic reality is that our nation is broke. We have amassed more debt in the last four years than was accumulated from President George Washington through President Bill Clinton. Our spending trajectory is unsustainable by any account. Our swelling $16.4 trillion debt threatens our national security. our economic wellbeing and our childrens very future. If we dont quit spending money we dont have. it is they who will become the next victimsthink Greece. It is past time to reexamine the proper role of the federal government in providing disaster relief and how that relief is financed. In the wake of a tragedy like Hurricane Sandy. all agree. no matter what. that disaster victims must receive basic necessities like food. water. power. medicine and law enforcement. This is undebatable. Yet as we continue to borrow more than 30 cents on the dollar. much of it from the Chinese. can and should the federal government continue to fund the restoration of private homes. businesses and automobiles? When wealthy states like New York and Connecticut spent $4.7 million on streetscapes and $30 million a year in taxpayer funds to rent new office space while staterented office space stood vacant. can and should the federal government continue to pay to rebuild their infrastructure? According to a recent report by the Heritage Foundation. the yearly average for disaster declarations has grown from 28 during the Reagan administration to 90 during the Clinton administration. 130 during the George W. Bush administration. and 153 during the Obama administration. This isnt just nature at work. This is a move toward \"nationalizing\" disaster. consequently lowering the threshold of what is considered truly disastrous. This has allowed states and localities to abdicate more and more of their responsibilities to a federal government that owns a printing press for money and has no balanced budget requirements. Also. spending restraint is usually the first thing to go in the heat of a crisisespecially when someone else is picking up the tab. Case in point: The Sandy relief bill passed by the Democraticcontrolled Senate in the 112th Congressthe same Senate that has refused to pass a budget in the last three yearsincludes $150 million for fisheries as far away as Alaska. $8 million to purchase cars for the Homeland Security and Justice Departments. $58.8 million to replant trees that were damaged on private land. $135 million to improve weather forecasting. and $10.78 billion largely for future construction improvements to public transportation not even related to Hurricane Sandy. In fact. 64 percent of the socalled \"emergency\" funding in this bill will not be spent until 2015 or later. We must always be vigilant to ensure the Obama administrations cynical motto. \"never let a serious crisis go to waste.\" is not allowed to rule the day. Given our spendingdriven debt crisis. changes must be made. Like many members of Congress. when disaster has befallen my district or state. I have worked to help ensure funding was provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. However. I have consistently fought for disaster funds to either be in the budget or offset through the rescission of lowerpriority spending. A nation on the road to bankruptcy must prioritize its spending. There should be no more \"emergency\" disaster funding without offsetting cuts to lower priority spending. Next. the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) must be functionally and significantly reformed. I have long been critical of this ineffective. inefficient and indisputably costly experiment in governmentprovided flood insurance. The program operates with nonactuarial rates. encouraging unsustainable development and running up $21 billion in debt with zero hope of repayment. A reauthorization bill passed last year began eliminating outdated subsidies. but Sandy hit before many of these provisions could take effect. Certainly. we have a contractual obligation to pay the NFIP claims of people whose lives were turned upside down by this terrible storm. Yet we also have an obligation to ensure hardworking taxpayers arent always stuck bailing out failed government programs. The Financial Services Committee. which I chair. will take up legislation to get the government out of the subsidized insurance business and transition us to a private. stable insurance system that can keep the promises it makes without borrowing tens of billions of dollars that we do not have. America is not just operating on borrowed moneywere operating on borrowed time. Today. it is not a question of if bond markets will turn on us. but when. Unless we change our outofcontrol spending ways. we will be the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with less freedom. fewer opportunities and a lower standard of living. We have no greater moral responsibility than to preserve the blessings of liberty and opportunity for future generations. A compassionate nation will not allow a great physical tragedy of today to ever become an even greater fiscal tragedy for our children tomorrow.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I strongly support the provision of immediate federal relief to the victims of Hurricane Sandy and other disasters. We absolutely have a responsibility to provide targeted resources to help communities meet their true emergency needs following a natural disaster. But I remain convinced that we can. and should. put in the tough work to do this in a fiscally responsible manner. This means finding a way to pay for what we spend. Our national debt currently exceeds $16.4 trillionand grows by billions of dollars each day. This is a symptom of Washingtons inability to live within its means. and unless we reform the way Washington has traditionally gone about its business. this debt is going to dramatically limit the potential of our children and grandchildren. We must do better. As I have traveled throughout Kentuckys Sixth District. people have asked me repeatedly to stand firm for common sense and fiscal responsibility. This is what families and small businesses in my district do every day. and this is the mentality that we need to start bringing to Washington. The Federal Government spent a massive $3.6 trillion in fiscal year 2012. so there are clearly savings that we can find. I am willing to do that work. and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well. Congress should not use the urgency of disaster relief as its excuse for continuing to run up our $16.4 trillion national debt.",

Last month. the Administration requested $60.4 billion in federal aid to provide financial assistance to homeowners and businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy. Back on December 28. 2012. the Senate passed a $61 billion comprehensive aid package for the victims and communities by a vote of 6232. I am pleased that this body was able to pass H.R. 41. a $9.7 billion dollar bill which temporarily increased the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program. Now that the President has signed H.R. 41. victims of Superstorm Sandy are finally able to receive some muchneeded relief from the federal government.

    "speech": "Thank you for the opportunity to the chairman and the ranking member. I want to make it very clear what this amendment is and what this amendment is not. This amendment is not about delay. This amendment is not about offering a poison pill to the underlying bill. This amendment is not about preventing money from going where it is very desperately needed. I want that to happen. I want these folks who need this money to get it. I live in an area that is hurricaneprone. I have lived through hurricanes myself. I have lived through floods myself. I have waded through chesthigh water full of snakes and human waste to get into my own business. Ive been able to take advantage of and to use. to rebuild a small business. a small business disaster loan. I want the money to go where it needs to go. Im here for one reason and one reason only today. Madam Chair. and that is to talk about how we can pay for it. Thats it. There was a time when we didnt have to have this conversation. There was a time back during Hurricane Hugo in the late 1980s where we didnt have to talk about how to pay for disaster assistance because the deficit was only $3 trillion. But weve so badly mismanaged our money after that. that by the time we got to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. that we actually did start talking about offsetting and paying for disaster relief and paid for and offset about 40 percent of it. But we didnt learn. We didnt learn from those mistakes. and weve continued to mismanage our money and to run up our deficit to such a point now where its $16 trillion today. and it is incumbent upon us to have the discussion about whether or not we have the money to do this and whether or not its important enough to us to pay for it. I wish very much that we werent here today. I wish very much that we could pass this and easily borrow the money without any questions whatsoever. but weve wasted that opportunity. Weve mismanaged our own finances to the point where we are now no longer capable of taking care of our own. Think about that for a second. In the United States of America. we do not have enough money to take care of our own citizens who need it. Theres no rainy day fund. Theres no savings. What ability we had to borrow money we blew through several years ago with trillion dollar deficits. We dont have enough money saved up to take care of our own people. and thats wrong. Its absolutely wrong. It is important to me that this money goes to the folks who need it very badly. Its so important to me that I think we should pay for it. I think we should be willing. as a body. to come together and say. Look. there are things that we do not need this year. things that we can do without this year so that the people in New York and New Jersey and Connecticut and the other States who so badly need the money can have it. without us having to go hatinhand to other nations of this world and say. Would you please lend us money so that we can take care of our folks who need it so badly? I hope the amendment passes. I hope the amendment passes so that I can vote for the bill. I want this money to go where it is so desperately needed. But the time has come and gone in this Nation when we can walk in here one day and spend $9 billion or $17 billion or $60 billion and not think about whos paying for it. This is important money. Its important to you. its important to me. and its important to everyone in here. But its important enough for us to pay for it ourselves. For that reason. I encourage passage of this amendment and passage ultimately of the underlying bill. With that. I would yield 11/2 minutes to the gentleman from California",

The question before us now is whether were going to spend $17 billion in this bill-$50 billion when its amendedwithout even pretending that we can pay for it. The gentleman from South Carolinas amendment proposes that we actually recognize that our government is facing a fiscal crisis of unprecedented dimensions and at least pay for the $17 billion in the Rogers bill. I dont like acrosstheboard cuts. which treat our highest priorities the same as our lowest priorities. but the Rules Committee disallowed the gentleman from South Carolinas specific offsets like repealing remaining TARP funds and ending bonuses to Federal employees who take transit to work. And the fact is if Members believe that a 1.6 percent cut to discretionary spending is draconian. they should be just as leery of a 1.6 percent increase in spending to pay for nonemergency. nonSandyrelated programs in the Rogers bill. In the last 10 years. inflation and population have grown 39 percent. our revenues have grown 37 percent. but our spending has grown 64 percent. In light of that. a 1.6 percent cut to pay for this bill. which we are assured is our highest priority. seems like a very modest measure.",

Many have seen their homes. their livelihoods. and their communities decimated beyond belief. It is the Federal responsibilityand in fact our responsibility as human beingsto help those victims in this unexpected catastrophe. In doing so. we must expend some Federal dollars. I dont take spending this money lightly. Our country faces a deficit crisis. as the gentleman from South Carolina has said. a deficit crisis of huge proportions. with an economy thats fighting to recover. and any expenditure must be weighed against all other needs facing our Nation. Now. I dont take a back seat to anyone when it comes to cutting spending. Since Ive chaired this committee the last 2 years. weve cut $100 billion off of discretionary spending. 2 years in a row. going on a third. Thats not happened since World War II. So I know whereof I speak. In this case. Madam Chair. the needs are very desperately clear. We must provide this emergency funding. as we are allowed by law. without the devastating slashandburn cuts elsewhere that this amendment would cause. The amendment before us would slash nearly $20 billion from discretionary spending this year alone. totally indiscriminate. unspecific. cutting the good and the bad. completely abdicating the responsibility of Congress to determine where spending should or should not occur. To put this in perspective. this amendment contains a cut to regular discretionary spending that is about the size of the entire agriculture discretionary budget for the year. It is about the equivalent of eliminating all discretionary funding for the Department of Transportation or the full annual budgets of the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Patrol combined. As written. this amendment is an acrosstheboard cut that holds no program safe from harm. Defense spending. which is already facing potentially devastating sequestration cuts. is cut by another $10 billion. It would cut war funding by $1.6 billion. directly affecting our troops who are putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan and other areas of conflict. This amendment also cuts funding for our veterans by $200 million. potentially endangering the quality of their care and making a statement that Congress is willing to go back on commitments to our vets. And the list of other unwise cuts and side effects go on. Finally. this amendment goes against the precedent of previous emergency supplementals. which did not contain these extreme offsets.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment that would address concerns in funding the Regional Ocean Partnership program under NOAA that is included in the underlying amendment. Let me tell you what this amendment is not. It is not a poison pill designed to stop funding for Sandy relief. It is not an amendment designed to delay aid to Sandy victims. It is not an amendment designed to stop the muchneeded aid to Sandy victims. All the amendment does is it stops the ability to allow a crisis to be used by the White House to fund Executive Order 13547. which is basically to zone the oceans. Funding for that could be used for purposes like this: to regulate economic activity in the Mississippi River watershed. And you could see that none of the money thats used for this program would be used to help Sandy relief. So thats just an example of what it would do. According to the NOAA Web site. the Regional Ocean Partnership grant program was developed to advance effective coastal and ocean management through regional ocean governance. including the goals for national ocean policy or. in other words. Executive Order 13547. set out in the Presidents final policy of the Interagency Ocean Task Force. dated July 19. 2010. Again. back to the Executive order. This amendment is essentially the same amendment that was passed that was part of the CJS appropriations bill that passed by a bipartisan vote of 246174 last May. Now. we can all agree that ocean planning is a good thing. However. that needs to be done through the normal appropriations process when approved by Congress. and not through an executive order by the President. The Natural Resources Committee has held hearings. under the leadership of Chairman Doc HASTINGS. to ask the administration where theyre getting the funding to implement national ocean policy. They have not responded with any answers to that. and now theyre using this crisis as a way to come up with funding of $150 million to basically fund all of these agencies in the Presidents effort to zone the oceans. We think that thats inappropriate. And again. this is not to stop Sandy aid. Its not to delay Sandy aid. Its not to be a poison pill for Sandy aid. Its only designed to stop the use of this crisis to fund a program that this Congress did not intend to have an effect. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This program is also voluntary and Stateled. with individual States opting into the program. In the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy. there is a MidAtlantic Regional Council that was established by midAtlantic Governors in 2009. These Governors work together to address coastal issues and mitigate future risks. State universities like Rutgers University in New Jersey also receive funding through States to work and coordinate with States to determine how to best mitigate future disaster risks.

The program will help support the development and implementation of priority actions identified in plans of regional ocean partnerships. Support will include the development of comprehensive Coastal and Marine Spatial Plans.\" i.e.. Executive Order 13547. So. yes. this program was around before during the Bush administration. but it has changed under the Obama administration. and now theyre using this Sandy relief as a methodology to fund this program which. again. was never authorized directly by Congress. There were two rounds of grant requests that were granted by NOAA in 2012. Only one went to a State. and that was to the State of Hawaii Department of Business. Economic Development and Tourism. and the Office of Planning. Here are the NGOs and outside groups that did get money from this. though: The Nature Conservancy. the Smith River National Recreation Area. the University of Hawaii. the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium. and others.

This funding. found in the Frelinghuysen amendment. is for work that is already underway as part of a yet unfinished stateoftheart weather satellite system. It is my understanding that this particular amount is meant to speed up the preparations needed to get ready for data that will come from these new weather satellites. which are set to be launched 2 to 5 years from now. Madam Chairman. our hearts go out to the victims that are suffering from the devastation from Hurricane Sandy. However. in the wake of large storms like this. governments kneejerk reaction is often to throw money at forecasting or storm modeling in order to prevent widespread damage in the future. Unfortunately. even with the best imaginable forecasting systems. we would not have been able to prevent the structural damages which resulted from this particular storm. Yet here we are debating funding for a project due to go online years from now in an emergency supplemental bill. which is meant to provide aid to those who are still suffering in the wake of Sandy. For fiscal year 2013. the National Weather Service received a total of $991 million. Thats $20 million over their initial request. NOAA is expected to ask for additional funding for this particular project over the next 2 yearsnearly $15 million in fiscal year 2014 and $18 million in fiscal year 2015. the year the first new satellite is due to launch. It appears that the funding included in the Frelinghuysen amendment is simply meant to get the ground portion of this project finished just a little bit faster. Madam Chairman. I dont wish to argue the merits of this project. and I agree that if we have the ability to improve our forecasting infrastructure. we ought to do it. but this is not the time nor the place. The time for this projectand other projects like it which are funded in the Frelinghuysen amendmentis during the normal appropriations process. While I offered seven other amendments to the Rules Committee which would have removed similar nonemergent spending totaling over $300 million. unfortunately. only this amendment made it to the House floor. Im disappointed that none of my other amendments to cut excessive spending were allowed. I was hopeful that the start of a new Congress would usher in a new dedication to cutting wasteful. duplicative. unnecessary spending. Unfortunately. it looks like it is business as usual. That said.

What it means on the ground. all across our country. when there is a severe weather incident. it means that we will have better information for evacuation purposes. if needed. Its about $1 million a mile to evacuate. Its about saving lives. So when the gentleman. who is the maker of this amendment. said that he wished we could do this faster and hes not opposed to us having better information. then I join with him in part. in that part. because this is about providing necessary information to the American public about severe weather incidents and saving lives.

Now. the ground readiness program means that weather satellite signals can be collected on the ground and those data can be used in operational models and forecasts. This satellite data is critical for forecasting hurricanes. In fact. the National Weather Service used data from these NOAA satellites to accurately predict the scope and the path of Hurricane Sandy. Now. this amount is a relatively small dollar amount in the overall disaster relief bill. but this amendment is of outsized importance in its misguided intent. A recent study showed that without the polar satellite data from the weather models. the forecasters would have said Sandy would stay out at sea. would not have hit the midAtlantic coast. Imagine how much worse the storm damage would have been if the emergency management officials said it would never make landfall. Its hard to overestimate how important accurate forecasts are. Lets accelerate the program. not slow it down. Its completely nonsensical to impair the ability of the National Weather Service to predict accurately.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. this Nations debt now stands in excess of $16 trillion. This is an amount of debt greater than our Nations economy. exceeding our GDP. and yet. Madam Chair. we have on the floor today legislation which piles upon our children and grandchildren even greater burdens of debt. Madam Chair. its time to end the credit card economics. We simply cannot afford to continue to spend money that were borrowing from countries like China on line items that we dont need and that Congress isnt constitutionally authorized to spend. Madam Chair. my amendment strips one such line item out of this bill. This is really low hanging fruit. You see. this Sandy relief effort was plussed up. or increased. by $1 million to boost Legal Services Corporation. funding masquerading as disaster relief. And I thought we had a ban on earmarks in this Congress. Why is a bailout for New York lawyers emergency hurricane relief? Even if you believe this is a legitimate government programwhich I dont. by the waybut how can you argue with a straight face that spending on lawyers is legitimate emergency spending? Madam Chair. let me say again. were $16 trillion in debt. Were $16 trillion in debt. America. We simply cannot afford to continue like this. We cannot keep spending money that we dont have on things that we cant afford and all the while sending our children and our grandchildren the bill. What part of $16 trillion in debt do you all not understand? I sincerely hope that my colleagues will take this opportunity to start to get serious about reining in our spending addiction. This amendment is a tiny step in that direction. Its only $1 million. A million dollars is brushed off as not a lot of money to haggle over here in Congress. but let me tell you. $1 million is a lot of money to the average American. But in this House. thats barely a blip on the radar screen. This amendment will cut 6 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of the Federal debt. It isnt that much. but at least its a start. The journey of 1.000 miles begins with a single step. Madam Chair. and we need to take that step today. This is a program that should no longer exist with Federal dollars. This program hasnt been reauthorized by the U.S. Congress since 1980. 33 years33 yearsof unauthorized appropriations. Madam Chair. Are we going to continue like its business as usual? The GAO has criticized LSC over its internal controls and lack of accountability in their financial reporting processes and systems. yet. year after year. we keep throwing money at them. We cannot keep doing things the same way and expect anything other than the same result: deeper and deeper in debt. with a bill that my sons and their children andhopefullymy grandchildren and maybe their children will get stuck with. Today. lets at least not throw more good money after bad by wasting another $1 million on an unauthorized giveaway to attorneys. Please support my amendment. It will strip $1 million from this bill and prevent any \"emergency spending\" to pay for attorneys that should be paid for by private citizens in the private sector.

The Legal Services Corporation exists precisely to help meet the civil legal needs of lowincome Americans. and the Legal Services Corporation assistance is never more important than following a major disaster. Since Sandy hit. legal aid programs in New York and New Jersey have set up recovery hotlines. staffed FEMA disaster recovery centers. partnered with other State and local organizations to conduct disaster assistance training. and participated in clinics to provide legal counseling to affected communities. Local legal service programs are helping families obtain emergency food stamps. disasterrelated unemployment insurance benefits and FEMA benefits to pay for rent and other expenses. The funding this amendment proposes to eliminate would enable local organizations to purchase the needed mobile resources and equipment and to hire the coordinators they need to manage volunteers.

This is one of those amendments that simply strikes out at a government agency not realizing the harm it causes the people. The impact is particularly severe for lowincome families. individuals who are unable to afford the kind of legal assistance they might need to help them recover. Since Sandy. legal aid programs have been on the front lines of disaster assistance. and they will be providing legal assistance for Sandy victims for years to come. Theyve been dealing with FEMA assistance. with SNAP benefits. with unemployment benefits. along with legal issues related to evictions and housing problems. but the need for legal assistance will not end there. In future months and perhaps even years. cases involving FEMA appeals. bankruptcy. fair housing. and public housing issues will arise. Contractor fraud scams will proliferate as Sandy victims start receiving cash payments from insurance proceeds and housing repair grants. Legal aid programs will be called on to provide help. and more than ever now we need this kind of assistance. Whats interesting about this amendment is that its not an amendment really directed at the funding as much as it is at the whole Legal Services Corporation. It is an attempt to attack an agency that stands up for those who cant defend themselves. Interestingly enough. this was Richard Nixons proudest program. He believed. at that time. as many have after him. that the poor needed a way to defend themselves in our courts. To go after this funding is not to go after a million dollars. Lets be honest. Its to go after the corporation. It is illtimed. it is wrong. it is unfair. and we should reject it by a majority. if not by a unanimous vote. The Acting CHAIR.

The amendment is a simple clarification to ensure that the Frelinghuysen amendment doesnt put taxpayers on the hook for 100 percent of the cost of projects that are unrelated to Hurricane Sandy. The amendment waives the standard local costshare for ongoing construction projects. This applies to beach renourishment projects. which are typically costshared at a 65 percent Federal and 35 percent local share. While the waiving of this local costshare for this type of project is unprecedented. I understand that for our friends in New Jersey. New York. and Connecticut. Hurricane Sandy was also unprecedented. Our amendment does not change the language with respect to repairing the beaches damaged by Hurricane Sandy. but unfortunately the language could be interpreted to also waive local costshare for future periodic beach replenishment unrelated to any damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. These typically can take up to over a 50year period and can cost tens of millions of dollars. Im confident that is not what was intended by the amendment as it was offered. But the amendment is necessary to make sure that thats not how its interpreted at some point in the future. Madam Chair. my heart goes out to the communities in the Northeast that have been devastated by Hurricane Sandy. I have strongly supported the efforts of the people in the region to step forward and be fully compensated to be able to have a robust package. Im sorry that its delayed. and I commend the leadership that has been displayed on both sides of the aisle. I strongly support having the Federal Government provide assistance for people not only to recover. but to rebuild in a way that is stronger and safer. But it does not make sense to use this legislation to change standard. nonFederal costshare procedures for projects unrelated to Hurricane Sandy. Doing so. I think. would be fiscally irresponsible. and it decrease local communities involvement and investment in local projects that primarily benefit them and Im afraid might be a reason for opposition for legislation that I hope passes.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. my amendment seeks to ensure maximum transparency in a process which will see billions of taxpayer dollars distributed through FEMA grants. While I appreciate that a provision was included to require the disclosure of grants over $1 million. I believe we owe it to the taxpayers to do even more. My amendment strikes the $1 million threshold for disclosure. and it requires the details of all grants distributed under FEMAs disaster relief program to be disclosed. Recently. a town in California was the subject of a FEMA Inspector General investigation. The FEMA IG found that the grantee received $830.000 following a recent flood. The town in question spent all of the allocated grant money and has requested reimbursement for $769.000 more. Among the inappropriate expenditures were a host of purchases that had nothing to do with the equipment damaged by the flood. including new chairs. computers. telephones. lamps. and a microwave. FEMA rejected the claim. fining these and numerous other attempts to claim reimbursement outside of the scope of the flood as well as outside of the terms of the grant. While I commend FEMA for catching this attempted fraud. the sheer volume of grants that will come as a result of Sandy necessitates maximum transparency at the beginning of the process. My amendment requires just that. Let me give you one other example. According to a September 2012 Department of Homeland Security IG report. I quote: Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and other disasters up to December 31. 2010. FEMA disbursed more than $8 billion in assistance payments. some of which were later determined to have been improperly paid to individuals who were ineligible or who received duplicate payments. The debts in question arose in part because FEMA relaxed its internal controls in order to provide the expedited delivery of assistance grants to displaced disaster survivors. The relaxed internal controls involved improper payments of as much as $621 million to 167.488 recipients. According to the report. FEMAs efforts to recoup these improper payments resulted in $1.3 million collected thus far. but they spent $7.3 million to collect themagain. costing the taxpayers a net of $6 million. Why repeat a process like this if we can avoid it? The paperwork is already being done on disaster relief grant applications. Theyre already being recorded on a computer somewhere in FEMA. so there are already disclosure procedures in place that can quickly and appropriately bring forward this information. According to the CBO. this amendment will have no budgetary impact. It simply does not create an undue burden to make the list public in a timely fashion. I ask my colleagues to join me in injecting 100 percent transparency and accountability at the beginning of the process in order to help root out waste and fraud.",

McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. The Stewart McKinney refuge is a complex of 10 separate units composed of over 800 acres that are stretched across the Connecticut shoreline. My amendment specifically addresses the request of the Fish and Wildlife Service to spend nearly $10 million to rebuild buildings and a seawall on one of the 10 units known as the Outer Island. The Service acquired this property through a private donation in 1995. Since that time. as a result of a memorandum of understanding. the island has been managed by Southern Connecticut State University. which provides access and guided educational activities to visiting school groups during the summer months. which is the only time Outer Island is actually open. In fact. the Southern Connecticut State University Web site is clear: All schools. university. community. and civic associations or other parties interested in participating in educational activities on Outer Island must have prior approval of the Connecticut State University System coordinators. While the Fish and Wildlife Service has no staff on Outer Island. the university utilizes paid interns and faculty coordinators to supervise the educational programming. An occasional kayaker may stop and have lunch on the island. but if you want to visit the Outer Island. you must coordinate your visit with the university and not with the Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition. the university received a $250.000 grant from the Long Island Sound Fund. Madam Chairman. last Friday members of my staff met with representatives of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Service has confirmed that they do not charge the university for what amounts to almost the exclusive use of the island. Furthermore. the Service did not provide at any time any analysis or breakdown on how they will spend $9.8 million of our taxpayers money. In fact. the only information they provided was a oneline explanation that the money will be used to remove debris deposited by storm floodwaters and to repair seawalls and buildings. Frankly. this is totally inadequate. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries. Wildlife. Oceans and Insular Affairs. my subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Fish and Wildlife Service. I intend to conduct our annual budget hearing in March of this year. This request does not belong in an emergency spending bill. and the money should not be in any way appropriated until we get a better understanding of how the $9.8 million will be spent. I am also interested in hearing why this Service does not charge the university for using the island and why they should not be assessed a portion of the repair costs. which benefits them far more than the general public or certainly the taxpayers of the United States.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise in strong and vociferous opposition to what I view as a misguided amendment. It aims to cut funding that would help repair the seawalls and research buildings damaged by Superstorm Sandy at the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge in Connecticut. This is a vindictive amendment. in my view. that needlessly slashes disaster relief for one particular State. and I urge its defeat. Named after the former Republican Congressman from my State. the Stewart McKinney Wildlife Refugee spans 70 miles of Connecticut shoreline. including 800 acres of island habitats. a beach. and tidal wetlands. One of the more remarkable aspects of the McKinney Refuge is a chain of seven islands along the coast. The islands support habitat for several federally endangered and threatened species and also hosts related research facilities. These islands are key stops for birds migrating along the Atlantic Flyway. and two of them have been named \"important bird areas\" by the National Audubon Society. Some of these islands are also in close proximity to urban centers. All of them sustained severe damage during Superstorm Sandy. For example. the storm damaged the dock. seawall. and education building on the Outer Island research station. which is also the most visited island within the McKinney Refuge. As a result. the natural resources on Outer Island cannot currently be properly managed. On Outer Island. the lack of repairs will have serious environmental consequences. If the seawall isnt repaired. erosion will undermine the foundation of the main building. dislodge the septic tank and cause significant contamination. and will lead to major repair costs. Thats why we need to make available disaster aid to the McKinney Refuge so that they can recover from this storm. just as we have many times in the past for other refuges affected by disasters all across this country. Let me give you some examples. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008. we appropriated $71 million for wildlife refuges in Texas. $20 million in Mississippi. and $74 million for refuges in Louisiana. the sponsor of this amendments home State. One of the central responsibilities of this institution is to act on behalf of the American people whenever a major disaster occurs. Federal disaster relief is meant to restore homes. businesses. communities. and Federal facilities to their predisaster condition. We do this whether the disaster is a fire in the west. a tornado in the south. or a hurricane in the northeast. There is no good reason to make an exception of the McKinney Refuge here. The sponsor of this amendment. Congressman FLEMING of Louisiana. has argued that this bill includes $9.8 million solely to repair the damage done at the Outer Island. This is simply not true. The Fish and Wildlife Service requested over $10.9 million for repairs to the McKinney Refuge. including just over $2 million for Outer Island. The rest of the funds. however. would support repairs all along the 70 miles of affected Connecticut coast. By cutting the funding needed to rebuild the Connecticut coastline to its preSandy condition. this amendment prevents the McKinney Refuge from meeting its Federal commitment to conserve wildlife. to provide education and outdoor recreation for the public. and it unfairly singles out Connecticut and all of the protected wildlife along our shores. Is the State and refuge somehow unworthy of Federal support? Its a terrible precedent for disaster aid. When these disasters occur. we have always come together as a Nation of Americans. just as we did after Katrina and Andrew and Irene. and we should not change that now. I urge my colleagues to reject what I view as a pernicious amendment and help Connecticuts McKinney Refuge rebuild from this storm.",

However. the gentlelady is incorrect: the university informed us that the vast amount of damage actually came from Hurricane Irene and not from Sandy. Now as to the other $8 million. it goes to about six different islands that are rarely. if ever. touched by humans. It is for coastline restoration. So what you have is basically $10 million. $2 million of which is to repair damage from a previous hurricane for which there has not been a request.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. like all of my colleagues. I come before you today very concerned about my fellow Americans whose lives were torn apart in October of 2012 due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Sandy. like many natural disasters before it. has caused billions of dollars of damage and has upended the lives of thousands of Americans. Congress gathers here today to consider a very important question: Exactly what is the role of the Federal Government in rebuilding our communities following a natural disaster? Like many of my colleagues. I believe the Federal Government must be a strong partner in responding to natural disasters. but local communities must lead the way in making the important decisions. Only local communities have the firsthand knowledge to prioritize how precious resources should be spent following a natural disaster. While the Federal Government can and should be a partner. it must be just thata partner. Madam Chair. the Federal Government currently plans ahead and budgets for natural disasters. We have an entire agency. FEMA. dedicated to managing these disasters. Perhaps Congress should have a more comprehensive discussion on how to better budget and prepare for natural disasters. but we cant use one hurricane as an excuse to fund or enhance programs that would normally go through the regular appropriations process. Local communities and property owners impacted by Hurricane Sandy face tough choices. They must prioritize and decide what projects will be rebuilt and in which order. One of the provisions in the underlying Frelinghuysen amendment provides for an additional $50 million in grants from the Historic Preservation Fund for necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricane Sandy. Currently. these types of grants typically require a nonFederal match. The Frelinghuysen amendment strikes the nonFederal match requirement for the Sandy funds. Madam Chair. my amendment would not reduce any of the supplemental funding provided for in the underlying amendment. Again. the amendment does not reduce the supplemental funding. My amendment simply restores the provision that the nonFederal match be applied. as normally required by the National Park Service. In actual practice. this would make the funds more widely available for a larger number of citizens. My amendment is about good government and good investments. It simply ensures that local communities have \"skin in the game\" and truly support the grants that they apply for. If a local community is truly supportive of rebuilding a project. they will band together and find a match. whether it be a local municipality. State government. or private nonprofit. I understand that those opposed to the amendment will say that the impacted property owners require emergency funding. They will argue that in order to obtain the funds. stakeholders should be released of the obligations of a nonFederal match. as many are struggling to get by. To this. Id like to remind you that our government is still borrowing over 40 cents for every dollar it spends. Just as families must prioritize their budgets. the Federal Government must learn to make adjustments. Federal grants should not be about having fancy consultants or great grant writers. These type of programs should come down to one thing: local support for a project. The ability to provide a nonFederal match ensures community support for those projects. We should no longer waive requirements that ensure local communities will support their efforts. This is about good government and ensuring fiscal responsibility now and in the future. It is my hope that you will join me in supporting this amendment to ensure that this good guiding principle of good government is continued. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the very distinguished gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership overall on this bill. but particularly for thinking to waive the nonFederal match. and Ill explain why. Im sure the gentleman from Michigans effort is wellintentioned. but many of the buildings damaged by Hurricane Sandy were historic structures. and their repair will be very expensive. Now. your amendment would make it cost prohibitive. Mr. BENISHEK. to repair or rebuild these historic structures. The Interior Department has told us that if the Benishek amendment passes. the historic preservation funds will be almost impossible to spend in the 2year timeframe. The regular historic preservation matching requirement is 60 Federal/40 nonFederal. If there is a 60/40 match requirement for the States affected by Hurricane Sandy. the State Preservation Offices will not be able to meet the matching requirement. These offices are already struggling financially. and have challenges meeting the match under normal circumstances. If they got the money without the waiver. the $50 million that we provide in this bill would sit in an administrative morass while we tried and then likely failed to spend it. So we would be funding nothing but Federal overhead for 2 years. The language in the Frelinghuysen amendment. like the Senate bill. limits Historic Preservation Grant funding to those 10 States that received the Stafford Act Major Disaster declaration. The density of historic structures in Sandyimpacted States is far higher and the damage far greater than any storm in recent memory. In New York State alone there were 51.587 structures on the National Historic Register that received a direct hit from Hurricane Sandy. These are structures of national significance. Likewise. in New Jersey and Connecticut. These structures include such wellknown sites as the South Street Seaport Museum and the Coney Island Historic District. as well as thousands of other structures. which while perhaps not being as wellknown. are no less important. So the fact is that many private homeowners. businesses. and communities. they take pride in their historic structures. These historic structures bring tourists to their communities. They help generate economic revenue. We should not penalize them as they try to recover from this disaster by making them sacrifice the historic character of their homes. their businesses. and communities. So I support Mr. FRELINGHUYSENS provision of waivers in his amendment for this special category of grants. and I ask my colleagues to vote against the Benishek amendment.",

And I think thats just a better way of prioritizing the increase in spending for the historic preservation fund in this method. I think weve seen in previous disasters where Federal money has been just wasted. And I think that having community input and community donations to this would ensure that the money will go as far as it can and be put to the most effective use determined by local input.

    "speech": "Thank you. Madam Chair. I appreciate your kindness and hope that your ears are very gentle today. Unlike some of the other amendments. this particular amendment does not reduce the amount appropriated in the basic underlying bill. What it does try to say is that the money needs to be used where the money needs to be used. It limits the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture from using any funds from this emergency appropriation for the purchase of additional Federal land. When Sandy hit. the Statue of Liberty. Ellis Island. Governors Island. Morris Park. Sagamore Hill. they were not spared from what took place. The Statue of Liberty is closed. It is not open to the public. It is in desperate need of repair. What I want to make sure is that the money we put for the repair of the Federal estate is used for the repair of the Federal estate. Unfortunately. in an effort to try and do that. there was some loose language. Even though it attempts to put some parameters on where this money can be used. embedded in the language is the phrase that the Secretary of the Interior may transfer these funds to any other account in the Department and may expend such funds in a myriad of ways to try and come up with something. Unfortunately. we were given. or made aware of. an unofficial wish list which would actually have used some of the money designed for the repair of these desperate issues to be used for the purchase of property not currently under the control of the Federal Government. That is the practice we wish to curtail. If you want to buy more Federal land. thats the icing on the cake. That should go through regular order. That is not emergency spending. So with this particular money. it needs to be used where it is necessary. It does not prohibit the Army Corps of Engineers or the GAO from using certain funds as necessary to prohibit any kind of relief or human suffering. It simply says youre not going to buy extra land with the money that is already identified for the need of repairing what we already own. The National Park Service has given us a list of what they need to do. It consumes the money that is in that approach to it. If you decide not to restrict this and allow them to have the flexibility of purchasing other land. something from this list that is essential has to come off. and thats not right. All were trying to say is use this money to make sure that we put it where it deserves to be. to end the suffering and repair the public property that we already own.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I oppose the Bishop amendment which. as he says. prohibits the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture from using funds made available under this act from any land acquisition. There is no attempt by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to use the funds made available under the bill for any kind of Federal land grab. However. there are instances when land acquisition can be part of a costeffective solution to repairing the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. For example. we have Interior and Agriculture facilities in lowlying areas that were destroyed by the hurricane. If either Department wants to move any of those facilities to higher ground to protect them from future hurricanes and that higher ground is not owned by the Federal Government. then the Bishop amendment prohibits the Secretaries from buying that land. So we go through the whole thing all over again. They make an assessment. If they realize that this building isnt going to withstand another hurricane. they should be able to move it to land where its more appropriate. but you couldnt do it if you have the Bishop amendment. We also had tidal wetlands that were destroyed that included private lands. Under the Bishop amendment. these private lands could not be acquired as part of a comprehensive effort to restore these wetlands to their natural condition. The private landowners need us to do that. They cant restore them. but the wetlands need to be restored. So this simply gives the two Departments the ability to act in a rational manner to restore the shoreline. The Bishop amendment is a solution in search of a problem.

Emergency funds should not be used to circumvent the process we already have in place. including the preservation of environmental standards. simply to do that. Here is the bottom line: if you dont accept this amendment. because the National Park Service has already told us what they will do with this money. if they are allowed because of some pressure from wherever source to purchase excess land with this money. which of these projects are we going to take off? Do you want to go to Liberty Island and take off the storm drain cleanage or the removing of the debris. the mold remediation. the hazardous debris removal. the removal of storm debris. the replacing of water fountains on Ellis Island. the repairing of the Battery Park screening site tent? The money is already identified here. This is where it should go. This is the emergency. For heavens sake. make it very clear that the money thats going to be given for an emergency is used to repair what was caused in the emergency. and do not have any loose ends that will circumvent regular order. If indeed there needs to be longterm changes of where administrative buildings are to be built. go through the regular order. Thats the process we have. That should be the way of doing things.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I know Mr. BISHOP has been involved in the legislative process long enough to know that process and regular order can be one of the most facile ways of preventing anything from getting done. I will not challenge him now to tell us how many things have been held up that thought they could get through regular order in a reasonable period of time. We have an emergency here. This is urgent. to repair these seashores. The fact is that the National Parks and the National Seashores and the National Wildlife Refuges are great assets to our communities. Not only do they attract tourism. they increase property values. and they enhance our quality of life. And now its clear that public lands and natural systems that they protect buffered built up areas from the impact of storms. They play a very important role. so we need to restore them. and restoration of these public resources will require a specific targeted strategy. A prohibition on land acquisition may very well frustrate the ability to bring back the public value of existing park and refuge lands and to meet other community needs. Where new access points are needed. which is oftentimes going to be the case. where small purchases are the best or only means to reestablish the lost value of damaged habitat. this amendment would preclude the purchase of even a single acre that would be needed to reestablish public use and resource integrity. This ties the hands of the professionals who know best how to restore the seashore. This is not a Federal land grant. but they need the tools to be able to make small purchases. Were not talking about a lot of money. were not talking about a lot of land. There will be times when you need to buy a small piece of privately owned land to get access to a seashore. There will be times when you need to move it to a more appropriate area. Theyre not going to be able to spend a lot of money. There isnt a lot of money to do that with. The fact is that this. I think. is a deliberate effort to frustrate the ability of people who have a vision of what the seashore can be once we restore it to its natural habitat. It seems to me that should be a national objective. to let this area repair and heal. Taking away this tool is going to frustrate that objective.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. from the Revolutionary War to the war in Afghanistan. we owe a great debt to our servicemen and -women. One way that we honor them is through their internment in national veteran cemeteries. which gives them a dignified and honorable final resting place. As anyone who has walked through the rows of tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery knows. these cemeteries are hallowed ground. They allow us not only to pay our great respect to these great men and women. but to reflect on the cost of defending the very freedoms we enjoy in our daily lives. Unfortunately. these burial grounds were not left unscathed by Hurricane Sandy. In fact. the Cypress Hills National CemeteryNew York Citys only such cemeterywas heavily damaged by the storm. As the final resting place for more than 20.000 soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War. the Civil War. the SpanishAmerican War. Korea. and Vietnam. it spans our Nations military history and is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made to defend democracy. At Cypress Hills National Cemetery. trees were downed. areas were flooded. and many important monuments were jeopardized. Headstones were also damaged. with some pulled out of the ground due to trees falling on them. To honor those veterans buried there. the cemetery must be well maintained. and making these repairs and protecting these structures should be a priority for all Americans. To do this. the underlying legislation provides $1.1 million to make repairs and renovations. This amendment would provide another $1 million for this purpose and enable those affected veteran cemeteries to take steps to protect this sacred ground from future disasters. This could include installing measures to prevent the destruction of grave sites. regrading areas prone to flooding. and reinforcing critical structures that honor our veterans. Such an investment will make sure that future generations can visit this memorial and understand the sacrifices of those that came before them. Making certain that this memorial stands the test of time is the least we can do for those that gave their lives in service to our Nation. Ultimately. a Nation is truly measured by how it honors its veterans. and this amendment does just that. while ensuring that we truly leave no man and no woman behind.",

The Cards followed the Champs lead by shocking the world.

Facing a defense that had never allowed a touchdown pass of 15 yards or more. Cards quarterback Teddy Bridgewater completed two.

My constituents work hard. play by the rules and deserve what theyve earned. They should be able to keep a little more of their paychecks for things like college tuition. family vacations or to retire just a little earlier. But Washington is standing in their way. The fundamental question that this Congress needs to answer is whether Washington should take more than it already does from these hardworking. taxpaying Americans. The answer. of course. is no. Washington doesnt tax too little. it spends too much. One would hope that since the last Congress raised taxes to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff. everyones attention now would turn to our biggest fiscal problem. the outofcontrol spendingnow 24 percent of our gross domestic productand the explosive growth of entitlements and interest on the debt that are adding to our morethan-$16trillion national debt and pushing us up against the debt ceiling. But. remarkably. President Obama is now calling for even more taxes. more spending and more borrowing in return for any future spending controls.

Its time to supply real leadership on the most pressing challenges we face. This is the only way we can restore trust in Congress. We are fast approaching a dead end. The Social Security Trust Fund will be bankrupt in 20 years. Medicare and Medicaid are not on a sustainable path. It is wrong for us to make promises to the American people we know we cannot keep. We must address the drivers of our debtMedicare. Medicaid. and Social Securitynot because these programs dont have merits. and certainly not because the seniors currently benefiting from them dont deserve what theyve been promised. but because real leadership isnt about making the easy choice. its about making the right choice. Social Security and Medicare alone account for 36 percent of our Federal spending. and both are going to keep growing because of our aging population. My friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about cutting waste. fraud. and abuse. And while I agree we must do that. we cant tell the American people that cutting and eliminating waste. fraud. and abuse alone is enough to tackle the $16 trillion debt. Thats not leadership. History shows us that unless we make the hard decision to implement changes that equal real savings now. it will not happen. We cannot afford to make changes in 7. 8 or 9 years. We dont have the luxury of more time. Were in a position to clearly see three obvious opportunities to make real. sustainable changes. First. we know we are approaching the debt ceiling. Second. sequestration will go into effect in 2 months. and third. funding for the government will expire March 27. These are opportunities to make real changes in spending. Im excited to be representing Indianas Fifth District. and Im ready to get to work. There is no reason we need to wait until the eleventh hour to start talking about the tough decisions we must make for the future of our country. It is time we commit to saving these important programs for those who need them and getting our economic house in order for the future generations of my children and my grandchildren and our countrys children and grandchildren. Lets be the Congress in this 113th Congress that chose to tackle real problems rather than handing them down to our children. Lets embrace rightminded solutions that can set us on a path toward a better and much more sustainable future.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I will remind my distinguished colleague from Indiana that Notre Dame was undefeated this year. It was a very successful season. and well just put that on the record. Mr. Speaker. I am deeply humbled to represent the people of Indianas Second Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. Today I speak for the first time before this Chamber and on their behalf. To the hardworking Hoosier families in north central Indiana. thank you for sending me to Washington. Im eager to work with my colleagues here to make raising a family and sending a child to college just a little bit easier. To the small business owners in South Bend to Plymouth. please know that each day I will work tirelessly to strengthen the economy so you can employ those who want to work within our community. To the senior citizens between La Porte and Peru. you can count on my support to restore the American Dream and ensure that Americas best days are not behind her in the past. who absolutely want to put our future and our future generations on a solid concrete path. Mr. Speaker. I want to let the people of Indiana know that in the coming weeks theyll hear many assertions in the debate over whether Congress should increase the debt ceiling. The people of Indiana deserve to hear the truth. The entire Nation deserves to hear the truth: The truth is that. even as I speak. our national debt is spiraling out of control toward $16.5 trillion. The truth is that the United States has not run one. not two. not three. but four consecutive trillion dollar budget deficits. The truth is that this Federal Government is borrowing an unthinkable 46 cents for every dollar it spends. while throwing our children under the weight of the bill. The truth is that the share of the national debt for every family in Indiana is a staggering $143.190. For every Hoosier. its $52.737. The truth. Mr. Speaker. is that its time for us to stop spending money we simply do not have. Admiral Mike Mullen. former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. has warned us. He said. \"the single biggest threat to our national security is our debt.\" In order to get our debt under control. we first must completely take care of our spending. As families in Indianas Second District and all across the Nation. we have to prioritize spending. we have to create budgets and live within our means. so should this Congress of the United States. Each day that we delay getting our fiscal house in order. we threaten the safety and wellbeing of those we love and care about the most. We threaten the opportunity and promise of future generations by limiting the resources we have to invest in infrastructure and education. Mr. Speaker. as I said earlier. the truth is that its time for us to stop spending money we simply do not have. As big as our national debt may be. Americans have always been able to come together and solve big problems. I thank the good people of Indiana for electing me to listen to their needs and bring good Hoosier common sense to Washington. I look forward to working together in this Congress on their behalf and to tackling our most serious issues. Ladies and gentlemen. the clock is ticking. Lets get to work.",

    "speech": "I say with great pride to my honorable colleague that we do it better in Indiana. I worked with thenState Representative WALORSKI and Governor Daniels as a member of Indianas General Assembly to help pass Indianas balanced budget. We turned a $600 million deficit into a $300 million surplus in 1 year without a tax increase. There was no silver bullet. Our States leader simply followed a principle most families already understand. that one shouldnt spend money they dont have. It wasnt always easy. but 8 years later. we have fewer State government employees than any time since the early 1970s. yet our State is providing better services in leaner ways throughout government. As Governor Daniels has often famously said: Most will be surprised by how much government they dont miss. I now yield to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina for your comments today.",

    "speech": "I thank my good friend from Indiana. Mr. Speaker. in previous generations. serving as a Member of Congress was considered an honorable profession. Congressmen were held in high esteem and examples of true leadership. They were honored in books like \"Profiles in Courage.\" Sadly. we seem to have lost our way. Last week. Public Policy Polling found that only 9 percent of Americans approve of the job that Congress is doing. In my opinion. the reason no one approves of the job were doing is that were not doing our job. Our Nation is in peril. We are threatened. not by a foreign tyrant. but by our own reckless spending. Just today. the Fitch Ratings agency warned that our AAA credit rating is at risk. We are on the verge of squandering everything that we have received from previous generations. Sadly. we are more likely to leave the next generation with crushing debt than we are to pass along the America we love. My fellow Representatives. may I make a suggestion? Starting with the 113th Congress. the buck stops here. For too many years. Congress and the President have received an A in addition. but they seem to have always flunked subtraction. We must commit to bringing spending in line with revenue. to setting priorities and learning to say \"no.\" If we are to be the Congress which takes to say \"no.\" If we are to be the Congress which takes substantive action on deficit reduction. we must start with entitlements. Its the topic everyone is afraid to address. but werent we elected to show true leadership? Today the Fitch Ratings agency warned that our Nations AAA credit rating is at risk if an increase in the debt ceiling doesnt also include a credible plan for deficit reduction. The Government Accountability Office has reported that government spending is on an unsustainable longterm fiscal path. with entitlements the primary culprit. The Congressional Budget Office reports that. left unchecked. the Federal entitlement programs will soon swamp the entire budget. Will entitlement reform be messy? Yes. Is it necessary? Yes. In fact. its the only way to bring a lasting solution to our Nations fiscal problems. Any plan to reform entitlements must protect the benefits promised to the current generation. But as we look to the future. we need serious reforms that will reduce spending while preserving these important safety nets for future generations. In 2006. thenSenator Obama said: The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. Yet. under President Obama. weve seen recordsetting deficit spending and trillions added to our national debt. The leadership failure lies with the President and others in Congress who have been unable to say \"no.\" Our objective is not arbitrary. Tax revenues are expected to remain right at the historical average of around 18 percent of the GDP. We know how much money well make. Now we need to sit down at the kitchen table with a calculator and figure out how to live within our means.",

    "speech": "I thank my friend from Indiana. Its good to be here. and its good to get started on what weve been sent here to do. I think thats the great thing about us coming together tonight and sharing. from a freshman perspective. our first few days in which weve been thrown into a Congress that really. I dont believe. any have experienced before. There have been tough challenges. but I think this is going to be an interesting time for us all. I appreciate us getting together tonight as we go forward. Mr. Speaker. I come from the great Georgia Ninth. The northeast Georgia district is full of mountain values and common sense. When we look at the district. as I traveled around for almost 18 months. what I kept hearing from people all along is that they wanted their life to look ahead to something of a brighter future. I think right now. from an economic perspective. when we look at whats going on. that is what they are most concerned about. Theyre looking at what they have at the national level and theyre looking at our debt. theyre looking at our economic and our budget issues and theyre saying. How is this effective? How is this going to be better for my kids and my grandkids? I thought to myself as I was traveling around and I beganwhen I ran. I told my constituents. I run for three reasons. and they were Jordan. Copelan. and Cameron. Theyre my three children. I told them that they represent not only my three kids and their future. but they represented the kids and the grandkids of the district and the nieces and nephews of those that everybody in my district lived with and cared for. because it is their future that were dealing with here. Its their future. When we talk about the economics and when we talk about the problem were in. this is the area in which we have got to work as a Congress. We cannot shirk the duty. We cannot pass it along. They expect us to act. and they expect us to act in a way in which. as we look forward. actually makes a difference in their lives. President Obama recently told our Speaker that he doesnt believe we have a debt problem. Were $16 trillion in the hole. and our outoftouch Commander in Chief doesnt think we have a serious problem on our hands. As my friend from North Carolina just statedI want to go with the entire quote. and this is what was said: The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. \"Leadership\" means the buck stops here. Instead. Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I. therefore. intend to oppose the effort to increase Americas debt limit. As we look at this issue. it really amazes me because I want to focus not on this debt issue but on basically what it says here. It says: America has a debt problem. and its a failure of leadership. If it were a failure of leadership back in 2006. it must be a catastrophic nightmare at this point because all weve done is increase it. Weve got to do better. Were borrowing almost half of every dollar we spend. If we dont provide serious measures to take care of it. we will leave our country in an absolute debacle for our kids and grandchildren. and thats simply not a price Im willing to pay. Our President just recently talked about not only a debt problem but that he doesnt believe we have a spending problem. I thought to myself that we dont have a spending problem. yet one of our colleagues. Representative LANKFORD. stated just the other day that in 2012 well have the third highest revenue year ever in the Federal Government. and yet were still discussing the fact that we dont have a spending problem. Im sorry. Mr. President. this is not leadership. This is failure. We cannot continue to give the President and those on the other side of the aisle a blank check. Any discussion of raising the debt ceiling must also include an examination of serious reforms that need to be made to entitlement and discretionary spending. On January 2. 2013. President Obama stated that we cannot continue to cut our way to prosperity. Mr. President. on the contrary. we cannot tax and spend our way to prosperity either. I think tonight were starting what. I hope. will become a regular occurrence for this freshman class. my friend from Indiana. As we look at it. its what I believe we have to do. and I believe its about telling our story and about telling why conservative principles matter and how conservative principles. when we explain how we can get debt off their backs and spending under control. mean freedom for their kids to have a better future so that they can go to college and so that they can start that new business and employ other people. I believe Americas greatest gift was found in the free enterprise system. and thats what we can encourage by getting our own fiscal house in order here tonight. This is the time for us to come together. and Im so pleased to stand with you and with the other freshmen here tonight. Were here to work. and were here to make some hard choices and to realize this is all in Americas best interests. I appreciate your letting me be a part of this tonight.",

    "speech": "It is an honor to be here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen. I rise in defense of the American people. I believe that we are at a tipping point in our history. I really believe that we are at one of those inflection points at which we will decide our future. at which we will decide who we are as a people. at which we will decide the America that we leave to our children in a way that hasnt been decided before. This is a generational moment. This time is that important. At its heart. I think the debate comes down to this: Will we reclaim the moral and fiscal discipline that created the American Dream? Will we reclaim the moral and the fiscal discipline that created the worlds first and the worlds greatest middle class? Will we reclaim the moral and fiscal discipline that made us. as Abraham Lincoln described us. the last best hope on Earth? That is the essence of our challenge. That is the great and defining argument of our day. In this debate. Id like to remind all of us of a few critical facts. One of them is that this Nation. a Nation that is bankrupt. cannot provide for the security of its people. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the needy or for the poor among us. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the future of their children. Yes. during these challenging times. it will require a commitment to fairness. and it will require a commitment to compassion. It always has. There has always been compassion in this Nation. That defines much of who we areallowing the safety net to continue for those who truly need it. But where is the compassion in allowing a program. like my parents depended on in the final years of their lives. to continue down a pathway towards bankruptcy? Where is the compassion in creating so much uncertainty that our own children no longer have faith in their futures or in the social and safety net that has been there for previous generations? If you believe in compassion and fairness. then help us fix these problems. Help us to save them. Help us to provide so that we can pass them on to future generations. Since the last election. this administration has talked about one thing and one thing only. and that is taxes. We have had that fight. and he has won. He got his tax increase. and that will raise between $60 billion and $70 billion. but the last deficit was $1.1 trillion. Mr. President. what about the other trillion dollars now? What do we do now? We have a 6 percent solution. Its a great start if you like raising taxes. but it doesnt address the problems at all. My father was an Air Force pilot. He was a pilot during World War II. and I had the great honor of serving for 14 years as an Air Force pilot as well. If there was one thing I learned from my father and those brave men and women with whom I served. it was courage. always to have courage. That is what we need now. That is the only thing that can save us. Mr. President and Members of this body. let us have the courage to do the right thing even if that thing proves to be hard. Our debt is unsustainable. We talk about saving our Nation for our children. We dont have that long. Let us take the steps to restore financial sanity in this Congress in this day.",

I represent Congressional District 25 in Texas. a great district. I have been meeting payrolls and creating jobs for 41 years and have been fighting government regulations for that period of time. I must tell you that. at a time when our national debt is over $16 trillionmore than $52.000 for each Americanwe must restore fiscal sanity in Washington. We do this by cutting spending. shrinking the deficit. and balancing the budget. As a businessman. when youre not selling your product. you dont raise taxes and you dont raise prices. You cut spending. Thats where the money is. Thats where the cash flow is. and thats what weve got to get to. Our Nations economic future is at stake. The Federal Government currently borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends. I think we all agree its time to get our fiscal house in order. Across this great Nation. the families have stretched their hardearned dollars in order to make it through this struggling economy. The Federal Government must do the same and must do it now. We are facing a crisis because Washington just simply spends too much and wastes too much. As I said. families all across this country are not looking to spend more money. Theyre looking to cut expenses and to meet the problems we all face today. The American people. I believe. do not support raising the debt. I ran on lower taxes. less government. to cut the spending. Thats what my district wants. We dont need to raise the debt ceiling without cutting spending at the same time. Thats what its about. We need to create a net worth in America. Im looking forward to the debate. We need to bring business principles back to Washington. D.C. May God bless America.",

Everyone in this room tonight. everybody watching. has grown up in an America where youve known one very simple fact: that no matter what your current station in life. no matter where you came from. if you worked hard and stayed focused in this great country. you would have an opportunity to build a life for yourself. you would have an opportunity to live the American Dream. And for the first time in my life. as I traveled through the Sixth District of Indiana and talked to people all across this country. people are doubting whether that will be true for the next generation. whether the next generation of young people and Americans will have the same kinds of opportunities that we all had growing up. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that the upcoming debate in the next 2 months is really about the question of what are we willing to do to save our country. and this underlying question: Does Washington have enough? How much more must they take from the hardworking. taxpaying Americans who are trying to put their life together every day? I and my colleagues who spoke earlier today believe Washington has enough.

    "speech": "I thank you. Mr. Speaker. Its good. it is very. very good that the new 113th Congress acted today to reach out in sympathy. compassion. and with real support to the people who were so severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. One of our colleagues. just a moment ago. spoke about this Nation being at a crossroad. And indeed. we cross paths many. many times and there are many different crossroads. The people of Pennsylvania. New Jersey. New York. Connecticut. and other parts of this great Nation here on the east coast came to a crossroads. That crossroads was 97 days ago when Superstorm Sandy came ashore and whacked and destroyed. pummeled and. indeed. killed Americans. Today. the House of Representatives. not unanimously. unfortunately. but by a strong majority of Democrats and some Republicans. stood tall and said we are one Nation. Were one Nation. and when one of us is harmed. well stand with that person. When one State is harmed. well stand with that State. and we will come together. just as my colleague said a moment ago. we will come together to provide what is needed to rebuild. to sustain. to provide. so that they who have been harmed can carry on. Theres a lesson here for all of us. and tonight my Democratic colleagues and I will talk about the lesson that Superstorm Sandy brought to this Nation. Certainly one of those lessons has been fulfilled today. As a great Nation. we will provide what is needed for the rebuilding. for the immediate needs. even though it is 97 days late. We will provide because we are a compassionate Nation. But theres also another lesson here. and that lesson is for this entire Nation to get ahead of the next disaster. It will come. Itll be another storm up the east coast or into the gulf. Itll be an earthquake in my State of California or a flood or a fire. But there will be yet another natural disaster of one sort or another. perhaps manmade. perhaps Mother Nature. What we must do as a Nation is to get ahead of that. to prepare ourselves not only with emergency responses. but more and just as important. to prepare the infrastructure to protect the lives and the property of the citizens of this Nation. Thats the second lesson of Superstorm Sandy. Build the infrastructure to prepare for the next flood. the next hurricane. the next onslaught of Mother Nature. We can do it. And in so doing. we not only reduce the cost of that next storm. that next flood. but we also save the lives of Americans. and we put people to work right now. This Nation is not yet fully recovered from the recession of 2008. This Nation has not yet fully brought Americans back to work. and we can do so taking the lesson of this days action here on the floor of the House of Representatives where we. at least most of us. voted to build for the future. voted to put in place those infrastructure improvements. not for yesterday. not to rebuild just what was there that was destroyed. but. rather. to build for the future onslaught of a storm coming into New Jersey. New York. Connecticut. or other parts of this Nation. To be prepared. The Boy Scout motto: Be prepared. Benjamin Franklin: An ounce of prevention is worth a dollar of cure. These are truisms that have been with us forever. and today we want to talk about infrastructure investment. the kind of things that were done here on the floor. some $33 billion going not only for immediate relief. but to build the infrastructure necessary to protect and prepare for the next storm. Joining me today in this discussion. at least at the outset. is my colleague from New York. PAUL TONKO. We often meet here on the floor. We sometimes call this the East Coast/West Coast show. Im from California. Representative TONKO is from New York. And you were there. not only for this storm. but for the previous storm. and that was less than 18 months ago. Lets talk about these things.

    "speech": "Sure. Thank you. Representative GARAMENDI. Thank you for bringing us together for this hour on the floor. where I think its important to pay attention to the needs out there as they relate to the damages that were brought upon certain areas of the country by Mother Nature. Yes. theres been a lot of focus with this on Superstorm Sandy. That really had its presence felt just to the south of my given congressional district. However. there was some damages in the northern reaches of upstate New York. the more northern sections as we traveled north of the metro area. But suffice it to say. the need here for assistance by not only New York. but New Jersey and Connecticut. where the proper of New York. the metro area of New York City. Long Island. Westchester County. were impacted severely by this storm. As I said. on the fringe elements in my area. not as much. But certainly. New Jersey and Connecticut were hard hit. But just over a year before that storm. youre absolutely right. we were impacted by Irene and Lee. a double dose of damage that really impacted my given congressional district severely. It looked like a wartorn area. as was the case here with Superstorm Sandy. And this Nation. whenever impacted by natural or manmade disasters. found a response from Congress. that the President. whoever that person might be at the time. working with Congress. expedited the assistance. wanted to get that aid there with a high degree of urgency. What we saw here was uncalledfor delays as people languished. I mean. we have to look at the human element here. the human cost of 88 Americans that were impacted. lives lost because of this tremendous devastation. the impact that befell so many communities with infrastructure being damaged severely. if not destroyed totally. It was also about the impact on the business community. the loss to commerce. and certainly property damage that people are going to have to respond to over a long course of comeback that I have witnessed in my district with the storm. as you indicated. being more than a year ago. And so it is important for us. as a Nation. to be responsive and responsible. That has always been the measure coming forth from this Nation. understanding. with sensitivity. what needed to be done and getting aid to people. Thats what its all about. And so today. when finally a vote was taken. some 70 days after Superstorm Sandy hit. 70plus days after the storm hit. finally we get a response. when so much pain and anguish was allowed to continue. unnecessarily so. The infrastructure issues in this country. storms aside. need to be addressed. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded many of our bridges into a D classification. a poor grade. deficiencies that are out there brought to our attention. So not only do we need to respond to these tragedies and respond to our given infrastructure. but I think what happens here is an opportunity to come forward with job creation. providing for the trades and skilled tradespeople to be put to work. That is so important for our economy. Its so important for our public safety. its so important for emergency response. as weve witnessed here in the northeast of the country. And so while the fight was long and at times unnecessary. at least the vote was taken today and we moved forward.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. TONKO. The bill now is out of this House. Its over in the Senate. We expect the Senate to pass it probably tomorrow or the next day. certainly before the inaugural on Monday. and then the President will undoubtedly sign it shortly thereafter. bringing that kind of relief. You mentioned the job issue. and people need to go to work. When we have these natural disasters. and we come forward with the kind of support that we have seen today. and will soon be available for New Jersey. New York. Connecticut and the surrounding areas. people go back to work. Those people that have received immediate FEMA support for housing. for clothing. for food. that moneys immediately spent into the economy. On the infrastructure side. its crucial. When the subways of Lower Manhattan flooded. the worlds financial institutions took a whack because it was shut down for several days. People couldnt get to work. and so the entire worlds economy slowed down. costing billions of dollars beyond just the damage. Now. part of the infrastructure. part of the bill that was passed today. the infrastructure improvements are to harden. to prepare Manhattan and the surrounding areas. the beach communities and others. for the next storm. to put up the seawalls. Now. what does that mean? Well. it means that the ounce of prevention and the pound of cure have taken place. but it also means people are going to go to work. Let me refer to this chart here. This is from Mark Zandi. chief economist at Moodys Analytics. and the former economic adviser to JOHN MCCAIN. His analysis. and this is generally agreed to by most economists. is that for every dollar invested in infrastructure. you get $1.57 back into the American economy. So youre not just putting a dollar in. Youre getting the American economy going. Youre putting people to work. Those people will then be able to pay taxes. buy food. support their families. and build for tomorrows disaster. putting in place the infrastructure that is hardened. that is protected. eliminating the potential. in this specific case. of flooding of the subway systems in New York City. I know that you talked about doing this in your area for the storm. You may want to pick that back up. and then I want to come back and talk about my own district in California.",

    "speech": "Right. You know. I think over and over again people are measuring with exit polling the sentiments of the electorate out there. and people have said that there is a need for government. They want effective government. efficient government. Well. I think when we look at some of the data that are collected. Representative GARAMENDI. it is important for us to acknowledge that as we rebuild in our areas that have been damaged by Mother Nature. you dont just replace. you need to improve upon the situation. For instance. if there are data that are telling us that more and more water volume is expected in certain watershed areas. as in my district. it would be foolish to spend tax dollars. the hardearned taxpayer dollars and simply replace an infrastructure. a bridge. at the same height. at the same span. if. in fact. we know that the water and the force of that water is growing with time. And so these are the ways to. I think. incorporate the soundness of academics and analysis that go into how we respond to this. And if much of it is driven by climate change. global warming. some of the impacts of Mother Nature that are causing these disruptive scenarios. then ought we not look at sound policy that then stretches our thinking and really puts a laser sharp focus on these situations? So this is a call for a bigpicture view. Its a call for effective replacement and repair so that were responding to data that are collected that speak to the demographics that we should expect to have happen as we go forward and as we rebuild. making certain that there are those opportunities for waterfront communities to embrace their sense of geography. I represent a district that is not only donor area to natural resources. but also historic resources in those waterways. And people want to have waterfront opportunities. They want to rebuild their communities so as to utilize these natural resources as a marketing agent to draw people to the area. Well. we can steward those resources so as to tame the Mother Nature impact in a way that allows us to go forward with this remarketing strategy. that allows us to utilize our sense of location. our place destination. and do it in a way that is possible because of preventative measures. because of retrofitting that can take hold. and its a way to utilize the engineering services out there. civil engineering. architectural opportunities to build communities and build them in a way that allows us to have that sense of place only deepened. rather than denied because weve walked away from what might have been damage from Mother Nature and have abandoned those opportunities.",

Theres also in this legislation other reforms that allow the projects and homes and businesses to be rebuilt in a way that protects them from the future storms and the increased storms that you so aptly described. Let me just take this home to my district. I represent the Central Valley of California. the great Sacramento Valley. 200 miles of it. literally from the beginning of San Francisco Bay 200 miles up the Sacramento River. And probably. I havent been able to count all the levees in my district. but I probably have well over 1.500 miles of levees that protect large cities. medium size cities. farms and other critical assets and infrastructure in the State of California. For example. the intercontinental rail system both north and south. intercontinental highway systems. universities. international airports. These critical assets are at risk of flooding. The Army Corps of Engineers is taking a look at the levees in one part of my district. The Natomas Basin. which is part of the city of Sacramento. judges those levees to have a 1 in 30 chance of failure. so that over a 30year period of time its anticipated there will be a catastrophic failure of those levees. One hundred thousand lives just in that part of Sacramento at immediate risk because those floodwatersshould those levees fail. it would be a repeat of what happened in New Orleans. only the water is deeper and the floodwaters would rush in. at least as fast. if not faster. A monumental disaster. international airport gone. highways gone and on and on. We need to get ahead of that. We need to build that infrastructure. those levees. to protect those assets. A penny of prevention. a pound of savings. So these are the kind of things that we can do. And there are ways we can do this. Yes. it may run up the immediate deficit. But once again. for every dollar that we invest in those levees we not only save lives and property. but we put people to work and we get the economic engine going. Further up in my district. again along the Sacramento and the Feather Rivers. I have a project thats 44 miles of levee that clearly will fail. It has failed four times in the last 60 years. Lives have been lost. One of the most catastrophic failures of a levee happened in this stretch of river. We need to rebuild that. The Federal Governments role in the construction projects of these levees has gone back to the very beginning of this Nation. And it is Congress task to allocate the money. to decide the projects that are going to be built. But unfortunately. weve tied ourselves in knots here with certain rules that have been put in by our Republican colleagues that prevent us from taking the necessary action to protect our communities. Were not talking about willynilly unnecessary projects. were talking about saving lives and property. This is how we should be acting. Rebuilding after a storm to a higher standard. building before the storm to protect our people. the people that we represent. These are critical issues. these are infrastructure projects. and we need to get on top of this and push these projects forward. Yes. it will cost money. but not nearly as much as the cost of a levee failure because we failed to act in time.",

    "speech": "Well. when you speak. Representative GARAMENDI. about the cost of these repairs or improvements were talking about a design team. were talking about a construction team. were talking about a maintenance team. And all of that translates into jobs. So these efforts are. yes. an expenditure. but its putting people to work and addressing not only public safety but commerce. Again. my home county. which is split by a historic river. was the scene of a devastation just over 25 years ago where a New York State Thruway bridge collapsed because of the flooding that was occurring beneath that bridge. A creek that you could walk across. walk through in the middle of summer. was equal to in CFS. cubic feet per second. the flow of Niagara Falls. We lost 10 lives in that incidence. and also saw the impact locally to commerce. It just disrupted the flow of activity to ship goods to whatever section of our area. It totally disrupted that situation. That is just a microcosm of impact of what happens. But youre very right. With the levees that might be at risk that could be a challenge to public safety. the poor ratings of our many. many bridges across this country. the need to begin aggressively to address these situations. means that you can bend that cost curve simply by moving projects forward. because the longer we go in time the more expensive it will be and the more risky it becomes with these deficient bridges. So programs like The American Jobs Act or Build America Bonds. all of these efforts are a progressive bit of policy that then takes us to a new realm of thinking. a commitment to the safety of the people of this great country. a commitment to commerce and the doable qualities of having infrastructure vastly improved that enables us then to talk serious business about growing our Nations economy. So I think that the efforts here by the Democratic Caucus to bring to the attention of the full House the sort of positive thinking. the sort of planned opportunities that speak to the very nature of our infrastructureand both of us represent States that rely heavily on welldeveloped and very wellmaintained infrastructureis indeed imperative. We need to move forward with a very strong supportive statement about this Nations infrastructure.",

    "speech": "I would like to move in just a moment to the issue of how we can actually help other parts of our economy grow as we build our infrastructure. But before I do I am just thinking about the previous discussion from our Republican colleagues where they talked about the deficit and the deficit and we ought to eliminate government programs. Certainly there are government programs that are neither efficient. effective. or necessary. and. yes. those should be cut. But when you start talking about infrastructure this is something that we really must do. It was said that for an expenditure of some $15 billion New York City could have protected its subway system and the shoreline from the devastation of two major storms. one that occurred a year ago and another one that occurred just 97 days or 3 months ago. Superstorm Sandy. So if we get ahead of these disasters and build the necessary protections. for example in my district if we build those levees. yes. it will cost money. For the Natomas area its about $1 billion. Very expensive. no doubt about it. But if we do not protect and do not build those levees the devastation will amount to several times that amount of money. Thats precisely what happened in Manhattan and in the New York City area. So again. you spend that money up front. yes. you put people to work. yes. there may be an immediate issue of where and how we fund it. and thats a legitimate issue. but fail to do it and then the cost is horrendous. And. yes. if the State. the Federal. the local governments. the individuals. that will all be an expense that they have to endure. And Superstorm Sandy. the bill we saw today. is precisely on that. Now. having said that. lets talk about the broader subject. You mentioned Build American Bonds just a moment ago. The Build American Bonds were part of the stimulus program. now almost 4 years old. [- 2030 That program created a new mechanism to assist local governments in providing the funding to build infrastructurevery. very successful in putting people back to work. We could extend that. In doing so. we will put people back to work. We will build the infrastructures. whether those are highways or bridges or whatever. As we do that. one of our favorite topics that weve talked on this floor many. many times about is this: We can Make It in America. We use our taxpayer money to make and to spend that money on Americanmade products. So the steel in the bridges. the concrete. the other design elements are American jobs. And as we do that. we rebuild the American manufacturing base. Youve talked about this extensively. You go back in history. but go for it.",

    "speech": "Well. absolutely. The manufacturing element in our society is strong. It still is very mucha bit of statistical evidence that we rank high in the international economy with manufacturing jobs. but there was a huge loss in the decade before this administration. 4.6 million jobs lost in that manufacturing element. Well. in order for us to stop that bleeding. its important. I believe. to promote advanced manufacturing. Retrofitting our manufacturing centers in a way that allows us to be cutting edge and doing it smarternot necessarily cheaper. but doing it smarterallows us to maintain that world leading status for manufacturing. Also. as we talk about infrastructure. beyond the bonds effort and the American Jobs Act. an infrastructure bank bill that will allow us to utilize that concept to leverage public and private funds that expand the opportunities to invest in our infrastructure takes us well beyond the traditional roads and bridges and levees that we talked about. the waterfront opportunities and dam repair. but it also brings us into the infrastructure for telecommunications and for electric utilities so that we then are cutting edge. We can provide for an upgrade. if you will. in the grid system. Now. we saw what that collapse was about in the year 2003. when branches rubbing on some power lines in Ohio put out the lights on Broadway in New York City. Now. that is unacceptable weakness. If there was ever a vulnerable. gaping situation that would have those looking at us for a weakness. it was there. that this grid system was so weak. designed for a monopoly setting and now being utilized to where electrons. not only region to region within States. but State to State if not nation to nation. with Canada wheeling in electrons into the U.S. So we need to vastly improve that sense of weakness in our system and allow us to speak to the needs of manufacturing because many are an energyintensive operation. We need to be energy efficient so that theyre utilizing their manufacturing process in a way that reduces cost. and to build into the equation all sorts of innovation so that theyre doing things in a smarter fashion and able to compete at that international level for jobs. because as they land those contracts with improved operations. that means more American manufacturing jobs. That is that kind of approach. that cuttingedge thinking that enables us to maintain our sense of productivity. that embraces our intellectual capacity as a Nation. and that takes the research that we should invest into and allows us to translate that research opportunity into jobs. So there are these dynamics of change and reform that can be brought into the discussions here as we go forward. That will speak. I think. to the vitality. the economic vitality of this Nation and the growth of jobs in a way that is significant. that is long lasting and that brings us into a sophisticated thinking. which this American society is very capable of doing.",

    "speech": "Last year. you and I talkedor last Congress. which was last year. you and I talked about this Make It in America. this manufacturing. We spent a lot of time talking about it. I had introduced in that session of Congress legislation that would require that our tax moneyat least 85 percent of itbe spent on Americanmade products and equipment. Lets take the Superstorm Sandy situation. We know that. for example. Amtrak is receiving. I think. a little over $150 million to repair its tracks that were damaged by Superstorm Sandy. Those are jobsmen and women will be workingbut its also steel. its electrical wires. its consultants. and it will undoubtedly be various kinds of electrical systems that will be used by Amtrak in rebuilding. similarly with regard to the subways in New York. Now. if we were able to write into the Superstorm Sandy legislation that 85 percent of that money thats used on rebuilding the infrastructure came from Americanmade productsin other words. Buy Americathen that would not only put people back to work. but it would stimulate the steel industry. the electrical industry. and certainly the consultants. engineers. and architects. So Im going to reintroduce that legislationtoo late now for Superstorm Sandy. but there will be other legislation. For example. we know that were going to have to rewrite a new transportation bill in this session. Theres a 2year bill thats now in place. It will expire at the end of the 213th Congress. so were going to need to redo that. We should write into that transportation legislationwhere we will spend $50 billion. $60 billion a year to build transportation systemsa clause like my bill that says thats taxpayer money. lets use that taxpayer money to buy Americanmade equipment and supplies. putting Americans back to work and using that to rebuild the American manufacturing sector along the lines that you describe. not with yesterdays technology. but with advanced manufacturing.",

    "speech": "Right. The efforts that we have with so much of manufacturing. with the incubator programs that enable us to provide for an innovation of sorts in any of these assembly operations is key. I think its key to our future. I think of those situations in my district. or even in my former district. where they worked with a local college that was very technically sophisticated. In this case. RPI. in the Greater Capital Region of New York. worked through its incubator program to develop these new opportunities within the plastics manufacturing that Kintz Plastics in Schoharie County utilized. I think its worth mentioning on this floor that that really brought about a new phase of activity for this company. By innovation. by readjusting its procedure. its process. they were able to compete more effectively. That required. however. that they move to training their workforce because it required a new skill set. As they did that. they reached out to a local community college. in this case. Hudson Valley Community College in the Capital Region of New York. That partnership created the human infrastructure. the incubator provided the innovation. and they lived happily thereafter. because what they did was secure contracts in that international competitive sweepstakes because they provided for innovation. The improvements that they made to their assembly operation enabled them to maintain that sense of competitiveness. Its that sort of thinking that takes us to a new level of job creation and job retention. Compounding that. or creating in the complement the Buy American concept. then inspires reaching to those local firms. It can all be done in that holistic sort of format. with a big picture sort of view that enables us to go forward and build upon sound policy. sound investment. with guarantees of much better outcomes for Americas working families.

    "speech": "You couldnt be more correct. You used the word \"holistic.\" meaning whole and in total. a total package. For years Ive said that to have a growing economy and a just social environment. we needed to make. as Americans. critical investments. You hit three of those critical investments. You talked about researchabsolutely critical investment in the future growth of the economy and to solve today and tomorrows problems. Thats research. most of which. interestingly. is funded either directly by the Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health or Defense Research Agency. DARPA. or one of the other Federal agencies. or indirectly through the research tax credit that we provide for businesses to engage in research. So research is one of the key investments that lead to economic growth. You mentioned the second one. very interesting. and thats education. A well educated workforce will be competitive across the world. Thats a critical. perhaps the most critical. investment. Again. a role for the Federal Government. certainly a role for States and local governments. but a role for the American society that cannot be ignoredresearch. education. You drew it very. very correctly. and that is the manufacturing that comes from that. Manufacturing matters. How do you do that? You need to be in front of it. and when you talked about the research and the manufacturing technology. you were spot on. Thats the third critical investment. The fourth one we also talked about here is infrastructure. So these are four of the critical investments that we need to make as a society. Some of that falls on individual companies. encouraged by a research tax credit or encouraged by Buy America. In different ways. we can encourage the manufacturing tax policy. which is critically important. We did that. Actually. it was a Democratic proposal. We did it 3 years ago. Weve continued it. Weve continued it in the recent fiscal cliff legislation where we provided 100 percent writeoff for capital investment. That was from the Democrats. We care about business. and so we said. grow your business. We will provide you with a 100 percent writeoff in the first year of capital equipment that you put in place. Not depreciation over 3. 4. 7. 15 years. but rather immediate. an enormous benefit to business. So we want the businesses to invest so that they can Make It in America. There are two more critical elements. Ill go through them very. very quickly. Provide for the national defense wisely. I think the public knows by now that were spending $100 billion in Afghanistan this year-$100 billion. We need to bring it back home. We need to end that war. Thankfully. the President has set us off on a course where we will end American offensive action and move to supporting the Afghan Government in the spring of this year. Mr. President. were thankful that you put that policy. Now lets bring the rest of it home. $100 billion. We need that money here. So we need national defense. but we need to be really wise about how we spend our money. Finally. the fifth thing is this: we need to change. We need to be willing to change. Thank you for bringing up the first three of those. But this is how we invest in the future. and these are policies that we need to put forward. Theyre the critical foundation for economic and social growth.",

I believe. to continually think beyond the status quo. And when were dealing with the energy arena. its a lineloss for one that allows for huge savings. and great opportunities for jobs to research that potential. but its also issues like waste heat which can be recaptured and make our energy system more efficient. So as we create and generate these energy supplies. if theres waste there. and we can captivate. or capture. that waste and stretch the amount of energy supply that we can create. here yet is another opportunity. So its endless. And for us to just continue to do the same old kind of responses to everyday issues isnt the sort of challenging outcome that I think allows us to best function as an American society. So there are policies and there are tax reforms that encourage and inspire this sort of investment. research tax credits. opportunities within the renewable energy area with production tax credits. All of this. being promoted in advance. we need to expand upon those opportunities. Because youre right.

And I will take the first shot at it. and then if you would be so kind as to finish it up. Im thinking of Chicago. Its not my territory. Its a long way from California. Its a beautiful city. a very dynamic city. At the turn of the previous century. in the late 1800s. they had an architect. a city architect. Burnham. and he wrote: Think no small thought for it stirs not the heart of man. Very interesting. We ought to add women to that equation now. But what he said is that when we rebuild this city. we need to build big. We need to think bold thoughts. We need to think about the greatness that could exist if we step forward. Earlier in the previous hour we heard about the exact opposite. We heard about inward. thinking small. we are not going to reach out and fulfill the great potential of this Nation. Instead. were going to retreat. Were not going to allow government to be part of the greatness of our future. but. instead. were going to make it smaller and less viable. And those five things that I talked about. education. thats a public investment. Infrastructure is both public and private. But the public side is critical. You look at manufacturing. manufacturing has always been private. but it has also relied upon the public sector. And if we use our tax dollars to buy Americanmade products. we are causing the manufacturing sector to grow. to blossom and to innovate and to be even greater than it is today. In developing the research. thats both public and private. but it is largely a public sector investment. So we can deal with this by investing. by thinking boldly about what it is we can do and. in doing so. make certain that everything we invest in publicly is necessary. that it is run efficiently. and that its outcome is effective. and that it fulfills the goal for which it was designed. Those should be our watchwords: efficient. effective. necessary. and bold. Think no small thought. This is America. This is the worlds greatest country perhaps ever. and it was created by bold thinking. both public and private working together in a synergy that created this incredible Nation. Im excited. Im excited here in the very early days of the 113th Congress. I know were going to have some big battles over debt limits and the like. But as we go through those fights. I want us to be bold.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a pleasure to get to know you better all the time and to be serving with you. I enjoyed hearing my friends talking about the economy and things that are going on. So I wanted to address a few things. I didnt come over here and plan to address what they had. but they were mentioning their hope for us. bringing our troops home from Afghanistan. And having been there a few times. having talked to the former allies that this administration has thrown under the bus that initially defeated the Taliban for us with less than 500. possibly less than 300 embedded Special Forces. special ops. and intelligence personnel embedded with the Northern Alliance. they defeated the Taliban in about 3 or 4 months. Then we added troops and became occupiers. Occupiers in that part of the world dont do well. Someone reminded me of what I already knew. that Alexander the Great conquered that area around Afghanistan. and I had to remind them that he died on his way out of the area. I dont consider that a great victory. Nonetheless. we helped give the Afghans a government and sharia law. making it difficult for Jews and Christians to reside in a country where they once had. Under this administrations watch. like I say. weve thrown our allies under the bus. and the Taliban has come back almost strong as ever. not quite. Some of my Northern Alliance friends told me in one of our visits over there that on national television last year. the Taliban leader that this administration released for humanitarian purposes from Gitmo didnt seem to be having health problems and was on national television and was making clear that the U.S. would be withdrawing in the next year or two. and that when they did the Taliban would be back in charge as they were before. So it was time to come beg forgiveness from the Taliban and ask for their protection under sharia law. That doesnt sound like were going to be in a whole lot better position after all the losses of life. all of the servicemembers who have laid down their lives in Afghanistan. who continue to do that as we speak because the Commander in Chief has them there without any real mission laying down their lives. As one of our troops told me. \"I dont mind laying down my life for my country. but please dont waste it.\" Theyre not laying down their lives for a wishywashy government that cant figure out what it wants to do. that leaves our military without a clear mission. that allows the Taliban to come back stronger than ever. supplied and funded in part from Pakistan. They deserve better. They deserve much better. Our Commander in Chief was on television yesterday talking about the debt limit. the debt ceiling. Hes talked about our economy. I think its worth noting that since 1923. the President was required to furnish a budget and a time deadline given for furnishing that budget. Ninety years. Ninety years. the President is required by law to furnish a budget. Since 1923. those ensuing 90 years. there have apparently been 11 times when presidents have been unable to get the budget to Congress as required by law. For some of those 11. there were very good reasons. But its interesting to note in the last 90 years. out of the 11 times that the budget from the President has been late. 4 of those 11 have been under the Obama administration. Were also informed that there is a chance once again. as there was a year and a half ago. that our credit rating of the U.S. could be lowered again by another credit rating agency. Some have tried to paint it as a different story. a different picture. But for those of us who recall what happened. S&P made it clear that they didnt believe that the United States was serious about dealing with this dramatic overspending problem. where we were spending $1.5 trillion. $1.6 trillion. over a trillion dollars more than the 2plus trillion dollars that we had coming in. And that if we didnt at least reduce the massive overspending annually by at least $400 billion for 10 years. a total of $4 trillion over a 10year period. then it would make it pretty clear that we were not serious about dealing with our debt. [- 2100 I know the Obama administration went on the warpath after the S&P credit rating was lowered. Personally. I think its to S&Ps credit that they did what they said. We came in with a debt ceiling bill that was agreed to with the administration. It had some sequestration in it with the supercommittee that some of us knew wasnt going to work because the Democrats had made it clear they didnt want a supercommittee to work because they wanted to be able to campaign and say. Gee. cuts are coming to Medicare because the Republicans were trying to protect their rich friends. It worked very well. They wouldnt reach an agreement. Even after somebody like a Republican Senator had a proposal to raise new revenue. a couple of Democrats were reported as saying that this was going to be the breakthrough that allowed an agreement. After consulting with the President. to HARRY REID it apparently was made clear we dont want to deal. No. no deal. so there was no deal. and now the sequestrations are about to take place.

Sequestrationmassive cuts to our national security. to our national defensewould be inflicted and massive cuts to Medicare. Our leaders responded to me that. Gee. the Democrats will never allow the cuts to Medicare. the sequestration to Medicare. $300 billion or so. Theyll never allow that. Thats why we know the supercommittee will reach an agreement. I advised them that that would not happen. that there would be no agreement. that of course theyre willing to have a $300 billion or so cut to Medicare. because ObamaCare cut $700 billion from Medicare from our seniors care without a single Republican vote. So the only way that Democrats would run a commercial last year. in 2012. with any sincerity at all was in saying. Gee. Republicans are cutting Medicare. If they were to prevent Republicans from reaching an agreement with the President and Democrats. then they could run commercials in 2012. and theyd blame the Republicans and say. See. they didnt reach an agreement. They wanted to cut seniors and help their rich friends.

In my district in east Texas. not only did we face consequences from Hurricane Katrina and the hundreds of thousands of people who came throughand many stayed in east Texasand from the onslaught of weather that hit east Texas. but it was immediately followed by Hurricane Rita. which swept straight up through east Texas. through my district. We know about suffering. We saw how Louisiana was helped so much more than east Texas even though. at the very time we were hit with Hurricane Rita. we were taking care of victims from Hurricane Katrina. We understand about that. but there is a lot of misinformation about Hurricane Katrina. For Hurricane Katrina. we did offset spending when Republicans were in the majority. We actually then turned money back that was not spent. Our hearts go out to the victims of Hurricane Sandy. especially those who understand what that kind of suffering is. I was all over my district. A Democratic sheriff told his county once that hell never forget midnight after Hurricane Rita hitno power. There in the county. there was no power at the sheriffs office. There was a generator that had kicked on. and the lights were flickering. After midnight. his U.S. Congressman came walking through his door and said. What can I do to help? To get there to San Augustine. I had to cut down trees that were across the road and over to Hemphill. Its tough when dealing with the consequences of a hurricane. People are hurt. Buildings. homes are destroyed. We understand that. We wanted to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. but what we didnt want to do and what wed hoped there would be plenty of responsibility in dealing with was pork that was placed in this bill for emergency purposes. It just seems a bit immoral that you would take advantage of the suffering of people during a hurricane to get one last big plug of money. I mean. its all so pretty discouraging to see that there is money being captured. taking advantage of the victims of a hurricane to enrich and engorge themselves. There ought to be a law against it. but there isnt because this Chamber. led by the Senate down the hall. is still putting pork in these bills to go to things that have nothing to do with the hurricane. and theyre not offset. We have no problem on both sides of the aisle in helping victims who cant help themselves. but we ought to pay for it now. When a former Member of Congress and one of the greatest heroes Texas history has. named Davy Crocketthe was a U.S. Congressman from Tennesseestood before the House of Representatives. right down the hall here in the old House Chamber. he explained what he was lectured to by a constituent: Dont take my money. Take your own money to help charitable causes. Not only do we not do that. but we take other peoples money to help. and they get all this pork added in order to get enough votes to pass it. Then it ought to be the biggest regret of this generation that we dont even pay for it. How in the world could this body fail to pass a bill that would pay for helping the victims of Hurricane Sandy? But we dont have the money to do it. so were going to borrow between 40 and 50 cents of every dollar of money both for the pork and for the help for Hurricane Sandy because this body got sweet talked into refusing to pay for helping this generation. Well let our children and our childrens children and maybe their children pay for this. We will load them up with debt because we will not pay our own way. Were too narcissistic. Were too selfindulgent. We are not going to pay our way. and that kind of attitude is a tragedy. It brings countries down. What brings a country to the peak of their greatness is when generation after generation does not fail to honor the God that has blessed that country and they have a commitment that we were taught in Boy Scouts that you leave a place better than you found it. and you leave better for those coming behind you. And its embarrassing that this White House and the Senate and this House are comfortable enough to leave a country massively more in debt than when this generation came to leadership. Its heartbreaking. And one of the reasons we are not effectively dealing with this problem is because not enough people know the truth. They dont know the history of this country. Apparently. the President thinks its perfectly okay to just forget about the rule of law. Oh. theres a law that says I have to provide a budget. Well. Im not doing it. Ill get around to it. But the law says he must. Is he above the law? Apparently so. Because of the 11 times in the last 90 years when the budget was late. four of them were this President. You know. when you talk to economists and you read what economists are saying. and youre concerned about the downgrade in the credit rating because of how much more money that will put us in debt that future generations will have to pay. when you talk to them. you look at what theyre saying. there are a couple of things that they point out. Well. one of the things that helped this country is our belief and support for the rule of law. that no one is above the law. And yet you look at what this White House is doing: ah. well get around to the budget eventually. More insensitive to following the law than any Presidency that I can find in history. We have a President who says. you know. yeah. I get it. the Defense of Marriage Act was duly passed into law and signed into law by a former Democratic President. but I dont like that law and I realize Congress is not going to change it. so Im going to ignore the law. Im going to instruct my Attorney General to ignore the law. That kind of thinking means theres no support at the highest level of this country for the rule of law. When we have a President who makes speeches and an Attorney General who makes speeches about how theyre going to go after illegal gun sales. and yet there is blood on the hands of people in this administration. and we cant even find out who they are because they are being obscured. for the death of hundreds of human beings who died because this administration forced gun dealers to sell guns that they knew and they reported should not be sold. and they were told by their Federal Government. their executive branch. you do it anyway because were going to follow the guns. in effect. The guns were not followed. They made their way into criminals hands. as was intended. but they werent followed. And now the administration says they want to support the rule of law and go after these illegal gun sales? Well. they have to start with their own administration. And then we have a President that instead of coming to Capitol Hill where most of the elected representatives of the country are. theres one down Pennsylvania Avenue. actually two. the Vice President. and there are 535 down here. and sitting down and working out a comprehensive immigration bill. instead of doing that. the President announces. you know. I dont like the laws that were duly passed by prior Congresses. Democrats. signed into law by Democrats and Republican Presidents. I realize what the law is. I dont like the law. so as I speak. so shall the new law be. And the mainstream just laps it up because theyre too ignorant of what the rule of law means. that you dont have a monarch at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue that just espouses law as he gets ready to. because he doesnt like the law that was duly passed. Come down here and work with us and if we can secure the border so that we can make sure that people wont get in that want to destroy our way of life. the drug cartels. the radical Islamists across the border that are working with the drug cartels now that want to destroy our way of life. weve got to make sure that we have people coming in that will continue to make the country great. And I have great hope for what the Hispanic community can do for this country because. generally speaking. those I know have strong faith in God. devotion to family. and hard work ethic. Thats what made America great. in my opinion. We need that kind of input. but its got to be legal. The Immigration Service is an embarrassment. one of the worst in the world. You can get a visa quicker to other countries than you can here. Its embarrassing the snafus in this government. But if we are going to get on track. we have to get back to a President and a Congress that believes the rule of law. And when the President will not follow the law. there have to be consequences. Ive talked to Democratic and Republican individuals who were part of prior Presidential administrations and Ive said at different times. different individuals: tell me. when you were in the administration. when you were in the White House. is it true what Ive heard that individuals would come together. both parties. both ends of the Capitol and talk to the President and say. look. you are usurping control that was given to the Congress in the Constitution. and were going to have to shut you down if you dont get back and acting within the Constitution? That doesnt happen under this administration. and its time that it must. We owe it to the country. We owe it to future generations. The President has said: If Congress in any way suggests theyre going to tie negotiation to debt ceiling voteswhich. by the way. we have never done in our history until we did it last yearI will not play that game. The President needs to have someone around him that knows the truth. That poor man is being lied to. All you have to do is look back in our history. Every time there was a cut in spending. it was often tied to the debt ceiling negotiations. Go back to 1985. to 1990. 1993. 1997. 2010. Speaker PELOSI in 2010. with President Obama. tied a PAYGO provision. She did it. Why is it so wrong that the Republicans want to do that in the House like Speaker PELOSI did. Lets get responsible. But the President doesnt even remember 2 years ago when Speaker PELOSI did that. Somebody has got to help this poor man understand recent and distant history before the rating agencies say. you know what. we used to think that the rule of law was going to help the U.S. economy and help the Federal Government get around to taking care of its debts. but these guys dont even follow the rule of law anymore. And as far as what economists say. yeah. but we have economic dynamism. Well. look what ObamaCare is doing to that. Look at what overregulation is doing to that. It is hurting our economy. The economy is sitting waiting to take off if the President and the Senate. that is bogging down bills that would free up the economy to go. if they would get out of the way. this economy could go. People could get back to work. They wouldnt need unemployment. They wouldnt need to be begging to the master government. They could do it on their own as free people. Its time to get back to following the rule of law. Its time to get back to having a government that doesnt put off the current debt on future generations because if we dont. our names will not be called blessed by future generations. Our names will be cursed. Mr. Speaker. it is my prayer and desire that we can finally get to be responsible in the coming months. And the only way we can really get there is if people are honest about our history. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is with heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and outstanding community leader. John Hammerslough. His passing marks the end of an era in Weston. Connecticut and the loss of a dear friend to many across Connecticut. John was a fixture in Westons civic community for half a century. died on January 2 after a brief illness. He was 84 years old and had lived in Weston with his wife Nancy since John understood the importance of serving the public and at one point or another he was a member of Westons Board of Selectmen. the Board of Finance. the Police Commission. among other roles. and was active in local. state and national political campaigns. Along with his wife. he was named \"Democrat of the Year\" in 2009 by the Democratic Town Committee. and the town of Weston proclaimed May 11. 2009. as \"John and Nancy Hammerslough Day.\" John Hammerslough was a pioneer in the emerging field of computerdriven analysis of financial securities. His role as director of computer research at Shields & Co. was unusual enough at the time that The New York Times profiled him and \"his electronic computer\" in June 1967. The computer. the article noted. \"is no bigger than an office desk.\" John Hammerslough was born in New York City in 1928. the son of Charles R. Hammerslough. a clothier and sometime theatrical producer. and the former Sylvia Rittenberg. He attended the Bronx School of Science and the Taft School. and graduated from Brown University. After college. he entered the army and served in the Korean War. first as an infantryman and later as a public information officer. The experience spurred him in later years to speak out against American involvement in Vietnam and. more recently. against the invasion of Iraq. Although Mr. Hammerslough was involved in the financial securities business for nearly half a century. he did not immediately go to work on Wall Street as a young man. Rather. his experience as a writer and audio producer for the army during the Korean War led him to join CBS as part of its fledgling television news operation. After a stint in the news business. he returned to school to do postgraduate work in mathematics at New York University. which led him to Wall Street. where his specialty was the use of computer analysis for valuing securities. His group at Shields & Co. operated the first computer at a Wall Street firm dedicated solely to investment research. He continued to focus on computerassisted financial research through the 1970s. Of his work. Mr. Hammerslough told the New York Times in 1967: \"The computer is suggestive rather than dictatorial. Its loaded with technique. but it has no judgment. The machine. therefore. represents an extension of our intelligence.\" Since the early 1980s. Mr. Hammerslough worked as a financial expert in litigation support. providing advice and testimony in more than 1.000 matters involving securities and alleged violations of securities law. A devoted Westonite. he was a familiar figure not only at Town Hall but also at the town center. where he could be seen most mornings drinking coffee with friends and talking politics and sports. at holiday parades and celebrations. where he sold ice cream and handed out buttons for the Democratic Party. and along the roads near his home. where he enjoyed walking his beloved dog. I join all of his friends and colleagues in extending my deepest sympathies to Johns wife Nancy. his son. Charles. daughter. Jane. and four grandchildren Phin. Alex. Zach and Shira.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Ed Koch is a great American lawyer. politician. and political commentator. He served 8 years in the House of Representatives and 12 as mayor of New York City. Koch was born in The Bronx and raised in Newark. In World War II. he served in the European theater of war. earned two Battle Stars as a Combat Infantryman and was honorably discharged with the rank of Sergeant in 1946. Returning to New York. he attended City College and NYU School of Law. receiving his law degree in 1948. He was a sole practitioner before serving as a partner with Koch. Lankenau. Schwartz & Kovner. Koch became active in city and Democratic party politics as a reformer and opponent of Tammany Hall and Tammany leader Carmine DeSapio. whom he twice defeated for Democratic Party leader for the district which included Greenwich Village. He served on the New York City Council from 1967 to 1969 and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977. before running for Mayor of the City of New York. During the 1960s. Koch opposed the Vietnam war and marched in the South for civil rights. As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. he advocated for a greater U.S. role in advancing human rights and became a target of attempted assassination by DINA. the Chilean secret police after proposing the cutoff of U.S. foreign aid to the rightwing government of Uruguay. He first rose to citywide prominence as a result of his opposition to a controversial attempt by then Mayor John Lindsay to place a 3.000person housing project in a middleclass community. a move which. at the time. shocked many of his political associates. In 1977. Koch defeated incumbent Abe Beame. renowned feminist Bella Abzug and now former governor Mario Cuomo. in the NYC Mayoral Democratic primary. and went on to win the mayoralty. In 1981 he won reelection with 75% of the vote. running on both the Democratic and Republican Party lines. In 1982. Koch ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York. losing the primary to then Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo. E29 As mayor. Koch often deviated from the conventional liberal line. strongly supporting the death penalty and taking a hard line on \"quality of life\" issues. such as giving police broader powers in dealing with the homeless and favoring (and signing) legislation banning the playing of radios on subways and buses. These positions prompted harsh criticism from many proponents of civil rights. In 1984 Koch published his first memoir. Mayor. a bestseller that was turned into an OffBroadway musical. In 1985. he won reelection on the Democratic and Independent tickets with 78% of the vote. In 1986. Mayor Koch surprised many by signing a lesbian and gay rights ordinance after backing his Health Departments decision to shut down the citys gay bathhouses in 1985 in response to the spread of AIDS. In 1987. when the New York Giants won Super Bowl XXI. he refused to grant a permit for the team to hold their victory parade in the \"Canyon of Heroes.\" quipping. \"If they want a parade. let them parade in front of the oil drums in Moonachie.\" a town near the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. where the Giants play. In his third term. Koch suffered a stroke while in office. but continued with his duties. Koch became a controversial figure in the 1988 presidential campaign for criticizing Jesse Jackson for alleged antiSemitism and stating that Jews would be \"crazy\" to vote for Jackson. In 1989. he ran for a fourth term as Mayor. but lost the Democratic primary to David Dinkins. who went on to defeat Rudy Giuliani in the general election. In the years following his mayoralty. Koch became a partner in the law firm of Bryan Cave LLP and became a commentator on politics. movies and restaurants for newspapers. radio and television. He also became an adjunct professor at New York University (NYU) and a visiting professor at Brandeis University. In 2008. Koch announced that he had secured a burial plot in the only graveyard in Manhattan accepting new burials. stating. \"I dont want to leave Manhattan. even when Im gone. This is my home. The thought of having to go to New Jersey was so distressing to me.\" On March 23. 2011. the New York City Council voted to rename the Queensboro Bridge as the \"Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.\" Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 88th birthday of Ed Koch. an independent thinker. an outstanding leader and the quintessential New Yorker.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor a remarkable 22yearold young man from Shaw. Mississippi. Jacques Alexander Marquis Matthews has answered the call of duty to his country and is currently serving as an active soldier in the Mississippi National Guard stationed in Afghanistan. Specialist Matthews comes from a lineage filled with military servicemen and women. His paternal grandfather. Mr. William Carter. is a Vietnam Veteran who served in the United States Air Force. his maternal uncle. Mr. James Attaway. served in the United States Marines. and his mother. Ramona Matthews. had just enlisted in the United States Army when she learned she was pregnant with her first child. Jacques. Specialist Matthews was raised in a single parent home by his mother. Ramona. along with his two younger brothers. Chauncey and Malik. Specialist Matthews understood the pain of his mother as she struggled to provide for them and the reproach of his grandparents. William and Alicestean Carter and Susie Matthews. As his mothers oldest child. much was expected of him and he wanted to fulfill those expectations. But like many other young men. what appears to be quick and easy was tempting. And sometimes he was prey to those temptations. In fact he said and I quote. \"my mother was more determined than mefor me to succeed. So. she snatched me from that wrong path and told me my life had three paths it could take and I had to choose one right then. college. military. or she was going to commit a homicide and thats all I needed to know. Needless to say. I chose the military.\" Mr. Speaker. Specialist Matthews has a litany of highlights during his military career including: In 2008: Specialist Matthews enlisted in the Mississippi National Guard. August 2008October 2008: Specialist Matthews did his basic training at Fort Jackson. South Carolina. October 2008: Specialist Matthews completed his basic training. He was recognized during graduation for having scored a perfect 300 on the physical fitness portion of the training.

November 7. 2010: Specialist Matthews while in the 168th Engineer Brigade received the Silver Castle Challenge Certificate of Achievement for having completed the Army Physical Fitness test with a score of 297. He was recognized for distinguishing himself by his excellent conditioning. He is truly to be commended for the accomplishment and deserving of the recognition for his sacrifice and selfdiscipline.

May 7. 2012: Specialist Matthews unit. the 2089th Vertical Construction Company. 223rd Engineer Battalion was activated to Afghanistan. I want Specialist Matthews story to serve as one of encouragement to those who think there is no hope for change and to those who prejudge someone because of their circumstances. Specialist Matthews has expressed great interest in building an exciting career in the military answering the call at home and abroad whenever and wherever he is needed. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am joining with my colleague Rep. ANNA G. EsHOO in reintroducing legislation to create a special envoy position at the State Department to advocate on behalf of vulnerable religious minorities in the Middle East and South Central Asia. In countries like Iraq and Egypt. ancient Christian communities are being driven from the lands they have inhabited for centuries. In Iran. Bahais are imprisoned and some cases executed simply because of their faith. In Pakistan. Ahmadi graves are desecrated. In Afghanistan. a country where America has sacrificed greatly in both blood and treasure. the most basic right to freedom of religion or belief is not recognized in the constitution. This is but a snap shot of the grave challenges facing these communities. If the international community fails to speak out. the prospects for religious pluralism and tolerance in the region are bleak. Last Congress the House. to its credit. overwhelmingly passed. by a vote of 40220. bipartisan legislation. H.R. 440. to create a special envoy position at the State Department charged with focusing on the plight of religious minorities in these regions. Sadly. in the face of State Department opposition. the Senate failed to act. There is a historic precedent for special envoysincluding the Sudan special envoy and the North Korea human rights special envoywhose positions were created in response to an urgent need for focused attention on a critical issue. The dire challenges facing Coptic Christians. Bahais. ChaldoAssyrians. Ahmadis. the small remaining Jewish population and countless other religions minorities throughout the Middle East and South Central Asia is surely such an issue. While there is no guarantee that a special envoy will be able to singlehandedly solve the problem. it certainly cannot hurt to have a highlevel person within the State Department bureaucracy who is exclusively focused on the protection and preservation of these ancient communities. Such an envoy would send an important message to both our own foreign policy establishment and to suffering communities in the Middle East and elsewhere that religious freedom is a prioritythat America will be a voice for the voiceless. President Reagan once said that the U.S. Constitution is \"a covenant that we have made not only with ourselves. but with all of mankind.\" I believe the United States has an obligation to speak out for the voiceless around the world and urge my colleagues to join me cosponsoring this critical legislation.",

Mr. Walsh has worked for the City of New YorkFinancial Information Services for 35 years in the Department of Computer Operations. He is currently the shift manager of Computer Operations Hardware.

Dutch Kills is a neighborhood bounded by 34th Avenue on the north. on the south by Bridge Plaza North. on the east by Northern Boulevard. and on the west by 21st Street. The Associations goal is to assist all segments of the community and to support cooperation between business and residents. Under Mr. Walshs leadership. the Dutch Kills Civic Association has flourished. Mr. Walsh strongly believes in the power of community involvement and civic engagement. As the neighborhood has become increasingly residential. the number of retail establishments has grown and the area has become a mecca for tourists with many new hotels. The Dutch Kills Civic Association has made extraordinary contributions to improve the quality of life in the neighborhood. These efforts include supporting a massive rezoning project. making crime reports. improving sanitation. keeping a watchful eye on nightclubs. and successfully fighting the closure of Fire Engine Company #261. Additionally. Dutch Kills has sponsored childrens shows at the Dutch Kills Playground and street fairs on 36th Avenue. and been involved with the organization of the New York City Marathon.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Carl Everett Drake. Sr. who died peacefully of natural causes at his home in Sacramento on December 27. 2012. He was 99. Carl Drake was born on August 21. 1913 in Neptune New Jersey. the second son of James and Lucy Bingham Drake. Carl was educated in the public schools where he was an outstanding student. and even better multisport athlete. His state high school long jump mark of 2110\" stood for over 25 years. His talents brought him to the attention of coaches from Morgan State College in Baltimore. MD the top ranked college football program available to African American players in the 1930s. His combination of size. speed and ferocity won him a starting spot on the championship football team. At 61\" and 205 lbs.. huge at the time. he was a bruising. standout guard. playing both offense and defense. The E31 team went undefeated for his entire career. He was team captain. had the honor of wearing jersey number one. and held the team ball in the national championship photos. At Morgan he was active in several student organizations. including the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. which he joined in 1933. He began dating an attractive and studious coed who worked as the Deans secretary. even joining the glee club to demonstrate to her his \"softer\" side. Carl and Beatrice Hayes were married in September 1937. They settled in Baltimore. she began work as a social worker. and he. having left school after football a few credits short of graduation. took a job in the post office. Professional football was not available. but his training made him valuable at handling mail sacks. Two children Carl Jr. (1939) and Beatrice (1940) followed. along with a chronic back injury that led to a job shift that relied more on his college schooling than his strength. Ruled out of active military service due to his back injury. he reenrolled in school to complete his college degree. and in 1944. at the urging of Bea. applied to medical school. He could not attend the segregated University of Maryland. but under the \"separate but equal\" concept of Jim Crow laws. the state of Maryland instead paid his tuition to attend Meharry Medical College. in Nashville Tennessee. one of the two medical schools in the county to educate more than the occasional person of color. He moved to Nashville to begin study. working an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. graveyard shift as a hospital orderly to save enough money to send for his wife and family. which he was able to do by 1946. He finished Meharry in 1949. and moved to New York City to begin internship at Harlem Hospital. He had wanted to return to Baltimore. but the city hospital there paid interns $15 per month with free room. Harlem paid $50 per month. enough to rent a one bedroom apartment for the family. After internship. and a new baby (Michael 1950). The family moved across the George Washington Bridge to Englewood. New Jersey. Carl began his life as a working physician with a grueling schedule that consisted of steady employment in the ER at Harlem hospital. graveyard shift. 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.. followed by a junior partnership in a local New York physicians office from 9 to noon. then home to Jersey to sleep. dinner at 6. and then a few private patients seen in a room converted to a makeshift medical office in the house until 9. before returning to work for the 11 p.m. shift in Harlem. When asked later about this level of commitment he replied that he was mainly \"grateful for a chance to actually work\". This schedule was of course unsustainable. and a fascination with the newly emerging field of psychiatry led him to. at 40. begin training in psychiatry at Graystone State Hospital. During residency he continued his home office practice after dinner to help support a family that had grown to four children with the addition of Barry in 1952. In 1957. after completing residency he looked nationally. and made the bold decision to move to Sacramento to join a newly burgeoning state mental health system. Prior to this no one in the family had ever been west of Tennessee. Arriving in Sacramento in July 1958. he worked for the state during the day. and as had always been the case set up a small private practice in rented space in the evenings. Financial obligations included supporting a son in college and stiff mortgage payment on a modern house in an upscale. and for the first time integrated. neighborhood. In Sacramento Carl and Bea joined a small circle of middle class African Americans. who had also moved west to make a new life. A handful of doctors. lawyers. a defense contractor. and a funeral home owner formed a social group anchored by the \"Couples Club\". which met on Saturdays once a month for a rotating house party. There were also civic activities like the Lions Club. competitive chess. and the NAACP. as well as the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha. Inc. The names of these pioneers: Colley. Jones. Morris. Morrissey. Nance. Rutland. Stewart. Trent. West. and a few others. are now a part of Sacramento history. In 1967 a reduction in state supported mental health services affected clinics. including the Sacramento branch where Carl was Chief of Psychiatry. The new Medicare and Medicaid programs made private practice more viable for physicians caring for low income patients. He converted to full time private practice. and the late 1960s and 1970s became a time of relative prosperity. A pool was added to the backyard. and Carl learned. for the first time. to swim. He remained health conscious. and he and Bea were in the pool everyday from May to October until they were both in their 90s. With the children finally grown and on their own Carl and Bea travelledAlaska. Mexico. Hawaii and Scandinavia were highlightsentertained friends. and watched their ever expanding cadre of grandchildren and great grandchildren grow. Bea retired in 1975. but Carl kept his active practice going. seeing patients five days a week until he was 90. Bea suffered from mild macular degeneration and progressive Alzheimers disease. ultimately requiring full time supervision. Carl closed his practiceregretfullyto come home to care for her. He moved from many patients to just one. They continued to play backgammon as long as she could. exercised in the pool. and when that was no longer safe took walks around the courtyard. until Bea passed away in March 2008. They had been married for just over 70 years. In the months following Beas death Carl. now 94. began a series of home refurbishing projects including a new roof and painting inside and out. His oldest grandson John. a professional house painter. came north to help. and ultimately moved in to help manage the house and yard. In August 2008 Carl renewed his medical license and his drivers license as he put it \"just in case\". He became active in his fraternity once again. He did a few legal consultations in 2009. and then with John to type reports on the new computer. began seeing patients again. on a regular basis. working for the State of California as he had when he moved to Sacramento in 1958. this time doing disability evaluations. He pulled the office shingle bearing the name \"Carl E. Drake. Sr. MD\" from the garage (the same shingle used at the house in New Jersey 60 years ago) and mounted it near the back door. The kitchen table became his consultation office. He scheduled a light but steady stream of patients. three or four a week. He saw his last patient on December 12. 2012. before taking a break for the holidays. New visits were on the books for January 2013. On December 26th all four of his children. along with five grandchildren and two daughtersinlaw visited without fanfare for a traditional postChristmas gathering. He was in great spirits. holding court. albeit with less energy than usual. On the 27th after a light dinner he walked into the living room to sit in his favorite easy chair and watch a few bowl games. He dosed off. never to wake again. Dr. Carl Drake left this life as he lived it. with great dignity and grace. He came through the depression. was an AllAmerican athlete. educated himself. raised a family. and was an active working psychiatrist until the very last days of a life that spanned the 20th century and more. He was calm. open. and cheerful. always. His physical stature was imposing. but his gentle steadfastness and serenity were the traits that made him a joy to be with. He never raised his voice. he never needed to. He was universally admired. respected. and loved. He is survived by four children. 11 grandchildren. 17 great grandchildren. 16 greatgreat grandchildren. and thousands of patients. He lived to see his 100th Christmas. he leaves the world a better place.",

Only the U.S. Secretary of Transportation can appoint and remove the IG and no additional action from any jurisdiction on the state or local level is required for this position to be established. In addition. MWAA would be required to pay for the IG using its revenues. not taxpayer dollars. I am reintroducing this legislation because I believe that due to the continued growth of the Dulles corridor. the Dulles rail project is the most important transportation project in the Commonwealth. It must be completed on time and at. or under. budget.

Dr. Chrestman has not only been a steward to higher education in Robeson County. but a trusted advisor and dear friend. Dr. Chrestmans colleagues acknowledge the remarkable progress the college has made during his decade of service as President. During his tenure. Dr. Chrestman worked to reaffirm Robeson Community Colleges status as a nationally accredited institution.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the New Columbia Admission Act. The residents of our nations capital are and always have been citizens of the United States. Yet they are the only taxpaying Americans who are not treated as full and equal citizens. The only way for them to obtain the citizenship rights they are entitled to is through the same statehood used by other Americans. Therefore. I am introducing the New Columbia Admission Act to create a state from essentially the eight hometown wards of the District of Columbia. This 51st state. however. would have no jurisdiction over the federal territory. or enclave that now consists of the Washington that Members of Congress and visitors associate with the capital of our country. The U.S. Capitol premises. the principal federal monuments. federal buildings and grounds. the National Mall and other federal property here would remain under federal jurisdiction. Our bill provides that the State of New Columbia would be equal to the other fifty states in all respects. Consequently. residents of New Columbia would have all the rights of citizenship they are entitled to as taxpaying American citizens. including two senators and. initially. one House member. Just as the New Columbia Admission Act was the first bill I introduced after I was first sworn in as a Member of Congress in the 102nd Congress in 1991. this is my first bill in the 113th Congress. Our first try for statehood received significant support in the House. In 1993. we got the first and only vote on statehood for the District. with nearly 60% of Democrats and one Republican voting for the New Columbia Admission Act. The Senate held a hearing on its companion bill. introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy. but the committee of jurisdiction did not proceed further. Although this start was encouraging. soon thereafter. the District. which is the only U.S. city that pays for state functions. found it necessary to ask the federal government to take over the costs of some state functions. posing fiscal barriers to entry into the Union on an equal basis. and in addition. the Democrats lost control of the House. The District of Columbia recognizes that it can enter the Union only on an equal basis and is prepared to do so. I then introduced the second best option available. a bill for Senate and House representation for D.C.. and later. when Republicans controlled the House. a bill for a House vote. Because these bills had strong support from Democrats. I will introduce them again as well. but with the understanding that residents will never stop short of their full citizenship rights and. therefore. of statehood. The final analysis is that we have no alternative. To be content with less than statehood is to concede the equality of citizenship that is the birthright of our residents as citizens of the United States. It is too late for the residents of the District of Columbia to make such a concession as we approach the 212th year in our fight for equal treatment in our country. This bill is the first I file in the 113th Congress. and it reaffirms our determination to obtain each and every right enjoyed by citizens of the United States by becoming the 51st State of the Union.",

Resolution 5: A resolution providing for the House Rules of the 113th Congress I would have voted no on H. Res. 5. The House Rules package maintains the House of Representatives discriminatory stance on the Defense of Marriage Act. which I have opposed. restricts the District of Columbias electoral representation. prohibits the House of Representatives from acting on health care recommendations from a nonpartisan scientific panel. and supports the partisan and unnecessary attacks on Attorney General Eric Holder. H.R. 41: To temporarily increase the borrowing authority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for carrying out the National Flood Insurance Program I would have voted yes on H.R. 41. To limit the danger of future storms. it is important to ensure the careful reconstruction of areas damaged by Hurricane Sandy. That effort will take many years. however. and should not unnecessarily limit access to resources provided by the National Flood Insurance Program. I support the increased lending authority to that program to ensure adequate support to victims of Hurricane Sandy. H.R. 219: Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 I would have voted to approve this legislation. which combines several changes the House had previously supported to improve recovery projects for Hurricane Sandy.",

MWAA. and provide Virginia a clear majority of the seats. given that both Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Reagan. and Washington Dulles International Airport. Dulles. are located in Virginia. The health of the airports and the Dulles Metrorail Extension project have an enormous impact on northern Virginia. I have often said that the Dulles corridor is the \"main street\" of Virginia. The number of businesses that have chosen to locate in this region is a testament to the strength of the airports and the services it provides as a hub for national and international travel. The success of the Dulles corridor. northern Virginia and the entire Commonwealth depend on MWAA being able to capably run the airports and the rail project. I firmly believe that it is in the best interest of Virginia residents for the Commonwealth to have a majority of seats on the MWAA board to ensure that the airports continue to thrive. Dulles Rail is completed successfully and the Dulles Corridor will continue to be the economic engine of not only the National Capital Region. but the entire Commonwealth of Virginia. I stand ready to work with all interested",

For the past six years. the citizens of the Greater Columbus area and the law enforcement officers of the Columbus Police Department have received unparalleled service and leadership from Jim Gilbert. His dedication has been illustrated through his many hospital visits to every officer injured in the line of duty and his commitment to personally coaching officers through the emotional process associated with using their weapons in the line of duty. Jim Gilberts talents are so well respected that even the most contentious issues between his membership and the city of Columbus have been resolved with no disruption to department operations. His tenure saw no layoffs of personnel in spite of hard economic circumstances. He has often been called upon to aid other officers and/or their families in tragic circumstances and received great praise for his attention to the needs of injured or fallen comrades. The Fraternal Order of Police will miss Jim Gilberts presence and influence. but will continue to rely on his continued service as a patrolman in his new assignment. His legacy will remain with the officers he has mentored. and Franklin County residents can rest assured knowing their streets will be under his watch as he returns to his duties as an officer. We offer our best wishes to Jim Gilbert and his family during this transition in his career. E34 May he enjoy many years of success and happiness as he continues his service protecting our communities in the Columbus area.",

If there are three words that one would associate with JDanny. they would be service. integrity. and friendship. These qualities have helped him to be successful in all of his fields of endeavor and. in turn. have made the individuals and organizations that he has worked for successful in their own right. JDanny was named AARs Executive Vice President in 1989 and developed a reputation for providing steady and wise leadership and promoting responsible home ownership. JDannys advocacy of high standards and ethical practices has benefited countless homeowners throughout the State of Alabama. creating stronger neighborhoods and communities. In 2002 and again in 2005. JDanny served as the first Association Executive appointed as a Committee Liaison by the President of the National Association of REALTORS. He has made presentations to 17 state associations to share successes achieved by the AAR. His contributions were honored nationally in 2004 when he was inducted into the Dr. Almon R. (Bud) Smith Association Executive Leadership Society. As a citizen. JDanny has always believed in ones civic duty to actively participate in our governing process. He has served as a member of the Governors cabinet. as the State Director for a United States Senator. as the executive director of a state political party. and as a state manager for a presidential campaign. Education has been another of JDannys enduring passions. JDanny holds a bachelors degree in Political Science and History as well as a Masters of Education degree in Administration from the University of Montevallo.

Caroline and Ella Kate. through Jay and his wife Susan. In March. Robin will marry the love of his life. Morgan Hightower. There are not many people you can think of that are known by their first name alone. but JDanny Cooper is one of them. He has achieved that distinction by being a listener. a leader. and a source of inspiration for the many privileged to know him. It is fitting and proper to have JDannys contributions to the State of Alabama and our country recorded in the annals of the U.S. House of Representatives.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my friend. colleague and fellow New Yorker for yielding time. Id also like to thank Representatives LOWEY and KING for their leadership. and I commend my colleagues in the New York and New Jersey delegations on both sides of the aisle for working so well together to advance the interests of our states at this critical time. I rise to support the rule and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 152. and the Frelinghuysen Amendment. and to oppose the Mulvaney Amendment. It has been twoandahalf months since Superstorm Sandy hit communities in New York. New Jersey. and neighboring states which continue to face the almost insurmountable task of cleaning up and rebuilding homes. businesses. and lives. Im grateful we finally have the opportunity to consider a relief package to help those who are most in need. On the eastern half of Long Island. businesses. farms. and homes fell victim to intense flooding. ferocious winds caused substantial damage to property. vehicles. and businesses. and along the coast. Sandy created breaches in the coastline and severely eroded other beaches. In New York and New Jersey. at least 651.000 homes were damaged or destroyed and approximately 463.000 businesses were impacted. I must observe this has been a painfully protracted process. it is a fact that what weve tried to accomplish for the last twoandahalf months had once been considered a commonsense. bipartisan response to natural disasters. And the calls for offsets and a slower pace of funding in the wake of natural disasters are a recent phenomenon. even though previous Congresses quickly supported measures that provided relief to affected states. For example. within two weeks of Hurricane Katrina. Congress provided $70 billion in disaster funding to the Gulf Coast with great bipartisan support. and with virtually no discussion about how to pay for it. Congress recognized this was a major disaster. people were hurting. and it had to act to alleviate the suffering. Congress. with bipartisan support. continued to appropriate emergency funds for various Katrina projects and activities totaling $120 billion. all without payfors. For example. Congress funded $1 billion to build a retractable seawall to protect New Orleans from rising storm surge. And it approved $14 billion to rebuild and upgrade critical flood prevention infrastructure to minimize. or mitigate. the risk of such devastation occurring again. Why do New York and New Jersey deserve less urgency? And why are mitigation projects for New Orleans considered prudent. and mitigation projects for New York and New Jersey characterized as pork? Mr. Speaker. our states are not asking for anything more than help to get back on their feet and rebuild. We are asking for nothing more than to respond to this disaster as we have for Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters that have wrought damage upon fellow Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this package without any damaging amendments.",

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise in support of the Disaster Relief Act. This bill brings much needed aid to the residents of central New Jersey. I am concerned that several amendments to H.R. 152 would impair the ability of money in the bill to be spent wisely. The amended bill includes a provision that would block funding that enables coastal communities to develop mitigation plans for future hurricanes and other severe weather events. We should not be limiting NOAAs ability to forecast and respond to hurricanes in an emergency appropriations bill that is designed to respond to a hurricane. I intended to offer to H.R. 152 an amendment that would have lifted the $250.000 cap on Community Development Block Grant Funds (CDBG) that can be used by towns and municipalities to finance critically need infrastructure projects. There are towns in my district that would benefit from upgrades to existing flood management infrastructure. yet are unable to afford the costs associated with these projects. Unfortunately. my amendment was not made in order by the House Leadership. While I support strongly passage of H.R. 152. I want to reiterate that our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Sandy have already waited far too long for help from Congress. In other natural disasters. such as Hurricane Katrina. Congress acted swiftly. and aid reached those in need. And yet. the 112th Congress adjourned before passing a muchneeded disaster relief package. The Senate had already acted to pass a wellconstructed aid package bill. The only reason that this bill is not law today is that House leadership refused to act. This devastating storm has left many people hurting in many different waysshopkeepers. homeowners. fishermen. hotel and restaurant ownersand has damaged the entire economy. H.R. 152 responds to this variety of needs and concerns. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.",

Carmen Warschaw. Carmen believed in the power and promise of our democracy. She believed that politics was about people. that the political process should be a force for good. that elections should produce leaders of bold vision and strong values. courage and character. She believed all Americans bore a responsibility to participate. to vote. to make our voices heard. She believed we all had the ability and the obligation to make a differencewhether in a campaign. in our schools. or in our communities. And she never hesitated to act on her beliefs. I was on the foundation of these principles that Carmen made her mark. It was on the basis of these values that Carmen built her legacy. She left footprints on the lives and careers of countless political figuresas a fixture at every Democratic National Convention from 1948 to 2008. as the Democratic Partys Chairwoman in Southern California. as a power broker in state government. She was never afraid to go toetotoe with the most powerful people in our state. whether a governor or a state party chair. She would. in the words of her alma mater. always \"fight on.\" She was a pioneer. The daughter of immigrants. she became the first woman to lead the states Fair Employment Practices Commission. standing firm for civil rights. equality. and justice for all. She was a philanthropist to her core. investing in the causes of Los Angeles Jewish community. supporting the state and people of Israel. endowing chairs and backing research at USCthe school where she met the love of her life. Louis. She loved music and the arts. and was surrounded by them in her beautiful home. She loved sports. and could regularly be found on a hot summer day in her seat behind the home dugout at Dodger Stadium.

Indeed. it was only fitting that Carmen would pass away on November 6. 2012Election Day. In characteristic fashion. she had already voted. leaving one last. indelible mark on history.

Mr. MARKEY and the other 31 members who have joined me in sponsoring this bill. Gun violence is a public health issue and public health agencies should have the ability to develop and pursue violence prevention and mental health research. Unfortunately. since 1996 a rider to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) appropriations bill has prohibited the agency from conducting highquality. peerreviewed research into gun violence prevention. Congress expanded the ban in 2011 to apply to the entire Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). including the National Institutes of Health (NIH). For over 16 years. gun deaths have continued to plague this country while we have restricted any meaningful. government sponsored scientific research on gun violence. We are unable to answer fundamental questions on the underlying causes of gun deaths because special interests and Members of Congress have restricted federal agencies from researching it. Now is the time to repeal this ban. The bill I am introducing will do just that. The Firearm Safety and Public Health Research Act will lift the current prohibitions on CDC and NIH research into firearm safety. Federallysupported public health research would resume at these key agencies to help understand the causes of gun violence and make sure that we are best prepared to address this enormous public health crisis. Even former Representative Jay Dickey. the Congressman who was instrumental in passing the 1996 ban agrees and is now calling for its repeal. Congress should not be able to establish politically motivated restrictions on specific areas of research. We have witnessed far too many tragedies as the result of firearms and we need all the data and information we can get to inform policy. Mr. Speaker.

The program was formed through the Modesto Chamber of Commerce to identify new potential Modesto leaders and to provide a tenmonth program that will develop knowledge and understanding of the communityits complexities and its potential. The program also provides an opportunity for participants to meet and exchange ideas with each other and current community leaders. and to motivate and encourage participants to assume leadership roles in community affairs. Leadership Modesto has turned out graduates such as Former Mayor James Ridenour. current Mayor Garrad Marsh. current Vice Mayor Stephanie Burnside. Modesto City Council Members Joe Muratore and Dave Cogdill Jr.. and Sheriff Adam Christianson to name a few. Some of the community efforts and accomplishmentsestablished Bette Belle Smith Day. upgraded playground equipment at JFK Elementary School. clothing drive for Professional Dress. and raised money for Camp Taylor.

Leadership Modesto is building our future and celebrating our past. Leadership Modesto is men and women with a sincere commitment. motivation and interest in serving the community. During the ten month program. members expand their understanding of Modesto and Stanislaus County through exposure to community issues many may not otherwise have the opportunity to explore at the same time enhancing leadership and management skills. and develop close relationships and mutual concerns with other class members. Even during a down economy. the Leadership Modesto program continues to inspire public and private sector interest and participation. One of the key successes to the longevity of the Modesto program is the program leadership infrastructureled by a committed group of Steering Committee members. Each Steering Committee member has a direct connection with one of the day topic planning teams. This direct connection enables the program to move quickly. to mobilize and respond to challenges and changes.

For six days in January of 1813. U.S. soldiers fought against British forces for control of Michigan and the lower Great Lakes in a town formerly called Frenchtown. now known as Monroe. The battle was the largest ever fought on Michigan soil. Out of more than 900 members of the United States Armed forces who fought in it. only 33 escaped death or capture. So many lives were lost that \"Remember the Raisin\" became the galvanizing battle cry for the remainder of the War. The battlefield is a Michigan State Historic Site and has been placed on the National Register of historic places. In October 2010. the River Raisin Battlefield became part of the National Park System and remains the only National Battlefield Park representing the War of 1812. Today I am introducing a resolution to commemorate the bicentennial of the Battles of River Raisin and to thank those who work so hard to preserve the significance of the battles for future generations.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have reintroduced my resolution to establish a House Select Committee on the Terrorist Attack in Benghazi to ensure a unified investigation of the attack and the Obama Administrations response. A select committee is essential to combine the myriad existing investigations into a single. comprehensive and exhaustive review. I believe such a combined effort will yield even more information regarding the true nature of these terrorist attacks and the administrations response. More than four months have passed since the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex that occurred during the late evening and early morning hours of September 1112. The attack took the lives of four Americans. including a U.S. ambassadorthe first ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979. Yet the American people still have been told little about the timeline of this attack and the administrations response in the hours. days and weeks following. Consider that the American people still havent been provided answers to the following serious questions: With the inexplicable release of suspect Ali Harzi by Tunisian authorities earlier this month. why are there no suspects in custody? Secretary Clinton. Secretary Panetta. Attorney General Holder and DNI Clapper still havent testified before Congresswhat steps did they take during the attack and in the days that followed? What were the Presidents activities during the sevenhour period of attack? Why wasnt the U.S. military deployed to assist? On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in American history. after multiple attacks this year on U.S. and Western interests. why were U.S. military units and assets in the region not ready. alert and positioned to respond? After all. two of the four people were killed seven hours after fighting began. Why do we still not have clear answers on the internal process that produced the inaccurate talking points on which Ambassador Rice relied several days after the attack? Why were the testimonies of the U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi on September 12eyewitnesses who knew there never was a demonstration outside the Consulatenot immediately factored in to the judgments of our intelligence community? Why wasnt Secretary Clinton interviewed by the Pickering Commission? Was the White House aware of the FBI investigation of Gen. Petraeus? If not. why not? There are also serious questions about links of this terrorist attack to the protests at the U.S. embassies in Cairo. Egypt. Tunis. Tunisia and Sanaa. Yemen that same weekwhere each American compound was breached by individuals allegedly linked to al Qaedaaffiliated groups. What. if any. were the connections between these incidents and the attack in Benghazi? These questions are too seriousand the consequences too graveto be brushed aside. There are critical legislative decisions the next Congress will have to make based on the answers of these questions. But more importantly. the American people deserve answers to these questionsincluding open hearings and an unclassified report. The select committee I am proposing should draw from the existing congressional investigations by including the chairman and ranking member of each committee of jurisdictionIntelligence. Foreign Affairs. Judiciary. Armed Services. Homeland Security and Oversight and Government Reformas well as five additional Republicans appointed by the Speaker and two additional Democrats appointed by the Minority Leader. I appreciate the support I have received for this resolution from the original cosponsors. as well as the Heritage Foundation. I also submit for the record a recent oped that was published on RealClearPolitics.com by former Senator Fred Thompson articulating the benefits of a unified select committee. Senator Thompson has a unique perspective on the need for this committee given his experience as counsel on the Senate select committee on Wate rgate. Mr. Speaker. we owe it to the families of the victims. and the American people. to fully investigate this terrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Ive known Jerry for many yearswe are both from the great hometown of Levittown. Pennsylvania. Everyone in town who knows Jerry knows that he has been a great leader in our community.

Jerry has served as the Commander of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States. and his commitment to their mission is unending. For many years. Jerry has volunteered his time and efforts to the departments cause to ensure that those who have fought our nations battles receive the treatment and the respect they deserve. With Jerrys help. many returning veterans have received the care they need through the Jewish War Veterans. Also. Jerry has been a strong advocate for the state of Israel. fighting to ensure that peace and prosperity continue to reign true in the Jewish state.

Freddy began flying at the age of 16. hanging around airport hangars at Key West International Airport. exchanging plane washes for flying lessons. In time. Freddy became an aviation legend in Key West. Freddy helped put Key West on the map by opening ceremonies and competing in airshows with incredible stunts. both high in the sky and frighteningly close to the ground. His skill and enthusiasm for aviation were so ingrained in Key West culture that he was named General of the Conch Republic Air Force. But. Freddy was more than a talented aviator. He was a skilled and generous businessman as well. As the proprietor of Cabanas Aeronautics Unlimited. he enjoyed providing sightseeing tours of the beautiful Florida Keys. thrill rides to the bravehearted. and perhaps most of all. giving back to others. from mentoring other pilots to flying supplies to earthquakestricken Haiti.

    "speech": "It was exciting to hear the President make climate change a major focus of his inaugural address. and appropriately so. Mr. Obamas first term provided stark evidence of the peril to the planet: recordbreaking heat waves. drought. hurricanes. forest fires. disappearing polar ice. all in accord with a prediction of the climate scientists. but the effects were happening faster and more severely than predicted. The good news is that you dont have to believe the climate scientists to reduce carbon pollution and energy waste while reasserting American global energy leadership. Even balancing the budget could be made easier with this initiative. Congress and the administration should begin serious conversation about a broadbased carbon tax. This would give the right signals on energy sources and use. It could raise money to reduce the deficit. restore our badly damaged infrastructure. speed and finance conservation while cushioning the impact on lowerincome families and small business. There are a number of other commonsense steps that would make progress on carbon pollution and energy conservation goals much more significant. First. the EPA should stop dragging its feet. permitting old. polluting. inefficient coal plants to continue to spew forth toxic waste harming not just the environment but the health of our citizens. Its past time that the Clean Air Act should be enforced. We should make sure there are proper safeguards for the fracking technology for gas and petroleum and making sure this vast reservoir of inexpensive gas does not undercut the critical addition of renewables to our energy portfolio: solar. wind. geothermal. perhaps even tidal energy. We need global leadership on these technologies for a balanced energy portfolio and. ultimately. to reduce our carbon footprint. At each step. we should be looking to enhance energy conservation. because the cheapest kilowatt hour is one that you dont have to generate and use. We should have a 10year glide path in our support of renewable energy. The wind energy industry has already signaled receptivity to phasing out its subsidy. just giving it enough time to come to scale and then stand on its own. Its such a good idea. we should do the same thing for the petroleum industry. After 100 years. the most profitable commodity on the planet is mature and will be able to survive and even thrive without additional tax incentives. Finally. and most important. we should have the Federal Government lead by example. The Department of Energys management of four large power marketing agencies should be the gold standard for integrating renewables into the grid. upgrading transmission capacity. and leading on conservation. The GSA. with over 300 million square feet of Federal office space should demand that all our facilities. every square foot we lease. buy. or build. should be of the highest energy efficiency. The Federal fleet should be on the cutting edge of fuel efficiency standards. Finally. the Department of Defense. the largest consumer of energy in the world. needs to redouble its efforts. The Pentagon is already moving in the right direction. But its not just about saving money in the long term. its providing operational flexibility and reducing vulnerability from inefficient and dangerous fossil fuels. Those fuel tanker trucks in Afghanistan and Iraq might as well have had great big bulls eyes on them for terrorists. The military knows this. and we should give maximum support even in a time of gradually reducing Pentagon budgets. This will pay dividends for defense and to our familys budget if the Pentagon gets it right. Its clear that America is ready and equal to this challenge. The President has signaled his interest and leadership. The question is whether Congress is equal to the challenge. ready with innovation. cooperation. and leadership.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in a remote region of Algeria at an oil and gas facility. in the dark of night before the sun rose. workers from all over the world were getting ready to sit down for breakfast when suddenly gunwielding Islamic radicals stormed the facility. Some of the workers were killed. some were able to escape. some were taken hostage. One of the hostages killed in this attack was a member of my congressional district. Victor Lovelady. Victor was a native of southeast Texas. He was originally from Nederland. Texas. a town of primarily hardworking. blue collar folks centered around the energy industry. Victor had recently moved to Atascocita. Texas. his home not far from where I live. He was 57 years of age. When he died. he was on a contract assignment for ENGlobal. an energy company in Algeria. According to his family. Victor waited to take that contract until his children had finished school so he could attend their sporting events. This was not surprising for someone who was described as a \"dedicated family man and a fantastic coworker.\" Although it was hard to be so far away from his family. Victor was excited to take the contract assignment so he could ensure a secure future for his family. Thats just the kind of father and husband he was. The deal for this contract was 28 days on. 28 days off. and he was just 10 days in with only 18 days left to go. He was scheduled to come home to Texas the day after his daughters birthday. His life was stolen by those who seek to destroy Americans. the radicals who inflict terror on all who believe in freedom. Victor is survived by a loving family. including his wife. Maureen. daughter. Erin. and their son. Grant. Over the holidays. the close Lovelady family expressed concern for the safety of Victor. but he reassured them saying. \"Its so safe. We have protection.\" Its hard for people to understand such unspeakable evil. I spoke with Victors brother. Mike. throughout the crisis and as did Congressman RANDY WEBER. Yesterday. after we heard the terrible news. Mike told me: I can associate with my brother getting in a car wreck or having cancer. But terrorism and Nederland. Texas. dont go together. He was described as \"a great family man and a fantastic coworker\" and \"a leader who mentored countless individuals during his tenure.\" He was also known for his spontaneous wit. Victor moved from Nederland. Texas. to Atascocita to be closer to work. but he went back and forth so that his children could finish school there. Mr. Speaker. Victor was killed not just because of what he did. he was killed because of who he was. He was killed because he was an American. A radical Islamic al Qaeda group by the name of the Signatories in Blood claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack. those who seek to destroy us and kill indiscriminately. They hate us for who we are and what we stand for. Diplomacy is not in their vocabulary. Two other Americans were also killed in this attack. Their names were Gordon Lee Rowan of Sumpter. Oregon. and Frederick Buttaccio of Katy. Texas. The Algerian military retook the compound after 3 days. and they found that 34 other hostages had been killed. as well as dozens of terrorists. Mr. Speaker. our thoughts. prayers. and concerns are with the Lovelady. Rowan. and Buttaccio families today. Secretary Panetta said that America must respond to these murders. That is correct. We should go after these killers who have malice and evil in their hearts. that kill Americans because they are Americans. That would be justice. and justice is what we do in this country. And thats just the way it is.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 3 years have passed since the Supreme Courts dreadful Citizens United decision. and we have seen the dramatic increase in the amount of corporate money flowing into our elections. drowning out the voices of ordinary American citizens eager to participate in the political process. Citizens United also epitomizes the socalled \"corporate personhood\" movement in which some now say that corporations are people. The fact is. corporations are not people. and the Constitution was never intended to give corporations the same rights as the American people. Corporations dont breathe. they dont have kids. and they dont die in wars. My constituents continue to express concern about the growing influence of corporations in our political discourse. Theyre also demanding action on campaign finance reform because they are repulsed by the large amount of money in our campaigns. Quite frankly. they want elected officials to spend more time on policy. deliberating and debating on issues. and less time dialing for dollars. Unfortunately. the Republican leadership in the House has failed to address these pressing issues during the past 2 years. They have been indifferent. We havent had the opportunity to vote on any legislation to curb the influence of unlimited and sometimes secret corporate money flowing into our elections. We havent even had the opportunity to address these issues in committee hearings or markups. Recently. I joined 18 of my colleagues in a letter to Chairman GOODLATTE and Ranking Member CONYERS of the Judiciary Committee requesting a hearing to explore constitutional amendment proposals in response to Citizens United and related cases. I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss these issues in the coming weeks and months. This is. after all. the peoples House. and this is the place where we ought to discuss the concerns of the people. Members of the Democratic Caucus have been working to reform our campaign finance system and restore the rights of the American people that were undermined by the Citizens United decision. We have sponsored and cosponsored legislation to address the growing influence of money in our democratic process. As a member of the task force on elections reform. Im proud to join my colleagues in working to rein in corporate spending and address unregulated money flowing into our elections. Today. Im introducing two constitutional amendments. The peoples rights amendment would overturn Citizens United and put a stop to the growing trend of corporations claiming First Amendment rights. This amendment not only addresses corporate rights as they pertain to campaign finance. but is broader in scope to clarify that corporations are not people with constitutional rights. Importantly. my amendment clearly protects the peoples rights of freedom of speech. freedom of press. free exercise of religion. freedom of association. and all other such rights of the people. My second amendment advances the fundamental principle of political equality for all by empowering Congress and the States with the right to regulate political spending. It will allow Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation that will withstand constitutional challenges. Mr. Speaker. we need to empower people. not corporations or Big Money special interests. Our current system has been corrupted. It undermines the rights of ordinary citizens. and it undermines our democracy. Surely. this is not the system our Founders envisioned. The preamble to the Constitution is \"We the people.\" Let us hope that this Congress doesnt forget that. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these important bills to reform our campaign finance laws and assure that corporate rights do not trump peoples rights.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise and submit remarks in honor of Virginia State Trooper Jay Ferland. a devoted public servant. who along with Trooper Philip Battel saved a family of three from a house fire in Saltville. Virginia. When I first learned of their bravery. news reports failed to mention Trooper Ferlands involvement. On January 2. I spoke of this incident and only mentioned Trooper Battel. However. both men are deserving of our recognition. To recap. in the early hours of Friday. December 28. 2012. Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel were in search of a stolen car that had been involved in an earlier police chase when they noticed off in the distance an orange hue. They decided to investigate. When they reached the area in question. much to their surprise. Troopers Ferland and Battel saw a home engulfed in flames. They banged on the door. but when there was no answer. they made the selfless decision to enter the home and investigate. Their actions in the house awoke its three residents who had no idea that their home was burning down around them. leading to their ultimate escape from the burning house and from the fire. Because of their bravery. the family was saved. and all are in good health. Their lives were saved. and the lives of two of their pets were also saved. The heroic actions of Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel in service to the community are to be commended. and I am honored to be here today to pay tribute to them. Please join me in thanking Trooper Jay Ferland and Trooper Philip Battel for all they have done for the people of southwest Virginia. The Virginia State Police. as my experience has shown over the years. always respond in fine fashion and rise to the occasion. Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel are among just two of the many law enforcement officers to note in the long and proud history of the Virginia State Police. Mr. Speaker.

SSI provides assistance to blind. disabled. and elderly individuals with low incomes. Congress has chosen not to extend the program to Puerto Rico. which instead receives a limited block grant. The average SSI payment to residents of the States is $500 a month. while the average payment to residents of Puerto Rico is just $70.",

    "speech": "program provides payments to needy families with children. The territories are not eligible for certain TANF grants. Moreover. Federal law imposes a cap on the aggregate funding that a territory can receive under a combination of safety net programs. including TANF. My legislation would eliminate this cap. which has not been increased since 1996. and make the territories eligible for TANF grants they do not currently receive. Equality under TANF would mean at least $40 million in additional funding for Puerto Rico each year. Those who seek evidence of how Puerto Rico is harmed by its territory status need look no further than the treatment it receives under SSI and TANF. I will fight to secure parity under these two programs. But as long as Puerto Rico remains a territory. it will be an uphill battle. Mr. Speaker. Puerto Rico recently held a referendum on its political status. Under the current status. the 3.7 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico cannot vote for the leaders who make their national laws and are treated unequally under those laws. as the examples of SSI and TANF well illustrate. The ballot had two questions. On the first question. voters were asked if they wanted Puerto Rico to remain a territory. Of 1.8 million voters. 54 percent said they do not want the current status to continue. while 46 percent say they do. On the second question. voters were asked to express their preference among the alternatives to the current status. Of the 1.4 million people who chose an option. 61 percent voted for statehood. 33 percent for free association. and 5.5 percent for independence. The 834.000 votes for statehood on the second question exceeded the 828.000 for the current status on the first question. For the first time ever. more people in Puerto Rico want to be a state than to continue as a territory. True to form. defenders of the status quo have tried to distort the results of this referendum. making claims that are intellectually dishonest and divorced from the facts. These critics ignore the results of the first question and argue that. because close to 500.000 people left the second question blank. statehood did not prevail in the referendum. Let me be clear so there is no confusion. A majority of voters in Puerto Rico soundly rejected the current status. Among the three alternatives. statehood won a decisive victory. and statehood obtained a greater number of votes than any other status option. including the current status. Mr. Speaker. at yesterdays inauguration. President Obama invoked the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. that among these are life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. President Obama then emphasized. while these truths may be selfevident. they have never been selfexecuting. that while freedom is a gift from God. it must be secured by His people here on Earth. To uphold this Nations core principles and values. the President and Congress must respond to the democratic expression of their fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. who have withdrawn their consent to a political status that makes them secondclass citizens and who have made clear that they aspire to have full democratic rights and full equality under the law. None of my stateside colleagues in Congress would accept territory status for their own constituents. so they must recognize and they must respect that the American citizens I represent no longer accept it either.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. thenchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen testified before the House Armed Services Committee that America \"is maintaining nearly historic fiscal deficits and national debt. Indeed. I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our national security. If we as a country do not address our fiscal imbalances in the near term. our national power will erode. and the costs to our ability to maintain and sustain influence could be great.\" Admiral Mullen is right: debt caused sequestration. Debt and sequestration will slash our uniformed personnel to their lowest levels since before World War II. will reduce our Navy to the smallest number of operational vessels since World War I. and will cut our Air Force to the smallest number of operational aircraft in its history. In sum. debt is putting Americas national security at risk. Last week. on January 17. the Comptroller General of the United States delivered to President Obama a Government Accountability Office report on Americas financial health. I have reviewed many government audits and financial statements during my three decades in public office. I have never seen warnings as stark as those given by the GAO to President Obama. Some lowlights of the GAO report are striking and deserve emphasis. In fiscal year 2012. the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. reported about $85 billion in net valuation losses. The Federal Governments Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporations liabilities exceeded its assets by about $34 billion. The Postal Service \"finished the year with a reported net loss of almost $16 billion.\" The Federal Housing Administration reported that its liabilities exceeded its assets by about $15 billion. Mr. Speaker. America is on a path to insolvency and bankruptcy. an event that will debilitate our country. America has incurred four consecutive. unsustainable trilliondollar deficits and is in the midst of a fifth consecutive trilliondollar deficit. Americas national debt exceeds $16 trillion. Interest on our debt is well in excess of $200 billion per year. To put our debt service burden in perspective. that is more than four times what the Federal Government spends on all highway and transportation infrastructure projects in America each year. Unless Washington becomes financially responsible. future debt service will escalate and even more money will be spent on debt service rather than on programs that serve Americans. Americas Comptroller General issued a stern warning to President Obama: The comprehensive. longterm fiscal projections show that. absent policy changes. the Federal Government continues to face an unsustainable path. Over the long term. the structural imbalance between spending and revenue will lead to the continued growth of debt held by the public as a share of GDP. This means the current structure of the Federal budget is unsustainable. Americas current path and Federal budget are unsustainable. Absent changes. Federal Government insolvency and bankruptcy are certain to result and cause an economic disaster unrivaled in Americas history. This week. the House of Representatives faces a vote to increase Americas debt ceiling. Pending legislation raises the debt ceiling by roughly $300 to $400 billion. What protection from the risk of insolvency and bankruptcy does America get in return? Are there any spending cuts? No. Are there policies that spur economic growth and result in revenue increases? No. Does this proposal help fix in any way the trilliondollar deficits that threaten America with financial ruin? No. Mr. Speaker. I can only speak for me. I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless significant efforts are made to fix the underlying problem of deficits and accumulated debt that force debt ceiling votes and risk Americas future. I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless. first. Congress passes a substantive balancedbudget constitutional amendment that solves the debt problem for future generations or. second. we implement sizable spending cuts that help get our financial affairs in order. I take this stance full well knowing the adverse economic effects of a failure to raise the debt ceiling but also knowing. Mr. Speaker. that those effects pale in comparison to an insolvency and bankruptcy of the America I love.",

We opposed a bill that would have allowed women to die if the emergency room employee who came to her aid had a \"conscientious objection\" to performing an abortion that would save her life. without even being required to refer her elsewhere for help. We have insisted that politicians not place themselves in the operating room to judge the motives of a woman seeking a constitutionally protected medical procedure if they thought her decision may have been based on the gender or race of the fetus.

PAHPRA created the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority within HHS to help with the development of medical countermeasures and ensure communications between HHS and the developers of medical countermeasures. Reauthorizing these programs would help the Nation respond to a CBRN attack and is essential to addressing gaps in the Nations flu preparedness. HH.R. 307 is essentially the same as H.R. 6672. the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2012. which passed the House in December by a vote of 38316. I would urge all Members to support this critical piece of legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 307. the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. Unfortunately. last month. before the end of the Congress. we were unable to get this final bill over the finish line. so I am grateful to Chairman UPTON and Ranking Member WAXMAN for agreeing to move quickly to get this bill passed and sent over to the Senate without further delay. This bill is virtually identical to the Housepassed bill last December. It reflects bipartisan work that took place between the House and Senate over several months late last year to resolve differences between the House- and Senatepassed PAHPRA reauthorization bills. We all know very well that our Nation continues to face threats that require an ongoing commitment to public health and emergency preparedness. Of course. I think to my own district and State of New Jersey after we experienced a devastating storm that destroyed entire communities. The Federal Governments support. including through programs authorized by PAHPRA. was critical in the wake of this hurricane disaster. The legislation before us today reauthorizes programs and activities first established as part of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. the 2004 Project BioShield Act. and the 2006 Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act. Over the past decade. these programs have represented comprehensive efforts to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. As a result of the investments that followed. our Nation is better equipped to respond to public health emergencies. I just want to take a few moments to highlight ways that H.R. 307 will continue the progress weve made over the past decade: First. the bill further facilitates the development of medical countermeasures through emphasizing medical countermeasure advancement in the National Health Security Strategy. requiring the development of a 5year budget analysis of the countermeasure enterprise. and calling for the development of a countermeasure strategy and implementation plan. Second. it bolsters the Nations medical and public health preparedness and response infrastructure. including through a new authority that would allow States to deploy personnel funded through Federal programs to the areas within their State where they are most needed in the aftermath of a disaster. Third. it strengthens and clarifies the position of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response as the lead for HHS on emergency preparedness and response and calls for streamlining and better coordinating HHS preparedness grants with those of other Departments. Finally. it places even greater emphasis on the special needs of pediatric and other atrisk populations in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 307 improves FDAs emergency response capabilities. It will enable FDA to authorize the distribution and use of medical countermeasures in preparation for an emergency and to take actions during an emergency that will allow for the most effective use of medical countermeasures. I just wanted to thank the Congressmen. First. I want to thank my colleague. who is about to speak. Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO. for all her work on this legislation over the years. also. obviously. MIKE ROGERS and Congressman GENE GREEN. These are different people who have authored the legislation over the years. I would also like to recognize the contributions of Chairman UPTON. Chairman PITTS. Ranking Member WAXMAN. and Congressman MARKEY in strengthening the legislation as it moved through the committee process and in discussions with the Senate. They have all worked in a bipartisan fashion over the past 1 2 years to accomplish the goals of our Members. and they should be commended for their work. I urge Members to join me in supporting passage of H.R. 307. I am hopeful that our Senate colleagues will move forward on this bills passage so we can get it to the Presidents desk as quickly as possible. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Speaker and Ranking Member PALLONE. I want to thank ANNA ESHOO for being such a great partner in what is truly a collaborative effort to get this bill passed and protect our ability to protect so many Americans. Its been about 10 years. Mr. Speaker. since September 11 and the anthrax attacks that followed. The threat of bioterrorism remains a very real danger. indeed. to the American people. As we have seen in events across northern Africa. our adversaries in al Qaeda and others are still hellbent on their terrorism acts. and we know that they are interested in chemical and radiological and biological elements to further their political gains. Fortunately. we have spent the last decade preparing for those chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear threats by developing and stockpiling numerous medical countermeasures to protect Americans in the event of attack. As a result of these efforts. we now have numerous vaccines and treatments in the Strategic National Stockpile that will save thousands of lives if were attacked. However. the work to protect Americans against bioterrorism is not finished. and we must pass this bill or the future of Americas public health preparedness infrastructure will be in jeopardy. The Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act is a fiscally responsible bill that represents common ground between the bipartisan Houseand Senatepassed preparedness bills in the 112th Congress. Id like to take this opportunity again to thank the bipartisan cosponsorsfirst. ANNA ESHOO for her longterm commitment and partnership in this. certainly Mr. PALLONE from New Jersey as well. Chairman UPTON and Ranking Member WAXMAN. and all of our great partners in the Senatefor their support in what has been a very productive process to ensure the health preparedness of our States and hospitals for the next flu outbreak or pandemic. This bill will reauthorize critically important biodefense programs designed to promote the continued development of medical countermeasures against chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear threats. and would strengthen the Nations public health preparedness infrastructure. Reauthorizing these programs is essential to how the Nation would respond to these types of attacks. The bill would also reauthorize programs for 5 years at the fiscal year 2012 appropriated level. The bill would not create a new program nor increase authorization for appropriations for an existing program. This bill would reauthorize and improve certain provisions of Project Bioshield and something we call PAHPA. Again. I want to thank you. Mr. Speaker. I wish this bill Godspeed for the safety of all of our first responders and those who might be exposed to what we know is a real threat when it comes to the safety. health. and national security of the United States.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the ranking member. Mr. PALLONE. for his leadership and legislative courtesies along the way. Im very proud that as we begin a new year and a new Congress that this bill is on the floor. I think its fitting that we begin a new Congress with this bill. the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization. It is very important legislation. as you have already heard from those that have spoken. I first introduced this legislation with Congressman MIKE ROGERS. my friend. my colleague. at the committee. and weve done other bills together very successfully. as well. We began that particular effort in 2006 to better help our country prepare for a chemical. biological. radiological. or nuclear attackall words that none of us really wish to utter. But we need to be prepared. Developing and stockpiling appropriate countermeasures is essential for public safety. And these programs encourage American companies to invest in areas of critical need because we need the partnership of the private sector in this as well. The bill before us today includes new provisions that highlight the important needs of our Nations children. Children are not just little adults. They need special care and medical attention. Theyre especially vulnerable to biological or chemical agents because of their size. their limited capacity to flush toxins out of their bodies. their underdeveloped motor skills. and their total reliance on their parents or other caregivers. And certainly the role of the Congress in this is to make sure that we have laws that really speak specifically to them. While the hope is that we will never need to use these countermeasures to combat an attack on our country. Im proud that weve strengthened these programs for everyone in our country. especially children. This legislation is supported by the American Public Health Association. the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. the National Association of County and City Health Officials. and Trust for Americas Health. as well as. very importantly. the American Academy of Pediatrics. Im very pleased that were. once again. voting to pass the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. just as we did a month before the end of the last Congress. and I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same. This is a bipartisan effort. and its critical to our national preparedness and security strategies. We very often come to the floor about strategies relative to our military and strategies relative to our national intelligence community. This is about the public health element of that national security for our country. We need to move forward with this and bring the legislation to the Presidents desk for his signature. I thank Chairman UPTON. the ranking member of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WAXMAN. and certainly the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee and. again. my wonderful partner.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act which will reauthorize certain provisions of the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 and the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act of 2006. This legislation was initially passed by Congress to help the U.S. develop medical countermeasures against chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear terrorism agents. to provide a mechanism for Federal acquisition of these newly developed countermeasures. Our Nation remains vulnerable to these threats because many of the vaccines and medicines to protect our citizens do not exist. Developing and stockpiling these medical countermeasures require time. resources. and research. all of which will be provided under the legislation before us today. Im pleased that the language I supported during the committee process aimed at increasing emphasis on regional trauma care centers was included. This bill is very important to me because the University of Texas Medical Branchs Galveston National Laboratory is near our district. The Galveston National Lab is the only BSL4 lab located on a university campus. At the lab. scientists conduct research to develop therapies. vaccines. and diagnostic tests for naturally occurring emerging diseases such as SARS and avian influenza. as well as for microbes that might be employed by terrorists. This is exactly the type of research we hope to encourage under the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. As an original cosponsor of this bill with Mr. ROGERS. Im very pleased at how quickly we have moved this rare bipartisan piece of legislation. I would like to thank Chairman ROGERS. Chairman UPTON. Chairman PITTS. Ranking Member WAXMAN. Ranking Member PALLONE. Mrs. Myrick and Ms. ESHOO for their work on this important legislation. The House passed this bill twice last year. and I hope the Senate acts quickly. and we will send it to the President. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 307. the Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. and urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. Mr. Speaker. this bill has been a long time coming. In fact. its the same one we passed just last month at the end of the 112th Congress. H.R. 307 reflects a lengthy. but extremely productive process with our Senate colleagues and their staff to come together to bridge the differences between earlier House and Senate bills. H.R. 307 is the product of that effort. It is our hope that this time around. the Senate will pass the bill as soon as possible after the House acts on the legislation today. Toward that end. H.R. 307 reauthorizes and makes minorbut importantimprovements to various programs and activities first established in the 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act. 2004 Project Bioshield Act. and the 2006 Pandemic and AllHazards Preparedness Act. or as it is commonly referred to. \"PAHPA.\" These programs and activities are key in helping to ensure that our nation is well prepared to successfully manage the effects of natural disasters. infectious disease outbreaks. and acts of bioterrorism. H.R. 307 includes dozens of changes to these underlying authorities. Let me highlight just three provisions that deserve special attention: First. the bill will ensure that the Food and Drug Administration focuses on medical countermeasures of the highest importance. Medical countermeasures are products designed to combat chemical. biological. radiological. and nuclear agents. H.R. 307 will facilitate communication between the FDA and product sponsorsparticularly on high priority countermeasures for which sponsors have developed regulatory management plansto resolve scientific and regulatory questions and help make these products available more quickly. Just last month. FDA approved the first drug developed and procured under Project BioShield. The FDA provisions in H.R. 307 will also facilitate the rapid provision of existing medicines to people in need during an emergency. Taken together. these FDA provisionsalong with the renewed emphasis in our countermeasure enterprise through other parts of the legislationwill make it possible for a greater number of drugs and devices to move from early development to procurement. Second. the legislation makes improvements to the nations blueprint for public health preparedness and response activities that will enhance the ability of our diverse health care system to respond to mass casualty emergencies. Among such improvements are clarifying the role of the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response as the lead office within the Department of Health and Human Services for emergency preparedness and response. H.R. 307 also establishes a new authority to permit the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to approve a request of a state. territory. or an Indian tribe to redeploy certain federallysupported employees during the time of a national emergency to geographic areas where these employees are needed most. Finally. H.R. 307 continues support for investments in state and local public health departments. Such investments are necessary to make certain that we have the requisite public health infrastructure in place to respond immediately and appropriately to any public health threat that may arise. This legislation reflects the effort of a number of membersDemocrats and Republicans alike. On our side of the aisle. Congressman GREEN. Congresswoman ESHOO. Congressman MARKEY. and our Health Subcommittee Ranking Member. Congressman PALLONE. have been deeply involved. I want to thank them and their staff for all the long and incredibly hard work they have put into this legislation and to the process of getting us here today. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. thank you for allotting the time. I appreciate it very much. My name is KEITH ELLISON. Im here today to reflect on what I believe was a historic speech for the ages yesterday. President Obama met the historic challenge. met the historic moment. and I just want to talk about my feelings about how important that speech really. really was. President Obama. you should understand. was called upon to make his second inaugural address. And inaugural addresses. historically. are speeches that people dont always remember. but there are some that we will never forget because of how important they are. His first speech 4 years ago was a speech during which. over the course of 18 minutes. he talked about trying to reach out diplomatically. He talked about the importance of trying to come together to solve common problems. And I think the basic attitude of the first speech was conciliation in an effort to try to work out problems both foreign and domestic. In this speech. however. President Obama set forth what I believe was a clear. concise agenda based on values that he owns. I was so proud to hear President Obama talk about the need to address climate change. He reminded us that you can believe in climate change or you can disbelieve in climate change. but the fact is our storms are harder. the drier weather we are seeing is causing forest fires. and we are seeing climatic catastrophes associated with climate change. Were seeing the consequences of it. So if we ignore the cause. we cannot ignore the consequence. I was so proud to hear him say that. He also spoke out boldly for equality. human rights and civil rights for all Americans. I remember that he said. and you may recall. too. Mr. Speaker. he said. we will never forget Stonewall. Seneca Falls. and Selma. These are three iconic moments in civil rights history when he talked about the womens rights movement. the gay rights movement. and the African American movement for civil rights. but they all added up to one thing. which is that an American is an American is an American. It doesnt matter what your color is. what your sex is. or who you love and want to be with. What matters is that you are an American and entitled to the full protection of the law in these United States. I think it was very important for him to do so. It represented an evolutionary moment in American history that a President being inaugurated into his second term would stand up for the first time and say \"civil and human rights for all people.\" I thought it was a great moment. and I found myself cheering even though I hadnt planned on doing so. But he didnt stop there. He specifically said we need to stand here and protect Social Security. Medicare. and Medicaid. three critical programs this Nation depends on. three critical programs that seniors depend upon. But not only do seniors depend on them. Also we know that seniors and people live on survivors benefits. When their loved one who gets Social Security dies. children are entitled to get survivors benefits. And these survivors benefits are literally putting food on the tables for millions of families all across this country. But not only that. People with disabilities get Medicare and Social Security. And he stood up for these programs. reminding us that this richest country in the history of the worldthe richest country in the history of the worlddoes not need to throw its poor. its vulnerable. and its aged under the bus. We are not too broke to make sure that our senior citizens. our children who are on survivors benefits. and people who are vulnerable economically. were not too poor to make sure that theres something for them and that they have a livelihood and a way to make it forward. Imagine the richest country in the history of the world saying. Im sorry. Grandma. but we got to cut your benefits because we cant make it. The reality is that when he gave that speech and he specifically identified those three programs as central to the American Dream. the American promise. I was proud. And I said. thats right. And I tell you. I was so happy to hear him say that. But he didnt even stop there. He talked about the need for immigration reform and the fact that for so many people around the world. America is still the land of opportunity and that we cannot sit by as 12 million people live in our country in the shadows with no pathway toward citizenship. The President specifically called on us to do something about it. Now. the President knows that guns are a volatile issue. He didnt smack the issue of gun violence prevention right on the head. but he did mention the victims of Sandy Hook. and he did tell us that children have a right to be safe at school. thereby signaling that. you know. yeah. we are going to do some things about the proliferation of guns. highcapacity clips. and background checks. things that make sense. not taking away the right to own a gun. but to do commonsense gun violence prevention measures that I think will make everybody safer. In fact. if youre looking at the news right now. you know that there was another shooting today in Texastodaytoday. So the bottom line is that the President laid out a vision. an inclusive vision. for America. The President got up in front of the world stage. all the Members of Congress. Ambassadors. Senators. the Supreme Court. and everybody assembled and said. This is the direction that were going in. Were going to say Americans. whatever their background. are included within the promise of America. Were going to address income inequality. Were going to protect the social safety net. Now. some punditsyou can always count on the punditry to throw salt aroundthey said. well. it didnt reach out to the Republicans. Well. I think that Republicans are on Social Security. Medicare. and Medicaid. and they probably. or at least their parents. appreciate protection of that program. Republicans live on this planet in which we see the temperature rising and the consequences of global climate change hurting more and more people. Some Republicans are black. some Republicans are Latino. and some Republicans are gay. And when they heard that they are included in Obamas vision of America. they must have felt good about that. So I dont agree that this speech didnt reach out to the full range of the political spectrum. left and right. I think that if youre in the category that he mentioned. that no matter what your political ideology may be. that you would feel that. yes. this includes me. Now. I think the Presidents speech was also great because it was courageous. No President has ever mentioned before the gay community in the United States. and most people like myself and most people are what we call straight or heterosexual. But all of us know that there is prejudice against the gay community. Theres no denying this. Theres no sense in denying it. We all know that these folks are our neighbors. theyre our coworkers. theyre our friends. and we know that they have suffered because of prejudice against them. For a President to stand up and say this isnt right and that everybody is included in the American Dream. I thought was a great moment. It was a first. It was historic. I think that President Obama seized the historical mantle and said. Im not going to sit up here and use a bunch of flowery. vague language. Im going to get up here and talk about what I really believe in. I was so proud of Obama yesterday. I admired how he handled himself and what he said. I think over the past 4 years. President Obama has. in my opinion. bent over backwards to reach out to the Republican Conference. He has really accommodated them in a whole number of ways. and yet their conferenceand the record is clearhas come forward and said that their goal over the course of the last 4 years was to make him a oneterm President. Well. they failed. Hes a twoterm President. So the question is: Are we now going to come together? Is the caucus of \"no\" now going to say there are some things were willing to work with? I hope so. Let me tell you. My dad was a Republican for many years. Of course. I love my dad and loved him when he was a Republican. He was what I would call a \"sensible Republican.\" He believed in watching the money. He believed in getting the most out of every dollar. He believed that the government had a limited role and shouldnt get in everyones business. Today. we have folks who are not in the realm of even negotiation. Theyre willing to shut the government down. allow our country to go over the fiscal cliff and default on Americas debt just to get their way. Thats an extremist position. This is an extremist ideology. Its not a reasonable thing to say. Now. some of them will come up here and talk about how big the debt and the deficit is. Wait a minute. When we say that we want to cut oil subsidies to Big Oil companies. they dont want to do that. When we want to raise some taxes on the wealthy so we can use that money to lower the deficit. they dont want to do that. I doubt anyone who says theyre outraged by the debt and the deficit. and we give credible solutions on how to lower it and they say \"no\"-I begin to doubt that thats really what theyre concerned about. The speech yesterday that the President gave. I believe. is a good starting point. The President is not negotiating with himself. Hes declaring his position. The other side in the political divide can declare their position. and then we can come together and negotiate. Im a huge supporter of the President. but I kind of believe that what he used to do. he used to state his values. then he used to anticipate what the other side would want. then he used to try to come together. bring both sides together. and then he would go to the table and negotiate. So we would end up not with a liberal position. but with sort of a centrist position. and we would start out right there. and then anywhere we would go from there would be further to the right. So if were lucky. we end up with a centerright position. Now I think we start with. as we are proud to be the progressive liberals that we are. we start out with what we believe in. then they say what they believe in. and then we negotiate. and maybe well end up in the middle. But I dont want to end up in the center right anymore. I want to end up with some reasonable compromise that protects Social Security. Medicare. and Medicaid. that protects civil rights for all Americans. that addresses this massive income inequality. that addresses climate change. that moves us toward a green economy. that allows people who are immigrants to have a pathway into the respectability of life in American society. The President did not disappoint last night. I believe in those things. Clearly he does. too. And I was so proud to see the President stand and deliver for these important values. Over the next several weeks. Mr. Speaker. were going to be in a huge debate. We just finished the whole debate on the socalled fiscal cliff. It really wasnt a fiscal cliff. That was just the name the press loved to call it. but the reality is it was a set of budgetary deadlines and tax deadlines. We were able to come up with a deal. but the worst part of the deal is what wasnt in it. Thats why I voted for it. I wasnt thrilled with the deal. but the thing I didnt like about it was the stuff mostly that was not included. Because even though I was happy to extend unemployment for a year. that was good. Even though I was happy to raise taxes on the richest Americans. because I believe its their patriotic duty to help their country out. that was good too. I believe those were good things. I thought the fact that we did not deal with the debt ceiling. the sequester. and the continuing resolution really just put us in a position where a few months later our Republican friends would say: Youre going to cut vital programs for Americans who need them. or were going to shut down the government. Youre going to cut Head Start. youre going to cut food stamps. youre going to cut Social Security. Medicare. and Medicaid. or were going to default on Americas debt. This is the hardcore bargaining position theyve been trying to ram down our throat. Ill never forget Speaker BOEHNER. who said. \"Look. if they dont take these cuts in one loaf. well feed it to them a slice at a time.\" Thats a quote. And so I was concerned that this deal we just did. this socalled fiscal cliff deal. the New Years Eve deal. even though there were things in it that I thought were good. I was concerned. Mr. Speaker. because of what wasnt in it. I believe the American people and our markets. our business people. deserve to have this budgetary issue resolved in a way so they can actually plan. My Republican friends correctly point out that there is uncertainty when Congress doesnt solve problems. but theyre the ones causing the uncertainty. In fact. they are guilty of creating the problem that they criticize the most. They say that we shouldnt kick the can down the road. They say we should have some finality. But theyre the ones who are not agreeing to some finality. They say that we need to make sure that we get some real job creation. but theyre the ones cutting into the public sector. causing us layoffs from the Federal Government. and therefore State governments. And of course. people who have government jobs spend money too. which leads people who they do business with to have jobs. If you work for the EPA and you go to a local grocery store. you spend money there. which allows the cashiers and the stock people to have jobs. Everything they say they dont want it seems like thats what theyre for. They dont want job cuts. they dont want job losses. but they create them. They dont want uncertainty. but they create it. They want finality. but they avoid it. It doesnt make any sense. They say they want to reduce the deficit. but they enlarge it. So my point is: Whats really going on here? I think President Obama has just kind of had enough and has said rather than trying to figure out how to do a deal with these folks who keep moving the goalpost. Im just going to say what Im about. Im going to declare what my values are. and they can come to the table and represent their own point of view. and well find a way. hopefully. to get to a point where we can agree and go forward. Even if we hate the deal. even if we dont like it. at least maybe we can move forward so Americans can at least be able to plan for their future. Mr. Speaker. I think that Presidential inauguration speeches are important. They do lay out an important path. I was reviewing. Mr. Speaker. the inaugural speeches of President Abraham Lincoln. Im a huge fan of Abraham Lincoln. I wouldnt call myself an expert or scholar of Lincoln. but Im sort of an amateur reader of everything about Lincoln. In Lincolns first speech. he was conciliatory. You will recall. Mr. Speaker. Abraham Lincoln. when he was elected. as soon as he was elected. Southern States began to secede even before he was inaugurated. South Carolina. Mississippi. the other States. they started seceding each before he was inaugurated. As soon as he was elected. some of them said. We are out of here. So when he came to his inaugural speech. the first one. he was trying to keep the Southern States in and trying to keep the border States from leaving. So he said some things that were so conciliatory. that even the abolitionists of the time thought that he wasnt what they were hoping for. He wasnt really against slavery. He said he was. but they thought that he didnt prove it. They thought he was halting. they thought he was too cautious. and they criticized him for this. But after the Civil War broke out and so much blood was spilled and so much harm was done to our Nation620.000 people died in the Civil WarPresident Lincoln came back 4 years later. On that speech. his second inaugural speech. it was a bold defense of the union cause and an argument that slavery must go. He didnt pull any punches on the second one. Now. he was not bodacious. and he was not offensivehe was trying to be as conciliatory as he could bebut he made very clear that America was going to be. one. whole and not divided and. two. that it would be slave free. He didnt water it down. as some pundits think that Obama should water his position down. The second time around. after we went through all the big fights. President Lincoln stood firm and spoke firmly and clearly but also in a conciliatory way about what he believed in. I dont know. Maybe there were some people back in 1865 who might have said. Well. Lincoln ought to be a little more sympathetic to the South. and he ought to try to work with them more. Look. Im not trying to compare this budgetary fight to the horror of slavery. There is no comparison. not at all. Im not trying to say that our Republican colleagues are in any way sympathetic to slavery. Theyre not. Thats not true. Im simply trying to make the point that when you start out trying to work with somebody and you cant get anywhere. and when you go through all the travails and difficulties of trying to get somewhere and you cant. then at the end of the fight. if you win. youre probably going to say. Look. I tried to work with you and you wouldnt work with me. I ended up coming out on top on this thing. so now Im going to bargain for my position. This is not to say the President is not going to negotiate. This is not to say the Democrats arent going to negotiate. We are going to negotiate. We believe that the democratic process requires an eye toward compromise. but I also believe that we went to our constituents in 435 districts around this country and that we told them what we believed in and we told them what we stood for. so they deserve for us to at least articulate that position. If we have to make a compromise on some things for the sake of the Union. for the sake of the Nation. we should do that. but we should never act like we dont believe in what we do. in fact. believe in. which is Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. which is confronting income inequality. which is equality for all Americans regardless of race. color. sexual preference. and all that kind of stuff. We should say what we believe in. We should say that we believe that a woman should earn every penny that a man makes. We should say these things. We should not be afraid to be who we are and articulate our vision of the world. Then when we go to the negotiating table. there might be some things we have to give up. and there might be some things we get. but we should never make any mistake about what were all about. So Im really proud of the President tonight. I feel the President did a fine job for America yesterday. and I wish the President well. I do know that the President. in being a man of reason. will listen to Republican arguments as to what they would like to see happen. but I also believe. based on what he said yesterday. that he is going to fight for what he believes in. too. He warned us against dogmatism. and he also said Look. dont confuse absolutism with principle. So thats sort of a warning to our side a little bit in his saying. look. I am going to have to negotiate some things. But when he sits around that table. we know where hes starting from. and that makes me feel good. I wish all the best for this Presidency and this Congress because I think that. if the Republicans are successful and if the Democrats are successful and if the President is successful. then America will be successful. So Im here to say that I hope we do negotiate. but there are some things that. quite frankly. Im not willing to cave in onSocial Security. Medicaid. Medicare beneficiary cuts. Theyre asking for cuts from the people who have already been cut. Do you know. Mr. Speaker. that 20 percent of widowed women on Social Security have nothing but Social Security to live on. and yet we want to reduce their benefits? Do you know that a full third of widowed women on Social Security depend upon Social Security to the degree of 90 percent of their incomes? Were talking about people who are making somewhere between $17.000 and $24.000 a year to begin with. You cannot go to people who already have so little and say give me back even more. This is at a time. because of our housing foreclosure crisis. when rents in nearly every city have gone up. and this is at a time when we have limited vitally important programs that help ease the pain of poverty for Americans. So there are some things that we are going to protect in this and that we are going to call upon the masses of Americans to protect. Let me just say. Mr. Speaker. that today I dont have the ability to be here for the whole hourduty callsbut I did want to offer a few reflections on the speech that was given. I also want to say a few other things as it relates to the next period coming up. In the next few weeks. were going to face a debt ceiling increase. In fact. we have a debt ceiling vote tomorrow. Were not voting to raise the debt ceiling. were voting to suspend it. I think this is bad policy because markets. businesspeople. and everybody else need to know that the Congress is going to stand by the credit rating and the debts of the American people. Were not going to default. and we shouldnt threaten that we are. Its bad. Its not a good thing to do. Its important for the American people to know that. when we talk about raising the debt ceiling. Congress is not approving new spending. Were not borrowing. Were saying that were going to pay the bills on debts we already acquired. Its kind of like this: If you have a family and if somehow youre already obligated to pay a mortgage. if you dont have the money for your mortgage. you may have to go to your cousin or your brother or your uncle and say. I need you to help me until next week so I can pay the mortgage. So you now have borrowed money to pay an obligation that you already owe. an obligation that. if you dont pay. you will default on. You can also have a situation in which somebody doesnt have enough money but goes into a local electronics store and says. Im going to buy that big screen television right there on my credit card. Those are two different scenariosborrowing to meet obligations youve already acquired and borrowing to buy stuff you really cannot afford. Raising the debt ceiling is the first one. Mr. Speaker. Its borrowing to meet obligations we already have. Its not borrowing for new expenditures. So. when we appropriate money and when we have had appropriated expenditures in the past. we might raise the debt ceiling to meet those obligations. which we should do. because to do otherwise is to say that America is going to default on its debts. which we cannot do. not just for our own sakes. but this would cause international harm to the world economy. People are confused about this whole debt ceiling debate. and I dont believe that its right for Republicans to just suspend the debt ceiling and then to put a bunch of stuff in there about the Senate and all that kind of stuff. some provisions that are blatantly unconstitutional. too. by the way. So Im disappointed in this thing thats coming up. but people need to know that this debt ceiling vote is coming up. They should also know that the sequester is coming up. With the New Years Eve deal. we delayed the sequester 2 months. These are massive cuts to the tune of. I think. around $89 billion that are going to be put on the Pentagon and domestic spending. Theyre dumb cuts. Were not looking at specific programs and evaluating their worth and eliminating some and keeping others. Were just. like. \"chop.\" This is no way to budget for a Nation. and I hope we can delay the sequester. but its coming up soon. Republicans have vowed that they want even more cuts. maybe even in addition to the sequester. to negotiate. I think we should remind everybody that weve already had $1.7 trillion in cuts and that we just did $600 billion in new revenue. Thats about $2.3 trillion. How much more cutting do we need to do. particularly when were talking about vital programs for Americans? So. Mr. Speaker. if were going to make cuts. we should cut things that we really dont need. For example. Medicare part D. which passed in 2003. prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies. Now. the Veterans Administration does negotiate for drug prices all the time. but Medicare is prohibited from doing so. Basically. if the pharmaceutical company says this drug costs this. the government has to pay. and we cant use our large buying power to lower a price. We should change that. We should introduce competitive bidding. That would save us a quite a bit of money. Mr. Speaker. Thats a way we could save money. Heres another thing we should do. We should eliminate oil subsidies. coal subsidies. and natural gas subsidies. The fossil fuel industry. a highly profitable industry. making a lot of money. a profitable industry. theres no reason in a free market economy we should be subsidizing a profitable company. It doesnt make sense. Even if you are a free market person. you have a hard case to make that we should be handing Exxon. Chevron. and Mobil money. We shouldnt do it. We should end it. and any real conservative would agree with me on that. Now. if somebody is just trying to get money to friends. thats another story. But if youre really about reducing the deficit. thats one way to do it. You know. there are a number of things we could cut. Theres a lot of Cold War weapons systems that could be eliminated. Our nuclear arsenal could be reduced without threatening our national security. and we could save money in doing it. There are ways to reduce the budget. There are ways to do it. and we probably should. But lets do it in a way where we keep Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. food stamps. aid for college students. money for investing in medical research. and groundbreaking research to give life to brandnew industries. You know. a lot of people dont know. Mr. Speaker. this thing we call the Internet was started with a government programsomething called DARPA. A government grant helped fund the Internet. Yes. it did. I dont know about Al Gore. but I do know that the government. a government grant. put the money into the form that we now know as the Internet. The government did that. The government funded the project for mapping the human genome. The government. The governments not always bad. So we should keep some programs. We should lower others. but weve got to think about this thing in a different way than we are. All I want to say. Mr. Speaker. as I begin to wrap up is that it is an honor and a privilege to be able to serve in this. the greatest deliberative body in the world. And even though we have big fights with our Republican colleagues. its an honor to serve with them. too. Were both here. sent here by the 435 districts that we represent to argue our positions and try to come to some kind of solution. I believe that we can have solutions if everyone has an eye toward compromise. but that depends upon everybody starting out carrying out the vision of the district they represent. My district wants me to stand up for Social Security. Medicare. and Medicaid. stand up for civil and equal rights for everybody. including gay people. My district wants me to find a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are here. My district wants me to do something about climate change and move our economy toward a green economy. Now. Im going to start there. and then we can negotiate with our colleagues on where we end up. but Im proud that the President stood up for our values. I think his speech was groundbreaking. historic. and gave real energy to people who share his value system. With that. Mr. Speaker. I have to curtail my hour. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 40 years ago today marks the U.S. Supreme Courts infamous. reckless. and inhumane abandonment of women and babies to abortionists. Forty years of victims. dead babies. wounded women. shattered families. Forty years of government -sanctioned violence against women and children. Since 1973. more than 55 million children have been killed by abortion. a staggering loss of childrens precious lives. a death toll that equates to the entire population of England. The passage of time hasnt changed the fact that abortion is a serious. lethal violation of fundamental human rights. and that women and children deserve better. much better. and that the demands of justice. generosity. and compassion require that the right to life be guaranteed to everyone. regardless of age. sex. race. condition of dependency. disability. or stage of development. Rather than obscure or dull our consciousness to the unmitigated violence of abortion. the passage of time has only enabled us to see and better understand the innate cruelty of abortion and its horrific legacyvictimswhile making us more determined than ever to protect the weakest and most vulnerable and end the mass deception by the abortion industry. Earlier today. Linda Shrewsbury. an academic and an African American with a degree from Harvard. who had an abortion. told a 40 Years Of Victims press conference: The lies that brought me to that day and its sorrowful aftermath are crystal clear in my mind: falsehoods and deceptions that concealed the truth about abortion. Lies planted in my thinking by clever marketing. media campaigns. and endless repetition led to a tragic. irreversible decision the death of my first child. She goes on to say: Its past time to lance the national wound of abortion with truth. The high culture thought leaders. media. celebritiesthat brought us abortion seem vested beyond extraction. She said she \"dreamed of the volcano of abortion truth that could erupt one day from the grassrootswomen and men and their relatives witnessing to their suppressed emotion. unspoken trauma. and lived pain. With abortion denial ended. we as a society could then reconnect with reality and life.\" Clearly. Mr. Speaker. there are seemingly ominous presentday signs that hinder ending abortion denial and a reconnection with reality and life. Certainly the reelection of the abortion President Barack Obama. public funding for abortion in the ObamaCare health exchanges that come online in 2014. a massive increase of public funding for abortion. the use of coercion to compel religious believers and entrepreneurs to violate their consciences. slick advertising. and the export of abortion worldwide. And it is deeply troubling that despite the fact that Planned Parenthood claims direct responsibility for killing over 6 million unborn babies in their clinics. including a record 333.964 abortions in 2011 alone. Planned Parenthood remains President Obamas favorite organization. Despite these and many obstacles. however. we will never quit. In adversity. our faith and trust in God is tested. but it also deepens and overcomes and forges an indomitable. yet humble. spirit. The prolife movementand Ive been in it for 41 yearsis comprised of some of the noblest. caring. smart. and selfless people I have ever met. They make up an extraordinarily powerful. nonviolent. faithfilled human rights struggle that is growing in public support. intensity. commitment. and hope. The compassionate women and men who staff thousands of pregnancy care centers. many of the women being postabortive themselves who try to save women from that irreversible decision. help women who are experiencing unexpected pregnancies. and they provide tangible assistance and an enormous amount of love and emotional support both before and after the birth of a child. The prolife movement is not only on the side of compassion. justice. and inclusion. We are on the right side of responsible science and of history. Someday future generations will look back on America and wonder how and why such a seemingly enlightened society. so blessed and endowed with education. advanced science. information. wealth. and opportunity. could have failed to protect the innocent and the inconvenient. They will wonder how and why a Nobel Peace Prizewinning President could also simultaneously have been the abortion President. Dr. Alveda King. niece of the late Dr. Martin King. who had two abortions but is now solidly prolife. said in one of her speeches: My Uncle Martin had a dream. He dreamt that we would live out that which is selfevident. that all men are created equal. He called on America to admit our wrongs and turn from them. Today. I call on all of us. regardless of nationality. race. or religion. to admit our wrongs and turn from them. I believe that the denial of the right to life is the greatest injustice we face in the world today. There is no compassion in killing. There is no justice in writing people out of the human race. History. Mr. Speaker. will not look favorably on todays abortion culture. We must. indeed and instead. work tirelessly to replace it with a culture of life.

I did eventually find healing. When I understood and rejected distortions about fetal development. doublespeak about choice. rights. planned and wanted children. I understood the reality and victimhood of my aborted child. I understood the absence of moral bases for choosing to \"disentitle\" an innocent human being of life.

The prolife movement is not only on the side of compassion. justice. and inclusion. we are on the right side of responsible science and of history. Someday future generations will look back on America and wonder how and why such a seemingly enlightened society. so blessed and endowed with education. advanced science. information. wealth and opportunity could have failed to protect the innocent and inconvenient.

I believe that the denial of the right to life is the greatest injustice we face in the world today. There is no compassion in killing. There is no justice in writing people out of the human race.\" History will not look favorably on todays abortion culture. We must instead work tirelessly to replace it with a culture of life. Prolifers celebrate the sanctity of life. Unborn babies are not disposable commodities. We recognize that unborn children. like their older brothers and sisters. have inherent worth. value. and dignity. They are children too. If left alone to grow and mature. they too will become older brothers and sistersand perhaps parents themselves someday. Modern medicine and scientific breakthroughespecially the widespread use of ultrasoundhave shattered the pernicious myth that unborn children are mere blobs of tissue. Its time to recognize birth merely as a celebratory event in the life of a personnot the beginning of life. And weve got to step up our efforts to educate and persuade. Far too many politicians. judges. journalists and others choose denial and deceptive speech over truth. Today doctors diagnose illness and disability before birth. New and exciting breakthrough health care interventions for the unbornincluding microsurgeriesare leading to an ever expanding array of successful treatments and cures of sick or disabled unborn babies in need of help. Unborn children are societys littlest patients who like any one of us might need health care. In stark contrast. abortion methods rip. tear and dismember or chemically poison the fragile bodies of babies and abortion pills cause premature expulsion from the womb and death. There is nothing benign. compassionate. or just about an act that utterly destroys the life of a child and often physically. psychologically. and emotionally harms women. And despite the near total absence of any meaningful reporting by the media. women get hurt and some even die from legal abortions. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report. from 1973 to 2008 at least 403 women tragically died in the United States from legal abortion. And that sad fact is almost certainly a significant undercount because the methodology employed by CDC is passive and voluntary and likely to miss instances of both mortality and morbidity. In the years since CDCs \"most recent report.\" many more women have surely died. Like Tonya Reaves. a 24yearold woman who died last July from a botched second trimester dismemberment abortiona D&Eat a Chicago area Planned Parenthood abortion mill. The abortion industry excels at surface appeal argument and propaganda. Indeed the misleading term \"safe abortion\" purposely misses the point that no abortionlegal or illegalis ever safe for the baby and that all are fraught with negative health consequences for the mother. Today. at least 104 credible studies show significant psychological harm. major depression and/or elevated suicide risk in women who abort. The Times of London reported that. \"[S]enior . . . psychiatrists say that new evidence has uncovered a clear link between abortion and mental illness in women with no previous history of psychological problems.\" They found \"that women who have had abortions have twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression as women who have given birth or who have never been pregnant.\" In 2006. a comprehensive New Zealand study found that 78.6% of the 1518yearolds who had abortions displayed symptoms of major depression as compared to 31% of their peers. The study also found that 27% of the 2125yearold women who had abortions had suicidal ideations compared to 8% of those who did not have an abortion. At this mornings \"40 Years of Victims\" press conference courageous postabortive women. as well as the mother of a minor girl who was transported across state lines to New Jersey to evade Pennsylvanias parental involvement laws spoke eloquently of the anguish of abortion. Irene Beltran said: \"My entire being was overcome by terror. and I felt deep anguish in the core of my soul when I ended the life of my own child for the sake of convenience. At the clinic I was treated like livestock being herded from one step to the next . . . When the abortionist administered the poison in my stomach I was mortified and shocked because I felt my child kick and turn very hastily. Years later I found out she was being burned and could feel the pain. Since I was 6 months pregnant this would be a twoday process. The second day consisted of the abortionist tearing my daughter out of melimb from limb. piece by piece. But I did not go back. After feeling my daughter fight for her life I went straight to my mothers home crying for help. She drove me to the Labor and Delivery Department at a local hospital. I arrived at the hospital grasping on the slim chance they could save my daughter. but there was nothing the doctors could do. The effects of the toxin were irreversible.\" Marcia Carroll said even though \"my daughter chose to have the baby. raise it .... The fathers family arranged a taxi. a train. and subway rides to sneak her across state lines to New Jersey where his family met them in front of the abortion clinic ... They planned. financed. harassed. and ultimately threatened my daughter into having the abortion .... As a result of the legal abortion that was completed unbeknownst to me. my daughter suffered years of depression. intense grief. posttraumatic stress disorder. nightmares. and thoughts and even attempts of suicide.\" Kellie Stauffer spoke of her abortion at the age of 14: \"We all thought abortion would erase the situation I had gotten myself in and we would go on living life the way it was. That was not the case. . . . life sadly was never the same. I hated myself. I tried to numb my pain in any way I could find. drugs. alcohol. food. meaningless relationships. but nothing took away the deep darkness that overwhelmed my soul. . . . She persuaded me to go to a Rachels vineyard retreat and that weekend saved my life. I allowed myself to feel the forgiveness God had been showing me all along. . . . I will never forget what I did to my first child. I am still brought to my knees in tears at times when I remember the pain I caused her. In response to Gods grace and for my daughters spirit I will be silent no more.\" Olivia Gans Turner said: \"I was not told vital information about the child I was carrying. Including the medical fact that by the time I had an abortion at 12 weeks. my baby already had a beating heart and brain waves! . . . I have not forgotten one moment of that day. and never will. That single day changed my life forever.\" Abortion not only has deleterious effects on women but on children born subsequently to women who have had a previous abortion. At least 115 studies show a significant association between abortion and subsequent premature births. Researchers Shah and Zao showed a 36% increased risk for preterm birth after one abortion and a staggering 93% increased risk after two. Similarly. the risk of subsequent children being born with low birth weight increases by 35% after one and 72% after two or more abortions. Another study shows the risk increases 9 times after a woman has had three abortions. What does this mean for her children? Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the industrialized world after congenital anomalies. Preterm infants have a greater risk of suffering from chronic lung disease. sensory deficits. cerebral palsy. cognitive impairments and behavior problems. Low birth weight is similarly associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity. The extremism of the proabortion industry is shocking. Last spring. the House of Representatives took up a bill to ban sexselection abortion. The bill garnered a solid majority246 to 168in the House. President Obama. however. made it absolutely clear that he would veto the sexselection abortion prohibition should it be sent to the White House. While sexselection abortion almost exclusively targets girls for exterminationsimply because they are little girlsthe egregious practice remains legal in most states. In fact. only four statesIllinois. Pennsylvania. Oklahoma and Arizonaand several countries including the United Kingdom proscribe it. And if thats not shocking enough. many remain unaware of the fact that sexselection abortion is part of a deliberate plan of population controla war on women. In other words. abort the girls so they cant grow up someday and have children of their own. In her book \"Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls. and the Consequences of a World Full of Men.\" Mara Hvistendahl traces the sordid history of sexselection abortion as a means of population control. \"By August 1969. when the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Population Council convened another workshop on population control. sex selection had become a pet scheme.\" Hvistendahl writes. \"If a reliable sexdetermination technology could be made available to a mass market.\" there was \"rough consensus\" that sexselection abortion \"would be an effective. uncontroversial and ethical way of reducing the global population.\" Many of you might recall the undercover sting operation by Live Action that exposed several Planned Parenthood affiliates who were eager. ready and willing to facilitate secret abortions for underage sextrafficking victimssome as young or younger than 14. As the prime sponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Actthe landmark law to combat human traffickingI found the willingness of Planned Parenthood personnel to exploit young girls and partner with sex traffickers to be absolutely appalling. Now. Live Action has released stingoperation videospart of a series. \"Gendercide in America\"-that show Planned Parenthood personnel advising undercover female investigators how to procure a sexselection abortion. Caught on tape. one staffer tells an investigator to wait until her baby is 5 months along to get an ultrasound that reveals the sex of the child. Then. if its a girl. kill it. For most of us. \"its a girl\" is cause for enormous joy. happiness and celebration. But far too often. this phrase can be a death sentence. These cruel. antiwoman policies have had horrible consequences everywhere. especially in China (and India as well). Chinas one child per couple policy in effect since 1979 constitutes massive crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg Nazi war crimes tribunal properly construed forced abortion as a crime against humanitynothing in human history compares to the magnitude of Chinas 34year assault on women and children. In China. brothers and sisters are illegal in most instances. The price for failing to conform to the one child per couple policy is unbearably high. A Chinese woman who becomes pregnant without a permit will be put under mindbending pressure to abort. She knows that \"outofplan\" illegal children are denied education. health care. and marriage. and that fines for bearing a child without a birth permit can be 10 times the average annual income of two parents. and those families that cant or wont pay are jailed and their homes smashed in. If the brave woman still refuses to submit. she may be held in a punishment cell. or. if she flees. her relatives may be held and. very often. beaten. Group punishments will be used to socially ostracize her. And her colleagues and neighbors will be denied birth permits. If the woman is by some miracle still able to resist this pressure. she may be physically dragged to the operating table and forced to undergo an abortion. Over the years. I have chaired 43 congressional human rights hearings focused in whole or in part on Chinas one child policy. At one. the principal witness. Wuijan. a Chinese student attending a U.S. university. testified about how her child was forcibly murdered by the government. She said. \"[T]he room was full of moms who had just gone through a forced abortion. Some moms were crying. Some moms were mourning. Some moms were screaming. And one mom was rolling on the floor with unbearable pain.\" Then Wuijan said it was her turn. and through her tears she described what she called her journey in hell.\" Not only has the Obama Administration turned a blind eye to the atrocities being committed under the one child policy. but continues to provide financial supportcontrary to U.S. lawto the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). an organization that supports. plans. implements. defends and whitewashes the Chinese governments brutal program. Twenty nine years agoon May 9. 1984I authored the first amendment ever to a foreign aid bill to deny funding to organizations such as the UNFPA that are complicit with Chinas forced abortion and involuntary sterilization policy. It passed. After all these years. it is astonishing that policy makersincluding and especially the Obama Administrationremain indifferent or worse. supportive. of these massive crimes against women and children. The Obama Administration has long enabled this cruel policy by its silence and financial support to the tune of $50 million a year to the UNFPA. The result of this policy is a nightmarish \"brave new world\" with no precedent in human history. where women are psychologically wounded. girls fall victim to sexselective abortion (in some provinces 140 boys are born for every 100 girls). and most children grow up without brothers or sisters. aunts or uncles or cousins. Women bear the major brunt of the one child policy not only as victimized mothers. Due to the male preference in Chinas society and the limitation of the family size to one child. the policy has directly contributed to what is accurately described as gendercidethe deliberate extermination of a girlborn or unbornsimply because she happens to be a girl. As a result of the Chinese governments barbaric attack on mothers and their children. there are some 100 million missing daughters in China today. Because of the missing girlsChina today has become the human sex trafficking magnate of the world. Women and young girls from outside the country are being sold as commodities throughout Chinaa direct consequence of the one child policy. Several prominent people including Ted Turner have suggested that the United Statesindeed the worldneeds to follow Chinas example and promulgate a one child per couple policy. Mr Speaker. despite the best and slickest market branding money can buy. the stubborn fact remains that Planned Parenthood clinics are among the most dangerous places on Earth for a child. Planned Parenthoods own personnel are now taking a second look and. thanks to ultrasound. are clearly seeing what is being done to millions of children in the womb. One of those abortion providers who took a second look and walked away is Abby Johnson. a former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic director. In her book \"Unplanned.\" Abby Johnson exposes the duplicity and cruelty of what really goes on behind closed doors at a Planned Parenthood clinic. In it she writes how she witnessed and assisted in an abortion of a 13weekold baby by holding the ultrasound probe. and as she pointed out in the book. it was the first ultrasoundguided abortion at that facility. She writes in the book: \"The details startled me. At 13 weeks you could clearly see the profile of the head. both arms. legs. and even tiny fingers and toes. With my eyes glued to the image of this perfectly formed baby. I watched as a new image emerged on the video screen. The cannula. a strawshaped instrument attached to the end of the suction tube. had been inserted into the uterus and was nearing the babys side. It looked like an invader on the screen: out of place. wrong. It just looked wrong.\" She goes on to write: \"My heart sped up. time slowed. I didnt want to look. but I didnt want to stop looking either. At first. the baby didnt seem aware of the cannula. It gently probed the babys side. and for a quick second I felt relief But I couldnt shake an inner disquiet that was quickly mounting to horror as I watched the screen.\" Remember. this is an abortion clinic director saying this. \"The next movement was a sudden jerk of a tiny foot of the baby as he started kicking. as if trying to move away from the probing invader.\" \"As the cannula pressed in. the baby began struggling to turn and twist away. It seemed clear to me that the fetus could feel the cannula. and it did not like the feeling. And then the doctors voice broke through. startling me: Beam me up. Scotty. the abortionist said lightheartedly to the nurse. He was telling her to turn on the suction. in an abortion the suction isnt turned on until the doctor feels he has the cannula in exactly the right place. Abbey Johnson. abortion clinic director. went on to write: \"I had a sudden urge to yell. Stop. to shake the woman and say. Look at whats happening to your baby. Wake up. hurry. Stop them. But even as I was thinking those words. I thought of my own hand and saw my own hand holding the probe. I was one of them performing this act\" of abortion. \"My eyes shot back to the screen. The cannula was already being rotated by the doctor and now I could see the tiny body violently twisting with it. For the briefest moment it looked as if the baby was being wrung like a dishcloth. twirled and squeezed. And then the little body crumpled and began disappearing into the cannula before my eyes. The last thing I saw was the tiny perfectly formed backbone sucked into the tube. And then everything was gone. The image of that tiny dead baby mangled and sucked away kept replaying in my mind. What was in this womans womb just a moment ago was alive. It wasnt tissue. It wasnt cells. This was a human baby. fighting for life. A battle was lost in the blink of an eye. \"What I have told people for years\"-8 years as a clinic director at a Planned Parenthood clinic- \"what I have told people for years.\" Abby Johnson continues. \"what I believed and taught and defended is a lie.\" Abby Johnson is now an amazing prolife leader. Mr. Speaker. as we stand here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this afternoon marking 40 years since seven members of the U.S. Supreme Court imposed abortion on demand for all nine months on the United States of America. the legacy of Roe v Wadedead babies and injured women. shattered familiesbegs reappraisal. And courageous women like Abby Johnson are showing the way. Mr. Speaker. we have a duty to protect. The struggle to reestablish durable protections for the most discriminated minority in America todayunborn babies- is worth any personal sacrifice. inconvenience or pain. We cannot allow the violence against women and their children to continue. I would like now to yield to my good friend and colleague. MARSHA BLACKBURN.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for the excellent work that he continues to do. year in and year out. on this issue. I appreciate his leadership. We do stand today and mark the 40th anniversary of the tragic Roe v. Wade decision. and it really said that not all life is created equal. Since the Supreme Court gave our governments seal of approval. if you will. for ondemand abortion. there have been over 55 million lives lost. Mr. Speaker. Im not certain that we think about the gravity or the enormity of the issue until we look at it in that collective sense. 55 million lives that have been lost. As a woman. I personally believe that America is better than choosing abortion. and I agree. and I believe that women deserve better. The gentleman from New Jersey referenced the press conference that victims held today. and I was so touched by a statement from one of those that participated in this press conference. Her name is Irene Beltran. Ms. Beltran tells the story of what she endured when she was living in southern California and when she chose the path of abortion. and it is a very tender and heartwrenching story. I want to quote from one paragraph in her story and this statement that she gave. And Im quoting Ms. Beltran now: Ive griefstricken countless people with the choice that Ive made. Ive robbed my seven children of a sister that they could have played with. fed. and helped nurture. Ive robbed three sets of grandparents of a granddaughter. Ive robbed future generations from ever existing. Ive suffered from depression. anxiety. and eating disorder. just to name a few. I felt damaged. humiliated and hopeless. Women deserve better than abortion. I stand before you today because my daughter forgives me. my family forgives me. the Lord forgives me. and I forgive myself. I dedicated the rest of my existence to fight this lifeanddeath war. This is why I am silent no more. That is the statement from Ms. Beltran as told at the press conference today. And we all know in our hearts what she says is just so true. that life is a natural right. Its a gift from God. whose love extends beyond our comprehension. and He calls on us to protect the smallest and the weakest among us. Were moving forward with prolife legislation in the States. and the gentleman from New Jersey referenced the movement that he has worked in for 40 years. We have 24 State legislatures that passed a record 92 measures that restricted abortion in 2011. Nine States have recently banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. On the national level. were working to end taxpayer funding for abortion. I have legislation that addresses that Title X funding. And we are continuing to work to make certain that we focus on helping the families that have felt the impact of abortion in their life. Were focusing on celebrating life and committing to making certain that we stand and work toward a prolife America.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. it is with heavy heart that I stand here today on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. a decision that has done so much harm to the moral landscape of our Nation. Since that dreadful day 40 years ago. there have been more than 55 million abortions in this country. That is roughly onefifth of the United States population whom we will never know. We will never derive the contributions to society that these nameless angels could have brought to the world. And even worse is the emotional pain that millions of women have endured in the days. months. and years after their abortion. Its my honor to put in the RECORD today the story of Joyce Zounis. who joins us today. Its compelling testimony. and its an honor to put her testimony forward. Since I was sworn into Congress nearly 3 weeks ago. I have had the opportunity to sign on to pieces of prolife legislation. I believe that it is important that we prevent any taxpayer dollars from going to abortions or organizations that perform abortions. I believe in the sanctity of life. that life is truly a gift. from conception to natural death. and I am dedicated to protecting the rights of the unborn. I support the efforts to reduce the number of abortions in this country. and will work not only to make abortion illegal. but to make abortion unthinkable. You see. as a mother of three beautiful children. the sanctity of life is very cherished and very personal to me. In fact. it was exactly 23 years ago that I came to Washington. D.C.. on a bus from St. Louis. Missouri. to participate in the March for Life. I know it was exactly 23 years ago because I was 6 weeks pregnant at the time with my second son. Stephen. Taking a 14hour bus ride while experiencing morning sickness is generally not advisable. but I knew actively participating in the prolife movement at a time when I was carrying my unborn child was so very important. As a mother. I want to raise my children in a world that values life at all stages. I do not want to raise them in a world that exhibits a flagrant disregard for human life. And at that moment 23 years ago. I knew that it was not enough to simply say that I was prolife. I had to. indeed. walk the walk. On the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in this country. I am heartbroken for the pain this decision has caused over the last 40 years. but I am hopeful. hopeful and inspired by the many young people I have seen today who will be marching side by side with me for life this Friday. I encourage my colleagues to join me and show support for human life at all stages.",

    "speech": "I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership in speaking out on this very important issue. Our Declaration of Independence. our Nations birth certificate. states that all are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. and among those are the right to life. but now. for 40 years. over 55 million Americans have been denied that basic right to life guaranteed by our Declaration of Independence. The Supreme Court got it wrong with Roe. just as they got it wrong with Dred Scott. Now. I accept the fact that under our system of law Roe is the law of the land today. but I. along with many millions of people around America. pray that one day that decision will be overturned. While in this body weve had much spirited debate over the right to life. theres one area where we have found bipartisan agreement. and that is that taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize a practice that so many of us find abhorrent. We must protect taxpayers from funding abortion. Thats why. earlier today. I introduced legislation that would do just that. Under ObamaCare. the Federal Government is required to sponsor at least two multistate insurance plans. The bill that was introduced earlier today would simply prevent those plans from paying for abortions. thus making sure that taxpayers around the Nation are not required to subsidize the taking of life. Now this isnt new policy. in fact. its simply an extension of longstanding Federal policy. and thats why I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Recently. President Obama said: When it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us. we must act now. Lets do the right thing. This bill is an effort to do the right thing. to protect taxpayers from funding the destruction of the most vulnerable among us: the unborn child. In closing. lets remember the words of the prophet of old: This day I call Heaven and Earth as witnesses against you. that I have set before you life and death. blessings and curses. Now choose life. so that you and your children may live. On this 40th anniversary of Roe. let us rededicate ourselves to choose life.",

    "speech": "Today. I stand here on the 40th anniversary of one of the worst decisions of our United States Supreme Court. It was deeply flawed. Too many Justices spoke of emanations of penumbras but missed the core principle contained in the Constitution: this notion that every human being is endowed with this special dignity that we call life. The cost of that decision has been enormous: 55 million souls were not brought into this world. We can feel it in families torn asunder and in lives that didnt get to become the next great leaders in our Nation. These lives were lost to each of us. Theyre lost to the families. Theyre lost to our community. Theyre lost to their Maker. But I want to talk today about hope. Ever since this decision in 1973. theres been a march. And I was in the Army. When you march. you march to victory. Weve had this special march. Well have this march again this week. Well have it in Kansas. Kansas has a very special relationship to this march. In 1991. in Wichita. Kansas. the city which I represent. we held the Summer of Mercy. where people came together in peace to talk about these lives that should have been protected but had not been. And this week. the airlines permitting. Ill be back to watch young people from all across south central Kansas board buses bound for Washington. D.C. Ill see them off from churches and cathedrals and synagogues. folks coming to Washington. D.C.. to once again march on this town to demand that we do everything we can in our power here in Washington. D.C.. to protect every human life. Im very proud of the rich history and the contribution that the citizens of the Fourth District of Kansas have made to this movement. It is certainly important to me as a matter of faith. But as a matter of science. we have this one right as well. We must protect every unborn life. Im dedicated to doing so. I look forward to being with that next generation. these young people coming to Washington. D.C.. so this fight can continue.",

    "speech": "Thank you. I applaud my colleague from New Jersey. and I thank him for his leadership on this very important issue. Today marks the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. two rulings which impose legalized abortion in this country. I was in junior high at the time this ruling came down. and I really didnt understand the implications. It was only later when I took a child development class and they showed pictures of the different stages of the babys development that I came to realize this wasnt just talk about a blot of tissue. This procedure ended a beating heart and denied life into this world. I became prolife then and continue to be prolife now. This Friday. hundreds of thousands of Americans will come to Washington to recognize this anniversary. And its not an anniversary observed with celebration. but one marked by somber reflection. We mourn the loss of 55 million aborted boys and girls. innocent children who were never given the right to live. attend school. go to birthday parties. participate on little league teams. or become siblings and peers. We mourn for families who do not know their lost children but wish they did. We mourn the devastating impact abortion has on our culture and our consciences. This anniversary also represents an occasion to renew our commitment to defending the most fundamental human right: the right to life. We know that more Americans now describe themselves as prolife50 percentthan those that consider themselves prochoiceAl percentand we know that younger Americans have begun to understand that the protection of their rights cannot be built upon the destruction of an innocent human beings right to life. Still. we have work to do. The Federal Government continues to subsidize family planning clinics that provide abortions. In 2011. the Nations largest provider. Planned Parenthood. performed a record number of abortions. over 330.000 abortions. Most of us in Congress represent approximately 750.000 people. If you think about it. thats almost half of a congressional district that was wiped out in 2011 at the hands of Planned Parenthood clinics alone. Planned Parenthood ended the beating hearts of these innocent victims while deluding vulnerable women that their choice wouldnt have any harmful consequences. and they did so with taxpayer funding. over $500 million in 2011. This must stop. Abortion does have consequences. It destroys babies. It harms women physically and emotionally. and it harms men. too. This past weekend. I had the opportunity to hear a man speak. who shared the heartbreak and the shame that he has suffered for over 20 years at the loss of four children that he was responsible for their abortions. It impacted his marriage. his mental and physical health. his parenting. and how he was able to do his job. Abortion has consequences. It deadens our consciences and it perpetrates the lie that killing the unborn is morally acceptable. This week. I stand with hundreds of thousands here in Washington who know better. who understand the truth. that abortion harms us and is killing off future generations. We observe the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade with the renewed hope that more Americans will see this truth and honor life.",

It is reassuring. as was mentioned here. that every year millions of Americans descend on Washington and our State capitals. including Kansas. to stand as surrogate voices for the millions of lives taken by abortion. Its a shame that this event has to happen. But this year. descending on Washington is more than just about abortion. its about religious liberty. Those in favor of abortion like to cast this debate about rights and choices rather than rights or wrongs. So if were to use their terms. where is the outrage at the fact that Americans increasingly have no choice. particularly under the Presidents health care plan. when it comes to paying for abortion. paying for abortion drugs. and numerous other things they find morally reprehensible? And wheres the outrage that religious liberty. the first part of the First Amendment. can come at the expense of this radical agenda? We in this Congress stand as the peoples direct representatives in Washington and must stand as a check to the most proabortion President in our history. A Presidents second term is usually about legacy building. but for the sake of the unborn and for the sake of our religious liberty.

Some of those gathered will be Republicans. others Democrats. Others will belong to no political party at all. They will belong to every faith and race and will belong to every socioeconomic demographic. Those gathered this Friday and those of us here on the floor of the House this afternoon are joined because we believe that life must be protectedand must be protected especially for those who have no ability to protect it themselves. Since Roe v. Wade in 1973 medical science has made tremendous gains. Today. expecting parents can watch 3D images of their young child playing in the womb. Today. doctors can perform lifesaving surgeries on children while they are still in utero. Today. thanks to medical science. we know that within 6 weeks after conception these little lives have a heartbeat and brain waves. Here in the peoples House we are taking steps to defend life. as are numerous State legislatures throughout the country. But the real heroes are those men and women who volunteer at pregnancy centers helping women. and those gathered for the March for Life who are committed to this mission. They gather this year not only in the name of protecting life but also to celebrate the life of the founder of the March. Nellie Gray. Well all miss her red coat up there on that stage. leading the March up the hill. but I know Nellie would be as pleased as I am to see the progress being made for this most important causeand she would encourage us never to rest until the job is done.",

It is a real special thing in this Chamber that we have prolife patriots who represent medicine. the profession of law. mothers. fathers. people who understand life from the most intimate fashion. I happen to be a pastor. It was 40 years ago that I had just accepted the call to my first church out of divinity school. I was busy in that ministry and getting started and didnt take too much notice of Roe V. Wade. But it was in 1978 when that issue hit me full square in the face. when two wonderful young people in my church came to my office and said. Pastor. we have a problem. and went on to talk about an unplanned pregnancy that they had. As we discussed. they committed to the fact that they intended to keep the child as a gift of God. But ultimately the story didnt go that way because their parentswho were fine. upstanding church members yet determined that these children wouldnt have that as a detriment to their lifeencouraged them to. as they called it. terminate the pregnancy. It broke my heart. and I watch the pain in these two young people go on even to this very day 40 years later. I committed to my God that I would stand for life strongly and have the privilege of doing that in the pastorate. in counseling sessions. on boards of adoption agencies. and crisis pregnancy centers as well. It was just a few years ago6 years to be exactwhen I held in my hands little John Timothy Walberg. my first grandson. along with his twin brother. Mica Todd Walberg. two little boys born at 24 weeks. 1.12 lbs. 12 inches long. fighting for life. They had been born just down the corridor from where abortions were being done on those same age children. I saw these two boys fight for life. Someday I will see John Timothy again in heaven. but I thank God that little Mica Todd is a live 6yearold. growing strong. healthy. a gift of God. The Framers of our Declaration of Independence went to their knees many times. They understood the value of politics. but they also understood the value of truth. truth that came not from man. but truth that came from God. Truths such as these were set in Psalm 127:3: Behold. children are a gift of the Lord. The fruit of the womb is a reward. Jeremiah 1:5: Before I formed you in the womb. I knew you. Before you were born I set you apart. Psalm 139. where it says: For You formed my inward parts. You wove me in my mothers womb. I will give thanks to You. for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are Your works. And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You. When I was made in secret. And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Your eyes have seen my unformed substance. And in Your book were all written the days that were ordained for me. When as yet there was not one of them. I end by going back to what ultimately came from understanding of truth by our Framers and Founders. when they said: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. among them the right to life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness.",

The most fragile in any circumstance are those with no voice at all. the unborn. And on this day. 40 years after a Supreme Court decision. 50 million voices with no representation. no opportunity to speak. how will this Nation be judged? I think the answer is clear. Our Supreme Court at that time expressed conflict on when life began. but todays science leaves no conflict. DNA is established on day one. The heartbeat is visible soon thereafter. What Nation would put mothers at odds with their unborn children and declare it to be a matter of choice? This is no matter of choice. its a constitutional question of protection of life. Its a value thatour Founding Fathers would blanch at our definition today. They would have no concept that we would have these discussions. But the hope lies ahead of us because the younger generations are seeing the technological replays of the unborn and know that its more than a mass of tissue.

    "speech": "I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for taking a pause every year to let us review what happened 40 years ago and whats happened since. Because some 40 years ago. obviously the Supreme Court decided that it was no longer the States prerogative to decide what laws could regulate abortion. We know some of the consequences of that: We know we have third trimester abortions. we have abortions for sex selection. we have abortions without the consent or even the notification of parents when minors are involved. Thats the path weve gone down. But as the majority says. much has changed in 40 years and deserves reevaluation. Im an obstetric anesthesiologist. Ive spent 25 years in the labor and delivery suite always wondering about the hypocrisy of being in a labor and delivery suite doing everything we could to save a 24week baby. while across the corridor. 24week babies were dismembered under what Roe v. Wade allowed under the law of the land. The majority leader is right: science has changed tremendously. Why. 40 years ago. we didnt have the Human Genome Project. We didnt realize the richness and diversity of the human genome. which only strengthened the notion that each and every human being is absolutely unique from the moment of conception. And thats in every embryology textbook you can look into. Every human being is unique from the moment of conception. And now. as the majority leader said. we have 3D and 4D ultrasound. We can see these human beings that are not blobs of tissue. they are human beings. So maybe we need to revisit what Roe v. Wade said. Let me tell you a story that really makes you think about revisiting this because. as you know. we spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fund organizations whose real sole purpose is to end life through abortion and very little to help the pregnancy centers that the majority leader spoke of. But in a pregnancy center north about 7 years agoits a pregnancy center in Baltimorea woman speaking Spanish called one afternoon. She was on political asylum in the United States from El Salvador. She was single. had two children already. and was pregnant with a third. She called the pregnancy center. actually. to get a referral for an abortion. That day. by coincidence. maybe the grace of God. a counselor was there who spoke Spanish and spoke to that woman. That woman really wanted to keep her child. but as many women facing abortion. she was in a period of crisis. She needed help. not the help that a Planned Parenthood would offer. but the help that this pregnancy center offered. by helping her through her pregnancy. giving her the support she needed. the money she needed. and the things she needed to have that child. Now. I know that story because that Spanishspeaking counselor was my wife. Sevenyearold Jennifer comes over to our house now. I look into her eyes. and I wonder if anyone is ever going to tell her the real story of what almost happened and how is someone going to look in her eyes and tell Jennifer that she was better off because of Roe v. Wade.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. First. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank CHRIS SMITH for not just this year. but for over 30 years of advocating for life and making that one of his missions in life. CHRIS. thank you for what you have done not only for this Congress. but for our country. to make awareness. I really appreciate it. I cant thank you enough for what you have personally done and sacrificed. Exactly 40 years ago next month. I was a young doctor in training in Memphis. Tennessee. and I was drafted in the U.S. military and left the country to go to Southeast Asia for a tour of duty there. And something happened when I was gone. Roe v. Wade passed. It really passed. and I wasnt even aware of it because I was out of the country. I came back to my training. which had been interrupted by my military service. and realized something very fundamentally different had happened to America. As an obstetrician. I personally have delivered around 5.000 babies. In the 31 years I was in medical practice in Johnson City. Tennessee. a small town in northeast Tennessee. our group had delivered over 25.000 babies25.000 children. I see these children now as doctors. lawyers. teachers. Sunday school teachers. soccer coaches. housewives. and farmers. you name it. bettering our community. I cannot imagine my community without these young people there. They are the future of this great Nation. As Dr. HARRIS mentioned. I saw when ultrasound went from when it was just a blob that you saw to being able to visualize the heartbeat 28 days or less postconception. Its unbelievable to be able to see that. And to see this child develop is something that I cant explain to you how fulfilling that is to be able to see that happen. And to have a \"choice\" snuff that out is a law that we have to get right in this country. Thank goodness minds are changing. I look around this great room here. this great Chamber. and wonder what it would be like if different choices were made. the great people that Ive met here in Congress that might not be here had a different choice been made. In this Chamber. we have a clear responsibility and duty for those that do not have a voice. The fourth President of our country. and the architect of the Constitution. James Madison. warned that the rights of the minority must be protected. The unborn children of America represent the greatest silent minority that there is. They are the most innocent among us and deserve the protection we afford all people in this great country. Life is a precious miracle from God that begins at conception. As a physician. I can personally attest after visualizing literally thousands of ultrasounds. We have to make our laws consistent with science of today. Its been mentioned before that one of our governments most important duties is to protect the most vulnerable among us. and I pledge to continue to remember and strive toward this as long as I breathe. Im heartened that so many others today have chosen to do the same thing. And may God very much bless the 4 million women last year in this country who chose life. not a choice to terminate life.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman. my good friend from New Jersey. for all the great work that youve done in this area and many others. protecting children. and were all grateful to you for doing that. Mr. Speaker. 40 years ago. when the Supreme Courts Roe v. Wade decision was handed down. I was just a college student taking premed courses with a desire to pursue my goal of being a doctor one day. That was when Roe v. Wade was passed. and hardly anybody even noticed what a landmark decision that was that has led now to the death of over 55 million unborn innocents in this country. Today. after 36 years as a family physician and having delivered hundreds of babies. I know now more than ever that life begins at conception. Over the decades. medical technology has only served to confirm what we know. Ultrasound has given us a powerful window into the womb that shows us a small. intricately developing human being. We know now through DNA that every little baby. every little embryo. is a unique blueprint in history. Protecting these preborn children must be our first priority. Thats what I strive to do as a family physician in Louisiana. looking after expectant mothers and their soontobeborn babies. As a Congressman. my aim has been unchanged. Abortion is an attack on the very creed that I follow as a physician: first. do no harm. As a Member of Congress. Ive stood firm against abortion. against laws that have infringed on the conscience protections of medical providers who want nothing to do with abortion. and I have consistently opposed the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion services. Many think that at the termination of a pregnancy that the problem goes away. but nothing could be further from the truth. We know through studies that young women who have abortions are more likely to have depression. more likely to commit suicide. and more likely to have future miscarriages and problems with their pregnancy. Mr. Speaker. the problems do not end with the termination of an innocent life. The abortion epidemic has cost 55 million children their lives. This is a national tragedy. and it must stop. and on this heartbreaking anniversary today. 40 years after Roe v. Wade. Im more committed than ever to defending the lives of the unborn.",

    "speech": "To my good friend. Mr. SMITH. thank you. Thank you for managing this. The last handful of Congressmen that have come up to the mic have been medical doctors. I get to stand here behind the microphone and share a slightly different story. This is that one very special time of year I get to stand here and say \"thank you\" to a woman named Mary Lynn Sheridan. at the time who was named Mary Lynn Gephart. She was a 17yearold who found out she was pregnant. and she was in the car on the way. at that time in southern California. on her way to. apparently. Tijuana. And she broke down crying and kept crying more and kept hyperventilating. The two girlfriends she was with were so terrified she was getting sick in the car. they turned around and took her back home. Heaven forbid. she told her mother she was pregnant. I was born a few months later at Holy Family Unwed Mothers Home in downtown L.A. The amazing thing ispicture this: Youre in your thirties. You come into work one day. You turn on your computer. and theres an email saying. Hi. DAVID. you have no idea who I am. but your sister gave me information. Heres your birth mother. What do you do? How about if shes never told her family. told her two daughters that Im out there? And I send a really carefully worded note after having a family meeting. and I had one of the most amazing experiences you could imagine. Imagine a couple of weeks later. you get a phone call. and its this little voice saying. Ive prayed for you every single day of your life. Every March 3. I go to mass and I light candles for you. Are you okay? Are you happy? Have you had a good life? All I could tell her through all the tears was. Look. Im incredibly lucky. I was adopted by an amazing family. Ive gotten to live a great life. Im here in Congress. which. actually. in many ways. may have disappointed her. But the reason I stand here and tell the story is Ive had this amazing relationship. having now met my birth father. having spent holidays with my family that has raised me and my birth family. I have a picture in my office with all these kids and all these people where all of our familieseven my little sister. who has met her birth family. because my siblings are all adopted. and we get everyone together and go to Disneyland. Ive noticed there is an amazing change out there where the little kids come up to you and say. Okay. my mom is your sister. but your sister is not my moms sister. The little kids get it. I think with this I get to come here behind the microphone and say. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the chance to be alive. Thank you for giving me the chance to engage in this battle that we have here in Congress of trying to do good things for our country. Thank you. Mary Lynn Sheridan. My mother would send my birth mother pictures of me as a baby. So when I would go to Walnut. California. and go see my birth mother. down the hallway would be all these pictures of me as a little kid. My birth mother has developed a very aggressive type of Alzheimers. and something amazing has happened in her mind. She can describe all those photos. In her mind now. I grew up with my two younger sisters there in Walnut. California. In her mind. Ive been with her this whole time. And that heartbreak she used to describe to me for all those years wondering what had happened to me is gone. Thank you. God. and thank you to Mary Lynn for giving me a chance to be here today.

Before liberty. equality. free speech. freedom of conscience. the pursuit of happiness. and justice for all. there has to be life. And yet. for millions of aborted infants. many paincapable and many discriminated because of gender or disability. life is exactly what theyve been denied. often at taxpayer expense. And an affront to life for some is an affront to life for every one of us. One day we hope it will be different. We hope life will cease to be valid on the sliding scale. We hope the error of elective abortions ushered in by an unelected court will be closed and collectively deemed one of the darkest chapters in American history. But until that day. it remains a solemn duty to stand up for life. Regardless of the length of this journey. we will continue to speak for those who cannot. and we will continue to pray to the one who can change the hearts of those in desperation and those in power who equally hold the lives of the innocent in their hands.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. and I start again from the beginning. Mr. Speaker. This is the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. I never imagined that we would be here 40 years afterwards. 55 million abortions afterwards. still seeking respect for innocent. unborn human life and the right of personhood that many over on the other side of the aisle also claim one should have once theyre born. But they give no right. no dignity to babies who are preborn. I would like to provide some of the narrative here of a story written by Joyce Zounis. Joyces narrative is about her life. Each one of these are just heartwrenching. and this is among those heartwrenching stories shared now by millions around the country. Joyces story starts out with this in bold. \"We will not speak of this again.\" Its her mother telling her as a 15yearold girl on the way to the abortion clinic that there would be no discussion outside of what happened that day. Thats at age 15. It says that \"the room was filled with many girls.\" of which she knew werent able to keep it as a secret. They said it wont hurt. it did. They said it would be over real quick. it has lasted 35 years. And 11 years laterheres the narrative. Mr. Speaker: Eleven years. three clinics. two States. seven abortions. not once was I told of the trau matic suffering that would follow. which it did. And on the seventh abortion. Joyce Zounis writes: Several hours later. the vacuumlike noise broke a decadeold trance \"What have I done?\" And as her story continues. she writes about emotional trauma. \"That child lost through choice would devour my dignity\"-they didnt tell her that. She said. \"I justified my twisted truth.\" That goes on every day here in America. 4.000 times a day in America. Everyone talks about their right to choose. but no one talks about the result of the choice. She writes. \"I will never forget hearing my firstborns heartbeat.\" a thing of joy for most people. Instead of joy. I was in shock. terrified that the nurses could see right through me and what I had done to my other children. I was never told you would need to grieve and cry for your unborn. that your life would be forever altered by the horrors of your \"chosen\" loss. Put this in this perspective: 40 years of Roe v. Wade. How did we get here. Mr. Speaker? Its important for us to understand how the creeping decisions of a Supreme Court creep in on the innocent unborn lives of 55 million babies who were victims of abortion. of millions of mothers and of fathers who have suffered the trauma and the heartbreak of finding out afterwards that they carried the responsibility and the burden on their consciences that altered them for a lifetime. It changed their relationships with their other children and with their family members. and it changed their relationships with brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that they interrelate with in their daily lives. In 1965. we had a Supreme Court decision called Griswold v. Connecticut. and that was the camels nose under the tent. At that time. Connecticut had passed State legislation that had prohibited the sale of contraceptives. It was supported by the Catholic Church. of which I am a member. and it was litigated to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found a right to privacy. which was manufactured out of thin air. That right to privacy prohibited banning the sale of contraceptives to married couples. That \"right to privacy\" phrase became the foundation. from 1965 until 1973. for Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. Those two cases came together and essentially said that you have a right to an abortion at any time. for any reasonabortion on demand. That was the conclusion of the two cases. Doe v. Bolton. in 73. We went on. We got some opportunities to try to make some changes here in Congress. and the beginning of it was the ban on partial birth abortion. which was litigated to the Supreme Court and was turned down. I arrived here on the Judiciary Committee. and we rewrote that language. under the leadership of STEVE CHABOT of Ohio. so that it would comply with the decision of the Court. It was litigated across the countryside. and I went into the courtroom of Judge Kopf in Lincoln. Nebraska. as he had concluded that the findings of Congress were inferior to the preparation work of the attorneys in that court. Someone had to speak up. I did so in Lincoln that day. and let him know that our congressional findings were deeply deliberated and well founded. I did so through the press. and I found out that he reads the papers. What happened finally was we were able to have a case sustained to the Supreme Court that at least banned the gruesome process of partial birth abortion. In the process of these debates that weve had. Mr. Speaker. it has been useful. Weve marched here. This will be the 40th year that hundreds of thousands and. by now. millions of peopleespecially young peoplehave come to Washington. D.C.. and have gone out to the basilica for the prolife vigil massor Ive seen as many as 15.000 people out at the basilicaall praying together. all singing together. all joining together in an effort to protect and defend innocent unborn human life. and then have come the next day here to the Mall in Washington and marched together from the Mall all the way around to the Supreme Court and then dispersed across the Capitol Grounds to the various receptions and offices so that they could bring their influence. This has changed the conscience of America. This has informed millions of now mothers who might have given up their babies to abortion instead. Im encouraged by the path that weve taken. I have to believe that. over the years. the millions of voices raising together in hymns and prayer and in the marching have had its effect and is having its effect. There will be a day when we see the end of Roe v. Wade. There will be a day when we respect and revere every human life from that instant. or moment. of conception until natural death. Thats what I work for. Thats what I pray for. Thats what many Members of the ProLife Caucus here in Congress have and many people across the countryside have. Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to live in a country that has so many millions of people who have great respect for innocent unborn human life. and I will be forever grateful if I live to see the day that Roe v. Wade is finally set aside and that life is protected in law.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this Friday. hundreds of thousands of people will gather in Washington for a peaceful march. exercising the most American of valuesthe right to assemble and the right to freedom of speech. Among the people who will come are multitudes of young persons from all over Americayoung people who are the inheritors of the great civil rights traditions of this land. These young people are prolife. Mr. Speaker. theyre really saying something pretty simple. They are saying that the time for honesty has come. that the time for a new national conversation has come. that the time for the violence to end has come. and that the time since the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion on demand some 40 years ago has inflicted a deep wound on ourselves and the very soul of this country. Over the past few decades. we have witnessed an evolving desensitization to abortion. It has become too easy to think of abortion as a procedure. as something clinical. somehow normal. removed. Disguised in the mantle and vocabulary of health. minds and hearts can easily become numb to what abortion really is. to what it really does and to who really dies. But the youth among us. they know better. They know that women deserve better. Abortion is so often the result of abandonment. A woman. in not knowing where to turn. falls into the grasps of the abortion industry. which says. We can quietly make this go away. There are no consequences here. just pay over there. But the consequences are so very real. Abortion is an act of violence. The woman so often carries the wound from this act of violence imposed upon her. Her unborn child dies. The abortion industry profits from this pain. and the other responsible partythe manescapes his responsibilities. This is why the early feminist movement saw abortion as another form of male domination over women. Mr. Speaker. young people. they know this. They sense this. They know instinctively that the Supreme Courts decision was a dinosaur decision. not based on science. They know that the consequences of abortion are very real. and theyre simply saying theres a better way. There has to be a better way. We should be loving enough and caring enough. We certainly are big enough. We certainly have resources enough to rally as a community and help a person no matter how difficult her circumstances. They are saying no woman should be left alone or in isolation. We are a community committed to the beautiful gift of life. Mr. Speaker. thats the message from these young people who will gather by the tens of thousands this Friday in Washington. and Im proud to stand with them. With that. I yield to my good friend.

    "speech": "I thank my good friend for yielding. and I applaud his tremendous leadership over the years in defense of the culture of life. for being consistent on all human rights issuesfrom child soldiers and combating that abuse of children to the abuse of unborn children by way of abortion. So I thank him for that. I would just make a few points. because we are coming to a close. Mr. Speaker. Today. doctors diagnose illness and disability before birth. New and exciting breakthrough health care interventions for the unborn. including microsurgeries. are leading to an everexpanding array of successful treatments and cures of sick or disabled unborn babies. A few other Members have made this point very clearly. as do I. which is that unborn children are societys littlest patients. and they might need health care just like any one of us. In stark contrast. abortion methods rip. tear. dismember or chemically poison the fragile bodies of unborn babies to death. and abortion pills cause premature expulsion from the womb and death. There is nothing benign. compassionate. or just about an act that utterly destroys the life of a child and often physically. psychologically. and emotionally harms women. And despite the near total absence of any meaningful reporting by the news media. women get hurt and even die from legal abortions. According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control report. from 1973 to 2008. at least 403 women tragically died in the United States from legal abortion. And that sad fact is almost certainly a significant undercount because the methodology employed by CDC is passive and voluntary and likely to miss instances of both mortality and morbidity. In the years since CDCs \"most recent report.\" many more women have surely died. like Tonya Reaves. a 24yearold woman who died last July from a botched second trimester dismemberment abortion. a D&E. at a Chicago area Planned Parenthood abortion mill. The abortion industry. Mr. Speaker. excels at surface appeal argument and at propaganda. Indeed. the misleading term \"safe abortion\" purposefully misses the point that no abortion. legal or illegal. is ever safe for the baby. and all are fraught with negative health consequences for the mother. Today. at least 104 credible studies show significant psychological harm. major depression. and/or elevated suicide risk to women who abort. The Times of London reported that: Senior psychiatrists say that new evidence has uncovered a clear link between abortion and mental illness in women who have had no previous history of psychological problems. Theyve found that women whove had abortions have twice the level of psychological problems. three times the level of depression as women who have given birth or who have never been pregnant. One comprehensive study out of New Zealand in 2006 found that 78.6 percent of the 15- to 18yearolds who had had abortions displayed symptoms of major depression as compared to 31 percent of their peers. Mr. Speaker. there are at least 115 studies that show significant association between abortion and subsequent premature births. You never read about this in the news media. Researchers Shah and Zao show a 36 percent increase for preterm birth after one abortion and a staggering 93 percent increased risk after two. What does this mean for children? Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the industrialized world after congenital anomalies. Preterm infants have a greater risk of suffering chronic lung disease. sensory deficits. cerebral palsy. cognitive impairments. and behavioral problems. Low birth weight is similarly associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity. These are consequences that are visited upon a woman later on. Shes never told this at the abortion clinic that subsequent children that she will have later in her life could suffer prematurity and low birth weight. And. finally. the extremism of the proabortion industry is shocking. Last spring. the House of Representatives took up TRENT FRANKS bill to ban sexselection abortion. The bill garnered a solid majority. 246168 in the House. President Obama. however. made it absolutely clear that he would veto the sexselection abortion prohibition should it be sent to the White House. While sex selection targets almost exclusively girls for extermination. simply because theyre girls. the egregious practice remains legal in most of our States. In fact. only four StatesIllinois. Pennsylvania. Oklahoma. and Arizonaand several countries. including the United Kingdom. prohibit sexselection abortion. And yet we have not been able to get that legislation enacted into law. and its opposed by President Obama. Mr. Speaker. we need to stand up for life. Again. I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Nebraska for having this second Special Order on defending life. And like JEFF. I do look forward to the March for Life on January 25 where we will all rally in defense of the defenseless.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding and for raising that important issue. The Peoples Republic of China doesnt have a prolife movement per se. The government is a dictatorship. Regrettably. going back to 1979. they enacted with great push and encouragement from the United States and from the West. Europe especially. a onechildpercouple policy where brothers and sisters are illegal. where women are systematically. forcibly aborted. and forced sterilization is commonplace to achieve quotas. Not only does a woman have to get a birth authorization from the Government of China to have a baby. if she has an outofplan birth. she is aborted forcibly. Over the years. as chairman of the China Commission and as chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Ive chaired 43 congressional hearings on human rights in China. and many of those were focused on. as you pointed out. women who had to be behind screens to tell their story about the gross indignity. the exploitation. the crimes against humanity that had been committed against them. In China today. there are approximately 100 million. maybe more. missing daughters. the direct consequence of sexselection abortion and what is often referred to as gendercide. the deliberate killing of a little girl simply because she is a girl. In her book \"Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls and the Consequences of a World Full of Men.\" Mara Hvistendahl traces the sordid history of sexselection abortion as a means of population control. And almost no one knows about this. Youll never read about this in the local papers. You dont hear about it on the major news broadcasts. She writes: By August 1969. when the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Population Council convened another workshop on population control. sex selection had become a pet scheme. Hvistendahl writes: If a reliable sexdetermination technology could be made available to a mass market. there was a rough consensus that sexselection abortion would be an effective. uncontroversial. and ethical way of reducing the global population. What that means is that you kill the girl child in the womb. you end one life. and that girl who will never grow up to be a woman because she has been exterminated because she happened to be a girl. will never be a mother. So it is a means of population control. It is absolutely an egregious violation of human rights. and yet our own President refuses to support a ban on sexselection abortion. He talked about we the people and inclusion yesterday. Wheres the inclusion of all unborn babies. but those who are particularly targeted for elimination. the girl child? And I would also add. finally. Live Action. an undercover sting operation that they had doneand its on the Web. you can watch it. you can watch the raw footage. liveaction.orgin their series. \"Gendercide in America.\" they showed Planned Parenthood personnel in this country advising undercover female investigators how to procure sexselection abortions. I watched that and was sickened by the admonishment. the socalled counseling that was all caught on tape. One staffer tells the investigator to wait until her baby is 5 months along. get the ultrasound. Thats when you can determine the gender of the child. boy or girl. and if its a girl. thats when you can kill it. And it was all made very clear. The investigators were laying out a scenario where. if its a girl. I want the girl child to be destroyed. And there was Planned Parenthood accommodating that to the nth degree.",

    "speech": "If the gentleman would yield for a moment. I think its important. an important tangent. Its not tangential. Its an element of this discussion because it shows once we give up on this basic fundamental human right. once we let go of our civil rights tradition and we dont include every person. including those who are most vulnerable in the womb. we can see the consequences. Maybe not here just yet. to a large degree. but we can certainly see the consequences of what I talked about earlier in terms of the desensitization of what abortion really is. So in other places its lent itself to coercive population control. and even to the shocking horror of taking the life of little girls simply because theyre a girl. Now. that still bothers our conscience here in this country. but you can see how its related to the deeper problem of once we start down this pathway. we desensitize ourselves to the hard. to the important reality that the life within is deserving of protection. that women who perhaps are in very difficult circumstances deserve better than this. deserve a fullness of commitment from you and me and the United States Congress and communities of concern everywhere that there is a better way. We do not have to do this to one another. We do not have to impose this wound upon women. We do not have to think in this paradigm when there are hard circumstances. We can do it differently. And I think its important to have a discussion about the broader consequences of what is happening all around us because we desensitize ourselves in what I call a dinosaur decision. because it wasnt based on science. We didnt have the fullness of technology back then. which fortunately helped so many of us understand just how that small. tiny little life is viable. is real. and is growing and can reach its fullness of potentiality if we just nurture it. And sometimes people who are in circumstances that are tough and difficult and need a little help with that nurturing. they deserve that support and help. Thats our message. Thats our message. So if we can turn this back and build upon a new ideal that life is beautiful. life is a gift. it is worthy of support. not only just from individuals but from the culture at large. I think well go a long way towards stopping this aggressive. horrific assault that is happening. primarily in other places but is a threat to potentially happen here. where youre even going so far as to select out the little girl for termination because shes a girl. This is particularly hard for me. to be honest with you. because I have five daughters. Just kind of happened that way. And I remember. in our last ultrasound for the baby. shes 7. I still call her a little baby. but when we saw that child in the womb. my youngest one at that time looked at me and said. Dad. I hope its a boy so you have someone to play with. But technology has helped us understand that life. the nature of that life. And so thats why the Supreme Court decision was not scientific. terribly misguided. has inflicted a deep wound upon us. has given us a false notion of choice and freedom. which tickles the ear. sounds good at one level. but the consequences are oh so deep and real for the individual. for those who are responsible and have been able to escape their responsibility. for geopolitical movements now that have ended up in coercive population control measures. which is grievously unjust. particular to women in far away places. Going back to what I said as well. if youd like. describe some of the testimony that we heard from the women who came from China in secret. who had to be. again. behind screens because we were fearful. and they were as well. for reprisals against their families back in China simply because they dared stand up and say. the government should not impose coercive abortion upon me. There was one woman. as I recall. who was in tears. She had four abortions imposed upon her by the government. You recall that hearing last year because you were responsible for it. and I think its a great credit to your leadership. But again. as hard as this is to look at. as painful as it is. I dont think theres been a more powerful hearing in which Ive participated in the United States Congress. hearing from the victim of a governmentimposed. coerced abortion and what the consequences were on her. Im sorry. Perhaps you had raised that earlier. I didnt have the privilege of hearing your earlier talk. but I think that perspective is important as well.",

    "speech": "I thank my friend for yielding and for raising again another very important point. You know. at several of these hearings. which were covered very scarcely by the news media. unfortunately. we had some powerful witnesses from women who are actually the victims of coercive abortion. Over the many years weve had such hearings. and when they tell their story. and they talk about the helplessness and almost hopelessness of the situation. trying to evade family planning cadres in China as they hunt them down. You know. most people are unaware of the fact that it begins with economic coercion. If you have a baby out of plan. you are fined if you do not voluntarily walk into the abortion mill for the child to be destroyed. And many women want those children. One of the women we had testify. her name was Wuijan. She was a Chinese student attending a U.S. university. and part of her testimonythese are her wordsshe said. when she was rounded up. literally grabbed by the family planning cadres and thrown into a van. totally against her will. she said: The room was full of moms who had just gone through a forced abortion. Some moms were crying. Some moms were mourning. Some moms were screaming. And one mom was rolling on the floor with unbearable pain. Then Wuijan said that it was her turn. and through her tears she described her journey into hell. Here is a woman. just like so many others that we heard from. who were literally trussed. picked up. arrested. I had a woman back in the 1990s. who was pretty much smuggled out of China. who ran one of the family planning centers in Fujian Province. and she selfdescribed herself: \"By day I was a monster. by night a wife and mother of one.\" And she talked about it. and she got asylum here eventually. But she talked about how she would use every part of the police state to ensure that women. even if they evaded family planning cadres up to the ninth monthto drag her in and to kill the baby. and if its very late in the pregnancy. with a poison shot of formaldehyde or some other substance right to the soft part of the brain to kill the baby. These are crimes against humanity. They are everpresent throughout China. And again. theyre missing 100 million girls. maybe more. because of gendercide and the loss of life. Theres no precedent. Theres no example that even comes close of a government using abortion as a tool of population control and the like. And it came right out of the population control movement and what happened in the early or late sixties and especially into the seventies. right here in the United States. In 1984. I say to my friend. Mr. FORTENBERRY. 29 years ago I offered the first amendment on this floor. from this podium. to a foreign aid bill to deny funding to any organization. such as the U.N. Population Fund. that is complicit in Chinas forced abortion policy and involuntary sterilization. It passed. and it morphed into what became known as the KempKasten Amendment. offered on the appropriations bill by Congressman Jack Kemp. After all of these years. it is astonishing to me that we still have so many Members of Congress. we have an administration. in the Obama administration. that is. at best. indifferent. and I would say. at worst supportive of these crimes by giving money to the groups that are on the ground enabling these crimes against women. The Obama administration has enabled this cruel policy by its silence and its financial support to the tune of some $50 million a year to the U.N. Population Fund. We passed. in this House. a prohibition. They. unfortunately. ignore it. do findings that do not comport with the reality on the ground. and then end up sending this money. And I met with a woman whose name is Peng Peiyun. who ran the family planning program in China. I say to my friend. Mr. FORTENBERRY. for several hours in a conversation in Beijing. She kept coming back to the fact that the U.N. Population Fund was there on the ground and found nothing but voluntary abortions. Of course. there are a loss of lives. too. but no coercion. So the whitewashing that the U.N. Population Fund has been able to provide to this egregious violation of womens rights in China. and now we today. under the Obama administration. are funding it. Mr. FORTENBERRY. So its something that has to end. We should be on the side of life and respect. not enabling such terrible things.",

Because everybody listening to this and this important dialogue. this highly sensitive dialogue. may not agree with us. But the vast majority of Americans do agree that the government should not be entangled in this. In other words. taxpayer money should not be going for the provision of abortion. Thats one bit of good news. The second bit of good news. I think. is. again. those of us who have been here a little while. who have been in these trenches trying to beg and plead for an increase of awareness as to what the consequences of abortion are. young people are recognizing that. again. theres got to be a better way. Theyve lived with this through their generation. Theyve seen the scars. seen the wounds. seen the effects on society. And theyre coming forward and saying. Women deserve better. Cant we be loving enough. cant we be big enough to do something different here? And I think thats a great sign of encouragement for two reasons. One is. projecting forward. maybe we can reshape society. But also. heal the wounds that have already occurred. Because they are substantive and deep. And I think its important. And young people. I believe. recognize this. Theyre there saying. Dont make this choice. Its a false choice. particularly if you feel coerced or abandoned. There are people here ready to help. love. get you through. But if there is that deep wound. were also here to heal and help. And I think its just such a beautiful message. It inspires me that so many young people would come to the Capitol and say.

We had four women today at the 40 Years of Victims who told their story of the terrible crisis of the abortion but also the reconciliation and peace that they found later. You make a very good point. Mr. FORTENBERRY. about the young generation. I have never seen more prolifers at the March for Life than we are seeing now. And I went to the first one back in 1974 with my wife. Marie. and then made every one thereafter. When I speak in schools. I used to get a great deal of pushback in answer to a question on the right to life. There are still people who push back. but many students say. Its life. Ultrasound has helped enormously. Its a window to the womb. We all remember Dr. Bernard Nathanson. the founder of NARAL. who became a prolifer. He said. \"If wombs had windows. abortion would end.\" The ultrasound is a window to the womb. And you can see that magnificent unborn child moving. shaking around. sucking his or her thumb. doing somersaults inside the womb. Blobs of tissue and protoplasm dont do this. I think this young generation also has another perspective as well. One of my favorite musicals is \"Les Miserables.\" My wife and I have seen it twiceonce in New York. once here in Washington. And now the movie. Theres a very haunting song in \"Les Miserables.\" a song by Marius. one of the chief people in that musical. Victor Hugos \"Les Miserables.\" and its called. \"Empty Chairs and Empty Tables.\" And he says. \"Theres a grief that cant be spoken. theres a pain.\" and it goes on and on. \"Empty chairs and empty tables where my friends will live no more.\" We have empty chairs and empty tables. A third of this generation has been killed by abortion. You look to your left. you look to your right in a classroom or at a diner. there are missing children and now young adults even up to the age of 40. since 40 years ago Roe v. Wade was handed down. Empty chairs. empty tables. And I would add to that. empty cribs.",

As a matter of morality. history. science. reason. and most of all faith. I can come to no other conclusion but that every human life begins at conception and every life is worthy of protection. We have a sacred responsibility to protect the innocent and defend the rights of those who are unable to defend themselves. The struggle to protect life is truly a struggle to change hearts and minds. It requires faith. reason. debate. action. and compassion. Often we hear that we ought to do something for the least of these. truly. unborn life is the least of these. Let us recognize it. Let us hold it precious. Let us live up to our responsibilities from the Creator and grant those yet to be born that precious right to life. Later this week. thousands of citizens will fight for the rights of the unborn by participating in the March for Life in Washington. D.C.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize the 40th anniversary of the monumental court decision Roe v. Wade. Since the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. 40 years ago today. 54 million abortions have been performed throughout the United States. Over 4.000 babies will be aborted today alone and over the course of 2013. 1.4 million children in the United States will not be granted the gift of life. Mr. Speaker. I am unapologetically prolife. I believe that the miracle of human life begins at conception. I believe that every human being has the unalienable right to life and that this right must be protected by law. As a proud member of the ProLife Caucus. I respect the sanctity of human life in all of its stages. Science proves that human beings develop at an astonishingly rapid pace and that the life of a child begins long before he or she is born into this world. At about 22 days after conception. a childs heart begins to circulate his own blood. unique to that of his mothers and his heartbeat can be detected on ultrasound. Americans have a proud tradition of standing up and fighting for those who cant fight for themselves. As a woman. a wife. a mother of two children. and as the Representative of Alabamas Second Congressional District. Im committed to fighting for the unborn. Recently. my home state of Alabama became the fifth state in the Nation to pass a measure banning abortions after 20 weeks. which is the point where unborn children can feel pain. I applaud the Alabama Legislature for taking such a strong stance on abortion and for protecting those who do not have a voice. As the 113th Congress begins. I will continue to do everything in my power to fight for the unborn. prevent taxpayer money from funding abortions. and protect our democratic system from the encroachment of an allpowerful judiciary. Mr. Speaker. today is a time to celebrate the miracle of life and mourn those whose lives were unjustly ended. Let us use the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade as an occasion to reaffirm our beliefs and vow to fight for the life of every child.",

It has been our privilege to raise them and watch them grow and mature. and three of our children are now married and have begun to have children of their own. Sandy and I now have eight beautiful grandchildren. and each of them have unique talents and personalities. I look forward to welcoming more grandchildren and great grandchildren into our family in the future. In the 40 years since that terrible day. an estimated 55 million innocent children have died as a result of abortions performed in the United States. In 2011 alone. Planned Parenthood reported performing 333.000 abortions. The death of 333.000 children in that one year represents more lives lost than if the entire population of Orlando. Florida. was suddenly extinguished. Over the past 40 years. abortion has claimed nearly three times the total population of the State of Florida. or the same number of people who lived in the Northeast United States as of July 1. 2012.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to acknowledge the 40th Anniversary of the Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade. I was a senior in high school when the case was decided and I still remember that decision vividly today. I could not understand how the Court could legalize the stopping of a beating heart on demand. I thought it was outrageous then and the intervening years since then have done nothing to change my opinion. My opinion has been reinforced by the tragic record of abortion. Fifty five million innocent children have been lost and countless women have suffered both mental and physical pain as a result of abortion. We are a nation of 315 million people. That means that over one sixth of our friends. neighbors. and family members are not with us today because of abortion. Millions of children have been denied the right to live their own lives. to skin their knees on the playground. to go on their first date. to graduate from high school. and to go on to have families of their own. All those unique. amazing lives were ended before we were even able to know them. The tragedy of abortion doesnt stop with the loss of so many innocent children. Like any medical procedure. abortion can have devastating side effects and complications that cause pain and suffering. Mental anguish. regret. and other emotional pain can also result from abortion. It is time for us as a nation to reject such a dismal and heartbreaking procedure. It is time for us to reject the cold callous indifference of abortion that abandons women and their precious children. Were a nation that takes care of our own. that protects the most innocent and vulnerable among us. and stands up for justice for women and children. As Roe v. Wade shows. justice does not flow from the pen of a judge. Justice comes from the loving heart of a human being and from the natural law enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. \"We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life. Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" Today. let us continue the fight for Life and justice for all Americans and especially for unborn children and their mothers.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. with the inspiration of the second inauguration of President Obama fresh in our minds. we renew our efforts to fulfill the promise of prosperity for every American. The theme of yesterdays inauguration was \"Faith in Americas Future.\" Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. whose birth and life we also celebrated Monday. once said. \"Faith is taking the first step even when you dont see the whole staircase.\" I have faith that the Members of the 113th Congress will bring this Nation closer to realizing the promise of prosperity. The last Congress was too often characterized by sharp political dividesdivides that hampered efforts to foster success for all Americans. I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that the 113th Congress will be characterized not by our divisions but by our renewed commitment to cooperation and compromise. I urge every woman and every man fortunate enough to serve in this Chamber to remember that it is possible to hold fast to our principles while making the compromises necessary to move our country forward. Democrats will hold fast to the guiding principle that a strong middle classand an opportunity for every American to enter that middle classis the key to this Nations success. Democrats will stand strongstrong for the standard of balance. We will remain resoluteresolute in the pursuit of fairness for all Americans. regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin. regardless of the size of their bank accounts. regardless of their religion or sexual orientation. Those principles will direct our course as we introduce our first 10 bills todaya tradition we have had in the Senate. which is that the majority party introduces the first 10 billsas we mend our broken immigration system. strengthen our schools. and rebuild our roads and bridges. and we will look to those principles as we bring forth other measures included in those 10 bills. Those principles will be foremost in our minds as we balance the right to bear arms with the right for every child to grow up safe from gun violence. Those principles will be our North Star as we work to end wasteful tax loopholes and balance thoughtful spending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among us. And those principles will point the way as we work to ensure that this countrys uniformed servicemembers never struggle to find employment when their military duties end. Through every struggle and every triumph. those principles must be our guide. Not a single piece of important legislation can pass the Senate or become law without the votes of both Democrats and Republicans. so we will be willing to compromise and work with our colleagues across the aisle. Unfortunately. a number of bipartisan bills passed the Senate during the last Congress that were never acted upon by the House of Representatives. So this year the Senate will revisit some of those legislative priorities that passed on a bipartisan basis here. We will again take up the Violence Against Women Act. This is an important piece of legislation that is expiring. We will take up the farm bill. which is a revolutionary piece of legislation that would save the country up to $24 billion. We will again revisit historical reforms to save the U.S. Postal Service. and we will take up legislation to make whole victims of Hurricane Sandy. Each of these initiatives passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis after deliberation and debate during the last Congress but was left to languish by the House. The Senate will continue to help our fellow Americans recover from Hurricane Sandy before another similar disaster strikes. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed in New York. New Jersey. and New England. and tens of thousands of Americans were left homeless by this destructive storm. We have a responsibility to aid our countrymen as they rebuild their lives and their communities. as we have after terrible floods. fires. and storms in other parts of our Nation. Once we complete that vital legislation. the Senate will take action to make this institution we all lovethe U.S. Senatework more effectively. We will consider changes to the Senate rules. Because this matter warrants additional debate. today we will follow the precedents set in 2005 and again in 2011. We will reserve the right of all Senators to propose changes to the Senate rules. and we will explicitly not acquiesce in the carrying over of all the rules from the last Congress. It is my intention that the Senate will recess today rather than adjourn to continue the same legislative day and allow this important rules discussion to continue later this month. I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that the Republican leader and I will reach an agreement that allows the Senate to operate more effectively in the coming months.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to start by congratulating President Obama on his inauguration. Presidential inaugurations are always a time for the country to come together. We all feel a certain pride in the event. and we are reminded of how fortunate we are to live in a Nation where we have the ability to choose our leaders freely and resolve our differences in peace. Inauguration Day is also a time for new beginnings. a chance to learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities of the past as we reengage in some vitally important debates about our future. Too often over the past 4 years. political considerations have trumped the need to put our country on a sound financial footing and a path to prosperity. Today we should recommit ourselves to the task of facing up to our problems headon. I understand that the passions of an election can sometimes overshadow the business of governing. but the Presidential campaign is now behind us. and so it is my hope that the President will finally be willing to do what Republicans have been asking him to do since his first inauguration 4 years ago. and that is to work with us on identifying durable solutions to the problems we can only solve together. to put aside those things we know we cant agree on and focus on what we can. We should start with spending and debt because if we dont get a handle on that. nothing else matters. If we dont work together to strengthen our entitlement programs. they will go bankrupt. Automatic cuts will be forced on seniors already receiving benefits. rendering worthless the promises they have built their retirements around. It is nice to say. as the President did yesterday. that these programs free us to take the risks that make our country great. but if we dont act to strengthen and protect them now. in a few years they simply wont be there in their current form. And if we dont work together to control the debt. then the cost of our interest payments alone will eventually crowd out funding for things we all agree onfrom defense. to infrastructure. and assistance for those who need it most. In short. the debate we are now engaged in over the growing Federal debt is about much more than numbers on a page. it is about the cost of inaction in terms of promises broken. jobs lost. and dreams deferred. That is why there is simply no more time to waste. Over the past 4 years. while the President focused on reelection and too many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions. the debt grew by more than $6 trillion. We saw the President blast House Republicans for doing their job and passing a budget while Senate Democrats didnt even propose one. Rather than work with us to save existing entitlements. we saw the President team up with Democrats in Congress to force through a brandnew entitlement that will make it even harder to cover the cost of programs we already have. In short. Democrats have put off the hard stuff until now. and our problems have only gotten worse. But that was the first term. A second term presents the opportunity to do things differently. and in the Senate that means a return to regular order. Later this week the House plans to send the Senate a bill to address the debt limit in a timely manner. Once we get it. the Senate should quickly respond. If the Senate version is different from the one the House sends over. send it to conference. That is how things are supposed to work around here. We used to call it legislating. I know a lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities. particularly on spending and debt. After nearly 4 years of refusing to pass a budget. they have only now reluctantly agreed to develop a spending plan for the coming fiscal year. All I would say to that is since the revenue question has been settled. I am sure the American people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have to bring down our ruinous deficits. Let me just say that one thing Americans will no longer tolerate is an attitude that says we can put off our work until the very last minute. They are tired of eleventhhour deals. They are tired of careening from crisis to crisis. and so am I. The good news is that a return to regular order is the surest way to solve the problems we face. And I hope some of my friends on the other side will agree that there is value in this body actually functioning the way it was intended to. Lets face it. The status quo isnt working. The Senate isnt functioning as it should. It has nothing to do with the process that has served us well for a very long time. But if we work together and strive to avoid some of the bad habits that have developed around here. I truly believe we will be able to achieve the kinds of solutions that have eluded us for the past 4 years and deliver some positive results for the people who sent us here. with time to spare. We can do better. I know my constituents expect better than what they have been getting from Congress in recent years. and so should we. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I appreciate the remarks of the minority leader. and I think he essentially gets to the point all of us. in this first week for the 113th Congress. need to be focused on and need to address. This is our first workweek back after the inauguration festivities of yesterday. and I think it is an appropriate time for the Members of this body to discuss the challenges that lay before us over the next 2 years. The most critical and. in my opinion. the most pressing of these challenges is one we have been dealing with for the past 2 years and is now of even more critical importance. and that is the outofcontrol government spending that weakens the health of our economy. threatens the security of our country. and jeopardizes opportunities for future generations. When I arrived here 2 years ago. it was clear the American people were concerned about outofcontrol Federal spending. At the beginning of the Presidents term 4 years ago. the debt limit stood at $10.626 trillion plus. In the 4 years of that term. it has risen to over $16.400 trillionnearly a $6 trillion increase. It is unprecedented in the history of our country to have such outofcontrol spending. It has resulted in our borrowing a very substantial amount of each years budget. which is not healthy whether you are a family or you are a business or you are a State government or you are the Federal Government. The chickens will come home to roost if we continue to do that. Each Americans share of our national debt now is well over $50.000. That means every new baby born in this country instantly owes the government more than $50.000. We have had 4 straight years of trilliondollar deficits without a budget in this body. The minority leader just talked about that. Hopefully. we will finally have a budget to work off of and a budget for which we can look at what the priorities are and make tough decisions about how we spend taxpayers money. We currently spend over $40.000 a second. These are not partisan numbers. and this should not be a partisan issue. These are the facts. As our former Governor in Indiana. Mitch Daniels. said: Just do the arithmetic. This is not a deep philosophical or ideological issue. It is a matter of basic math. With financial problems as great as these. it is my hope as we return now to this 113th Congress we will be able to address this fiscal crisis. It is the same hope I had 2 years ago when I joined the 112th Congress. As we know. we went through a series of efforts to begin to address this problem. Many of those were on a bipartisan basiswe had the Gang of 6 and then we had the supercommittee of 12. These were bipartisan efforts. Many of us worked with our colleagues across the aisle to try to put a grand bargain together. Of course. the President had his own commission led by Mr. Bowles and former Senator Simpson. He rejected that. The Simpson Bowles proposal would have been a good blueprint upon which to begin our discussions. I will be talking some more about that and the disappointmentthe extreme disappointmentof Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson in terms of the inability of this body to address what has been predicted as the most predictable financial crisis in our Nations history. We went through this whole process of the fiscal cliff. We. unfortunately. had to pick the lesser of two evils in order to protect nearly 99 percent of taxpayers from drastic tax increases. starting with the lowest to the highest taxpayer. The fiscal cliff deal may have allowed the President to fulfill his campaign promise to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. but it did little or nothing to address excessive Federal spending. So the debate now shifts. The President got his taxes. With revenue off the table. the debate shifts to where it needs to be and should have been in the first place. that is. addressing spending reductions. Just last week Fitch Ratings warned that Americas AAA credit rating is at risk if the Congress and the President increase the debt limit but fail to enact a \"credible mediumterm deficit reduction plan.\" We can expect to see more headlines like this if we do not come together and take action to deal with our countrys debt obligations. In the coming days and weeks I will be speaking in this Chamber and outlining what I believe are rational steps we need to take to get our fiscal house in order. The easy thing to do. and the way Congress has operated over these past 2 years. is to look at our fiscal situation and say: Well. we have more time. or we can deal with this after the next election. While I thought that was exactly the wrong tactic to take. that is what happened. There were a series of efforts. but each one ended up socalled kicking the can down the road or postponing the day of decision. This is the day of decision. This is the hour of decision. This is the time when we have to step up now and address our outofcontrol spending. We have had that next election. The President has been reelected for 4 years. Members have been reelected. We have this challenge now in front of us. Continuing with the status quo. governing by a crisis. and failing to address our spending problem must be unacceptable. Mr. President. 2013 is the year. In 2014 we are back in another election. We all know the precious 6 to 9 to 12 months that lay before us is the timepostelection. with the Presidents reelection and new Members herethis is the time we have to step up and address our debt and deficit problem. If we do not do so now. most experts who look at this. whether they are liberal or conservative. nonpartisan or partisan. ideological or nonideological. have virtually all come to the conclusion that unless we address this now in 2013. with an election year in 2014. 2015 will be too late. We have seen what is happening in Europe. We see what is happening in Japan. We see what is happening around the worlda world hungry for America to lead. to address its problem. not by pushing it down the road. not through avoiding tough decisions. but addressing the real issue before us that impacts the future of this country and the future of generations to come. So now is the time. now is the hour of decision that we have to take to go forward and address this problem. As I said. I will be using this platform and others as a way to address what I believe we need to go forward with. not only looking at the larger picture but also looking at how this government spends way beyond its means. spends money that it does not have. wastes money through bureaucracy and waste and failed efforts. tries to do more than it should or could or is able. and I want to document some of thoseeverything from the macro to the micro. from the absurd to the bureaucratic to the necessary tough decisions. particularly in regard to our entitlements that have to be addressed in order to preserve and save those programs for not only current beneficiaries but for future beneficiaries. Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to begin this process. and I think each of us must dedicate ourselves to the challenge that lies before us. That challenge is dealing with our outofcontrol fiscal situation. that if not controlled will bring this country down and continue this economic malaise that we are currently in. With that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to talk about our efforts to change the Senate rules. As we began the 113th Congress on January 3. Senators MERKLEY. HARKIN. and I submitted a resolution to reform the Standing Rules of the Senate. Thirteen of my colleagues have signed on to cosponsor our resolution. When we submitted the resolution. we agreed with the majority leader that it would be best to have the debate about reforming our rules after the inauguration. I appreciate his willingness to work with us on this important issue. Although we postponed the debate. we preserved the right of a simple majority of this body to amend the rules in accordance with article 1. section 5 of the Constitution. Senate Resolution 4. our proposal to reform the rules. is simple. it is limited. and it is fair. Again. we are not ending the filibuster. We preserved the rights of the minority. Here is what we are proposing: an end to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead. Senators would be required to go to the floor and actually tell the American people why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a filibuster. Debate on motions to proceed to a bill or to send a bill to conference would be limited to 2 hours. Postcloture debate on a nominee. other than a Justice of the Supreme Court. would be limited to 2 hours rather than the current limit of 30 hours. These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live with if we are in the minority. and yet we are warned these simple reforms will transform the very character of the Senate and leave the minority without a voice. These arguments are covers for continued abuse of the rules. The reforms we propose are modestsome would say too modestbut they would discourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the right to filibuster. but not the right of one Senator to do so by simply picking up the phone. by simply making an announcement and then going out to dinner or. more likely. out to a fundraiser. I have listened carefully to the arguments by the other side against these changes. Let me say. again. we are not talking about taking away the rights of the minority. we are not talking about abolishing the right of debate or to filibuster. but there must be change. The abuse of the filibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate from doing its job. We are no longer the worlds greatest deliberative body. In fact. we barely deliberate at all. This does not honor this institution. and it does not serve the American people. For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly. but in recent years what was rare has become routine. the exception has become the norm. Everything is filibustered. every procedural step of the way. with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the process. not send it into a deep freeze. Since the Democratic majority came into the upper Chamber in 2007. the Senates of the 110th. 111th. and 112th Congresses have the three highest totals of filibusters ever recorded. Lyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate majority leader. In the same span of time HARRY REID has faced over 390. Lyndon Johnson. 1. HARRY REID. 390. Legislation is blocked at every turn. The result is not surprising. The Senate of the 112th Congress passed a record low 2.8 percent of bills introduced. That is a 66percent decrease from the last Republican majority in 20052006. and a 90percent decrease from the high in 19551956. By every measure. the 112th Congress was the most unproductive Congress in our history. My Republican colleagues have come to the floor and made many impassioned statements in opposition to amending our rules at the beginning of this Congress. They say the rules can only be changed with a twothirds supermajority. as the current filibuster rule requires. They argue that any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is breaking the rules to change the rules. This is simply not true. The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article 1. section 5 of the Constitution states: Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. punish its Members for disorderly Behavior. and. with the Concurrence of two thirds. expel a Member. When the Framers required a supermajority. they explicitly said so. as they did for expelling a Member. On all other matters. such as determining the Chambers rules. a majority requirement is clearly implied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents. sitting as President of the Senatewhere the Presiding Officer is sitting todaywho have ruled on the meaning of article 1. section 5. In 1957. Vice President Nixon ruled that: The right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules. stemming as it does from the Constitution itself. cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress. Vice President Rockefeller and Vice President Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses. The Constitution is clear. and there is also a longstanding common law principleupheld in the Supreme Courtthat one legislature cannot bind its successors. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For example. in 2003 Senator JOHN CORNYN wrote in a Law Review article: Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote. one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power. after all. would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another. So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not breaking the rules to change the rules. it is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules. When there is a conflict between them. we follow the Constitution. Some of my colleagues may believe that using the Constitution in this way would be harmful to the Senate. But there is an alternative. We do not have to reform the rules with only a majority vote. Each time the filibuster rule has been amended in the past. a bipartisan majority of Senators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with a majority vote on the reforms looming. enough Members agreed on a compromise and they passed the changes with twothirds in favor. We could do that again. I know many of my Republican colleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. As I visit with my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle. they tell me they are unhappy with the way things are. I said 2 years ago I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next Congress regardless of which party was in the majority. At the time. many people believed the Democrats would lose their majority. So let me be clear: If Leader MCCONNELL had become the new majority leader in this Congress. I would have asked him to work with me on these same reforms. I will say again. the proposed changes will reform the abuse of the filibuster. They will not trample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I am willing to live with all the changes we are proposing. whether I am in the majority or the minority. The other side has suggested a change in the rules is an affront to the American people. But the real affront would be to allow the abuse of the filibuster to continue. We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is time for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and what matters to American familieswhat they talk about around the kitchen table. That was the message that was sent us from this election. and we would do very well to listen to it. Under the abuse of the current rules. all it takes to filibuster is one Senator picking up the phone. That is itdoes not even have to go to the floor and defend itjust a phone call by one Senator: no muss. no fuss. no inconvenience. except for the American public. except for a nation that expects and needs a government that works. a government that actually works together and finds common ground. Maybe some of my colleagues believe the Senate is working as it should. that everything is fine. We do not take that view. It is not working and it needs change. The American people of all persuasions want a government that actually gets something done. The challenges are too great. the stakes are too high for a government of gridlock to continue. The New York Times yesterday and several of the local newspapers in my home State have editorialized about moving forward with reform and how important that is. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New York Times and an editorial from the New Mexican be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I am rising today to talk about the vision we have ahead for the next 2 years and how this Senate can fulfill its responsibilities under the Constitution to do its legislative responsibilities addressing the big issues facing America. I dont think anyone is unaware that for the last 2 years this Chamber has seen simply inaction and paralysis. It has been rated as one of the worst 2year sessions in the history of the U.S. Government. Well. what are we going to do differently? How is it that we only address 1 out of 24 appropriations bills over the last 2 years? How is it that so many important bills never made it to the floor of the Senate. bills such as the replacement for No Child Left Behind. which was a bipartisan vision that came out of committee. How is it that so many bills came to this floor to never see a final vote? These are bills. such as the DISCLOSE Act. which would have eliminated secrecy in campaign donations. the DREAM Act. which would have honored creating a future for those who know only America as their home. the Presidents jobs package. which would have helped put America back to work. and the closing of loopholes for the biggest. most wealthy oil companies. Those funds could be put to use reducing our deficit or funding critical programs for working Americans. On issue after issue after issue. we saw inaction. What we heard yesterday at the start of this next 2 years was a call from the President for action. In his inaugural speech he said: For now decisions are upon us. and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle. or substitute spectacle for politics. or treat namecalling as reasoned debate. We must act. knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act. knowing that todays victories will be only partial. The President echoed. if you will. the thought that he brought into his first 4 years. the urgency of now. We have big issues facing America. and it is time for the executive branch and the legislative branch to work together to address those issues. In this call for action. we must ask how much action can there be if we see more than 100 filibusters in the next 2 years? How much action can there be if on every request for a vote an objection is heard that creates a day of delay in this Senate? The contrast is enormous from the time that Lyndon B. Johnson was President of the Senate. Lyndon B. Johnson. during 6 years of presiding over this body. saw one filibuster. HARRY REID. in his 6 years of presiding over this Senate. has seen 391 filibusters. Let me convey that even when we have the votes to end a filibuster. the fact that it is launched creates enormous paralysis. Imagine you are debating a bill. and you continue debating through the end of the week. When you come in the following Monday to debate. and nobody has anything left to say. then someone says: I ask unanimous consent that we have a final vote on this bill. Now. you see. we dont have a previous question on this floor. so one has to ask unanimous consent. Any of the 100 Senators can weigh in and say no. When they weigh in and say no on that Monday. then on Tuesday a petition is put forward with 16 Senators saying: Lets have a vote on closing debate. That vote cant happen until Thursday. under the rules. If it is successful on a Thursday. we have to have 30 hours more of debate before we can hold the final vote. That takes us into Saturday. Monday through Saturday is lost based on an objection on Monday by one Senator. If we have 391 of these objections that waste a week of our time in the course of a 6year period. then we basically waste every legislative week because there are not 391 weeks in a 6year period. It becomes pretty simple to see why we only were able to get one appropriations bill done in the last 2 years. and why so many bills never made it to the floor of the Senate for consideration even though they were essential to restoring the economic vitality of our Nation and putting people back to work. I. for one. find this absolutely unacceptable. Over our history there have been three basic forms of filibusters. The first only worked in an age when transportation didnt work very well. and at any given moment there were a number of Members who couldnt get here to the floor of the Senate because they were traveling from their farms and the axle on their wagon broke or the train broke down or so on and so forth. Sometimes those journeys would take many weeks and things happened along the way. In that situation. a quorum of 50 percent plus 1 was sometimes in doubt. and those seeking delay could say: You know what. Lets deny a quorum. Well. that was an effective tool only through that period. Then. as that changed. folks said: You know. we have the respect here of hearing everyone out. Therefore. if I can get to the floor of the Senate. I may delay this Senate as long as I am able to speak. Well. it is through this effort that we have a number of famous filibusters. folks such as Strom Thurmond holding forth for 24 hours. We have. however. seen that a person can only delay the Senate for 24 hours. Then someone else can seek the floor. and you may proceed. So that was a fairly modest strategy. In both the case of the denying quorum and in the case of speaking as long as you could. you had to spend time and energy. You had to organize. and it was visible before this body. It was visible before the reporters gathered in the balcony. Therefore. the American people. long before there was a television camera here. could see what you were doing. and the public could provide feedback on that. But now we come to the modern era. from 1970 forward. in which it has become popular to start using the objection as an instrument of party warfare. the objection to a final vote. If we turn back before 1970. we had an overlap between the parties of perhaps 30 Members. So if you had used this objection. you would have a good sense that you would be able to get cloture. Furthermore. there was a social contract that you only interrupted the workings of this body on an issue of deep principle. You only blockaded the operations of the Senate on an issue of profound concern to your State. not as a routine instrument of party politics. But that has changed over the last 43 years. since 1970 forward. and now the minority party can say: Lets show that the majority cant even get an agenda onto the floor of the Senate. and then lets complain about them not acting. This is not a philosophy that serves America. It is not a philosophy that was embraced through the extent of our history. You came here with the responsibility to contribute in committee. to contribute on the Senate floor. to try to make bills better. and to try to get issues addressed. You were not trying to paralyze this body so issues dont get addressed that may be contained on that side. That. quite frankly. is an unacceptable theme that has started to haunt this Hall. and we need to do something about it. Indeed. if we look at the modern era where the parties have become so divided. we no longer see that overlap of 30 Senators. Therefore. any minority group. be it the Democrats. be it the Republicans. has the ability to bring this Chamber to a halt. But is it right to do so? If we cannot persuade our colleagues it is wrong to do so. then we need to change the rules of the Senate. We need to insist if someone is going to throw a shoe into the gears. if someone is going to blockade the ability of the Senate to deliberate and decide. then that Senator needs to take responsibility here on the floor of the Senate. Yes. we should get rid of the filibuster on the motion to proceed. Filibustering on whether to get to a bill does not enhance deliberation on the bill itself. We should make that decision in a crisp fashion and get on to the work. not waste weeks trying to decide if we are going to do the work of the people. Second. we should get rid of the filibuster on going to a conference committee. Both Chambers have decided. They have voted in favor of the bill. It has been passed in different forms. Nothing should impede getting to conference and having a negotiation. Indeed. out of those negotiations. even if starting with one Chamber having a dramatic view different from the other. there is a coming together that takes steps forward that both Chambers can agree to. So nothing should impede that negotiation from going forward. We recognize a bill can still be filibustered when it comes back from committee. so why impede getting to the conference committee in the first place? We should greatly reduce the number of hours after we have gotten cloture on debate. On nominations. by the time we vote on closing debate. our Members know how they are going to vote on that nominee. So we could have a final 2 hours but not a final 30 hours. Thirty hours is another wasted set of days we can ill afford. And certainly it makes sense to say. whenever possible. we should cut down that 30 hours on bills after we have reached cloture. We can do it by unanimous consent. and we often do that now. We can do it by requiring Senators to proceed to a vote if they do not stand and talk. but that is postcloture. Here is the thing: When 41 Senators say they want additional debate. they want to delay the decisionmaking process here in the Senate. they should be willing to stand and make their case before their colleagues and the American people. It takes time and energy if you go that direction. It doesnt become a freebie where one Senator spends no time. no energy. and can go off to dinner or on vacation while paralyzing the Senate. You should have to spend the time and energy to be here to make your case. Not only is that important in stripping away frivolous filibusters. it also means the American people get to weigh in. I am absolutely convinced if we were to go back to the debate on the DISCLOSE Act. which stripped away secrecy in campaign donations. and we had 59 votes to close debatewe needed a sixtiethif those who voted for additional debate. and who fled this Chamber fearful of making their case before the American people. had been required to stand and defend secrecy and foreign donations in our campaign system. the American people would not have said they were heroes but they were bums. They would have weighed in and said to their own Senators: Join the effort to close debate. because to stand in the way of a final vote over secrecy in campaign donations does great damage to our democracy. Maybe the pressure and common sense of the citizens would have helped address the bitter partisanship that guides this body. At a minimum. the citizens of this Nation have the right to know what is happening to legislation here on floor. The idea it is being paralyzed by the secret filibuster is unacceptable. so we should include the talking filibuster in any package we bring to modify the rules of the Senate. I see my colleague from New Mexico has come to the floor. and he spoke earlier. He has put forward the vision that we must. at the start of every 2 years. evaluate how the Senate is working. and if it has problems we need to pass changes in the rules to address those problems. This is not some remote concept of inside baseball. This is about American citizens having a legislature that can address the big issues facing our Nation. So I praise him for his leadership in putting this forward. which has led to this day. And it is the second time. We were here 2 years ago making this case. making this argument that we owe it to our citizens to improve the workings of the Senate. and we are here again today. There is a saying about the Senate. that the Senate is the worlds greatest deliberative body. If only it were so. It has been. at various points in its history. a thoughtful Chamber. a deliberative Chamber. But not today. It is driven by deep partisan differences. those being converted into strategies of paralysis. that prevent deliberation. We must change that. It is our responsibility as Senators to change that. The American people expect it. Lets make it so. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

So it is a chance I have to explain to them that what has changed is the social contract. that when people objected to the Senate proceeding with its business in the past. they wanted to make their views known on the Senate floor. They wanted to take responsibility because they realized it was a very high privilege to be able to delay the Senate and they had a responsibility to do so only for deeply principled or large issues and to make their case known. So I do see overwhelming support. I feel as though the American people are so far ahead of maybe our own Chamber in understanding how broken we are and how much it needs to be fixed.",

    "speech": "The Senator made some nice comments about mehe was probably a little too generousand I wanted to also thank him for all the work he has done on this issue. He has been a passionate voice for change. and he and I have both reached out to our friends across the aisle and tried to get things done. I always bring this back to the question of why are we doing this. We are doing this so government can tackle the issues the American people care about. And I think there are two times in historyI am sure there are many otherswhere for me the Senate was in its glory days. We should always remember we have that potential. We see little bits of light every now and then here. such as with the passage of a transportation bill or a farm bill out of the Senate where bipartisanship exists and we come together. but I wish to talk very briefly about two time periods that I consider to be the glory days of the Senate. One was before the Civil War. In the 40 years before the Civil War. the Senate was grappling with how do we hold the Union together. There was tremendous discussion. and Senators such as Daniel Webster and John Calhoun and others would work with each other and have heated debate. but for that 40 years before the Civil War. they held the country together. It was the Senate that fashioned those compromises that allowed the country to stay out of the Civil War. They didnt completely prevent it. but most people. looking at history. say those were some of the glory days of the Senate. The second period was in the 1960s and 1970s. with Senators such as Muskie and Stafford and Chafeegiants in this bodywho stepped forward on civil rights. stepped forward on environmental issues. stepped forward on the pressing issues of the time. So the Senate. once again in that time period. passed laws. I remember. I was a kid here in Washington. and my father was Secretary of the Interior. when the wilderness law. the Clean Water Act. the Clean Air Act. and the Environmental Protection Agency was set up. Those were big lawsbig. bold lawsthat were dealing with our problems. So once again. they are glory days of the Senate. I think we have that potential. As I see the new Senators coming in. the folks who were elected with us. and the Senators who arrived in the last 5 or 10 years. I think we have the ability to respond in a big. bold way to the crises that face us. I know Senator MERKLEY came here as a young man with Senator Hatfield. I believe. and he saw a different Senate. Maybe he could talk about that. We dont want to stay. I know we are going to a caucus and we have our generous chair hereour presiding officerso we dont want to keep her up here too long. Anyway. I yield to the Senator.",

    "speech": "I think my colleague from New Mexico is absolutely right in pointing out there were periods when the Senate really worked to face the big issues of America. And it wasnt that there werent profound differences. There were fierce differences. emotional differences. deep differences. but folks came to this floor. they conversed. they laid out their arguments and. ultimately. they made decisions about which way to go. They didnt bring the attitude: Well. lets paralyze this Chamber from doing anything. Had they done that. there would never have been the set of changes that addressed significant issues in either of those periods. My colleague is right that a part of the reason I feel so strongly about restoring the functioning of this Senate is that when I came here as an intern at age 19 for Senator Hatfield. I had the very good fortune to be assigned to the Tax Reform Act of 1976. and then I had the even better fortune that it came up on the floor of the Senate. So during the many days it came before the body. I sat up in the staff gallery and watched as amendment after amendment was raised and debated and voted on. And since in those days there was no camera or email. the member of the Senate team who was responsible for it would run down from the staff gallery. intercept their Senator. and tell them what the issue was. what was said about it. what the folks back home thought about it. what the set of motions was that had been dealt with on it. and so it was a legislature at work. And rarely. rarely. did the thought that anything would not be decided by 51 pass the minds of Senators. Again. that objection for 51 was reserved for very special. very rare occasions. It might happen once or twice in your career. I do feel that the conversation we have before us is so important that I thought I would put up this chart. As my colleague can see. this just dramatizes it. It is a picture of Lyndon B. Johnson showing his one filibuster in 6 years. one time that he needed to get a cloture motion to try to shut down debate. otherwise. there was a courtesy that people said what they had to say and then stood aside and took votes. And here we have HARRY REID in his 6 yearsit says \"387 and counting.\" It hit 391 before we completed his sixth year. So there is an enormous difference. The work we are engaged in right now of trying to find a way to have every voice heard and then to be able to proceed to be accountable and transparent before the public is so important. As the Senator and I have engaged in this conversation. sometimes we have heard criticism from across the aisle saying: You are trying to silence the voice of the minority. Does the Senator see anything in the proposals that we have been advocating that in any way silences the voice of the minority?",

    "speech": "In looking at this. I do not see anything in the proposals. and I think we. in working on this together. tried to bring a discipline to it that said we want to preserve the best traditions of the Senate. we want the minority to be heard. we want the minority to have amendments. and we want them included in the process. What we dont want is the tyranny of the minority. And the Founders talked about the tyranny of the minority. They talked about the fact that if you allowed a small minority to govern and block the governing of the majority. that was the tyranny of the minority. and they feared that. So I think that when we consider this and we talk about the filibuster and our institution today. our Senate. where many times the Republican leader has come to the floor and said that it is going to take 60 votes. everything takes 60 votes. that isnt the way the Founders designed it. The Founders actually had very strong language for what they thought of supermajorities. Everybody remembers their history. The Founders came off the Articles of Confederation. It was a supermajority. It didnt work. It was broken. So they only put into the Constitution in five places supermajoritiesthings such as expelling a Member and ratifying a treatybut otherwise it was simple majorities. And when the history is going to be written. it is hard to tell how this happened. But to have a leader of the Senate stand and say that everything takes 60 votesthe Founders never contemplated that. When they adopted rule XXII in 1917. that wasnt what they were trying to do. and the rule has actually been turned on its head. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I would like to follow up on the last point Senator UDALL of New Mexico made about our Founders. I have in my hand three of the Federalist Papers. Federalist Papers 22. 75. and 58. These are by Madison and Hamilton. and they explore this issue of the supermajority. It was a very conscious decision that a supermajority was not put into the Constitution for decisions of these Chambers. And the reason whyand they explained it more eloquentlyis essentially that if you take the path that the minority thinks is the right path rather than the path the majority thinks is the right path. then over time you make a series of worse decisions. The minority might be right on occasion. but most of the time the viewpoint brought by those representing the greatest number of States in this case or the greatest number of citizens on the House side is the path that makes sense. And they warned about the supermajority as an instrument that would bring paralysis. It is almost as if they could look forward 200 years to this moment and say: Dont do that because you will end up with paralysis. This is from Federalist Paper No. 22 by Alexander Hamilton. He wrote this in 1787. and he notes in commenting about the issue of a simple majority that \"there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must. in some way or other. go forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority. respecting the best mode of conducting it. the majority. in order that something may be done. must conform to the views of the minority. and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater. and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence. tedious delays. continual negotiation and intrigue. contemptible compromises of the public good.\" Let me read that last set of words about what Hamilton said would happen if you had a supermajority requirement in the Senate: \"tedious delays. continual negotiation and intrigue. contemptible compromises of the public good.\" I think anyone watching the proceedings of the Senate for the last 2 years would say that Hamilton was right on the mark in that regard. And. of course. he was not alone. There was not a single Federalist Paper written arguing that there should be a supermajority in the Senate or the House because of the experience that had been had previous to forming the strategy embodied in the Constitution. Lets turn to James Madison. In Federalist 58. James Madison said: It has been said that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum He goes on to discuss it in various views. and he said: Lastly. it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice of secessions. a practice which has shown itself even in States where a majority only is required. a practice subversive And here is the key languagea practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular government. a practice which leads more directly to public convulsions. and the ruin of popular governments. than any other which has yet been displayed among us. He also made the point that we would end up with equitable sacrifices to the general wealor general good. So as we turn to our conversations in our respective caucuses and to the dialog here on the floor of the Senate. I ask my colleagues to search your hearts about our responsibility to the citizens of the United States of America to address the big issues facing America. which means that we dont paralyze this body in secret. If my colleagues have points to make. then make them as was done during the periods of great debate on the floor of the Senate: Make them on the floor of the Senate. engage in that debate. and when no more is to be said. when all 100 Senators say: We have had our full input. then lets make a decision.

    "speech": "Madam President. let me take a moment to welcome you to the Senate. I look forward to working with you and welcome you. coming from the House of Representatives to the Senate. Over the Christmas holidays most of our Nation was focused on what Congress would do to avoid the socalled fiscal cliff. What was largely missing from that conversation was how to address the much greater and more damaging problem. our growing national debt. I am not exactly sure what the definition of fiscal cliff was. I think it had different meanings to different people. We dealt with a portion of the fiscal cliff. a slight delay in sequestration. and the consequences of the socalled Bush tax cuts expiring on December 31. but the serious problem is our national debt. Last years budget shortfall reached $1.1 trillion. the fourth straight year of trilliondollar deficit spending. This outofcontrol government spending has increased our national debt to a record $16 trillion. which is more than the entire U.S. economy produced in goods and services for the entire year of 2012. Last week Secretary Geithner let Congress know it will reach its borrowing limit as soon as midFebruary. President Obama will request that Congress raise the debt ceiling once again. This is the fifth time that President Obama has requested the debt limit be raised to allow the Federal Government to borrow and spend more money. What is the point of even having a debt limit if Congress simply extends the Treasurys borrowing capacity each time the limit is reached? While some may say it is irresponsible not to raise the debt limit. our Nation finds itself at a point of such indebtedness that it is equally as irresponsible to extend the debt ceiling without significant reductions in Federal spending. I voted against an increase to the debt limit 2 years ago and intend to vote against another increase unless we substantially change the way government does business by reducing Federal spending. In addition to it being alleged that it is irresponsible not to raise the debt ceiling. sometimes it is suggested it is not compassionate to not spend money. Where is the compassion in spending money we dont have that is being borrowed and will have to be repaid by future generations of Americansour kids and grandkids? Our country is facing enormous fiscal challenges that. if left unchecked. will have a disastrous impact on the future of our Nation. The simple truth is that government is spending more than it is taking in. and this pattern must not. and in fact cannot. continue. During the last 2 years alone the government has spent more than $7.3 trillion and increased the Nations debt by more than $3.2 trillion. We didnt get into this situation overnight. It has been years in the making. Our staggering national debt and deficits are the responsibility of many Congresses and Presidents from both political parties who have allowed us to live well beyond our means for far too long. Americans deserve leadership in Washington to confront these fiscal challenges and fight for the future of our Nation. However. to date. our President and our Congressthis Congresshas failed to provide that leadership. We learned from the New Years Eve fiscal cliff negotiations that our work to tackle our debt must begin now. It cannot wait until the eleventh hour when the deadline is near and the consequences are preventable. We have all heard the saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results. Why should we expect our fiscal situation to change if we keep doing the same thing: raising the debt limit so we can borrow more money and spend more money? We know what needs to be done. It will just take the political courage to do it. Rather than wait for another lastminute deal that gets rushed through with little input from the American people. it is time we have an open and honest debate. I think Americans are ready for leadership that involves tough decisions. The President must come to the table with Congress and put courage and common sense before politics. and that means getting serious about our governments finances. One of the best ways to rein in spending is to set a budget and live by it. No country. business. or family can operate responsibly without a budget. Crafting a budget is one of the basic responsibilities of Congress. but this Senate has not passed a budget in more than 1.300 days. When a Kansas family meets the max on their credit card. they dont just call the credit card company and ask them to raise their credit limit so they can keep on spending. No. They cut back on spending and change their budget. Washington needs to do the same. I hope the stories the Senate is going to address a budget are true. and I hope that means the Budget Committee will meet andin regular orderdeal with a budget. I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I hope we have the opportunity to do appropriations bills which matter and follow that budget. We must take serious action to address this fiscal cliffthe real oneof $48 trillion in unfunded obligations. These programs. which represent promises made by the Federal Government to Americans. must be kept. It is not about undoing Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. it is about making certain they are available. fiscally sound. and that another generation of Americans can receive the benefits. Another solution. besides the budget. in getting our spending back under control is to consider and adopt many of the bipartisan recommendations put forth by the Presidents own Deficit Reduction Commission. The cochairs of that Commission have warned that if we fail to take swift and serious action. the United States faces the most predictable economic crisis in history. Yet the President and Senate leadership has ignored these recommendations and continues to spend borrowed money without regard for the consequences. The Presidents solution is to raise revenues to balance the budget. but those tax increasesif he got all he asked forwould only cover our spending for a few weeks. The budget the President proposed during the 4 years he has been President raises taxes. Every budget that the President has proposed in the 4 years he has been in office has raised taxes. One would think maybe that means the deficit is going down. But. unfortunately. the budgets proposed by President Obama would raise taxes. raise spending. and increase debt. To me. that suggests increasing taxes is never the solution that results in less spending and less deficits but just increased taxes and more spending. History shows us that every time money is raised in Washington. DC. more money is spent by Washington. DC. The revenues we need to balance our books are not increases in taxes but revenues coming from a strong and growing economy. To turn our economy around and put people back to work. Congress and the administration should be implementing policies that encourage job creation. rein in burdensome government regulations. replace our convoluted Tax Code with one that is fair. simple. and certain. open foreign markets to Americanmanufactured goods and agricultural products. and develop a comprehensive energy policy. We are not immune from the laws of economics which face every Nation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that government spending on health care. entitlements. Social Security. and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the total revenues generated by the Federal Government by the year 2025. That means the money the government spends on national defense. transportation. veterans health care. and other government programs will have to be borrowed and will drive us even further into debt. The CBO issued a report last June which warned that unless we work to reduce our debt. we will face the increased probability of a sudden fiscal crisis that would cause investors to lose confidence in the governments ability to manage its budget. and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at these affordable rates. I do not want to experience the day when our creditors decide we are no longer creditworthy and America has to suffer the same consequences as the countries that have ignored their debt crisis. We need to look no further than the current situation of many countries in Europe to see what high levels of national debt will do to a countrys economic health. Last week one of the major credit rating agencies. Fitch. warned that America risks losing its AAA credit rating if Congress and the President fail to agree to a \"credible mediumterm deficit reduction plan.\" Fitchs warning is yet another reason we need to work together to put our country on a sustainable path for the future. We need to heed this warning and take steps now to prevent another credit downgrade. The American people expect the President and Members of Congress to confront our Nations challenges and not push them off to some future date. They also want their concerns and voices heard. The lastminute deals. the negotiations by a handful of people are very disturbing to me and to many Americans. Today I am pleased to share a new opportunity which gives Kansans a voice in the debate on how to reduce spending through a new Web site called Fight for our Future. Kansans can access that site from my home page and learn more about the governments true fiscal condition. Not only can they share their thoughts on why we should cut spending. but they can also vote for a debt reduction proposal they think will be most effective. They will be able to add their name to a message that will be sent to the President and congressional leaders to urge us to put politics aside and work to save our countrys future. The debate over government spending is often seen as one that is philosophical or simply partisan bickering. All my life I heard Republicans and Democrats argue about spending. deficits. and taxes. They think that is what goes on in Washington. DC. This time it is different. Our failure to act will have dramatic consequences to the daily lives of Americans. This is about whether an American can find a job. afford to make payments on their homes and cars. and whether their kids will have a bright future. The debt limit crisis we are facing now did not have to be a crisis. We knew the day would come when we would have to deal with the consequences of living beyond our means. Lets work together to solve this tremendous challenge. I note the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday President Obama made a beautiful speech. I think everyone agrees that he is a very persuasive speaker. Although I didnt agree with anything he said. it was said beautifully. I want to read one part of his speech because I dont want to get it wrong. He said: We will respond to the threat of climate change. knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations . . . The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition. We must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries. We must claim its promise. Thats how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure. That is a direct quote which came out of the Presidents speech. and it has a lot of little subliminal things in there that people did not pick up on. but I did. One isand they talked about thatwe must show the leadership. That is because of all the things they try to do to damage the economy. to destroy the economy. in terms of the capandtrade agenda. And all of that are things that other countries are just waiting for us to do. It is not that we are going to provide the leadership. and all of a sudden China is going to say: Hey. they are doing it. so maybe we ought to do it. China. instead. is sitting back hoping that will happen in this country. so they can have all the jobs that are chased away from our manufacturing base. There are a few sentences the President dedicated to global warming. and the rest of his speech could be labeled as a liberal laundry list. And I think everyone was expecting that. I was not surprised that the President decided to do this. All during the campaign and during the weeks since the election. the Presidents extreme environmental base has been very vocal with their frustrations. A lot of them go back and say: At one time. Mr. President. you had the White House and you had the House and you had the Senate. and yet you did not even try to get this stuff done. They are talking about. of course. the capandtrade system. In fact. there is one good reason he did not get it done. and that is because the votes just are not there. They want the President to immediately regulate hydraulic fracturing. officially reject the permit for the Keystone pipeline. advance the regulatory powers of the EPA to cut CO2 emissions. use all of his political capital to push a legislative fix to climate change. and to kill Americas oil and gas industry. That is what was expected of him. And now. since he does not have to run for reelection. you are going to get a lot more than you did before. So that should make them happy. But it is a lot more rhetoric and not a lot more action. Studies done during the most recent debateand that would have been the WaxmanMarkey bill. that was the capandtrade bill just a couple years ago that they had. I think that might have been the last one we hadthe estimatesthis is interestinggoing all the way back to the Kyoto treaty. they said. the cost. if you try to do cap and trade. is going to be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Well. that is between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. I do something in my State of Oklahoma. and I suggest that the Presiding Officer may do this in his State of West Virginia. Every year I get the figures on how many families there are in my State of Oklahoma who file a Federal tax return and actually pay Federal taxes. Then I do the math. The way it works out. if you are talking about $400 billion a yearand I have not had one person argue with that figure that I have been using for over 10 years nowbut if you do the math. that means for each person in my State of Oklahoma. it would cost them about $3.000 a year to do it. The interesting part of this is. you do not really accomplish anything by doing it. This same agenda at the EPA. under authority he is claiming is under the Clean Water Act. has to be something we are going to talk about. And I do not have any hesitation in doing that. Bills such as the WaxmanMarkey billand I believe Senator BOXER and several others have had billsthe cost of that being of some $400 billion a year. would affect industries and emitters of CO2 that emit 25.000 tons of CO2 or more a year25.000 tons. That would truly be just the big emitters. However. the effort of this administrationsince they cannot get it passed through legislationis to do it through regulation under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act is specific. And the Clean Air Act goes after anyone who emits at least 250 tons of CO2. So stop and think about that because it is very difficult to try to evaluate it and determine just how much it would cost. The regulations they have would force these facilities to receiveanyone who is regulated under thisEPA construction permits. rehabilitation permits. monitoring devices. and install unnecessary and costly technology to reduce CO2 emissions without any corresponding benefits. This would give the EPA a hand in everything. The cost of this is so great that it cannot be calculated. Stop and think about this. If the WaxmanMarkey billor any of the other pieces of legislation that were called capandtrade regulationswere passed. that would regulate only those 25.000 tons or more of emissions. However. the Clean Air Act is 250 tons. So 25.000 tons would be $400 billion a year. How much would it be for just 250 tons? That means every university. every school. every hospital would be subject to the regulation. That is something they have been attempting to do for a long time. I have to say. there are a lot of appointees of President Obama whom I do not like at all. One I do likeand I am sorry she is not stayingis Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was the Director appointed by President Obama to be the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. I found one thing really curious about her. While she is very liberal philosophically. she does not lie. That is all I can really ask of people. I can remember in this case. when they finally gave upthis is just 2 years go. They finally gave up and said: We are not going to be able to pass any kind of a bill for cap and trade. but we are going to go to Copenhagen and tell them we are going to do it another way. If we cannot get a bill passed. we will do it through regulation. To do it through regulation instead of legislationthis is kind of in the weedsyou have to have an endangerment finding. That is what the law says. So Lisa Jackson was before our committee. and I asked her a question. I said: Madam Administrator. tomorrow I am going to leave for Copenhagen to be the oneman truth squadbecause everybody has been over there lying to these other countries saying we are going to pass something over hereand I have a feeling that once I leave town. you are going to have an endangerment finding and do this through regulation. I could see her kind of smiling. I said: When you do that. the regulation that you have is going to have to be based on science. That is what the law says. What science are you going to use? Her answer was: Well. we will use mostly the United Nations IPCC. A lot of people do not realizeI wrote a whole book about thisthis thing all started way back 12 years ago. and it was a thing by the United Nations. They formed the IPCC. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They are the ones who came up with all this stuff. So she said it is going to be on the IPCC. Well. poetic justice. It could not have been done better if we had planned it. because it was not weeks after that. it was days after that. that what hap pened? Climategate. All of a sudden. they realized. through some leaked information. that the IPCC had been lying all those years. I will mention a couple things. The UK Telegraph said it is the \"worst scientific scandal of our generation.\" Clive Crook of the Financial Times said: \"The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.\" IPCC prominent physicist resigns because \"Climategate was a fraud on a scale I have never seen.\" Further. another U.N. scientist bails. U.N. IPCC coordinating author Dr. Phillip Lloyd calls out IPCC \"fraud.\" \"The result is not scientific.\" And the list goes on and on. Just stop and think about it. The UK Telegraphone of the biggest publications in the UKsaying it is the \"worst scientific scandal of our generation.\" So we now know that was the science they were going to use. I will always be appreciative of Director Jackson for being totally honest in her response. But we can guess that would be devastating and cripple the Nation and bankrupt our economy. We know what would happen. The contrast here is stark. On one hand. you have the President saying he wants to control carbon for the sake of protecting our economy and. on the other hand. you have the Presidents EPA embarking on a regulatory crusade that potentially would be devastating to our economy and America. The President and the EPA have been working for 4 years to build a case to justify the need for Federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. A minute ago I listed all the things that were in his speech that I think would be devastating to the economy. One is hydraulic fracturing. I will bet you. 5 years ago. if you said hydraulic fracturing. peoples eyes would glass over and they would not know what you were talking about. They all know now because hydraulic fracturing is a process that is used to get oil and gas out of tight formations. I know quite a bit about it because it all started in 1949 in my State of Oklahoma. In 1949. in Duncan. OK. we discovered that you could unlock these reserves using hydraulic fracturing. So it is something that has been used that way for over a milliona millionapplications. and the States have been regulating it and doing so quite well. Everyone is satisfied with the way it has been regulated. There has never been a casegetting back to Lisa Jackson. I asked her a question in one of our committee hearingsand it was live with TV covering itI said: Can you tell me and can you identify one case in a milliona million applications of hydraulic fracturingone case where there has been groundwater contamination? She said she could not. So there has never been a confirmed. documented case of groundwater contamination because of hydraulic fracturing. Because of these facts. the only reason for EPA regulation of hydraulic fracturing is to significantly limit. if not ban. its use. It would kill the domestic oil and gas industry. which I believe. more often than not. that is exactly what they want. Well. in closing. the Presidents remarks yesterday were not surprising to me. But it did confirm the fact that this President is not interested in pursuing an agenda that would help the growing segments of the economy. such as the oil and gas industry. People talk about our reliance upon the Middle East and people who could become our enemies for oil and gas. All we have to do is produce our own. get the political obstacles out of the way. so we can be totally independent. I wish to mention two things President Obama has said. One. he says that oil and gas production during his administrationhis 4 yearshas boomed. This is true. but not in the public sector. It has done so because of hydraulic fracturing. horizontal drilling. and all these technologies that have been very successful and have worked. He has made the statement over and again that: Well. it would not do any good if we opened public lands for production because it would take 10 years before that would affect the supply and the cost of oil and gas. Well. there is a guy whose name is Harold Hamm. Harold Hamm is arguably the most successful independent oil man in America today. He is from Enid. OK. I called him because I was going to be on a very liberal TV show and knew they were going to ask this question. I called him so I could document an answer. The statement they were going to make was: Well. President Obama has said it would take 10 years for that. for oil to reach the pumps if you opened public lands. How long do you think it would take? So I called Harold Hamm. I said: Harold. you have to be accurate in responding to this question because I am going to use it on national TV tonight. and I am going to use your name. So I said: If you were to set up your rig in New Mexico and start drillingyou say: Go right nowhow long would it take for the first barrel you brought up to reach the pumps? Without hesitating. he said 70 daysnot 10 years. 70 days. Then he went on and told me what would happen each day. how long it would take to go through the refining process and reach the pumps. So that is just one of the things that has been said over and over to make people believe it is true. Let me mention a couple of things in winding this down. Richard Lindzen is from MIT. Richard Lindzen is probably the foremost authority. No one has really questioned him in the past. His statement was: Regulating CO2 is a bureaucrats dream. If you regulate C02. you regulate life. That is exactly what it would be. Everyone would fall into that regulation. Getting back to whyI do not want people to sit around and worry about ityou are going to hear a lot of talk and the President is going to do all he can under regulations to try to do cap and trade. We found outit took extensive researchthat the President. in his first 4 years. has actually spent $68.4 billion on cap and trade. and that was not authorized. So he can do a lot of it through regulation. but it is not going to pass. The reason it is not going to pass is. as we have stated. the cost would be extensive. And what would be accomplishedagain. going back to when I asked a question of the Administrator of the EPA. Lisa Jackson. in another hearingI said. if we were to pass any of the regulations. any of the legislation. the WaxmanMarkey legislation or any of the rest of them. would this reduce C02 emissions worldwide? She said: No. it would not. She said: Because the problem is not here in the United States. The problem is in China. in India. in Mexico. and other places. So you can carry that argument even further. If we were to do this in just the United States. if you were one of those who really believes that C02 emissions are causing all these problemswhich I do not agree withbut if you really believe that. it still would not reduce them. It would actually have the effect of increasing them because as we chase away our manufacturing basebecause we cannot generate the electricity to sustain itwhere do they go? They go to countries such as China and India and Mexico and other countries where they have little or no emissions regulations. So with that. while it sounded real good yesterday in his speech. and I do have a great deal of respect for the President and his persuasive abilities. I want people to realize. those who are out there recognizing that we can become independent in our energy development in this country. that they are not going to be able to pass capandtrade any more now than they have failed to do so in the last 10 years. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I came to the floor this afternoon to speak briefly about Hurricane Sandy and what the Senate and the House could and should be doing to help the survivors of this catastrophic disaster that occurred now over 3 months ago on the northeast coast. We from Louisiana are very familiar. unfortunately. with disasters. We have had quite a number over the past several years. Unfortunately. I have become an expert on disasters. I dont want to be. but I am becoming one as chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and as a leader from Louisiana. All of us. whether we are school board members. city council members. mayors. parish officials or Governors from Louisiana. are becoming experts on disasters because we are having a lot of them. So I came to the floor to say just a few things this afternoon about Hurricane Sandy. First. I wish to begin by saying the people of the Northeastand they dont need me to tell them thishave a wonderfully strong delegation in the Senate. Senators SCHUMER. GILLIBRAND. MENENDEZ. and LAUTENBERG. Of course. in Marylandthough we dont hear much about Maryland. there were one or two small counties that were terribly affected in Marylandand Senator CARDIN and Senator MIKULSKI have been. day in and day out. working with me and with many others. of course. trying to fashion a robust and smart response to the disaster on the East Coast. We want it to be smart because the taxpayers dont want to waste money on things that dont work. Of course. the survivors want it to be smart because they need us to do our best work now. We cant be late and sloppy and bureaucratic. They have churches to rebuild and faithbased organizations to get back up and running. There are schools and libraries and. most importantly. of course. their homes and their businesses. So this is very important work. It has been difficult because there are many different philosophies about how to tackle this. I have made my positions fairly clear on certain aspects such as offsets. et cetera. But today I wanted to come to the floor to just acknowledge the extraordinary work of the delegationled in large measure by Senator SCHUMEROf Members who have been absolutely rolling up their sleeves at every meeting and trying to build bipartisan support. which we have to do in the Senate. The House can sometimes get away with sending things over here with only the Republicans voting for it and no Democrats. but over here we cant get anything done unless it is done with all of us together. It is just a different set of rules in the Senate. so we have had to work very hard. Senators SCHUMER and GILLIBRAND and other Members worked very hard to get together the necessary votes to get that $60 billion out of here a couple weeks ago. The House. of course. unfortunately. stripped away some provisions but. happilyhappilythey left some of the best reforms we have been able to think of in the last 4 or 5 years in the bill. and that is what I wish to talk about today. I am a big believer in sending aid to the people in America who need it. We send a lot of aid overseas. and we will sure send a lot of aid when we rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq. but I am a real big believer in sending aid to our own taxpayers when their homes are flooded or tornadoes have taken out their area or fires have raged out of control or major storms have hit their area. I am a big believer that when people pay taxes all their lifemiddleclass families as well as the poor and the working poor. as well as the wealthy. who pay a lot of taxesthey deserve their government to respond when they are at a very dark moment. That is what is happening on the east coast. and these constituents and citizens of ours could not get this help. They need it more quickly. We are moving as fast as we cannot fast enough for this Senator. but hopefully we can get this vote and this bill to the Presidents desk. I know President Obama will be happy to sign this and is eager to sign it. I wish to also say thank you to President Obama for his strong support of a robust supplemental and to say how proud I am to have worked with his Cabinet. many of whom are involved in this recovery. and particularly the Secretary of HUD. who is probably one of the most able leaders. All the Cabinet members are very able. but the Secretary of HUD is particularly knowledgeable about rebuilding in a more coordinated fashion because he actually got to practice on us down in the gulf coast. We were kind of like the guinea pigs. Hopefully. we have worked out a lot of the problems and we can take all the best practices and lessons learned. But Shaun Donovan will do a great job leading that effort on the east coast. I have no doubt. with both a very strong Democratic Governor and a very strong Republican GovernorGovernor Christie and Governor Cuomo in that areaalong with Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Cory Booker and so many other smalltown officials involved in the recovery. They will have a great friend and a knowledgeable and reliable partner in Secretary of HUD Shaun Donovan. But let me go into just a few things we were able to redesign. thinking that our citizens and our constituents want government to be leaner. They want government. most importantly. to be smarter and more efficient. and I could not agree more. We have tried. at least in the disaster recoverywhen the response to Katrina and Rita was such a disaster itselfto reshape some of this and make it better and smarter. So we put some very effective and smartly designed programs into the Sandy supplemental. I want to begin by thanking my friend and colleague from the State of Mississippi. Senator COCHRAN. who joined me in introducing the Disaster Recovery Act in 2011 that contained many of these reforms. Our States have endured the same series of disasters and bureaucratic roadblocks to recovery over the past eight years. and we are determined to prevent communities in the northeast from experiencing the same inefficiency and waste. His contributions to the Gulf Coasts recovery and the development of this legislation have been tremendous. and I am grateful for his partnership in this endeavor. I also wish to thank my House colleagues. particularly Congressman SHUSTER. Congressman RAHALL. Congressman DENHAM. Delegate HOLMESNORTON. Congressman MICA. who is the outgoing chair of the committee over there and was so instrumental in helping to fashion some of this. Congresswoman SLAUGHTER. Congresswoman LOWEY. Congressman ALEXANDER and Congressman RICHMOND. In particular. CEDRIC RICHMOND. who is from Louisiana and a dear friend. along with Congressman ALEXANDER. from my home State. were very instrumental in helping their colleaguesone is a Republican. one is a Democratkind of understand why it is important to have these reforms stay in the bill. and they were successful. I am very grateful to them for that. One of the things from the several lists of things that were in this billand that I want to put into the RECORDI will just go over and highlight briefly. No. 1. in the Sandy supplemental. it will reauthorize two expired pilot programs from the postKatrina Emergency Management Reform Act that allowed FEMA to repair rental units as a costeffective temporary housing alternative to trailers and mobile homes and to utilize expedited debris removal procedures. This might not seem very interesting to people. unless you and your family are looking at living in an 8by16 or 8by24 trailer for the next 6 months. Then you are very interested. In the old days. when Katrina happened. all people were given were trailers and. in some instances. with formaldehyde in them. which made for a lovely and very healthy way to live for 6 months. We dont want to go over the nightmares of what happened after Katrina and Rita. but we decided we had to give our citizens some other options besides trailers. So if something would happen in Massachusetts. Madam President. your Governor and your local officials could come together and maybe be a little bit creative in thinking about some rental repairs. where maybe people could move into some of the blighted properties. That would also help with the blight. Instead of spending $120.000 per trailer. maybe we could do a little investing in some blight reduction and. at the same time. giving people a temporary place to live. So that is smart. I think taxpayers appreciate it when we try to spend their money in a wiser. builttolast kind of way. That is what the Sandy supplemental allows. It also allows the State to draw down a portion of its hazard mitigation funds from FEMA in order to leverage mitigation opportunities earlier in the reconstruction process. In the old days. it would take 18 to 36 months for funding to become available. in some instances. to rebuild a school. That is too long. Can you imagine a community going 3 years without even getting their school started? I realize sometimes it takes a long time to build things. but you dont want to wait 3 years before you start. So the way we do it now. without spending any more money. is just allowing the Federal Government to push out some of the front money to the locals so they can get started on mitigation projects much sooner. So that is a very smart reform that is included. In addition. we also provide grants on the basis of reliable fixed estimates for rebuilding damaged infrastructure and facilities and expedited removal of storm debris. This approach will be faster. cheaper. and more effective. The Public assistance program as currently designed may be one of the most dysfunctional programs in the entire Federal Government and will not work for this disaster. Under the current approach. initial damage estimates are often incomplete. Projects must be reversioned multiple times. Decisions are often not made in writing. Frequent staff turnover leads to decision reversals. Hundreds of meetings result in incalculable administrative waste. And it can take years for even a small project to be completed. And let me just put this in English. What this means is in the old days when Katrina hitand people are not going to believe it when I say this. but it is true. and I will put this in the RECORD so people can go find it. But in the old days we would have to take measurements and pictures of a tree to determine how wide the branch was because if it was more than 3 inches you got reimbursed. and if it was less than that you didnt. We would have to go take pictures of trees where the debris came down to try to get the paperwork necessary for the reimbursement. Those days are hopefully over with. We will now do kind of an estimate just like any normal. rational person would do. You know from past storms how much debris is usually there. You could sort of measure that. There are waysnot just subjective but objective. like geospatial modeling. without having to take pictures of limbs on trees and measure them individuallywhich is a complete waste of time and wholly irrational and. of course. survivors who are standing there without a house are wondering why government officials are going around taking pictures of shrubs. So we need to move past that. Hopefully. we will with some of this legislation. No. 4 codifies temporary legislative measures that were enacted to facilitate smarter recovery. including thirdparty arbitration. eliminating penalties on alternate projects. and consolidating facilities into a single project. This was my most important thing. and I would like to take a minute to explain it to everyone. A while after Katrina. which was a nightmare. I kept wondering why these project worksheets were never getting settled. We would send thousands of these worksheets to the Federal Government and say: This was our library. We estimate it will cost $5 million to rebuild it. The Federal Government would say: No. we think it is $2.5 million. That is all we owe you. So I said: I can understand there could be a disagreement. Who resolves it? No one. What do you mean. no one? No one. It just keeps going around and around. and we just keep sending paper back. I said: Is there any timeline for the resolution? No. I said: Is there any thirdparty arbitrator? No. So we put in a thirdparty arbitrator so that if a project is disagreed to by the locals about what was there. what it looked like. how they should rebuild it. we now have a rational way to step in and get a decision. and it is nonnegotiable. You cant appeal it. But it is better than not having a decision. The local governments really support this. and I am happy we could get that done. In additionthis was one of my favoriteseveryone would run around giving press conferences about how we were going to build smarter and stronger and better. et cetera. Except when we looked into the law and actually read the law. it was illegal. If you tried to move a police station like 10 feet to get it out of the way of the river. or the land had sunk and you wanted to move it to higher ground. you would actually be penalized 25 percent because it became an alternate project since it wasnt exactly the same. So I said: We dont want to build the exact same thing. That was the problem to begin with. Some of our buildings were in places they shouldnt have been. Some of our buildings were built with materials we should never have used. So why are we having to rebuild the same old thing? Well. that was because that was what the law said. I said: Well. the law needs to be changed. and we are changing it. So I hope people. while they fuss at governmentand I know we have a lot to do to get things straightknow a lot of thought has gone into some of these reforms. and they are based on reallife experiences on what communities have gone through. Hopefully. the Northeast will benefit from this as we go forward. Let me just put a few more things in the RECORD. No. 5 allows families to use FEMA individual assistance for childcare expenses. Here is another thing we found. We do depend on individual citizens to rebuild their communities. Trust me. The Federal Government may send a lot of money. but they didnt gut houses. Do you know who gutted houses? The churches helped. the volunteers helped. and seniors. Many veterans who had fought the war in the \"greatest generation.\" they. at 80 years old. put on gloves and overalls and gutted their own houses. I mean take your house down to the studs. It is a hard thing to do. Not only is it physically hard. it is emotionally devastating. The Federal Government did not come in and gut peoples houses. We had to gut our houses by ourselves. After we sorted our debris by EPA requirements and dragged it out to the sidewalk and made sure it didnt touch a part of the lawnbecause if it did. they couldnt pick it up because they cant go on private property to pick up debris. It is a nightmare. But this is going to be alleviated because parents and grandparents need to get back to gut their homes. They have to have a place for their kids to go that is safe. You cant have children running around in dangerous places. So people arent thinking about this in a recovery. but schools have to be up and running. and you really should be able to use some of this money for daycare so the parents can work. Some of them quit their jobs to rebuild their homes. They lived off their savings and they went back to work. It is a tough situation. But I am happy. and I want to thank Mark Shriver. Save the Children. and the National Commission on Children and Disasters who led this initiative trying to help us focus on the storms of the future. what we could do better to help children to make sure their needs are cared for. We think about adults. but. of course. most of these families have kids. sometimes young children. So we have done a little bit. I wish we could have done more. but we negotiated the best we could. and at least we got the childcare provision in. It reduces bureaucratic waste by eliminating duplicative agency reviews for the same project and the same set of laws governing environmental. historic preservation. and benefitcost requirements. It also helps the environment by incentivizing recycling of debris. So if we can find a way to recycle it. then people get paid a little bit more as opposed to just throwing it in the landfills. We think that will be a good opportunity to try to promote some good technologies for recycling. Andthis is very importantit also corrects a gap in current law that prohibited tribal governments from requesting Federal assistance. They were completely prohibited under the former law. Really. as a matter of fair policy and the Federal law. tribes should be able to request some assistance as well. and that was corrected in this piece of legislation. It also. finally. eliminates a perverse incentive in the law to use highpriced contract labor for emergency work instead of local government employees. such as firefighters and police officers. which should save the Federal Government millions of dollars. In closing. I want to thank all of the different organizations that helped to pass this: the U.S. Conference of Mayors. the National League of Cities. the National Association of County Organizations. International Association of Emergency Managers. International Association of Firefighters. International Association of Fire Chiefs. and the Association of State Floodplain Managers. This is not a subject that is always fun to talk about because when you are talking about it. it is a lot of suffering that is going on. whether it is Joplin. MO. or Gulfport. MS. or New Orleans. LA. or New York. NY. or the boardwalk in New Jersey. And many of those notsosmall beach communities are very highly populated. There is a lot of suffering. But it is important for us to try. when we can. when we see that the response is not what it should be. to take the time to push out some reforms. to fix what we can fix so that the $60 billion that I hope we will send to them can be used smartly. quickly. and efficiently. I am living proof of a Senator who has had to literally help lead the rebuilding of the gulf coast. along with my friends from Texas. Mississippi. Alabama. and Florida. My hometown is New Orleans. My brother is now the mayor. and he is rebuilding that city every day. Eighty percent of the residential communities on the east bank were destroyed completely. That would be like 80 percent of the District of Columbia but not Anacostia. but 80 percentwhich would be the whole other side of DC on this side of the riverbeing uninhabitable. It is hard for people to get their head around that scale. I think Massachusetts has experienced some of these storms. But the scale and scope of the loss is just hard to get your head around. Even though it is not on the 5 oclock news or the 6 oclock news or 10 oclock news or now 24hour news. it is still happening. So this money and these reforms are important. So I hope the Senate will act quickly this week. We may have to take up a few amendments from the minority. We have already had the debate about offsets. and we have decided that in the middle of the battle we dont have to argue about who is going to pay for the bullets. We need to go ahead and send the money. and we will figure out how to pay for it later. We are going to pay for it. It is not a question of whether it is going to be repaid. It will be paid for. We should not be arguing about that while the water is rising or while people are gutting their homes or worshiping in tents along the beach. They need their churches back. they need their communities back. and we need to send them money and the smarter tools to help them with the recovery. So I again thank so many colleagues for helping with this. particularly Senator Lieberman and Senator COLLINS. who led a lot of these efforts through their leadership of the Homeland Security Committee and spent a significant amount of time along with their staff reviewing and helping to improve this legislation. as well as my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee on Homeland Security.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I deeply miss my friend Danny Inouye. Danny Inouyes passing leaves a huge void in the Senate and for me personally. as I have lost a dear friend. and now being the sole U.S. Senator to have served in World War II is a lonesome postespecially after losing the presence of a Medal of Honor winner. Danny was not only a great Senator for his constituents. but also the most popular among his Senate colleagues. He exemplified what it means to serve and represented the very best qualities of our country. Whether in the Army or as Hawaiis representative in Washington since the States birth. he worked tirelessly to do right by every Hawaiian and every American. Danny volunteered to serve in the Armys 442nd Regimental Combat Team. which was almost entirely made up of Nisei. or people of Japanese descent born in the United States. Although its members faced discrimination at home and many of their families were in internment camps. the 442nd is widely acknowledged as the most decorated infantry unit in the history of the U.S. Army. All of us who served admired the courage and heroism Danny displayed on the battlefield especially in San Terenzo. Italy when 4 days before the wars end. he lost his arm in battle. earning a Purple Heart. When Danny first joined the Senate in 1962. World War II veterans were common in our chamber and. over the past five decades. the Senators who served in World War II have shared a bond that overcame partisan politics. But I am now the last of that group and I will continue to look to Dannys example to bring colleagues together to do what is right for all Americans. Danny and I partnered together time and time again on the Appropriations Committee to write legislation that has made America safer and healthier for our families. I will always be especially thankful for his help in crafting relief bills for New Jersey in our times of need after Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy. In fact. his last piece of legislation in the Senate was one to provide relief to those affected by Sandy. But perhaps Dannys defining quality was thisin a time and profession that increasingly rewards grandstanding and grasping for the spotlight. Danny served with intelligence. grace and humility. And while he was always a humble and quiet leader. when Danny spoke other Senators listened closely and took his words to heart. His voice never wavered when it came to advocating for an America that leaves no one behind. He was a giant in the Senate. and we will never forget the legacy he leaves behind. As the last World War II veteran in the Senate. I promise to always do whatever I can to uphold his commitment to service and love of country.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to join my colleagues in remembering our friend and colleague Senator Daniel Inouye. Dan Inouye dedicated his life to Hawaii and represented Hawaii from when it achieved statehood until his death. Senator Inouye was respected and loved by members of both parties and both chambers. He was the last Senator to serve with both Everett Dirksen and Richard Russell. Senator Inouye learned early the importance of doing something for the good of the Nation and the good of the Senate. as well as the importance of personal relationships and trust among colleagues. For Dan Inouye. his word was his bond and that applied to Democrats and Republicans alike. He became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. the Senate President ProTempore. was the second longest serving Senator in history and served on special committees investigating the Watergate and Iran Contra scandals. At the time of his death. he had long become a Senate giant in his own right. Long before reaching the Senate. Dan Inouye was an American hero. Enlisting in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. he served in Europe earning a Bronze Star. Purple Heart and Distinguished Service Cross for helping his fellow soldiers while suffering terrible injuries. Later in life. President Clinton would confer upon him the Medal of Honor. His moral character and life experiences made Senator Inouye a leader on many of the pressing issues of the day from civil rights to veterans benefits and from health care to helping people with disabilities. Through his position on the Appropriations Committee. Senator Inouye was able to direct funding to important projects and research that helped bring about important advancements as well as simply help people. Dan Inouye was also a strong supporter of Israel and the Jewish community. From his advocacy on behalf of Holocaust survivors. to his efforts to help free Jews from the former Soviet Union to his influential role in securing funding for Israel. Senator Inouye was a tireless friend and advocate. He was given the nickname \"Trumpeldor\" after a Zionist hero. Joseph Trumpeldor. In closing. I am reminded of a quote used to eulogize Daniel Webster that President Nixon used when eulogizing Everett Dirksen. \"Our great men are the common property of the country.\" Senator Inouye was indeed a great man and our country is better off today for his commitment. his conscience and his years of dedicated service.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to once again join with Senator GRASSLEY and today introduce the Criminal Antitrust AntiRetaliation Act. This legislation. which is identical to our legislation from last Congress. will provide important protections to employees who come forward and disclose to law enforcement price fixing and other criminal antitrust behavior that harm consumers. This legislation is a continuation of the long partnership that I have had with Senator GRASSLEY on whistleblower issues. Congress should encourage employees with information about criminal antitrust activity. such as price fixing. to report that information by offering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle rather than leaving them vulnerable to reprisals. Throughout our history. whistleblowers have been instrumental in alerting the public. Congress. and law enforcement to wrongdoing in a variety of areas. These individuals take risks in stepping forward. and many times their actions result in important reforms and have even saved lives. The legislation we are introducing today is based on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office. which interviewed key stakeholders in the antitrust community and found widespread support for antiretaliatory protection in criminal antitrust cases. The provisions in this bill are modeled on the whistleblower protections that Senator GRASSLEY and I authored as part of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. and are narrowly tailored to ensure that whistleblowers are not provided with an economic incentive to bring forth false claims. The antitrust laws protect consumers and serve to promote our free enterprise system. Our bipartisan bill will help to ensure that criminal violations of these laws do not go unreported. I urge the Senate to act quickly to pass this important legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on the first day for bill introductions this year I once again join with Senator CRAPO and a distinguished. bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. This lifesaving legislation should be a top priority of the new 113th Congress. It is our hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this strong. bipartisan bill to help all victims of domestic and sexual violence. The Senate acted just 9 months ago to approve the LeahyCrapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012 with 68 bipartisan votes. Despite our best efforts. the House did not join in our bipartisan efforts and enact that bill into law. By now. the litany of VAWAs successes is familiar. but important. Since this historic legislation first passed in 1994. States have strengthened criminal rape statutes. and every State has made stalking a crime. The annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped more than 50 percent. We have helped to provide victims with critical services like housing and legal protection. Those are just a few highlights. We need to remember that behind those numbers are thousands of lives made immeasurably better. Despite VAWAs success. there is a pressing need to update and strengthen its protections. The Center for Disease Control and Preventions 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that one in four women has been the victim of severe physical domestic violence and one in five women has been raped in her lifetime. These numbers are almost too awful to contemplate. Real life cases remind us that this reauthorization is long overdue. Last month. I read in the Burlington Free Press the story of Carmen Tarleton. a woman from Thetford. VT. Five years ago. Carmens estranged husband broke into her home. beat her with a baseball bat. and poured industrialstrength lye on her. severely burning a great deal of her body and nearly blinding her. Her doctors said that she had suffered \"the most horrific injury a human being could suffer.\" Today. she is nearly blind. disfigured. and continues to experience pain from her injuries. Despite this. Carmen is courageously sharing her story. Stories like this one remind us that every day that we do not pass legislation that will help to prevent horrific violence and assist victims. more people are suffering. Late last year while Congress failed to act on our bipartisan bill. we saw tragic domestic violencerelated murdersuicides in Missouri and Colorado. We also learned of harrowing new accounts of sexual assaults on college campuses. These are just more examples of the kind of tragedies that unfold every day across the country. The LeahyCrapo bill would support the use of techniques proven to help identify highrisk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. It would increase VAWAs focus on sexual assault and push colleges to strengthen their efforts to protect students from domestic and sexual violence. This reauthorization will allow us to make real progress in addressing the horrifying epidemic of domestic violence in tribal communities. where one recent study found that almost three in five native women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. It will allow services to get to those in the LGBT community who have had trouble accessing services in the past. Every VAWA reauthorization Congress has passed has taken steps to help immigrant victims of violence. who are often particularly vulnerable. Last years bill included a modest increase in the number of U visas available to immigrant victims who help law enforcement. which is good for victims and for law enforcement. Unfortunately. that provision led to a technical objection from House Republican leaders. In the interest of making quick and decisive progress. we introduce the bill today without that provision in order to remove any excuse for House inaction. We have retained other important improvements for immigrant victims in the bill we introduce today as part of our commitment to ensuring that all victims are protected. I still believe strongly in the U visa increase that was in last years LeahyCrapo bill. I authored that provision after hearing from law enforcement and the experts in the field. I think it is needed to encourage assistance to law enforcement and to protect immigrant women and I remain committed to enacting it and ensuring that the needed U visa increase is adopted. I intend to work to include it in comprehensive immigration reform legislation that we should consider early in this Congress. It will be part of our immigration reform effort. We have included. as well. in this years bill the specific provisions of the SAFER bill that I worked out with Senator CORNYN and Senator GRASSLEY last year and that then passed the Senate unanimously late in the session. I hope that Senators who opposed VAWA last year while supporting those provisions will now join with us in our effort to enact VAWA reauthorization that includes those provisions. as well. All of the provisions in our bill were developed with the help of victims and with those who assist them every day. They are common sense measures that will help real people. It is past time for Congress to move beyond partisan politics in order to provide help to victims of domestic and sexual violence. We can make these concrete and important changes in the law that will prevent terrible violence and provide more help to victims. There is no excuse for delay. I hope all Senators will join me in quickly moving this bill through the Senate and that the House will quickly work with us to get a strong VAWA bill to the President. I thank Senator CRAPO. the lead Senate Republican cosponsor of our bill and Senators MURKOWSKI. MIKULSKI.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation directed at combating the practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking in firearms. I thank the law enforcement partners who have contributed ideas and Senator DURBIN for joining me in this effort. I hope that as Senators become familiar with the proposal. they will see it as a focused approach to provide law enforcement officials with the tools they need to go after those who engage in the illegal trafficking. This commonsense measure deserves the bipartisan support that will be critical to any effort in the Senate to reduce gun violence in America. I have heard again and again from Senators on both sides of the aisle that keeping guns away from those who should not have them is a goal worth pursuing. This bill will further that effort. When the President spoke last week about the need for legislative action in the wake of the horrific events at Sandy Hook Elementary School. strengthening our law enforcement efforts against illegal gun trafficking was one of the key issues he proposed. This bill will answer that call to action. Next week. the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold the first hearing of the 113th Congress on the issue of gun violence. I expect that part of that discussion will include examining various legislative proposals Senators have put forward. We need to move beyond platitudes and toward solutions. It is my hope that as the Committee proceeds we can find areas of common ground. There is now broad recognition that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right to own a firearm. and that self protection is an essential part of that right. To the extent there used to be a backdrop of uncertainty about the meaning of the Second Amendment. that time is past. I have long believed that the right to bear arms for protection is a fundamental right. The Supreme Court has now confirmed the individual right guaranteed by the Second Amendment. That is no longer questioned. So we can proceed now in this discussion with certainty that Americans constitutional rights will be preserved while we seek solutions to prevent gun violence. There is broad agreement that keeping guns away from those suffering from mental illness and criminals is the right thing to do. I am a responsible gun owner. I know that other responsible gun owners will support better enforcement of the laws that exist to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. We cannot allow those who are barred from buying guns to circumvent our laws. That is just common sense. Law enforcement officials have complained for years that they lack the legal tools necessary to effectively combat illegal firearms trafficking. Congressional inquiry during the last Congress should have put a spotlight on the very difficult legal environment within which law enforcement officials currently operate. In fact. one of the whistleblowers who testified about the misguided tactics used by Federal law enforcement in firearms trafficking investigations in Arizona described the current laws as \"toothless\". If we are to address gun violence. we must respond to this clear vulnerability. The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act will make important changes to Federal firearms statutes to give law enforcement officials the tools they need to investigate and prosecute the alltoocommon practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. This practice typically involves a person who is not prohibited by Federal law purchasing a firearm on behalf of a prohibited person. or at the direction of a drug trafficking or other criminal organization. It is a problem that must be addressed. It not only results in the support of larger criminal organizations. but also in the proliferation of illegal firearms and gun violence in our communities. It puts both law enforcement officials and law abiding firearms dealers in a very difficult position but more importantly. this makes our citizens and communities less safe. Under current law. there is no specific statute that makes it illegal to act as a straw purchaser of firearms. Nor is there a law directly on point to address the illegal trafficking of firearms. As a result. prosecutors must cobble together charges against a straw purchaser using socalled \"paperwork\" violations such as lying on a Federal form. These laws are imperfect. and do not give prosecutors the leverage needed to encourage straw buyers. often the lowest rungs on a ladder in a criminal enterprise. to provide the information needed for investigators and prosecutors to go after those directing and profiting from such activity. The bill I introduce today will add a new provision to our Federal criminal code to specifically prohibit serving as a straw purchaser of firearms. and establishes tough penalties for those who purchase firearms for. on behalf of. or with the intent to transfer the firearms to someone prohibited from making that purchase directly. Under current law. it is a crime to transfer a firearm to another with the knowledge that the firearm will be used in criminal activity. This bill would strengthen this existing law by prohibiting such a transfer where the transferor has \"reasonable cause to believe\" that the firearm will be used in relation to criminal activity. The bill does contain important exemptions from the prohibition. namely. the transfer of a firearm as a gift. or in relation to a legitimate raffle. auction or contest. This bill will complement existing law that makes it a crime to smuggle firearms into the United States by specifically prohibiting the smuggling of firearms out of the United States. The provisions laid out in this legislation are focused. commonsense remedies to the very real problem of firearms trafficking and straw purchasing. The bill does not affect Federal firearms licensees. and in no way alters their rights and responsibilities as sellers of a lawful commodity. As the Senate seeks a way forward to find national solutions to reduce gun violence. I hope Senators from across the political spectrum can work together to find common ground. We have a responsibility and a duty to refine our laws consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. a Senator. a Vermonter. an American. a father and a grandfather. I am prepared to hear all ideas. listen to all views. and work with Senators from both sides of the aisle. The bill I introduce today is the first of several proposals I expect to support to reduce gun violence. I look forward to discussing it further with fellow Senators and witnesses at the upcoming hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Mr. Vice President. Members of Congress. all who are present. and to all who are watching. welcome to the Capitol and to this celebration of our great democracy. This is the 57th inauguration of an American President. and no matter how many times one witnesses this event. its simplicity. its innate majesty. and most of all its meaning. that sacred. yet cautious. entrusting of power from we. the people. to our chosen leader. never fails to make ones heart beat faster as it will today with the inauguration of President Barack H. Obama. We know we would not be here today were it not for those who stand guard around the world to preserve our freedom. To those in our Armed Forces. we offer our infinite thanks for your bravery. your honor. your sacrifice. This democracy of ours was forged by intellect and argument. by activism and blood. and above all. from John Adams to Elizabeth Cady Stanton. to Martin Luther King. Jr.. by a stubborn adherence to the notion that we are all created equal and deserve nothing less than a great Republic worthy of our consent. The theme of this years inaugural is \"Faith in Americas Future.\" The perfect embodiment of this unshakable confidence and the ongoing success of our collective journey is an event from our past. I speak of the improbable completion of the Capitol dome and capping it with the Statue of Freedom which occurred 150 years ago in 1863. When Abraham Lincoln took office 2 years earlier. the dome above us was a halfbuilt eyesore. The conventional wisdom was it should be left unfinished until the war ended. given the travails and financial needs of the times. But to President Lincoln. the halffinished dome symbolized the halfdivided Nation. Lincoln said: If people see the Capitol going on. it is a sign we intend the Union shall go on. So despite the conflict which engulfed the Nation and surrounded the city. the dome continued to rise. On December 2. 1863. the Statue of Freedom. a woman. was placed atop the dome. where she still stands. In a sublime irony. it was a former slave. now free American. Philip Reid. who helped to cast the bronze statue. Our present times are not as perilous or despairing as they were in 1863. but in 2013 far too many doubt the future of this great Nation and our ability to tackle our own eras halffinished domes. Todays problems are intractable. they say. the times are so complex. the differences in the country and the world so deep we will never overcome them. When thoughts such as these produce anxiety. fear. and even despair. we do well to remember Americans have always been. and still are. a practical. optimistic. problemsolving people. that. as our history shows. no matter how steep the climb. how difficult the problems. how halffinished the task. America always rises to the occasion. America prevails and America prospers. Those who bet against this country have inevitably been on the wrong side of history. So it is a good moment to gaze upward and behold the Statue of Freedom at the top of the Capitol dome. It is a good moment to gain strength and courage and humility from those who were determined to complete the halffinished dome. It is a good moment to rejoice at this 57th Presidential inaugural ceremony. and it is the perfect moment to renew our collective faith in the future of America. Thank you and God bless these United States. In that spirit of faith. I would now like to introduce civil rights leader Myrlie Evers. who has committed her life to extending the promise of our Nations founding principles to all Americans. Mrs. Evers will lead us in the invocation.",

    "speech": "America. we are here. our Nations Capitol. on this day. January the 21st. 2013. the inauguration of our 45th President. Barack Obama. We come at this time to ask blessings upon our leaders. the President. Vice President. Members of Congress. all elected and appointed officials of the United States of America. We are here to ask blessings upon our Armed Forces. blessings upon all who contribute to the essence of the American spirit. the American dream. the opportunity to become whatever our mankind. womankind allows us to be. This is the promise of America. As we sing the words of belief. \"This is my country.\" let us act upon the meaning everyone is included. May the inherent dignity and inalienable rights of every woman. man. boy. and girl be honored. May all Your people. especially the least of these. flourish in our blessed Nation. One hundred fifty years after the Emancipation Proclamation and 50 years after the march on Washington. we celebrate the spirit of our ancestors which has allowed us to move from a nation of unborn hopes and a history of disenfranchised votes to todays expression of a more perfect Union. We ask. too. Almighty. that where our paths seem blanketed by throngs of oppression and rippled by pangs of despair. we ask for Your guidance toward the light of deliverance. and with the vision of those who came before us and dreamed of this day. that we recognize their visions still inspire us. They are a great cloud of witnesses unseen by the naked eye but all around us thankful that their living was not in vain. For every mountain You gave us the strength to climb. Your grace is pleaded to continue that climb for America and the world. We now stand beneath the shadow of the Nations Capitol whose golden dome reflects the unity and democracy of one Nation. indivisible. with liberty and justice for all. Approximately 4 miles from where we are assembled. the hallowed remains of men and women rest in Arlington Cemetery. they who believed. fought. and died for this country. May their spirit infuse our being to work together with respect. enabling us to continue to build this Nation. and in so doing we send a message to the world that we are strong. fierce in our strength. and ever vigilant in our pursuit of freedom. We ask that You grant our President the will to act courageously but cautiously when confronted with danger and to act prudently but deliberately when challenged by adversity. Please continue to vest his efforts. to lead by example in consideration and favor of the diversity of our people. Bless our families all across this Nation. We thank You for this opportunity of prayer to strengthen us for the journey through the days that lie ahead. We invoke the prayers of our grandmothers who taught us to pray: God make me a blessing. Let their spirit guide us as we claim the spirit of old. There is something within me that holds the reins. There is something within me that banishes pain. There is something within me I cannot explain. But all I know. America. there is something within there is something within. In Jesuss name and the name of all who are holy and right. we pray. Amen.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Mr. Vice President. ladies and gentlemen. the late Alex Haley. author of \"Roots.\" lived his life by these six words: \"Find the good and praise it.\" Today we praise the American tradition of transferring or reaffirming immense power in the inauguration of the President of the United States. We do this in a peaceful. orderly way. There is no mob. no coup. no insurrection. This is a moment when millions stop and watch. a moment most of us always will remember. It is a moment that is our most conspicuous and enduring symbol of the American democracy. How remarkable that this has survived for so long in such a complex country. when so much power is at stake. this freedom to vote for our leaders and the restraint to respect the results. Last year. at Mount Vernon. a tour guide told me our first President. George Washington. once posed this question: What is most important of this grand experiment. the United States? Then Washington answered his own question in this way: Not the election of the first President but the election of its second President. The peaceful transfer of power is what will separate our country from every other country in the world. Today we celebrate the 57th inauguration of the American President: Find the good and praise it. It is my honor to introduce Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor for the purpose of administering the oath of office to the Vice President. Will everyone please stand. Associate Justice SONIA SOTOMAYOR administered to the Vice Presidentelect the oath of office prescribed by the Constitution. which he repeated. as follows: I. JOSEPH R.

    "speech": "Thank you. Thank you so much. Vice President BIDEN. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the U.S. Congress. distinguished guests. and fellow citizens. each time we gather to inaugurate a President. we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. We affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this Nation together are not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. What makes us exceptional what makes us American is our allegiance to an idea. articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. that among these are Life. Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Today we continue a neverending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. for history tells us that while these truths may be selfevident. they have never been selfexecuting. that while freedom is a gift from God. it must be secured by His people here on Earth. The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a republic. a government of and by and for the people. entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. For more than 200 years. we have. Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword. we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free. We made ourselves anew and vowed to move forward together. Together. we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce. schools and colleges to train our workers. Together. we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play. Together. we resolve that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from lifes worst hazards and misfortunes. Through it all. we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority. nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all societys ills can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of initiative and enterprise. our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility. these are constants in our character. We have always understood that when times change. so must we. that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges. that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. for the American people can no more meet the demands of todays world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. No single person can train all the math and science teachers we will need to equip our children for the future or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs to our shores. Now. more than ever. we must do these things together as one Nation and one people. This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. Americas possibilities are limitless. for we possess all the qualities this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive. diversity and openness. an endless capacity for risk. and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans. we are made for this moment. and we will seize it so long as we seize it together. For we. the People. understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe Americas prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work. when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else because she is an American. she is free. and she is equal. not just in the eyes of God but also in our own. We understand outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. We must harness new ideas in technology to remake our government. revamp our Tax Code. reform our schools. and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder. learn more. and reach higher. But while the means will change. our purpose endures. A nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. that is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed. We. the people. still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past. when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe. in this country. freedom is reserved for the lucky or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives. any one of us. at any time. may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other. through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. these things do not sap our Nation. they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers. they free us to take the risks that make this country great. We. the people. still believe our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change. knowing the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science. but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms. The path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. but America cannot resist this transition. we must lead it. We cannot cede to other Nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries. we must claim its promise. That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure. our forests and waterways. our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet. commanded to our care by God. That is what will lend meaning to the creed our Fathers once declared. We. the people. still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform. tempered by the flames of battle. are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens. seared by the memory of those we have lost. know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war. who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends. and we must carry those lessons into this time as well. We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other Nations peacefully. not because we are naive about the dangers we face but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe. and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful Nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa. from the Americas to the Middle East. because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. We must be a source of hope to the poor. the sick. the marginalized. the victims of prejudice. not out of mere charity but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity. human dignity and justice. We. the people. declare today that the most evident of truths. that all of us are created equal. is the star that guides us still. just as it guided our forebears through Sen eca Falls and Selma and Stonewall. just as it guided all those men and women. sung and unsung. who left footprints along this great Mall to hear a preacher say we cannot walk alone. to hear a \"King\" proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth. It is now our generations task to carry on what those pioneers began. for our journey is not complete until our wives. our mothers. and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law. for if we are truly created equal. then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving. hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity. until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children. from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia. to the quiet lanes of Newtown. know they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. That is our generations task to make these words. these rights. these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centurieslong debates about the role of government for all time. but it does require us to act in our time. For now decisions are upon us. and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat namecalling as reasoned debate. We must act. knowing our work will be imperfect. We must act. knowing todays victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. My fellow Americans. the oath I have sworn before you today. similar to the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol. was an oath to God and country. not party or faction. and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service. But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride. They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope. You and I. as citizens. have the power to set this countrys course. You and I. as citizens. have the obligation to shape the debates of our time. not only with the votes we cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals. Let each of us now embrace. with solemn duty and awesome joy. what is our lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose. with passion and dedication. let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom. Thank you. God bless you. and may He forever bless these United States of America.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Mr. Vice President. America. \"One Today.\" One sun rose on us today. kindled over our shores. peeking over the Smokies. greeting the faces of the Great Lakes. spreading a simple truth across the Great Plains. then charging across the Rockies. One light. waking up rooftops. under each one. a story told by our silent gestures moving across windows. My face. your face. millions of faces in mornings mirrors. each one yawning to life. crescendoing into our day: pencilyellow school buses. the rhythm of traffic lights. fruit stands: apples. limes. and oranges arrayed like rainbows begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper bricks or milk. teeming over highways alongside us. on our way to clean tables. read ledgers. or save lives to teach geometry. or ring up groceries as my mother did for twenty years. so I could write this poem for all of us today. All of us as vital as the one light we move through. the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day: equations to solve. history to question. or atoms imagined. the \"I have a dream\" we all keep dreaming or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that wont explain the empty desks of twenty children marked absent today. and forever. Many prayers. but one light breathing color into stained glass windows. life into the faces of bronzed statues. warmth onto the steps of our museums and park benches as mothers watch children slide into the day. One ground. Our ground. rooting us to every stock of corn. every head of wheat sown by sweat and hands. hands gleaning coal or planting windmills in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm. hands digging trenches. routing pipes and cables. hands as worn as my fathers cutting sugarcane so my brother and I could have books and shoes. The dust of farms and deserts. cities and plains mingled by one wind our breath. Breathe. Hear it through the days gorgeous din of honking cabs. buses launching down avenues. the symphony of footsteps. guitars. and screeching subways. the unexpected song bird on your clothes line. Hear: squeaky playground swings. trains whistling. or whispers across cafe tables. Hear: the doors we open each day for each other. saying. hello. shalom. buon giorno. howdy. namaste. or buenos dias in the language my mother taught me in every language spoken into one wind carrying our lives without prejudice. as these words break from my lips. One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed their majesty. and the Mississippi and Colorado worked their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands: weaving steel into bridges. finishing one more report for the boss on time. stitching another wound or uniform. the first brushstroke on a portrait. or the last floor on the Freedom Tower jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience. One sky: toward which we sometimes lift our eyes tired from work. some days guessing at the weather of our lives. some days giving thanks for a love that loves you back. sometimes praising a mother who knew how to give. or forgiving a father who couldnt give what you wanted. We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight of snow. or the plum plush of dusk. but always home. always under one sky. our sky. And always one moon like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop and every window. of one countryall of us facing the stars. Hope a new constellation waiting for us to map it. waiting for us to name it together.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Amsoil World Championship Snowmobile Derby on Sunday. January 20. 2013. in Eagle River. Wisconsin. Fifty years ago. the sport of snowmobiling had just begun. Today. the sport has a national economic impact of $24 billion with an additional international economic impact of $13 billion. Over 100.000 fulltime jobs in North America are generated by the snowmobile industry. These American jobs include jobs in manufacturing. sales. and tourismrelated services. I am proud to have a snowmobile manufacturer with facilities located in Wisconsins Seventh Congressional District. Polaris Industries. Inc. manufactures and distributes quality snowmobiles. among other highperformance motorized products. This employee owned company is just one example of the positive impacts the snowmobile industry has on our economy. The history of snowmobiling started in Vilas County. 40 years before the very first snowmobile race took place. In fact. Carl Eliason of Sayner. Wisconsin. invented the first snowmobile. which was a snow toboggan. with skis and a track to drive the machine over the snow. By 1964. John and Betty Alward in Eagle River. along with Walter Goldsworthy of nearby Three Lakes. WI. gave the winter economy a boost with the sport of snowmobile racing. The initial news release called this the \"Worlds First Snowmobile Derby.\" which at the time. was an entirely new concept in winter sports celebrations. Between 2.000 and 3.000 people attended that event in 1964. Today. the World Championship attracts over 30.000. I am thankful for those who envisioned the snowmobile derby and for those who have made this event an incredible success. Snowmobiling is an important part of Wisconsins heritage and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending my congratulations on the 50th Anniversary of the Amsoil World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River.

I rise today to join with the people of Azerbaijan to commemorate the tragic events of \"Black January.\" On January 19. 1990. approximately 26.000 Soviet troops stormed Azerbaijans capital city of Baku in tanks and armored vehicles. That night. the Soviet military opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful demonstrators. including women and children. As a result of these merciless acts 131 people were killed. 611 were injured. 841 were arrested. and 5 went missing. The Human Rights Watch report \"Black January in Azerbaijan\" states that \"among the most heinous violations of human rights during the Baku incursion were the numerous attacks on medical personnel. ambulances. and even hospitals.\" The report concludes that the violence used by the Soviet Army constituted an exercise in collective punishment and that the punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists. not only in Azerbaijan. but in other Republics of the Soviet Union. Far from crushing the spirit of Azeris. the atrocities of Black January instead consolidated the rising independence movements in the country and united the Azerbaijani nation in its quest for freedom. After 23 years Azerbaijan represents a flourishing country where democratic aspirations of Azerbaijani people have been materialized as they continue diplomatic relations with the United States. It is my honor to thank the Azerbaijani people for their friendship and to offer my thoughts and prayers to the families of those who gave their lives for the independence of Azerbaijan. I encourage my colleagues to visit the very moving memorial to Black January in Baku that honors the memories of those killed in these attacks by the Soviet military and to join with me today in standing with Azerbaijanis as they commemorate this tragedy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay special tribute to Umatilla County Sheriff John Trumbo. Sheriff Trumbo retired on January 1. 2013 after a career in law enforcement that dates back to 1973. Since he moved to Pendleton. Oregon in 1977. Sheriff Trumbo has dedicated over thirtyfive years of service to the citizens of Umatilla County. Born and raised in Oregons Willamette Valley. John learned how to work hard in the family business and later as a crane \"high flyer\". His love for police service began in 1972 when he joined the Benton County Sheriffs office \"Ride Along\" program. A year later John became a reserve officer. serving Benton County. Oregon for nearly four years. During this time he joined his colleagues in Benton County who traveled to Pendleton. Oregon and lent a hand with security for the world famous Pendleton RoundUp and Happy Canyon Pageantry Show. Because of these connections and his work. John was offered a job by the Umatilla County Sheriff. John took the Sheriff up on this invitation and in 1977 moved to Pendleton. an eastern Oregon wheat ranch and rodeo community which he and his wife Carol never left. His wife Carol. an accomplished school teacher in her own right. was there helping John raise their two sons Nick and Michael who now have blessed them with two loving grandchildren. Presley and Cade. Recently Cade was asked to write about a hero in school and chose his \"good grandpa the Sheriff\" who would be there \"just in case anyone is a criminal.\" For nearly twenty years John served in various roles in the Umatilla County Sheriffs office. officer in the jail. having the first K9 unit. Sergeant. Lieutenant. Captain and UnderSheriff. In 1997. John was sworn in and began his first of sixteen years of service as Umatilla County Sheriff. Always known for his honest and straightforward approach. Sheriff Trumbo was requested and volunteered to participate in many local and state boards. task forces. and councils. including the Governors Methamphetamine Task Force and the advisory board for Blue Mountain Community Colleges criminal justice program. He also served as President of the Oregon State Sheriffs Association. Sheriff Trumbo also implemented programs to aid the citizen of Umatilla County and the region. He organized the nationally recognized E44 Umatilla County Neighborhood Watch and Rural Crime Prevention Program that now has 19 units and over 800 active members. Recognizing the rural nature of Umatilla County and the challenges that are posed. especially in the winter. John implemented an allterrain vehicle and snowmobile patrol program. for search. rescue. and patrols. Whether it was creating a program to take meth off the streets or sending a bill to a foreign county for the care and feeding of their citizens. Sheriff Trumbo has always looked for simple. straightforward solutions to solving problems. Although John has retired as Sheriff. I know he wont be ending his service to Pendleton or Umatilla County. In fact. John remains an active volunteer with the Pendleton RoundUp. serving as the Board of Director who heads up security during the world famous rodeo. In this role he spearheads efforts to provide protection and safety of thousands of people attending the performances and visiting the community. including helping those wayward individuals leaving the \"Leter Buck\" room stay out of trouble! I also know he will be spending plenty of wellearned time on those things he loves. whether it is traveling horseback across the county with his grandchildren. woodworking. or camping with his family. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Sheriff John Trumbo the best in his retirement. Sheriff. thanks for all your service to Umatilla County. the region. and our fine State of Oregon. You may be able to turn that cell phone off from time to time now!",

The Seawolves finished the regular season with a 4311 record and won their second straight conference regular season title. The team also swept the major conference awards. bringing home Coach of the Year. Player of the Year. and Pitcher of the Year. Twelve players were named allconference. But the teams success did not end there. After winning its conference. Stony Brook went on to win the America East Championship for the second time in three seasons. The Seawolves then competed in the Coral Gables Regional of the NCAA tournament. The tournament. attended by four teams. was statistically the toughest regional tournament in the country. The team was able to prevail over the three other competitors and advance to the Super Regional in Baton Rouge. In the Super Regional. the Seawolves faced the LSU Tigers in a bestofthree tournament. After falling behind in Game 1. the Seawolves won Game 2 to force a winnertakeall Game 3. Although the Tigers took an early lead. the Seawolves won the game to become the first Northeast region school to advance to the College World Series since the end of geographic regional tournaments in 1987. The Seawolves went to Omaha as the team that had captured the attention and the hearts of observers throughout the country. The team embraced the rallying cry \"Shock the World\" as a mission. it set out to leave a mark on the national stage and make Stony Brook a household name. Unfortunately. the Seawolves were eliminated from the College World Series after a loss to Florida State. but they were successful in their mission to raise the profile of the Stony Brook University athletic program. The question. \"Whats a sea wolf?\" is now able to be answered by people who have never set foot on the Stony Brook campus. By the end of the postseason. Stony Brook had compiled an NCAAbest 52 wins. For the 2011 and 2012 seasons combined. the team has a winning percentage of .777. the best in the nation. In addition to its playoff run. the team reached a number of milestones for its program. Coach Matt Senk became the third coach in the history of the conference to win 6.000 games. The program also had a record seven players drafted in the Major League Baseball FirstYear Player Draft. including its first player to be drafted in the first round. All seven players have signed with major league organizations. Stony Brooks remarkable season of triumphs was recognized by the local news media as among the top sports moments of 2012. and the coaches and members of the team were named People of the Year in Sports by a local newspaper. These are a few among the many ways the team has been honored by organizations across Long Island. and I am so very proud to represent this outstanding baseball team and Stony Brook University as their representative in Congress. Mr. Speaker. on behalf of New Yorks first congressional district. I again congratulate the 2012 Stony Brook University Baseball team on its recordbreaking season and wish the program continued success. Go Seawolves!",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in order for our students to be competitive in the global economy. we must do our part to ensure that they are acquiring the knowledge and skills they need for success. The skills needed for success go beyond the basics of reading. writing. and math. however. When surveyed. employers continually emphasize that. in our 21st century economy. students need to be adept at critical thinking and problem solving. communication. collaboration. and creativity and innovation. in addition to being proficient in core subjects. Sixteen states. as well as local school districts from across the country. have formed a partnership with over thirty leading education organizations and corporate entities to find ways to strengthen 21st century skills in their K12 classrooms. However. this momentum isnt sustainable unless federal policy gives states and districts the flexibility to innovate in this direction. To remedy this. Rep. DAVE LOEBSACK and I are introducing the 21st Century Readiness Act. This bill does not create any new programs or authorize additional spending. instead. it would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to emphasize the importance of 21st century skills and give states and districts added flexibility to develop and enhance these skills as part of their own initiatives. A growing coalition of states and school districts has recognized the importance of giving our students the tools they need to succeed in our 21st century workforce. This bill will give them the flexibility to succeed in these efforts. I hope that our colleagues will join us in this effort.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit a letter I recently sent to over three hundred national faith leaders encouraging them to use their platform and lend their voice to the cause of the persecuted church globally. DEAR FRIEND: Christians worldwide just celebrated the birth of Jesus. For those of us living in the West. this was a festive season marked by worship services. giftgiving and time with family and friends. But for our brethren in the Middle East. fear of persecution and outright violence or even death cast a long dark shadow over the Christmas holiday. While most striking in the Middle East. given the ancient roots of Christianity in that part of the world. the challenges facing those believers are by no means isolated. nor are they anything \"new under the sun.\" Ecclesiastes 4:1 says. \"I saw the tears of the oppressed. and they have no comforter. power was on the side of the oppressor.\" As you well know. oppression has marked the church since its birth. Consider the chilling words of Roman historian Tacitus regarding the early church: \"Besides being put to death they were made to serve as objects of amusement. they were clad in the hides of beasts and torn to death by dogs. others were crucified. others set on fire to serve to illuminate the night when daylight failed...\" Every day. around the world. men and women of faith are imprisoned. beaten. detained. tortured and even killed. The book of Hebrews enjoins us to \"remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners. and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.\" Do we suffer with our brethren? Have we in the West ceased to be salt and light? E45 Consider that on our watch a historic exodus of Christians from the Middle East is underway an exodus fueled by persecution. German Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer. faced with the tyranny and horror of Nazism. famously said. \"Silence in the face of evil is itself evil. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\" And that is precisely what many in the church did. or failed to do. as Hitler unleashed his murderous plans. I recently encountered this haunting account by a German Christian in the book When a Nation Forgets God: \"I lived in Germany during the Nazi Holocaust. I considered myself a Christian. We heard stories of what was happening to the Jews. but we tried to distance ourselves from it. because. what could anyone do to stop it? A railroad track ran behind our small church and each Sunday morning we could hear the whistle in the distance and then the wheels coming over the tracks. We became disturbed when we heard the cries coming from the train as it passed by. We realized that it was carrying Jews like cattle in the cars! Week after week the whistle would blow. We dreaded to hear the sound of those wheels because we knew that we would hear the cries of the Jews en route to a death camp. Their screams tormented us. We knew the time the train was coming and when we heard the whistle blow we began singing hymns. By the time the train came past our church we were singing at the top of our voices. If we heard the screams. we sang more loudly and soon we heard them no more. Years have passed and no one talks about it anymore. But I still hear that train whistle in my sleep. God forgive me. forgive all of us who called ourselves Christians and yet did nothing to intervene.\" The parallels are imperfect but the sentiments are the same. Has our comfort led to complacency? Can the church in the West be galvanized to act? A phrase not often heard outside the majority Muslim world is \"First the Saturday people. then the Sunday people.\" The \"Saturday people\" are of course the Jews. Their once vibrant communities in countries throughout the region are now decimated. In 1948 there were roughly 150.000 Jews in Iraq. today less than 10 remain. In Egypt. there were once as many as 80.000 Jews. now less than 100 remain. It appears a similar fate awaits the ancient Christian community in these same lands. Iraqs Christian population has fallen from as many as 1.4 million in 2003 to between 500.000 and 700.000 today. Churches have been targeted. believers kidnapped for ransom and families threatened with violence if they stay. In October 2010. Islamist extremists laid siege on Our Lady of Salvation Catholic Church in Baghdad killing over 50 hostages and police and wounding dozens more. In Egypt with the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood. Coptic Christians. numbering roughly 8 to 10 million. are leaving in droves. Ironically. some 2.000 years ago. the Holy Family sought refuge in this same land from the murderous aims of King Herod. In the midst of devastating bloodshed in Syria. the Christian population is particularly vulnerable. A recent ABC News story reported. \"They [Christians] are fearful that Syria will become another Iraq. with Christians caught in the crossfire between rival Islamic groups.\" Over the span of a few decades. the Middle East. with the exception of Israel. was virtually emptied of Jews. The same thing will happen to the Christian community if the current trajectory holds true. And yet. the silence of many in the West is deafening. Such stories receive scant attention in the mainstream media. and perhaps more strikingly. are rarely spoken of from our pulpits. A recent study on Christian persecution released by the Britishbased think tank Civitas explained the medias seeming ambivalence this way: \"Parts of the media have been influenced by the logical error that equates criticism of Muslims with racism. and therefore as wrong by definition. This has further distracted attention away from the hounding of Christians. helping to cement the surprisingly widespread idea that Christianity is a Western faith.\" And yet. we in the church ought to know better. The Middle East is the very cradle of Christendom. Consider Iraq: with the exception of Israel. the Bible contains more references to the cities. regions and nations of ancient Iraq than any other country. The patriarch Abraham came from a city in Iraq called Ur. Isaacs bride. Rebekah. came from northwest Iraq. Jacob spent 20 years in Iraq and his sons (the 12 tribes of Israel) were born in northwest Iraq. A remarkable spiritual revival as told in the book of Jonah occurred in Nineveh. The events of the book of Esther took place in Iraq as did the account of Daniel in the Lions Den. Furthermore. many of Iraqs Christians still speak Aramaic. the language of Jesus. So how do we account for the Churchs indifference? Is it political correctness? Lack of awareness? What tragedy must befall this community before we are propelled to act? The persecution plaguing the Middle East is no exception. Christians are targeted throughout the world in countries like China. Vietnam and Pakistan. According to the Civitas study. \"More Christians are imprisoned in China than in any other country in the world.\" If the faith community in the West isnt engaged. are we surprised when government leaders turn a blind eye to matters of religious freedom? Consider the following: bipartisan legislation to create a special envoy position at the State Department charged with advocating on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East and South Central Asia overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives more than a year and a half ago. But it remained stalled in the Senate as a result of State Department opposition and the refusal of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. and presumptive secretary of state. John Kerry. to even hold a hearing on the legislation. I have had the privilege of meeting individuals who boldly follow Jesus despite unbelievably hostile circumstances. Shabbaz Bhatti. Pakistans federal minister for minority affairs. and the only Christian Member of the cabinet and an outspoken critic of his countrys blasphemy laws. was one such man. On March 2. 2011 he was murdered. his car riddled with bullets. leaving his mothers house for work. In a video filmed shortly before his assassination (accessible on my Web site at http://wolf.house.gov/bhattivideo). Bhatti appears to sense that the path he has chosen will come with a price. When asked about the threats against his life. he said. without malice or fear. \"I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us. I know what is the meaning of [the] cross. And I am following the cross. And I am ready to die for a cause.\" And so he did. The book of Proverbs tells us to \"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves \u0095 Bhatti can no longer speak. The Chinese bishop under house arrest cannot speak. The North Korean believer enslaved in the gulag cant speak. The Iraqi nun fearing for her life cannot speak. Will we be their voice? Martin Luther King. Jr. famously said. \"In the end. we will remember not the words of our enemies. but the silence of our friends.\" Are we not their friends? The Church globally is under assault. Our response must not be to simply sing more loudly. thereby drowning out the cries for help from our brothers and sisters. Rather we must speak out. advocate and act on their behalf. From my perspective the Church in the West. specifically in America. is failing in this regard. Can you. as a leader in the Church. help? Are you pained by these accounts of persecution? Do you have ideas about how best to respond? Will you use your sphere of influence to raise the profile of this issue be it through a sermon. writing or media interview? I welcome your thoughts and invite your engagement in this monumental task. Next week. when Congress reconvenes. I intend to reintroduce the special envoy legislation and press for passage in both houses of Congress. I dont pretend to think that a special envoy will singlehandedly solve the problem. but it certainly cant hurt to have a highlevel person within the State Department bureaucracy who is exclusively focused on the protection and preservation of these ancient communities. Furthermore. to do nothing is simply not an option. We in the West must speak out on behalf of the persecuted church around the world. Best wishes. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California are exceptional. Our community has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Claudia Luppino is one of these individuals. On Friday. January 4. 2013. Claudia ended her tenure as the Area Director for the Inland Area jurisdiction of the Social Security Administration (SSA) after 37 years of service. Claudia grew up in Erie. Pennsylvania. where she and her future husband Bud were high school sweethearts. After graduating from Erie Business College. the young military wife began her government career with the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command at Fort Belvoir. Virginia. later transferring to March Air Force Base in Riverside. In 1977. after Bud left the Air Force. she began her career with Social Security as the Administrative Aide in the Riverside District office. Since then. she has held more than a dozen positions with the Agency. including Claims Representative. Operations Analyst and Operations Supervisor. In 1985 Claudia was selected as the Area Analyst in the Inland Area Directors Office (ADO). and in 1987 she became the District Manager in the Redlands Office. where she served for two years before being selected as the Operations Officer in San Bernardino. In 1993 Claudia rejoined the Inland ADO as the Area Administrative Assistant. and later went on to serve as the Assistant District Manager in Palm Springs. District Manager in North Las Vegas. District Manager in Victorville. Deputy Area Director in the Inland Area Directors Office and the District Manager for the Riverside District. Claudia is a graduate of the Region IX Leadership Development Program and has received numerous awards. including the Regional Commissioners Citation. Claudia recently concluded an assignment as the Acting Area Director in the Los Angeles Metro Area. She served for over six months as the Acting Area Director in the Inland Area. where she oversaw 540 employees in 16 offices in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. and all of Nevada. It was a responsibility she took seriously. According to her. \"There is no other government agency that provides the critical services SSA does. providing retirement. survivors and disability benefits as well as Supplemental Security Income benefits to the American public.\" What she will miss most about her job. she said. \"is that very ability to make a difference in the lives of so many people.\" In her retirement. Claudia plans to help her husband Bud with his business. Buds Tire and Wheel. Inc. in Riverside. and a shop in Moreno Valley. They will soon begin construction on a third location in Riverside. She also looks forward to traveling more. learning Italian and spending time with her three grandsons. In light of all Claudia has done for southern California seniors. it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Claudias tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire and I am proud to call her a fellow community member. American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.",

As the outgoing dean of Missouris congressional delegation. she has led our group with fairness. respect. and a spirit of cooperation. As she retires today. I know that every member of the Missouri delegation. as well as her many friends on both sides of the aisle. join me in congratulating her on an exceptional career in the U.S. House.

Jo ANN has always been a voice of calm. reason. and good common sense. There is no doubt that the center aisle caucus will miss her strong. principled leadership.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. District of Columbia residents raise billions of dollars annually for their local budget. and. like Americans everywhere. regard the right to control the funds they themselves raise to support their city as fundamental to their American citizenship. Therefore. today I introduce the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2013. the second bill I have introduced this Congress. to allow the Districts localtaxpayerraised budget to take effect immediately when passed by the city. without being subject to congressional approval. Control over the dollars raised by local taxpayers is central to local control. the oldest American government principle. Beyond this core principle. permitting the citys local budget to become law without congressional approval would have multiple practical benefits for both the city and Congress. For the city. a timely budget means eliminating the uncertainty of the congressional approval process. which has a negative effect on the citys bond rating. adding unnecessary interest costs for local taxpayers. significantly improving the Districts ability to make accurate revenue forecasts. and reducing the countless operational problems that result because the citys budget cannot be implemented until Congress approves it. Also of major importance is that the bill would allow the District to use the typical state and local government fiscal year (July 1June 30). allowing ample time to prepare for the opening of schools in September. instead of the federal fiscal year (October 1September 30). Moreover. the D.C. local budget consumes valuable subcommittee. committee. and floor time in both houses of Congress. the most inefficient and redundant annual process in the Congress. yet the D.C. budget is of interest only to those members who use it to promote their own issues. violating a principle of local selfgovernment that they value for their own districts and states. Increasing recognition of the hardships and delays caused by the congressional approval process has led Congress to begin freeing the city from many congressional constraints. I appreciate that my bill to avoid a D.C. government shutdown when the federal government shuts down is in the Senate Appropriations Committeepassed fiscal year 2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. President Obama included this provision in his fiscal year 2013 budget. and the Republicancontrolled House Appropriations Committee indicated in its report accompanying its fiscal year 2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill that legislation to avoid D.C. shutdowns was necessary. In addition. several years ago. I negotiated an agreement with a Republicanled appropriations committee that ensures that the citys local budget is approved in the first continuing resolution (CR) if the D.C. Appropriations bill has not been approved by the start of the fiscal year. This approach ended the annual nightmares of lengthy delay of the budget of a big city until an appropriations bill was passed. often months after the start of the fiscal year. As a result. under CRs. the city has been able to spend its local funds at the next years funding level. even though federal agencies must spend at the prior years funding level. We are appreciative that this process. which eliminated serious problems for the functioning of the D.C. government. has continued. We nearly secured budget autonomy for the District in the last days of the lameduck session in the 111th Congress. I used an unusual procedure. getting the House authorizers to agree to the inclusion of budget autonomy in the fiscal year 2011 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. which was passed by the subcommittee. Unfortunately. Congress passed a CR instead of regular appropriations bills in the lame duck. Most important. we gained critical support for D.C. budget autonomy in the 112th Congress. In an Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in May 2011. Chairman DARRELL ISSA (RCA) endorsed budget autonomy. Since that time. House Majority Leader ERIC CANTOR (RVA) and Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell (R) have both indicated their support for budget autonomy. Even if the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2013 were enacted. Congress would still retain jurisdiction over the District of Columbia under article I. section 8. clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution. Because this authority allows Congress to make changes to the Districts budget and other laws at any time. it is unnecessary to require a lengthy repetition of the Districts local budget process in Congress. The time is overdue to permit the city to enact its local budget. the single most important step Congress could take to help the District better manage itself. Members of Congress were sent here to do the business of the nation. Members have no reason to be interested in or to become knowledgeable about the local budget of a single city. In the past. the House and Senate have more often than not passed the Districts budget as is. Our bill takes the Congress in the direction it is already moving in. Congressional interference in one of the most vital rights of selfgovernment should end this year by enacting the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2013.",

Despite the violence done to them. they showed forgiveness against the people. and our colleague JOHN LEWIS and others helped us avoid. by their commitment to nonviolence. the calamities and replaying of grievances that have destroyed the fabric of many other countries.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. consider the following: if the United States had an adopted policy of equal pay. it would put $200 billion more into the economy every year. That comes out to about $137 for every white woman per paycheck and to approximately $300 for every woman of color. who is doubly discriminated against. These women are not going to put their money into a Cayman Islands bank account. Instead. theyll spend it. and this will boost our economy. create jobs and help families. With a record number of women in the workforce. wage discrimination hurts the majority of American families both in terms of their economic security today and their retirement security tomorrow. The Institute for Womens Policy Research found that wage disparity will cost women anywhere from $400.000 to $2 million over a lifetime of lost wages. That means fewer resources to pay the mortgage. to send kids to college. or to have a decent retirement. Also. due to rising employment rates. an unprecedented number of women are now the family breadwinners. making pay equity even more critical. not simply to family economic security but also to the Nations economic recovery. As we look for ways to create more jobs and grow the economy. it is astounding to me that Congress has not yet passed legislation ensuring equal pay for equal work. It is a powerful policy with what would be powerful and positive economic outcomes. That is why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act. It ensures that employers who try to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show that the disparity is not sexbased. but jobrelated and necessary. It prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose their own salary information with their coworkers. and it strengthens the remedies available to wronged employees. Pay inequity due to gender discrimination is real. and it should not be tolerated. The House of Representatives should address this issue.",

The House has fulfilled the most basic responsibility of governing and passing a budget. On the other hand. the liberalcontrolled Senate has failed to complete a budget for nearly 4 years. Hardworking American families and small businesses plan to spend within their means and abide by a budget. The Federal Government should do so as well. Today. House Republicans will consider legislation aimed at putting this fiscal irresponsibility to a halt by voting on the No Budget. No Pay Act. This bill will raise the debt ceiling for 3 months with the provision that both Houses of Congress must pass a budget. If either body fails to achieve the task. the Members pay will be withheld. It is past time to hold the President and the liberalcontrolled Senate accountable for outofcontrol spending. If hardworking Americans strive to succeed in their jobs. the Senate must do so as well.

This bill accommodates spending at ruinous levels far beyond the limits set by the House budget. It sets a terrible precedent by abolishing the debt limit for nearly 4 months. giving an unlimited credit card to this administration. I think Members will be stunned by the borrowing that this moratorium makes possible. Certainly. thousands of dollars of new debt will be heaped on every household in America. House Republicans have passed two budget plans that put our Nation back on a path toward fiscal solvency. If the debt limit were increased within that trajectory at 2month intervals. it would require only small and incremental reforms each time. That would both avert default now and the fiscal crisis that we are fast approaching. I believe that it is achievable and far preferable to the bill to be voted on today.",

Frankly. its dangerous when a government leader stoops to the same fearmongering for political purposes. Last week.

Theyre Coming for Your Guns.\" Among the emails dishonest claims was this blatant distortion: President Obama is spelling out the 23 different executive orders he will take to get your guns. Those 23 executive actions are so modest that even gun rights activists have said they have no problem with them. In fact. many of them reflect proposals made by the NRA. Even if we give Senator MCCONNELL the benefit of the doubt as to whether he actually knew what his campaign manager was putting out. he is responsible. as we all are. for what our employees do in our name.

Mr. Speaker. and that is restoring our vibrant economy by reducing the crippling weight of the growing debt caused by our Federal Government. In the coming months. we face a string of deadlines that will force Congress and the administration to address the fundamental challenge of our trilliondollar deficit and its mounting effect on our economy and jobs in America. Weve already exceeded $16 trillion in debt. and Republicans find this debt level absolutely unacceptable and that is why we are here today. By contrast. President Obama seems to be perfectly comfortable with the idea of reaching $23 trillion. which is where well be at the end of his second term if we continue his policies in that direction. While $16 trillion in debt is stifling our economy. $23 trillion would crush it. It would crush the dreams and hopes and aspirations of our great Nation and the people who will certainly follow us. our children and our grandchildren. Thats why. today. were considering this rule and the underlying bill in order to reverse this course. Our great Speaker. JOHN BOEHNER. and our majority leader. ERIC CANTOR. are pleased that this bill is on the floor today to discuss not just this important activity with our Members of Congress. but to let the American people know we are serious about what needs to be done to save this country from this crippling debt. We will use the upcoming weeks and the looming deadlines before us as a means to enacting a more meaningful and lasting reform so that we can begin to grapple with this skyrocketing debt. At the same time. todays rule and the underlying bill will allow us to turn up pressure on the Senate to join the House in offering real solutions. Together. these actions will help to reignite our engines to grow our economy and to restore discipline and accountability to our Federal budget. The first of the looming deadlines we face is the debt ceiling limit. The underlying bill would temporarily suspend this limit so that we have the opportunity to craft comprehensive reforms without risking default on the debt that our Nation has incurred. Risking default would be counterproductive to our Republican agenda of restoring economic growth. getting our fiscal house in order. and ensuring that we do not burden future generations with intolerable debt. We will not risk the full faith and credit of the United States. but neither will we compromise a longterm extension of this debt ceiling without slashing wasteful Federal spending. enacting meaningful entitlement reform. and ending the era of trilliondollar deficits. By taking this temporary action. we are keeping the focus where it needs to be: resolving the coming debates on sequestration. the expiring continuing resolution. and the fiscal year 2014 budget through fiscal discipline and entitlement reform. Suspending the debt ceiling until May 19 provides the House and the Senate with muchneeded time to pass a budget and then consider how best to deal with the sequester. The underlying bill also takes action to ensure that the Senate becomes an active partner. which we want and need and the American people. I think. expect. in our efforts to reform Federal spending. For nearly 4 years. the Senate has failed to meet its most basic obligation: passing a budget. During this time. the Senate has collected its own paychecks despite being derelict in its most important duty. In the private sector. there are consequences for failing to do ones job. This resolution will impose the same accountability on Members of Congress that private sector workers face. Oh. yes. and were putting that same obligation on the House as we would want them to accept in the Senate. That is. if you dont get your work done. you dont get paid. The power of the purse is the most fundamental duty the Constitution places upon Congress. For far too long. this power has not been wielded with the discipline and accountability necessary to do so responsibly and sustainably. There are a host of challenges that must be addressed. but the entire process begins with a joint budget resolution. As long as the Senate is unwilling or unable to do its job. our efforts in the House to deliver real solutions to the American people will continue to be impeded. Some have questioned whether the action we are taking is constitutional. The 27th Amendment of the Constitution prohibits legislation that varies the salary of Members of the current Congress. This provision was intended to prevent Members of the House and the Senate from giving themselves a pay raise without first standing before the voters. This bill upholds both the letter and the spirit of the 27th Amendment. It would not change a Members rate of compensation in any way. they just dont get to collect it until they do their jobs. And until they get their work done. we simply cannot adopt a permanent extension to that debt ceiling. This body will work to ensure that the Senate performs the most basic of tasks to pass a budget. and well do our job also. We will continue to work for meaningful entitlement and spending reforms to take us beyond our current cycle of crisis and deadlines in favor of longterm solutions. As we do all of this in order to invigorate our economy and put our Nation back to prosperity for ourselves and for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first of all. let me say to my colleagues. both Democratic and Republican colleagues. that they ought to vote against this rule. The bill before us today was not the product of deliberation in either the Ways and Means Committee or the House Administration Committee. There were no hearings. It was brought before the Rules Committee last night. and not a single amendment was made in order. This is a closed rule. So if my friend from Texas wants to usher in a new policy of openness in this Congress. we should have had this rule open so that Members could have an opportunity to express themselves and to have their viewpoints made known. But. again. it is a completely closed rule. So this rule should be defeated. It should go back to the Rules Committee. We ought to come back with something that allows this Chamber to be able to do its deliberation. And Mr. Speaker. we ought to be here today to raise the debt ceiling. not because we like the idea of raising the debt ceiling. but because thats the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for our country and for our economy. It is the right thing to do for the businesses of this country. so that they have some certainty that we will not default on our debts. And if they had that certainty. they would then invest in our economy and help create more jobs and help create more opportunity for people. You know. one of the things I have heard from Republicans and Democrats who Ive bumped into at all types of occasions. they may have differences on our tax policy. they may have differences on our economic policy. but the one thing that everybody seems to agree on is that Congress ought to provide certainty. And this is anything but certainty. because what we are doing today. thanks to the Republican leadership. is to bring a shortterm extension of the debt ceiling to the floor. which means that they have decided. once again. to play partisan politics with the debt ceiling. This is a bad idea. This is not the way a mature governing body ought to behave. We ought to do our job. Next month the United States will hit the debt ceiling and. without action. the United States will default on its debts. Now. the last time the Republican leadership played this dangerous game of economic Russian roulette. they threatened the full faith and credit of the United States for the first time in our history. For some reason they seem hellbent on doing it again. We need to be clear about one thing. The debt limit is not about new spending. its not about increasing the deficit. The debt limit is simply the way Congress pays for things that we have already bought. things like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. by the way. that my friends on the other side continue to insist that we dont pay for. it just goes on a credit card. Things like the Medicare prescription drug benefit that was not paid forward that my friends on the other side of the aisle championed. things that the Republicans have voted for over and over and over again. Now. we can and we should have an open and thoughtful debate about our spending priorities and our deficit. That is what were supposed to do. But playing games with the debt limit. threatening to default. should not be an option. But thats just what the bill before us does. It. once again. kicks the can down the road. Now. instead of passing a clean. longterm debt ceiling bill. one that could ensure that America doesnt default on its debt and obligations. the Republicans have chosen to bring a bill up that would put us right back in the same place that were in now in May. 3 months from now. So whats next. Mr. Speaker? A 3week extension of the debt ceiling? Three days? Three hours? My Republican friends go on and on about how the business community needs and deserves certainty from Washington. but treating the full faith and credit of the United States like just another political talking point is no way to create certainty. How ironic. Mr. Speaker. that the Republican Party. the party that took a record surplus and turned it into a record deficit. the party that put two major wars on the Nations credit card. the party that refused to pay for two rounds of tax cuts and a massive. expansive prescription drug benefit. now wants to pay its bills. Now wants to pay its bills. The same group of people that got us into this mess are now telling us that they want to get us out of this mess. The fact is. on the issue of the deficit and on the issue of the debt. my friends on the other side of the aisle. I do not believe. have any credibility. You know. theres an old show business saying. Mr. Speaker: you got to have a gimmick. And my Republican friends never cease to disappoint me. They always have a gimmick. They believe in government by gimmicks. And this No Budget. No Pay bill is another gimmick. Lets kind of play this out. What their bill says is if the House doesnt pass a budget bill by April 15. we dont get paid. If the Senate doesnt pass a budget bill by April 15. they dont get paid. Now. I have no doubt that they have the votes to ram whatever they want through the House of Representatives. and I expect that they will bring us yet another budget bill that has the same extreme. excessive spending cuts in programs that benefit the middle class and poor that they brought before us last year. So I think they will bring a bill to the floor. And lets say the Senate does bring a budget bill to the floor and they pass it. This bill does not require that there be a conference report that is voted on by both the House and the Senate as a condition of whether or not Members get paid. So. again. this is not a solution. What this is just more political gamesmanship. You pass something in the House that may be totally irreconcilable. something that will never be able to be conferenced with the Senate. Senate. you pass whatever you want. it doesnt have to be conferenceable with the House. and there we are. And there we are. 3 months from now. in the same position that we are in now. You know. the way this should be done. and I know this is a radical idea. but the way this should be done is the leadership of the Republican side should speak with the leadership of the Democratic side. and lets see if we can kind of agree on a way to proceed. There ought to be serious discussions. Ill also point out for my colleagues and for those who are watching. there were a couple of occasions over the last year and a half where Speaker BOEHNER came very close to coming to agreement with the White House on a bigger deal. And on those two occasions the Speaker walked away and said no after he came very close to saying yes. Why did he say no? It had nothing to do with the Senate not having passed a budget resolution. It had everything to do with the fact that when the Speaker came back and talked to his Republican rankandfile Members. they all said no. They said no. It doesnt cut Medicare enough. It doesnt cut Social Security enough. It doesnt cut food stamps enough. It doesnt cut education enough. It doesnt cut job creation enough. There are people on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker. who are using this not as an opportunity to balance our budget. but theyre using this as an opportunity to gut government. to end the public sector. They see this as their opportunity. And as a result. we have this uncertainty. And as a result. the American people pay the price. As a result. this economy is not recovering as quickly as it needs to be. I would urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on this rule. this closed rule. This is not the way we should begin this session. Mr. Speaker. I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. enough of the gimmicks. Its time to get serious about doing the peoples business. and this is not doing the peoples business. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I will insert into the RECORD an article from The Washington Post dated January 22. Mr. Speaker. Id like to now discuss. if I can. this Washington Post article which is out today. which says the Senate Majority Leader HARRY REID praised House leaders for moving ahead with a bill that would give the government borrowing authority into the future. He further said that he not only is very glad that were going to send a clean debt ceiling bill. but that he felt like it would be good for the Senate to be able to take up this action. Well. Mr. Speaker. what were trying to do is to empower those things that we know this institution. the House and the Senatewhere we work closer together. where we both do our work. And yesterday. the gentleman representing the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. RYAN. whos also PAUL RYAN. the chairman of the House Budget Committee. in testimony said that he intended to make sure that he would produce a bill exactly supporting what we are trying to do here today. and would bring that to the floor. and would be faithful in doing that. Look. maybe people are upset that were putting their pay at risk. Maybe people are upset because it wasnt their idea. But the bottom line is that PAUL RYAN. JOHN BOEHNER. ERIC CANTOR. the Rules Committee. yesterday said we think its a good bill. and we were joined by HARRY REID. the Senate Majority Leader. When the Senate Majority Leader can agree with Republicans about a great direction to go that will empower the Senate and join with them in trying to make sure that we get our job done. I think thats a rare day. I think thats a good day when we can work together. when we can bring legislation that the Senate openly welcomes and. might I add. the President of the United States. President Obama. would sign this legislation. And he said so in the Statement of Administration Policy. I reserve the balance of my time. [From the Washington Post. Jan. 22. 2013]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Im glad the gentleman from Texas agrees with HARRY REID. I hope he agrees with HARRY REID on more things in the future. But the fact of the matter is this show business before us does nothing other than postpone this debate on the debt ceiling for 3 months. It doesnt require a finished product. It does not require that we actually have something that amounts to a deal that goes to the Presidents desk. The House will pass their extreme budget. like they always do. The Senate will probably do something. And then nothing else is required. Theres no requirement for a deal in order to get your pay. This is show business. And what we should be doing is providing certainty to the business community that were not going to default on our obligations in 3 months. And we ought to come together and figure out a way to be able to get this budget in balance without destroying the social safety net in this country. Again. the problem has always beenand lets be clear about thisas much as I get frustrated with the Senate. the problem on this is not the Senate. The problem is the rankandfile Republicans in the House Republican Conference who. every time the Speaker of the House goes to them with a deal. they say. No. They always say it doesnt cut deep enough. it doesnt eliminate programs that help the poor. it doesnt eliminate programs that help the middle class. it doesnt eliminate programs that help create jobs. Because the ultimate goal of so many on the other side is not about a balanced budget. They dont care about balanced budgets. Theyre the ones who took this balanced budget that Bill Clinton had and turned it into one of the worst deficits and debt in our country. They dont care about that. They care about eliminating the public sector. Thats what this is about. Three months? Please. Three months? What kind of certainty is that?

    "speech": "I thank my colleague for yielding to me. And I want to continue what he was saying. despite the fact Ive got a greet speech here. But its terribly important. I think. that we try to make the point one more time that process here is turned upside down and is totally meaningless. So JOHN BOEHNER and PAUL RYAN and HARRY REID and the Rules Committee all agree. That leaves out about 500 more people who have been sent here from the districts to represent what the people who live there think. This is not the first time this has happened. A couple of weeks ago. on the fiscal cliff. we had a thing that came up from nowhere called Plan B. JOHN BOEHNER liked that. I guess PAUL RYAN liked that. Im not sure what HARRY REID thought about that. The Rules Committee thought it was okay. But the fact of the matter is that that bill was written while the Rules Committee was in session. There are 13 of us on the Rules Committee. We love the enormous power that weve got. But I dont believe any of us ever suspected that the Rules Committee was going to supersede all of the committees in the House of Representatives. Theres been no committee action on any of this. In addition. I want to make the point. again. that despite what we tried to do. we said. Nobodys talked about this. Theres been no discussion on this. Lets have an open rule. Lets let not just the people on our side but the people on the Republican side whove had no input here as well. lets open it up and have a real debate and see whats going on here. What is going on here? Whats going on here. as my colleague points out. is a circus of dubious constitutional validity. frankly. Some people may say what theyre doing is okay. Other people say. Absolutely not. We certainly should have had that decision before we got this far. What will the Senate do with it? Heavens to Betsy. I dont know. They have to have 60 votes over there before they can get to anything. It is the only legislative body in the world where 60 is the majority. not 51. as it is in every other legislature. So weve just reached. I think. a new low today. I am very depressed by the fact that the Constitution of the United States. which is very specific. that the rules of the Congress. which are extremely specific. are meaningless here. We have all these people on the committees. people with expertise. and wonderful staff. We can draw on resources from all over probably the world. not just America. But weve got plenty of them here just a block away. All the people we can talk to. all the people we can ask. What is the meaning of this? What will it do to the economy of the United States of America? Are we on the right track? Should we be doing something different? Do we need a debt limit law? What are we doing? Why cant we have those kinds of discussions in this Congress ever again? Its as though if we give them time to think about it and everybody has a chance to weigh in on it. then maybe we wont be able to move this the way we would like to and play another \"gotcha\" game. which is really what it comes down to. I dont care if The Washington Post loves it. Theyre probably so pleased to see the fact that people believe theres something in the fact that HARRY REID said he liked it. which is not anything thats been heard here lately. and that they thought they would like it as well. But I dont know what it is. and I dont think any of the rest of my Members did. And we certainly did not yesterday in the Rules Committee. We did not have the benefit of the knowledge of any of the other Members of the Congress or the committee process. which could have answered the questions for us that came up yesterday. In fact. all of us know where this came from. Charles Krauthammer wrote a column in The Washington Post. They maybe like that a whole lot. as well. Thats where this came from. He said. Hey. theres a good idea. Instead of going to the committees of the Congress of the United States. where people of knowledge are seated. they decided lets just throw it together over the weekend at a retreat and well take it back next week. Were only going to work a couple of days so lets rush it through and get it through and maybe by the time we get to 3 months. something will have straightened out. Or. more likely. Mr. Speaker. in 3 months we will have thought of another way that we can kick the can down the road. Now its important to note that this is not an extension of debt limit. It is a suspension of debt limit. That makes a difference. I think. as well. but we didnt get a chance to discuss that part of it either. We did away with all notions of regular order. I really thought the Plan B. as Id said earlierand I dont want anybody to miss thisthat bill was being written while the Rules Committee was meeting. I know that all students of government. all the colleges and universities in this country. theyre out there teaching people how America runs. how carefully and wonderfully put together it was by the Founding Fathers. how our Constitution is our guiding light. We just celebrated that. Because without doubt. the Presidents inaugural speech. based so closely on the Declaration of Independence and talking about the Constitution. made us understand that that is what we are here to uphold. And indeed we all held up our hands and swore we would uphold it. But when it comes to a piece of legislation like thisand this is the same as I said last night in the Rules Committeeits just lurching around and jerking around and coming up with any kind of crazy gimmick we can think of and making smart remarks. But I will tell you that kicking the can down the road for 3 more months is not a solution. It gives us some breathing room. But I dont have any reason in the world to believe from past performance that the future is going to be any clearer for us. Until the leaders of the House can start to include the fellow Members in the majoritybecause they have been cut out as welland the minority in the legislative process. the regular order will be little more than a dream. And todays bill drops the majoritys insistence that increasing the debt limit be matched by cuts to Medicare or reductions to education funding. Thats a step forward. But it doesnt answer our questions. My Democrat colleagues and I are eager to participate in the legislative process for which we came to Washington. And the American people are certainly eagerif not eager. maybe desperate would be a better wordto see an end to the dysfunction in this Congress. I hope that at some point the majority will realize that a completely partisan approach. which is what weve had. is a dead end. That meaningful solutions can only come from negotiation and compromise with those on the other side of the aisle who do have some good ideas. And when the majority comes to that realization. my Democrat colleagues and I will happily join in the effort to craft the serious legislative answers our country needs. our constituents deserve. and the world expects of us. The bill before us today isnt a serious solutionit is a gimmick of dubious constitutional validity. The legislation is the product of a weekend retreat. and contains all the seriousness one would expect from such origins. For the last year. the majority has alternatively taken the full faith and credit of our Nation hostage and put forth extreme proposals that do nothing to reduce our deficit in a balanced way. In the process they have done away with any notion of regular order. Just weeks ago. a socalled \"Plan B\" to the fiscal cliff was being written at the same time the Rules Committee was meetingthus forcing us to debate a bill no one had ever seen. Now we meet to debate a bill that failed to go through a single committee hearing before landing on the Rules Committee desk yesterday afternoon. Under the process forged by the majority. the Rules Committee has become the place where legislation is unveiled by the majority and brought to the floor 24 hours later. with no input from their colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is about as far away from regular order as it gets. Until the leaders of the House start including their fellow members of the majority and minority in the legislative process. regular order will be little more than a dream. Mr. Speaker. todays bill drops the majoritys insistence that any increase in the debt limit be matched by cuts to Medicare or reductions to education funding. This is certainly a noteworthy step forward. But kicking the can down the road for three months is not the solution that the American people deserve. If todays legislation had been crafted in the halls of Congress. with input from both sides of the aisle. I believe that we could be voting on a serious measure to prevent a debtlimit crisis and reduce our deficit starting today. My Democratic colleagues and I are eager to participate in the legislative process. and the American people are eager to see an end to the dysfunction in Congress. I hope that at some point the majority will realize that a completely partisan approach is a dead end. Meaningful solutions can only come from negotiation and compromise with those on the other side of the aisle. When the majority comes to that realization. my Democratic colleagues and I will happily join in the effort to craft the serious legislative answers that our country needs and our constituents deserve.",

    "speech": "I thank my chairman for yielding. I used to come to this podium. Mr. Speaker. and say Im just a House freshman. but this is what I think about things. Im now a House sophomore. Its been 2 years and 1 month since I arrived here. and if you told me 2 years ago when I arrived that we were going to be bringing fivepage pieces of legislation to this floor for upordown votes by this body. I wouldnt have believed it because Ive watched the way this House has operated for over a decade. I see these billsand Mr. Speaker. youve seen them toothese bills that folks have to carry down here on a dolly. those bills that they drop them down here on the rostrum with just a thump. Folks cant read those bills. folks cant analyze those bills. folks cant digest those bills. But this one that we have today deals with an incredibly complicated topic. the debt ceiling. an incredibly controversial topichow it is that the House and the Senate get their business doneand yet we bring it in five pages that every Member of this body has had a chance to read and digest. every Member of this body. We had a hearing on it in the Rules Committee yesterday. And here on the floor today were going to debate this bill not just with one committee of jurisdiction. with the Ways and Means Committee getting time. but with two committees of jurisdiction. the Ways and Means Committee getting time and the House Administration Committee getting time. You know. its unusual. Mr. Speaker. that we have a bill that the Speaker of the House has decided to bring forward. that the majority leader of the Senate has praised the Speaker for bringing forward. and that the White House has said it doesnt have any objection to. Thats unusual. Candidly. it makes me a little suspicious. Thats the way its been around here. I think my colleagues on the Rules Committee would agree. So often we get so used to the controversy that if we cant fight about something. we start to wonder whats wrong. whats wrong that we cant fight about something. Ill tell you. Mr. Speaker. were going to have that opportunity to fight. We dont have that roadmap yet. Of course. the House has laid out its budget roadmap year after year after year after year. Certainly. the 2 years Ive been here. the House has done its jobmuch to the credit of my colleagues on both sides of the aisleand passed a budget. This year. rumor has it the Senate is going to do the same thing. This bill certainly puts an incentive in place for both the House and the Senate to get their job done. but how is it that were going to tackle those tough decisions that my friend from New York. the ranking member of the Rules Committee. talked about. those really difficult financial decisions. talking about those obligations we have in the future that we have absolutely no plan or means to pay for. How are we going to grapple with those decisions? Well. Ill tell you. I wish we had gotten a big deal in the debt ceiling debate of August of 2011. We got a step in the right direction. but we didnt get it all done. I wish we had gotten it in the Joint Select Committee. We didnt get it done. I wish we had gotten it in the fiscal cliff debate of last year. We didnt get it done. But I believemaybe its just a hope. Mr. Speakerbut I believe that if the Senate has the courage to lay out its path for Americaits path for Americas budget and dealing with Americas obligationsand if the House has the courage to lay out its vision for America. its vision of dealing with Americas obligations. that were going to find that opportunity to come together to make those decisions that have to happen. Now. I hope Im not speaking out of school. Mr. Speaker. but I had a chance for some constituents in townsome of my business leaders. some of the great entrepreneurs from my district. theyre in town. I took them by to meet with Speaker JOHN BOEHNER. Ill tell you. I come from one of the most conservative districts in the United States of America. Speaker JOHN BOEHNER is not always the most popular name in my district. But I brought them by to meet him because I wanted them to hear from him directly and he said this to them. he said: We have real opportunities in divided government. real opportunities to come together and do the big things that matter. that only in divided government can you bring together the best ideas from both sides and put everybodys fingerprint and stamp of approval on them and do those things that really make a difference for America. And my goal is to do those things while Im leading this. the peoples House. I take him at his word. Mr. Speaker. And if giving this 90day extension so that budgets can be passed gives him that opportunity. Ill do it. A colleague of mine yesterday said. \"That stuck with me.\" He said. \"Ive had people I respect a whole lot less ask me for a whole lot more.\" I have great respect for our Budget Committee chairman. PAUL RYAN. I have great respect for our Rules Committee chairman. PETE SESSIONS. I have great respect for the Speaker of the House. If they tell me another 90 days is going to give us that opportunity to do those big things I think we on both sides of the aisle want to do. Im there. I support this resolution. Mr. Speaker. and I hope folks will support the underlying bill.",

I want to tell the gentleman from Georgia that I appreciate his many. many. many. many years working here in Washington. not only as a Member of Congress. but his many years as a congressional aide. So you have a perspective here based on many. many years of service in Washington. But I would just say that if someone were to tell me that the Republican leadership were to bring yet another closed rule to the floor. Im sad to say that Id respond: Im not surprised. This is a closed rule. This is a billwhether its five pages or a hundred pages. it doesnt make any differencethat did not come out of a committee process. The Ways and Means Committee didnt hold hearings or a markup. The House Administration Committee didnt hold hearings or a markup. This did. as my colleague from New York said. basically come out of your retreat. and you hand a bill to all of us here. Whats even more startling is that you do not allow anybody. Democrats or Republicans. to amend it. Completely closed. Completely closed. Look. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisleespecially the freshmen who campaigned on the platform of openness and transparencyyou vote for this rule. youre the problem. Youre the problem if you vote for this rule. So I would again urge my colleagues. just on the process alone. this is not the way that we should proceed.

This requires the House to once again pass its budgetwhich. as we all know from last years experience. represents the extreme of the extreme. I mean. its irreconcilable with the Senateand the Senate can pass whatever they want. but it doesnt require a finished product. What the American people want is a finished product. not a gimmick to kick the can down the road for 3 months. Yeah. everybody is happy were not going to default today. But 3 months. thats it? I mean. I think we can do a heck of a lot better than this. At this point. Mr. Speaker. I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California . the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.",

Thats all this bill does. Under some sort of camouflage about withholding pay. what have you. they kick the can down the road. You know. Americans are starting to realize that the economy is starting to recover after the devastation of the housing scandals. of the Wall Street scandals. Small businesses are starting to hire. spending over Christmas was reasonably good. the stock market is at a 5year high. the housing market is coming back. builders are in fact building new homes because of the demand in housing. 1l 1000 All of a sudden. enter the Congress of the United States and it says that were going to put the full faith and credit of the United States of America on a 90day leash. Were going to take the greatest economy in the greatest country with the greatest responsibility in the world and were going to put them on a 90day leash. How does a great country respond on a 90day leash? We know how it responded last time the world saw this happen. We got downgraded in the credit rating. That drove up the borrowing cost of the United States. That drove up the borrowing cost of corporations. That drove up the borrowing cost of counties and citiesthe counties and the cities that we represent. And were told again that should we falter on the credit debt of the United States. that we can expect a downgrade and we can expect a further downgrade in cities and counties all over the country. and somehow were supposed to believe that this is a good plan.",

The last time the American people looked at the Ryan budget they rejected it overwhelmingly. Do you remember the election of November. just a couple of months ago? They rejected those cuts in Medicare. those cuts in Medicaid. and the tax cuts for the wealthy. Yet all of this is being put back on the table by holding the debt limit hostage. holding the credit hostage. and holding American jobs hostage. So if you dont vote for that budget. then they get to play with the debt limit again. They get to play with the debt limit again. We have got big lifts to make between now and then. folks. We have sequestration. we have tax reform. and we have a budget to write. Lets just get down to business and do it. Just do it. Dont play with the credit of this country.

Id like to say to the American people and to my colleagues that are listening that the Republican leadership has decided to bring this bill to the floor today. We have no clue exactly what date the United States actually needs to make sure that we pass this bill to avoid not paying our bills. The Secretary of the Treasury is in active notification with our leadership and the leadership of the Senate and perhaps all Members because of his openness to speak about this in the press. We dont know when that day is. and because we dont know when that day is. thats a good reason to begin working on ideas to see whether we can even pass this bill. I think were going to. I think its going to be a bipartisan bill. I dont think everybody necessarily has the same concerns that the gentleman from California spoke of. but what were trying to do is work together. Conservative Republicans in our party do support this bill. I support this bill as a conservative Republican. Our Speaker. as a conservative Republican. supports this bill. What its about is avoiding the problems of chaos. avoiding the problems of doing things at the last minute. avoiding the problems of not addressing the issue. and avoiding the problems where the marketplace loses confidence in what were doing. Chairman PAUL RYAN. chairman of our Budget Committee. a bright young leader for our country. forthrightly brought this idea to our conference and has sold it. Its the right thing to do. We are trying to do here today the right thing. talking with the American people. letting people see that were moving forward to avoid conflict and avoid problems. So it was accomplished with this 5page bill. a 5page bill which we will then have two committee chairmen. PAUL RYAN representing the Ways and Means committee. perhaps DAVE CAMP. the chairman of the committee. and CANDICE MILLER of House Administration. work through meticulous. thoughtful ideas that really are not difficult to get because its a 5page bill. We think were doing the right thing. we think weve got the votes. and we think its going to provide this country and the Senate and this administration. us all working together. the right thing. So if you want to oppose it. I get that. I can understand the positions held. But passing the bill will be a positive thing. It will offer workingtogether relationships with the Senate. It is supported and not opposed by the President. and I think that gives us an opportunity to put a good foot forward in this new Congress rather than one where were fighting. disagreeing. and cant get our act together. The American people demand that we get things done. The American people are asking. hey. when possible. can you guys work together? Yes. we can. Today is the day where we can say. Mr. Speaker. people from Nebraska. people from Texas. people from Ohio. people from all over this country. can you work together? Were trying to find a way. and Im proud of that.

And I know that my good friend recognizes that the Constitution in article I. section 8. requires the Congress to have the power to collect taxes and duties and to pay the debts. but also to be concerned about the general welfare. Really what the administration says is that they support a longterm increase in the debt ceiling. And the reason why the people of the United States have not heard of this controversy is because the normal course of business constitutionally is for the Congress to consult with the Treasury. the Treasury to consult with the Congress. and the debt ceiling is raised in a manner that protects the general welfare of the American people. But now we have a proposal that is driven by polling and brinksmanship. This is not the way to run a country. I heard a comedian some years ago say. What a great country. We are a great country. I love America. The Constitution emphasizes the greatness of this Nation. but we dont play politics with something that is the ordinary course of business. Spending cuts is the responsible way to govern. but it is to govern in a way that we sit at the table of reconciliation and we dont break the backs of seniors who utilize Medicare and Social Security and veterans benefits. What we do is we sit at the table and we understand how to deal with the oncoming issue of the deficit. How do we do that? We do it with growth. But the Constitution has nothing in here that suggests. under this article. that we are to do brinksmanship and do 2 weeks or 3 weeks or to May. What happens in May. a crisis where we cant pay our military? The debt ceiling is paying the debt. and I am troubled by the fact that we would use this tactic. I want bipartisanship. In fact. someone who raises issues about the vulnerable. like myself. has worked with my Republican friends. I look forward to do it. Im an American. I believe in the Constitution. but you do not raise the debt ceiling in increments. The administration says. We wont stop it. but we want a longterm increase so that we can begin the rebuilding of this Nation. Growth. the Constitution. thats what we should be talking about. making America better.",

We need job creation. We need to be able to reduce the debt of this country. The President is well aware. were well aware here in Congress that each of the years that the President has been our President he increased spending. He wants a massive tax increase. and we have a deficit. We have a deficit of $1.3 trillion each of these years. Were trying to work together. Were trying to. as the President said as he addressed a luncheon just an hour after he was sworn in. that he wants to learn from some of the things that hes done and he wants to do better. Some of doing that better is a chance to perhaps reassess: Did I do the right thing the first time? Did I do the right thing when I continue to raise taxes and demand that we do that? Higher taxes diminish jobs and opportunity and growth in this country. and thats why we are trying to suggest openly. Mr. President. lets grow some jobs. Lets do the things I think that are more in line with what President George W. Bush did. who is referred to as No. 43 in Dallas. Texas. No. 43 had 60 straight months of economic growth. with the underpinning of reducing taxes so that Americans would go and work harder and see the incentive for creating jobs and would want to buy into the philosophy that the harder that we work. our country benefits. The underpinnings of Social Security. of Medicare. of Medicaid. systems that are very important to our country. reducing the number of people who have to receive government assistance is what happens when you have job growth. protecting the longterm interests of this country and growing the American Dream. The gentlewoman from Houston is absolutely correct. And the methodology towards getting there is not higher taxes. and it is not higher spending. It is giving more freedom and opportunity. It is having a reduced size of government. not a bigger government. It is giving people an opportunity to have fewer rules and regulations. not more rules and regulations. So the process that the Republican Party believes in deeply is the rights of individuals. freedom and opportunity. and reducing the size of government. which gives more people opportunities to empower their freedom and opportunity for their American Dream. Its part of what were doing here today. I think we believe and I think it works.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 325. the No Budget. No Pay Act of 2013. This legislation directs Members of the House and Senate to adopt a budget resolution by April 15. 2013. If either body does not adopt a budget resolution by April 15. 2013. Members of that body will have their pay withheld until they pass a budget. Its simple: no budget. no pay. The American people understand that they dont get paid if they dont do their job. and neither should Members of Congress. In addition. to ensure the complete and timely payment of the obligations of the U.S. Government. this legislation allows Treasury to issue debt between the date of enactment and May 18. 2013. However. Treasury may only issue enough debt necessary to pay bills coming due before May 18. I want to be perfectly clear on this point: this bill does not allow Treasury to run up an unlimited amount of debt between now and May 18. The debt authorized under this bill must be tied to bills coming due during that timeframe. Further. on May 19. a new debt limit is automatically established. So thats what this bill does. The larger question is. why are we even talking about the debt and debt limit? Our Nations debt is not just some abstract number. It has a direct impact on American families. During the Presidents fiscal commission. the SimpsonBowles Commission. we heard nonpartisan testimony that when the debt is this large in comparison to the economy. it costs the country the equivalent of about 1 million jobs. Think about that. If Washington got its debt and spending under control. then 1 million more Americans would be working today. And if that wasnt sobering enough. Fitch Ratings recently warned that the failure to come up with a plan for reducing our debt would likely still result in a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. A lower credit rating is sure to mean higher interest rates. That means higher credit card payments. higher car payments. higher student loans. and certainly higher mortgage payments. Despite these nonpartisan warnings. the Democratcontrolled Senate has not produced a budget in more than 1.300 days. Thats 4 years without a budget. How can we begin to get our debt under control when Democrats wont even produce a budget? This bill is the first step in forcing Democrats to put forward a budget so we can start holding Washington accountable for its outofcontrol spending. Every day. American families have to make decisions about their household finances. They have to adjust their spending to cover a whole host of things: groceries. student loan payments. braces for children. and a replacement for that aging refrigerator. Of course. they cant buy everything they want. Every day. they have to make tough choices. Its time for Congressthe House and the Senateto make some tough choices. To be honest. Mr. Speaker. this isnt a tough choice where I come from. Where I grew up. if you didnt do your job. you didnt get paid. Its time for Congress to start living with the same facts of life everyone else in America has to live with. I support the No Budget. No Pay Act because it brings back a bit of accountability and common sense to Washington. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

House Republicans continue to play with economic fire. Theyre playing political games with the debt ceiling. and that undermines certainty. Yesterday. economist Simon Johnson of MIT testified before our committee saying that a shortterm increase would only extend uncertainty. He said: You will continue to undermine the private sector. You will continue to delay investment and to reduce employment relative to what it would be otherwise. Lets. for a second. remember history. the last time the House Republicans played political games with the debt ceiling. In August 2011. our economy produced the lowest job growth in 3 years. During that 2month period. the Dow Jones plummeted 2.000 points. including one of its worst singleday drops in history635 points on August 8. S&P downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time in history. Leading Republicans in June. 2011. criticized the notion of a shortterm debt ceiling increase as providing a lack of certainty. The majority leader said: We feel very strongly that one of the reasons why we continue to see an ailing economy is that people have very little confidence. have very little certainty in terms of where we are headed. Our Ways and Means chairman echoed that feeling only days later saying about the prospect of a shortterm debt ceiling increase. It does not give you certainty. This bill does not give certainty. but uncertainty. The action we took New Years Day to avoid the fiscal cliff brought our total deficit reduction over the past 2 years to $2.5 trillion. Whats more. it set the stage for future further balanced agreements that include both spending cuts and new revenue. We should proceed with that effort. not plunge into further uncertainty.

When I grew up in Wisconsin. if you had a job and you did the work. then you got paid. If you didnt do the work you didnt get paid. Its that simple. Heres the point. We have a law. and its called the Budget Control Act. It requires that Congress pass a budget by April 15. All were saying is: Congress. follow the law. Do your work. Budget. The reason for this extension is so that we can have the debate we need to have. Its been a onesided debate. The House of Representatives has passed budgets. The other body. the Senate. hasnt passed a budget for almost 4 years. We owe our constituents more than that. We owe them solutions. When both parties put their solutions on the table. then we can have a good and clear debate about how to solve the problem. The problem is not going away no matter how much we wish it away. The problem of debt. of deficits. of a debt crisis is here.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. This resolution contains some good news. but lots of bad news for the American people. The good news is that our congressional Republican colleagues have finally recognized that America must pay its bills and meet its financial obligations without condition. The bad news is they only want to do that for 3 months. Just read the title: To ensure the complete and timely payment of the obligations of the United States Government until May If its a good idea to maintain the obligations of the U.S. Government between now and May 19. it sure is a good idea to make sure that we meet the obligations of the U.S. Government beyond that. And by setting up what amounts to another fiscal cliff. all our Republican colleagues are doing is prolonging economic uncertainty. For the last 2 years. weve heard from our Republican colleagues that economic uncertainty is bad for the economy. Guess what? It is. Yet thats exactly what youre doing. another big dose of economic uncertainty. This is a political effort simply to increase their negotiating strategy leverage 3 months from now at the expense of jobs in the economy and the American people. How do we know its at the expense of jobs in the economy? Because we saw what happened in August of 2011. As the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee said. it was the worst month in terms of jobs. We saw our credit rating downgraded. and both GAO and the Bipartisan Policy Center have said it cost the taxpayers over $1 billion. So thats all were doing right now. another dose of uncertainty. To my friend and colleague. the chairman of the Budget Committee. yes. we need budgets. yes. we need to reduce our longterm deficits. Thats never been the issue. The issue is how. We believe weve got to make targeted cuts in reforms. but we also believe we need to eliminate a lot of the tax breaks and loopholes that we heard a lot from our colleagues about in order to reduce the deficit in a balanced way. If you dont do that. you sock it to everybody else in the country. Lets pass a balanced approach to reducing our deficit. and not one that takes it out at the expense of our kids and our seniors.",

Two branches of the government have responsibility for the budget. and there are three pieces to those two branches. The White House is onethe administration needs to produce a budget. the House Republicans need to produce a budget. and the Senate Democrats need to produce a budget for the system to work. Even though we may not agree with it on this side of the aisle. the President has produced his budget. Its increased our deficit from $11.4- to $16.4 trillion or $16.5 trillion. And some people at home may not really grasp the concept of $16 trillion. Lets just talk about $1 trillion. If we spent a dollar a second. Mr. Speaker. how long would it take us to spend that $1 trillion? It would take 36.000 years. We are 16 of those in debt. Its time for the Senate to do their job. Even though Admiral Mullen has said our greatest national security threat is our deficit. and even though the Senate has raised their right hand and took an oath to protect and defend this great Nation of ours and defend the Constitution. they still have not acted. They still have not done their job to protect and defend. to uphold the oath that they took. Again. Admiral Mullen has saidand I repeatthat national security is at great risk because of our $16 trillion deficit. Look. you own a home and you have a $50.000ayear job and youre making your payments on a car and a house and youre thinking things are going just fine. but I want to add to that. Im going to buy a new big screen TV. Im going to put a pool table in. Im going to buy two more cars. Im going to put a pool in the back. Im just going to fix the place up. All the sudden you realize. I cant pay for it. You have some options available. You have to raise revenue. You go out and get two or three more jobs maybe. or your wife goes to work or your kids have to go to work. And that still doesnt meet your responsibilities. Then you have to stop spending. right? Stop spending. The only other option now is to get rid of some of the stuff you cant pay for because even though you might have stopped spending and youve taken another job and youve raised some revenue. now youve got to get rid of stuff.",

Im proud to have. over the course of the past year. been advocating consistently for no budget. no pay in this House. The hardworking men and women that I represent wouldnt be paid if they didnt show up and they didnt do their job. or they didnt get their job done on time.

Theyre stringing the American public along so they can set up yet another dramatic showdown that only hurts our recovery.

And yes. there is certainty. because the Senate majority leader just announced they will take up this bill and pass it. And I think every American understands that we must get our debt and deficit under control. Weve had over $5 trillion in increases in deficits in the Obama administrationalmost a 50 percent increase in our national debt. And let me just say that we have had many shortterm increases in the debt limit over time. What was business as usual when the Democrats were in the majority? We had nine shortterm debt increasesthree of them in 1987 and six of them in 1990before longer. more permanent debt limit increases were made. So what was business as usual for the Democrats they now call \"flirting dangerously\" for Republicans. I think it is very important we move forward on increasing the debt limit for this limited period of time while we can then address the issues that will help affect our longterm debts and deficits. including the sequester and the continuing resolution. When the longterm debt of the United States was lowered to a AAplus rating on August 5. 2011. they said that the downgrade. which was after the Budget Control Act was passed. reflected their opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the administration recently agreed tomeaning the Budget Control Actfalls short of what. in our view. would be necessary to stabilize the governments mediumterm debt dynamics. meaning we didnt do enough to address the drivers of our longterm debt. We must do that. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 325. to support the No Budget. No Pay Act. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 325. the No Budget. No Pay Act. The Budget Act of 1974 requires each House of Congress to pass a budget each year by April 15. This is important. of course. because the budget that we pass is our blueprint. literally. for how were going to spend the hardearned tax dollars that the American people send here to Washington to run our Nation. Today. we are in a situation where the United States Senate has not passed a budget in nearly 4 full years. leaving the American people with no idea of how the Senate intends to deal with the fiscal crisis that is facing our Federal Government. In the time since the Senate last passed a budget. the Federal Government has experienced deficits of over $1 trillion each and every year. and we have added more than $5 trillion to our national debt. Obviously. this is a very serious fiscal crisis. and the American people are demanding answers. This legislation will allow us room to begin working on a solution that will put our Nation on a much more sound financial footing. This bill will extend our Nations borrowing authority for 90 days to give each House of Congress. the House and the Senate. the needed time to do what they are legally required to do. which is to pass a budget to show the American people how we intend to deal with the many challenges that we face. But while giving Congress time to do its work. it also has a very important caveat associated with it that says. if we dont do what we are required to do by law. that we will not be paid. Simply put: no budget. no pay. This idea actually came. Madam Speaker. from previous bipartisan efforts to bring fiscal responsibility to Washington. And now the President has indicated that if it reaches his desk. he will sign it. that he does not oppose it. As well. there have been very promising indications coming out of the United States Senate from many Democratic Members that they will also step up. after 4 long years of inaction. and put forward a budget. I believe that this can be the impetus today for us to begin working together to make the difficult decisions to finally address our fiscal challenges. Today. we can send that very strong message to the American people with a bipartisan vote to show that we are willing to put our paychecks on the line to meet these challenges. Now. some are concerned about whether or not this legislation is constitutional because of the 27th Amendments restriction that the pay of Members of Congress cannot be variedthat is really the operative phrase of that amendment. \"varied\"-that it can neither be raised nor reduced until another election has taken place. This bill. Madam Speaker. was carefully crafted to comply with the requirements of the 27th Amendment. So this is how it will work: If either the House or the Senate does not pass a budget by April 15. the deadline. then beginning on April 16. the pay for Members of that Chamber will be placed into an escrow account and will only be paid when that Chainbereither the House or the Senatehas passed a budget or when we reach the end of the 113th Congress. The amount that Members are paid will not be reduced nor will it be raised. so we stay in strict compliance with the terms of the 27th Amendment. There is no requirement in the 27th Amendment which states that Members have to be paid weekly. biweekly. monthly. or bimonthly or what have you. only that the pay that they receive will not vary. Now. some have suggested that the escrow account into which the Member pay would be deposited should bear interest so that that could then. as well. be paid to the Members. This cannot happen because that would actually cause Member pay to increase. of course. It would then vary their pay. which would not be in compliance with the strict terms of the 27th Amendment. So I am extremely hopeful. Madam Speaker. that we will successfully conclude our work in a timely basis here in the House. and I hope that this additional provision. as well. encourages the Senate to also complete our important work and pass a budget. What we are suggesting certainly is not unreasonable. Ill tell you. I come from southeast Michigan. and one thing I can tell you that is true about the people that I am honored to serve is that they get up every single day. every morning and work hard all day. every day. They simply do not understand how Congress can fail to do our job for almost 4 yearsno budget out of the Senate for almost 4 yearsand yet suffer no consequences. The American people are demanding that their Members of Congress deal effectively with the challenges we face. Our problems are real. and its time for real solutions or real consequences. The concept. again. very simple: no budget. no pay. When times are tight. you balance your checkbook. When you run out of money. you stop spending. When your credit card is maxed out. you cut it up or get a plan together to pay it off. And if you dont do your job. you dont get paid. These are the principles. Madam Speaker. that Americans live by. and we certainly should be no exception. So I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This bill is not a serious or viable attempt to address the debt ceiling issue and is merely another way to avoid dealing with the difficult choices we need to make. We have been here before. We know what happens when we govern with this kickthecandowntheroad mentality. The most troubling effect. again. is the constitutionality of this bill is also dangerously unclear. I was not on the floor last week when my colleagues read the Constitution. Maybe they didnt reach the 27th Amendment. I am not a constitutional attorney. I am not an attorney in any way. and I make no apologies for that. But its real easy: No law. varying the compensation for the services of the Senators or Representatives. shall take effect. until an election of the Representatives shall have intervened. \"Varying\" is the. again. as my friend did say. operative word. If you arent getting a paycheck in a month and youre going to wait for 18 months. thats varying. So it could beand. in my opinion. it isa constitutional problem. But be that as it may. I do commend the majority for recognizing that Congress must pay its bills. that raising the debt ceiling isnt about spending more money. its about paying for bills we already incurred. There is widespread. bipartisan acknowledgement of how difficult and serious the fiscal challenges before us have become. However. this proposal is just another attempt to yet again put the discussion off for another day. Madam Speaker. I came here and I saw the sign. \"No Budget. No Pay.\" It probably should say. \"No Budget. Delayed Pay.\" but it sounds better when you say \"No Budget. No Pay.\" That means we may not be getting paid. but were going to get paid. it will be delayed. but were going to get paid. Every year in this house we do pass a budget. although. its a budget that I cant vote for. Its a budget that hurts the middle class. the working class. the wanttobeworking class. and it also hurts the American peoples safety net. We know again this year we will pass that budget. So our friends on the other side of the aisle are putting up a No Budget. No Pay quite well knowing that they will probably pass their budget and we probably will get paid. On another thought. as my good friend. Mr. DOYLE. from Pittsburgh has said to me. why not no gun control. no pay? Why not no immigration reform. no pay? Why not no DISCLOSE Act. no pay? So.

I would just point out that none of those are required by law. as passing a budget is required by law. Also. there was some comment again about the significance of the 27th Amendment. I would just add quickly a statement from David Rivkin. Jr.. and Lee Casey. These are two constitutional attorneys that served in former administrations who say the bill passes muster. Their comment: It does not vary Members compensation instead holding it in escrow until such time that a budget is passed or. at the latest. this Congress comes to an end. It is attentive to the text and structure of the Constitution. And just one other quote. This is from another constitutional attorney. a Greg Watsonactually. a gentleman who rallied the support to pass the 27th Amendment. I will proudly point out. in 1992 it was my State of Michigan that put it over the threefourths threshold. But at any rate. he said: Nowhere in such a proposal do I see any violation of the terms and provisions of the 27th Amendment. Such a proposal does not vary the dollar amount of compensation to Members of Congress. The proposal merely delays the disbursement of that dollar amount.",

The bill does not vary the amount of compensation and is. therefore. constitutional. It only changes when Representatives and Senators are paid if they fail to adopt a budget resolution. as required by law. Currently. Representatives are paid monthly and Senators are paid twice a month. This bill simply says. if the House does not adopt a budget resolution. the Members of that House. instead. get paid at the end of that term of Congress. In 1789. James Madison. when he introduced the 27th Amendment. spoke of preventing changes in compensation from being for the benefit of those determining them. The clear purpose of the amendmentwhich. as we know. was not ratified until 1992was to prevent Members from drawing higher salaries from the public treasury without giving voters an opportunity to speak on that decision. This bill does not benefit Members at the expense of taxpayers. and it is consistent with the provisions of the 27th Amendment.",

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. for their leadership and the clarity they have brought to the debate on the floor today. Its a curiosity what we have on the floor today. Its a subterfuge to distract from the matter at hand. Madam Speaker. once again. as has happened too often in the last 2 years. we have come to the floor at a moment when our Republican colleagues are threatening the full faith and credit of the United States of America and putting the stability of our economy on the line. Too often. families and small businesses have faced uncertainty about the debt ceiling. funding our national government. our Tax Code. and the rest. Three months. Where is the certainty in 3 months? We should not even be having a debate. There should be no doubt that the full faith and credit of the United States will be honored. and that is what our Constitution says. Too often. House Republicans have refused to acknowledge the negative impact of their action. choosing to return to the same tired. failed strategy. one that only serves to. again. weaken our economy and undermine our middle class. That track record must end. Now. Im hearing people say that we should go down this path of least resistance. Thats what I call it. Its an easy way out. 3 months. But the fact is that that is a path to even more problems and. as Mr. CROWLEY has said. a path to another cliff. Our country needs a clean. longterm debt ceiling increase and a bipartisan. balanced budget that protects Medicare and Social Security. invests in the future. and responsibly reduces the deficit. We all know that. We know that as we go forward to reduce the deficit we need growth in job creation. we need spending cuts. and we need revenue. Democrats have already agreed to $1.6 trillion in spending cuts. Democrats have already agreed to more than $1 trillion in Medicare savings to strengthen Medicare and to protect beneficiaries and not to affect their benefits. Democrats and Republicans came together to avert the fiscal cliff and raise revenues by delinking the tax cut for the high end from the tax cut for the middle class. We all agree that more can and must be done to get our fiscal house in order. But we must face the facts. Real. lasting deficit reduction will only be achieved through an approach that is balanced. fair. and focused on jobs and the prosperity of our middle class. Unfortunately. this bill on the floor today fails to meet those standards. Americans and Members of Congress should remember two words about this legislationtwo words: three months. Three months. Thats how long Republicans are prepared to raise the debt ceiling. Today they really dont even address the debt ceiling issuethree months. But Republican leaders are doing more. They have made promises to their fellow Republicans. to get their vote. to even go beyond the Ryan budget. This is like the Ryan budget on steroids. They have called this bill No Budget. No Pay. But who pays under the Republican budget? Seniors pay. ending the Medicare guarantee. Seniors. children. and people with disabilities pay. cutting Medicaid. Children pay because it will cut investments in their education. in their future. in their selffulfillment. in the competitiveness of our country in the global economy. Veterans pay because of the gutting of our domestic spending priorities. I dont think that we should ever link what we do here as to whether people get paid. We have a lot of work to do here. This linkage is a gimmick. its a joke. and its not right. Its designed to put people on the spot and say. you dont get paid. and in order to get paid. in order for Members of Congress to get paid. you must cut benefits for seniors and their Medicare guarantee. Medicaid and the rest. Its a false link. It shouldnt even be there in the first place. and it is wrong. Again. this proposal is a missed opportunity. It does not relieve the uncertainty faced by small businesses. the markets. and the middle class. It is a gimmick unworthy of the fiscal and economic challenges that we face. This proposal does not have certainty. It does not have growth. and it does not have my support. I urge a \"no\" vote.",

No Pay came from a Nashvillian who approached me two years ago and said. \"I dont get paid if I dont do my job. and do it on time. Why should Congress be any different?\" I agreed. and I introduced No Budget. No Pay in 2011 during the last Congress with the help of the important nonpartisan reform group No Labels. I reintroduced the bill. H.R. 310. last Friday. with 48 original cosponsors. 19 Democrats and 29 Republicans. The purpose of No Budget. No Pay is to get Congress to do its essential budgeting work on time. This means payforperformance. a new concept here on Capitol Hill. Getting the job done on time is a fundamental American principle yet one that has been forgotten in our nations Capitol. Our No Budget. No Pay proposal aligns incentives of elected officials with those of our citizens back home so that we will start completing our work on time in order to get paid. The purpose of this bill is not punishment. but performance. We are in an interesting parliamentary situation today because. after stonewalling by both political parties. the Republican Party has now. suddenly and without hearings. adopted a diluted version of No Budget. No Pay for immediate floor consideration. Thankfully. the Democratic Party has decided not to make this a partisan issue. freeing members to vote as their conscience tells them.

But the important point is that reform of Congress is long overdue. and this is the way to start. with a new type of reform that brings Congress back in line with the values and the work ethic of the American people.

It frustrates me to no end that my Republican colleagues still have not learned their lesson from their earlier failures on matters of similar character. The American people want results. not political gimmicks. which is precisely what this bill is. H.R. 325 does nothing to ensure the longterm stability of markets. promote sustainable economic growth. and protect the credit rating of the United States. Very much the opposite. it is a \"gotcha bill\" that allows House Republicans to thumb their noses at the Senate and blame it for faults in which House Republicans share. I have never been a great lover of the other body. but now is not the time for petulant antics. Now is the time for action in the public interest. I urge my colleagues to vote down H.R. 325. We have time enoughthough not muchto negotiate a bipartisan increase to the debt ceiling that is not just another stopgap measure creating new problems and risks in the immediate future. That will require good faith and hard work by all who choose to be involved. I choose so. and I hope my colleagues do as well.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. this measure will continue to ensure funding for all federal government obligations and allow the government to continue its day to day operations through May of 2013. The U.S. Constitution is clear on the subject of the debt limit. Section 4 of the 14th Amendment states in clear language that: \"the validity of the public debt of the United States . . . shall not be questioned.\" The American people and our economy are being held hostage to gimmicks driven by polls. and unfettered brinkmanship. On the cusp of the inauguration of our 44th Presidenta glorious occasionthe people deserve better. Americans want a clean debt limit increase. which has been done numerous times. but the normal process by which the Treasury Secretary consults with the President and Congress seems to have hit a major roadblock. This obstructionist governing is based on a practice that seems to put ideology over pragmatism. The President has stated: \"The Administration supports a longterm increase in the debt limit that would increase certainty and economic stability. . . Instead of shortterm management of selfinflicted fiscal crises. the President believes there is now an opportunity to strengthen the economy by putting the Nation on a sounder fiscal path. Progress has already been made towards that goal.\" I would hope that my colleagues on the other side realize that these are trying times for the American people and brinkmanship is not the answer. This body must come up with a sensible solution to the pressing financial problems which plague our economy. It is truly shameful that during the beautiful transcendent inaugural weekend. in which many of my Houston constituents were able to come and enjoy Washington. DC. hospitality. capped off by the celebration of Dr. Martin Luther Kings birthday. Congress is back to the same bad sportsmanship which has crippled this body to the point of gridlock. The measure provides funding authority for the first five months of 2013. through May 2013. to allow the government to service debts and obligations which we have previously incurred. This legislation is filled with gimmickry because it would require House Members salaries to be held in escrow if we House do not adopt a budget resolution and Senators salaries to be held in escrow if the Senate doesnt do the same. It appears that my colleagues on the right have opted for form over substance. We cannot continue to hold our Nation hostage. keeping the benefits of recipients of Social Security. Medicaid. and Medicare who have must have sleepless nights because they are worried about the disappearance of their monthly checks. I support a longterm increase in the debt limit that would increase certainty and economic stability. The bill before us this morning. H.R. 325. is a shortterm measure with unnecessary complications. needlessly perpetuating uncertainty in the Nations fiscal system. though I would note that the Obama administration has given somewhat tepid support. and only because H.R. 325 lifts the immediate threat of default and indicates that my Congressional Republican colleagues have backed off an insistence on holding the Nations economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare. education. and other programs that middleclass families depend on. My colleagues want to buy time so that they can figure out how to squeeze the American taxpayer even more by devising bonecrunching cuts and slashes to entitlement programsall of which is driven by rabid ideologyas opposed to sitting down and working with Democrats to come up with reasonable budget reforms which do not hurt seniors and the disadvantaged. That is why Madam Speaker. I submitted an Amendment to the Rules Committee yesterday which: \"Establishes that it is the sense of Congress that the safety net for the most vulnerable among us. the 15.1 percent of Americans living below the poverty line which includes 21 percent of our nations children. must be protected in any budget negotiations.\" Madam Speaker. Social Security is currently the only source of income for nearly twothirds of older American households receiving benefits. and roughly onethird of those households depend on Social Security for nearly all of their income. Half of those 65 and older have annual incomes below $18.500. and many older Americans have experienced recent and significant losses in retirement savings. pensions. and home values. Today. every dollar of the average Social Security retirement benefit of about $14.800 is absolutely critical to the typical beneficiary. Contrary to some claims. Social Security is not the cause of our nations deficit problem. Not only does the program operate independently. but it is prohibited from borrowing. Social Security must pay all benefits from its own trust fund. If there are insufficient funds to pay out full benefits. benefits are automatically reduced to the level supported by the programs own revenues. For reasons like these. I may not oppose a shortterm solution to the debt limit and look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues here in the House and the Senate to provide certainty and foment stability for the economy. I would add that instead of shortterm management of selfinflicted fiscal crises. I truly believe we have an opportunity to strengthen the economy by putting the Nation on a sounder fiscal path. Progress has already been made towards that goal. In 2011. the President signed into law $1.4 trillion in spending reductions. not counting additional savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to seize this template and move forwardnot backwards. The fiscal agreement the President signed at the beginning of January increased revenue from highincome households by over $600 billion. Together with interest savings. these two steps will cut the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion over the next decade. We should have done more to address our revenue problem. The President has made clear that he remains willing to work with both parties in the Congress to budget responsibly and to achieve additional deficit reduction consistent with the principles of balance. shared growth. and shared opportunity. The President has also made clear that he will not have another debate with the Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they have already racked up through the laws that they passed. The President has made clear that the Congress has only two optionspay their bills. or fail to do so and put the Nation into default. And I am in complete agreement. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center. spending for Medicare and Medicaid is projected to increase from 21 percent of noninterest federal spending in 2010 to 31 percent by 2020. The numbers are wonkish sounding but in terms of real dollars. the increase is mammoth. That is why we must address the spending issue in earnest but not using the paltry monthly income of seniors to pay for yachts for millionaires. National spending on health care has grown about 2 percentage points per year faster than GDP over time. Federal revenues. however. have not kept pace. growing at roughly the same rate as GDP. As a result. federal deficits will be driven upward by federal health programs unless their rate of growth is tamed. This discrepancy must be dealt with sooner rather than later. but no matter how you couch it. there is no better translation than the word: broke. I hasten to add that community health centers provide much needed. highquality healthcare to over 20 million Americans. These centers are able to serve vulnerable portions of the American population. including racial and ethnic minorities. as well as rural and lowincome Americans. I want to give some pertinent facts about my district and why the certainty provided by H.R. 325 is so important. The HoustonSugar LandBaytown Metropolitan Area consists of 10 counties: Austin. Brazoria. Chambers. Fort Bend. Galveston. Harris. Liberty. Montgomery. San Jacinto and Waller. The Houston metro area: It ranks sixth among U.S. metropolitan statistical areas with a population of 5.867.489 as of mid2009. and it covers more than 10.000 square miles. and has a gross product of $403.8 billion. according to The Perryman Group. This area recorded 2.54 million payroll jobs in November 2010. more than the job counts of 31 U.S. states. including Arizona. Colorado and Alabama. The Houston economy has experienced a resurgence but lets remember the economic history: The recession hit Houston in September 08. Our region lost 152.800 jobs through January 10. We began to recoup jobs starting in February that year and by October 11. the region had gained 153.000 jobs. or 101.1 percent of what we lost in the recession. And though Houston faces some challenges in the near term. the longterm outlook is bright. The challenges are those of managing growth rather than economic stagnation. The longterm outlook for the Houston metro area is positive. and steady growth will be the norm for Houston for the foreseeable future. What Houston cannot afford right now is continued uncertainty from Washington. D.C. Moreover. given the uncertainty of final funding decisions and the possibility that acrosstheboard spending cuts will occur in March unless Congress and the President can reach agreement to prevent the currently scheduled \"sequester.\" it is critical that we work towards bipartisan solutions to our nations financial woes. Given the U.S. economy is showing signs of progress. it is crucial that we continue to fund government programs without interruption. Lastly. as a Senior Member of the Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees I understand the importance of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection mission to enforce drug. trade and travel laws in efforts to keep our borders safe. and the importance of ensuring that our nation remains safe from terrorists and others who would do harm to our nation. In summation. I urge my colleagues to reject this polldriven exercise in futility and give a clean debt ceiling vote so that the American people can carryon with the business of achieving prosperity. This is not a new law. new outlay. or some random exercise in the fulfillment of the Obama Doctrine. In fact. according to the Congressional Research Service. since March 1962. Congress has enacted 76 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt. Typically. the Treasury Secretary consults with the President and Congress. and the limit has been subsequently raised to accommodate our fiscal needs. And I close with the sacred words from our Constitution. Section 4 of the 14th Amendment states in clear language that: \"the validity of the public debt of the United States . . . shall not be question.\" And the President himself was transparent and sincere when he stated: \"H.R. 325 would temporarily allow the Congress to fund commitments to which it has already agreed. A temporary solution is not enough to remove the threat of default that Republicans in the Congress have held over the economy. The Congress should commit to paying its bills and pass a longterm clean debt limit increase that lifts selfinflicted and unnecessary uncertainty from the Nations economy.\" I echo President Obamas words and wish that this House gets its house in order.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. this is the final amendment to the bill. which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted. the bill will be amended and immediately proceed to final passage. I appreciate that the Republican leadership has put forward legislation that would raise the Nations debt ceiling. agreeing that it is not an option for the United States to default on its obligations. I also support that Members of Congress should not be paid if they do not do their jobs. part of which is to pass a responsible budget. but I do not agree with the political gamesmanship of. once again. playing politics with our serious fiscal issues and using shortterm gimmicks rather than working to find longterm solutions. We need to stop playing games with the debt ceiling and spend our time and energy on job creation. I supported a clean debt limit bill. However. because in this version congressional pay has been tied directly to passing a budget. it is important to ensure that the budget that is passed is responsible and protects our most vulnerable citizens. My amendment would not kill the underlying legislation. It would merely add commonsense protections to the bill for members of our Armed Forces. our veterans. and our seniors from the budgetcutting process. Anyone who supports the underlying legislation has no reason to not also support this amendment. If adopted. the debt limit would still be raised to allow the government to pay its obligations through May 19. and Members of Congress would still have their pay withheld if they fail to agree to a budget resolution by April 15. The amendment simply clarifies that the budget resolution protects our troops. veterans. and seniors. I recently visited the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center and spoke with both veterans and staff. I heard their very real fears that their benefits. which they fought for. would be threatened by the political gamesmanship in Washington. I saw that same anxiety in the eyes of seniors I recently spoke to from Nettles Island on the Treasure Coast. who worry that cuts to Medicare and the privatization of Social Security could lead to a choice between a meal or medicine. After hearing these concerns. I expressed time and time again throughout my district that I could not understand why anyone would oppose amending the underlying legislation to ensure veterans. troops. and seniors are protected from devastating cuts. Madam Speaker. this amendment language should have the full support of the House. It simply states that we cannot cut benefits for veterans or members of the Armed Forces or cut benefits for seniors and that we will not gamble our grandparents futures on Wall Street or turn Medicaid into a forprofit voucher system designed more to help out the big corporations than those who are struggling or disabled. I also want to express my disappointment that the underlying legislation is another shortterm fix when our country needs longterm solutions. I spoke to several business groups last week. and they want stability from our government. If they had certainty. they would begin investing capital back into our economy rather than sitting on it. Our dysfunctional Congress is to blame for slowing our recovery. Now is the time to work together with courage and purpose and come to a grand bargain that will protect Americas greatness for generations to come. Our Nation cannot afford to continue down the path of such fiscal irresponsibility. Such piecemeal approaches will not address our countrys longterm fiscal health. Rather. we must look at reducing spending. generating revenue. lowering unemployment. addressing the longterm sustainability of Social Security and Medicare. and creating additional economic growth through job creation. A real fix to Americas longterm fiscal issues and deficit reduction can only come by truly coming to the table without personal agendas and with the recognition that America needs less political gamesmanship and more leadership. Unfortunately. the underlying legislation in its current form falls short of what our country desperately needs. That is why I hope my amendment will be adopted here today as a first step towards putting aside partisanship and. instead. protecting our veterans. troops. and seniors. While the underlying legislation is not perfect and while it is not the grand bargain we were hoping for. it would show that there is willingness in the 113th Congress for compromise. As we move forward from the debate over the debt limit and on to other pressing fiscal issues. we can no longer settle for shortterm approaches to our public policy but. instead. work together to come to the grand bargains that will ensure America continues to be the greatest country for generations to come. Madam Speaker. my amendment is an opportunity to show the American people that this Congress is willing to work together and compromise to address our fiscal issues and to protect our troops. veterans. and seniors. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my commonsense amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.",

This debate belongs when we do the budget. Were not at the budget yet. Look. Im glad people are excited about actually debating a budget. Thats wonderful. Lets hold that enthusiasm until we actually are debating a budget. The purpose of this bill is to actually get us to have that debate. to have a budget. Whats frustrating for Democrats and Republicans in the House. I would like to say. is that the other body hasnt been doing a budget for 4 years. The minority. to their credit. brought a budget to the floor. The majority has brought a budget to the floor and passed it both of the last 2 years. The Senate. no budget. So what we decided to do was to take a piece of legislation from the minority. from a member of the minoritythe No Budget. No Pay legislationand add it to this so that we can get to debating this Nations fiscal house. which is not in order. Madam Speaker. So all I would say is we should defeat this motion to recommit. It is premature. and it is prejudging a budget that does not yet exist. So lets get rid of this motion to recommit and be serious about this shortterm extension so that we can make sure that we have the debate we deserve. How are we going to prevent a debt crisis? How are we going to balance the budget? How are we going to have growth and opportunity in this society? How are we going to save Medicare? How are we going to make sure that we can pay our bills and stop our government from living beyond its means? How are we going to secure a future for our children and our grandchildren? Thats the debate surrounding the budget. This is premature. It applies to a budget that hasnt even been written yet and which will be written on a baseline that doesnt even exist yet.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when I graduated from Henry Clay High School in Lexington. Kentucky. just over 20 years ago. I had little notion that I would stand before you today occupying the seat which the Great Compromiser himself once held. Henry Clay was first elected to this House in 1811 becoming the only person elected as Speaker the same day he took office. During his remarkable four decades on the national stage. he steered America through a daunting array of crises. each of which might have shattered the Union absent his remarkable leadership. Indeed. Henry Clay demonstrated that an unwavering dedication to principle and a practical commitment to compromise are not incompatible values. They are. instead. the tools of statesmanship. the implements of progress. and the guardians of freedom. He was Abraham Lincolns \"beau ideal of a great man.\" Eulogizing Clay in 1852. Lincoln called him \"the man for a crisis.\" declaring that Clay \"desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen. but chiefly to show the world that freemen could be prosperous. Henry Clay understood the indispensable link between liberty. prosperity. and basic human dignity. His struggle to harness our system of checks and balances to serve these goals echoes across the generations. The process was messy. and the path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty. but the Great Compromiser governed in the national interest without comprising himself or forgetting who sent him there. Mr. Speaker. I am honored. indeed I am awed. by the legacy of Henry Clay and the exceptional men who followed him. but I did not come here as the selfstyled heir to that legacy. Instead. I came here as a father concerned about his childrens future. I came here as a Kentuckian determined to fight for my States signature industries. And I came here as an American committed to restoring the American Dream. My district. in central and eastern Kentucky. offers a panoramic view of the values. dreams. and passions that have animated our Nation since its beginnings. Historically anchored in Kentuckys bluegrass region. the Sixth District now extends to the Appalachian foothills. bordering the coalfields of the Cumberland Plateau. We are perhaps most recognized as the horse capital of the world. Indeed. the world came to Kentucky just over 2 years ago when Lexington hosted the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. Yet that event offers just the latest example of our States deep integration with the global economy. Georgetown. Kentucky. is home to the largest Toyota manufacturing facility outside of Japan. a facility which provides 7.000 wellpaying jobs that produces the Camry. the most popular Americanmade car in the United States. These jobs in turn rely upon some of the lowest electricity costs in the Nation. which Kentuckys coal industry makes possible. Having endured the astonishing assault of the war on coal during the last 4 years. Kentuckys coal industry continues to offer the reality of affordable energy today and the promise of an affordable. reliable. and clean source of American energy for centuries to come. Kentuckians are also capitalizing upon our States enormous potential for tourism through creative initiatives like the Bourbon Trail. which now draws an estimated 400.000 visitors every year. We are introducing the world to our special distilling heritage. The Sixth District offers a number of historic treasures. such as Daniel Boones settlement. Fort Boonesborough. and in Frankfort. even our new State capitol and executive mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Plus. tourists and residents alike can enjoy natural attractions of stunning majesty. such as Red River Gorge. Natural Bridge. and Cave Run. which provide almost limitless opportunities for outdoor recreation. The Sixth District also remains home to a diverse and thriving agricultural economy. We are best known for tobacco. but many people may not know that Kentucky possesses more head of cattle than any State east of the Mississippi. These industries are supported with colleges and universities filled with outstanding teaching and research professionals. Institutions like the University of Kentuckymy alma materEastern Kentucky University. Transylvania University. Kentucky State University. Georgetown College. Midway College. and the members of our community and technical college system. The University of Kentucky is wellknown for its proud tradition of college basketball. having won eight national championships. most recently in 2012. Underlying all of these success stories is the unique pride and attachment to place that distinguishes Kentuckians wherever you find us. Our States pioneer heritage survives as the wellspring of our determination to survive and excel against overwhelming odds. No matter the challenge. we will persevere. We will lead. And with Gods help. we will prosper together. Mr. Speaker. I am humbled beyond measure to represent a people who embody the spirit. the generosity. and the creativity that define Americas greatness. I pray that my service proves equal to their trust. Through the lens of time. Henry Clay appears larger than life. yet our Republic has a habit of producing the right men and women at the right time. Together. lets strive after Henry Clays model of leadership. Given the gravity of our challenge. each of us must. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. more than 4 months have passed since the terrorist attacks in Benghazi. which killed four Americans. including our ambassador. injured many others. and destroyed two U.S. facilities. Yet. despite the months that have passed. were hardly closer to bringing those responsible to justice than we were in the weeks immediately following the attack. Put bluntly. the lack of progress in identifying and hunting down the terrorists responsible is stunning. Consider the current state of the Obama administrations investigation and response to the attack: Four months later. the administration still cannot or will not name the terrorist groups responsible for the attacks or the names of these group leaders. Four months later. despite consulate video footage that many Members of Congress have seen and many eyewitnesses. not a single Benghazi terror suspect is in custody. Four months later. the FBI has had access to only one suspect. Ali Harzi. for just 3 hours. and the Tunisian Government kept the FBI team waiting for more than 5 weeks before finally granting access. Four months later. the administration still has not disclosed the serious connections between the groups behind the Benghazi attack and the leaders of the attack on the U.S. embassies in Cairo. Tunis. and Sanaa that same week of September 11. Four months later. following the release of the Pickering report on State Department failures leading up to the attack. not a single State Department employee has been fired and held responsible for their role in denying adequate security for the consulate in Benghazi. Four months later. despite Secretary Clintons September 21 declaration when she said. \"What happened was a terrorist attack. and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.\" this administration seems to have not only rested. but to have moved on and apparently hopes that the Congress and the American people will too. Just today. the New York Times is reporting: Several Egyptian members of the squad of militants that lay bloody siege to an Algerian gas complex last week also took part in the deadly attack on the United States Mission in Libya in September. Mr. Speaker. 4 months later. this is an unacceptable state of affairs. Quite frankly. the Obama administration has failed. They have failed to prioritize this investigation. They have failed to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Libyan. Tunisian. and Egyptian Governments. But more fundamentally. the administration has failed to respond to a terrorist attack appropriately. treating it as a law enforcement and diplomatic issue. rather than the security issue that it is. At its core. this is yet another reflection of President Obamas schizophrenic counterterrorism policy. the same administration that unapologetically rains down lethal drone attacks on some al Qaeda affiliate terrorists in Pakistan. Yemen. and Somalia and will not use other counterterrorism resources to identify. locate. and detain the terrorists involved in the death of our ambassador and others in Libya. This inconsistent policy may stem from the Presidents hasty campaign promise to shut down Guantanamo Bay in Gitmo and prematurely transfer detention facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. In doing so. the President effectively ended Americas ability to detain and interrogate terrorists. depriving the FBI. the CIA. and other agencies of critical opportunities to obtain information on al Qaeda networks. Today. as the case of Benghazi suspect Ali Harzi has demonstrated. the United States is completely reliant on the cooperation of host countries to detain on our behalf and selectively allow access to suspects. As in the case of Harzi. as demonstrated. this approach is fraught with diplomatic roadblocks. costing critical time in getting information from suspects to track terrorist networks. Perhaps that is why President Obama so often opts to use lethal drone strikes to kill terrorists. knowing that the U.S. would be unable to get access to interrogate these terror suspects by working through host governments or because he no longer has a way to detain them in U.S. custody short of providing them the full privileges of an article III court. In short. the President has tied his own hands. compromised U.S. national security and put the FBI in an impossible position. The FBI has been asked to treat the terrorist attack where four Americans died as if its a law enforcement activity and has been put in a compromised and very difficult spot. and they have laid the groundwork for the administrations inept response in the wake of the terrorist attack in Benghazi. To make matters worse. the administration has not even seen any significant success from its diplomaticfocused response. When Tunisia refused to allow the FBI access to Harzi for more than 5 weeks. the administration took no public steps to use diplomatic tools. like U.S. foreign assistance. to pressure the Tunisians to make Harzi available. In fact. the FBI only gained access after Members of Congress threatened amendments to cut off or restrict Tunisias foreign aid if they continued to obstruct the FBI investigation. I was among those Members of Congress along with LINDSEY GRAHAM and Senator MCCAIN and others. In the interim. I urged the administration to act immediately to suspend foreign assistance if the Tunisian Government persisted in obstructing the investigation. On January 4. I received a tepidand it was tepidresponse from the Acting Deputy Assistant Administrator for Legislative and Public Affairs at USAID with a bland assurance that the Tunisian Government was cooperating. Was cooperating? Five weeks and the FBI had to wait? Then the FBI had 3 hours to talk to him. and we gave this Tunisian Government. Mr. Speaker. $320 million last year? Days later. Ali Harzi was released. Today. I again wrote USAID. expressing my disappointment that the administrator himself could not respond directly to a Member of Congress who serves on a committee of jurisdiction and. further. pointed out what should be obviousthat the Tunisian Government did not cooperate. The Tunisian Government never seriously thought the aidprecious taxpayer moneywas in jeopardy. The Tunisian Government has not faced a single consequence for undermining U.S. national security. I submit my letter for the RECORD. Sadly. the failure to respond forcefully and appropriately to the Benghazi attack will undoubtedly encourage our enemies and make the world a more dangerous place for Americans working in hostile environments around the world. This failure to respond has endangered future Embassy staffs and Ambassadorsthe Federal employees who serve our country at great risk. Rather than demonstrating that there will be no quarter. no respite. no safe haven for terrorists who threaten American officials abroad. the message the administration has sent is that there is no apparent consequence for these actions. This will only embolden our enemy to plan the next Benghazi. knowing that under this administration there is less consequence even for their involvement in such an attack. In this context. perhaps it is not surprising that the al Qaedaaffiliated terrorist group Ansar alSharia brazenly took pictures of the FBI agents interviewing Harzi and posted pictures on their Web sites. and when the Tunisian Government released Harzi. Ansar alSharia was there to welcome him and post a video of the celebration of his release. Again. these antagonistic actions have been met by silence from this administration. As Steve Hayes and Tom Joscelyn reported in The Weekly Standard this week: U.S. officials tell The Weekly Standard that the release of the photos was a clear attempt to intimidate the Americans and show that the FBI could not act with impunity. In its posting. Ansar alSharia Tunisia warned the Tunisian people that their government had allowed the FBI \"to begin investigating your sons under postrevolutionary protection.\" Consider that. in the same week of the Benghazi attack. our Embassies in Cairo. Tunis and Sana were also overrun in an increasingly apparent coordinated plot. In each case. the American flag was ripped down and burned. and a black al Qaeda flag was flown in its place. We are fortunate and blessed that none of these incidents resulted in a loss of life. They were. nonetheless. an attack on America by hostile groups. As the administrations own State Department Web site states: \"Any attack on an Embassy is considered an attack on the country it represents.\" Each Embassy and consulate that was overrun the week of September 11 represents. in its own way. a public attack on America. and in the months that have followed. this administration has demonstrated that there are no consequences for breaching our Embassies or for killing our personnel. I fear that the latest hostagetaking and killing of Americans and other Westerners in Algeria is a manifestation of a newfound confidence by our enemy in knowing that they may face no serious consequences from this administration for their murderous acts. It is telling that neither President Obama nor any others in his administration have made a public statement on the recent terrorist activities in Algeria. whereas the head of France and the head of England have spoken out over and over and over. All the while. the Arab Spring. which was fanned by this administration to much fanfare. has become an Arab Winter. and for many of the people in the Middle East and North Africa. this Arab Wintera new safe haven for al Qaedaaffiliated groupsis forming. ideologically fueled by the release of terrorists and extremists from prisons and flush with weapons provided to antiQadhafi rebels last year. We are witnessing the potential formation of the next front in the war on terror. but we increasingly have an administration that no longer considers it a war worth fighting no matter the cost to American power or to the safety of our people abroad. While some have described the Obama doctrine as leading from behind. it is increasingly clear that the Obama doctrine means not leading at all. While most of the responsibility falls on the President and his administration. the Congressthe House and the Senateand the media share some blame for failing to adequately investigate and bring attention to the many questions surrounding the administrations response to Benghazi. Aside from a handful of reporters who have stayed with this story and have continued to raise questions about the administrations words and deeds. I cant help but wonder: Where are the New York Times. the Washington Post. or the network news programs? Why in the wake of last weeks deadly terrorist attack in Algeria are no reporters investigating the serious links between al Qaedas affiliates in North Africa and the connection between the groups? Equally important. where has the Congress been in investigating both the circumstances of the attack and the administrations response over the last 4 months? Despite a handful of hearings. many in classified settings and done by very capable and good people. the American people have not been provided with anything close to an adequate answer to the following questions. It is not only important for the Congress to find out. it is important for the American people to find out. Have they been given answers to these questions? Secretary Panetta. Attorney General Holder and DNI Clapper still have not testified publicly before Congress as to what steps they took during the attack and in the days that followed. What were the Presidents activities during the 7hour period of attack? Why wasnt the U.S. military deployed to assist? On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in American history and after multiple attacks this year on U.S. and Western interests. why were U.S. military units and assets in the region not ready. alert. and in a position to respond? After all. two of the four people killed were murdered 7 hours after the fighting began. Why do we still not have the clear answers on the internal process that produced the inaccurate and. frankly. misleading talking points on which Ambassador Rice relied several days after the attack? Why were the testimonies of the U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi on September 12eyewitnesses who knew there was never a demonstration outside the consulatenot immediately factored into the judgments of our intelligence community? Have the witnesses who were there on the scene. government employees. good peopleall risking their livesbeen called to come up and been given the opportunity to talk to Members on both sides of the aisle? The answer to date is \"no.\" Why hasnt Secretary Clinton been interviewed by the Pickering Commission? Was the White House aware of the FBI investigation of General Petraeus? If not. why not? To date. Congress has failed to get these answers. and it has not developed a coordinated or substantial investigative plan to fully explore this critical matter. which has a direct bearing on U.S. national security. In the absence of serious oversight. the media has moved on. In the absence of this. the administration. which has so much to account for to the American people. receives a carte blanche from the legislative branch to continue its questionable policies. These matters are too serious to be brushed aside. There are critical legislative decisions the next Congress will have to make based on answers to these questions. but. more importantly. the American people deserve the answers to these questions. including open hearings and an unclassified report. Mr. Speaker. for these reasons I remain convinced that a House select committee on the terrorist attack in Benghazi is needed more than ever. That is why last week I introduced my resolution. H. Res. 36. with 20 of our colleagues joining as cosponsors. A select committee is essential to combine the myriad existing investigations into a single. comprehensive. and exhaustive review. I believe such a combined effort will yield even more information regarding the true nature of these terrorist attacks and the administrations response will not allow administration officials to offer up siloed accounts to various committees. The select committee I am proposing should draw from the existing congressional investigations by including the chairman and ranking member of each committee of jurisdictionthe Intelligence Committee.

    "speech": "Administrator. Agency For International Development. Washington. DC. DEAR DR. SHAH: Ms. Barbara Bennett. acting deputy assistant administrator for legislative and public affairs at USAID recently sent a response to my December 11. 2012 letter to you. I was disappointed you did not respond directly to a Member of Congress who serves on a committee of jurisdiction. especially given that my concern was budgetary in nature. Just days after I received your response. Tunisian authorities released Ali Harzi. a key suspect in the September 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex in Benghazi. which took the lives of four Americans. including the U.S. ambassador. and resulted in the destruction of two U.S. facilities. This development is completely at odds with USAIDs assurances in the response letter that \"... Tunisian authorities are cooperating with the Department [State] through normal law enforcement channels.\" Respectfully. I would also like to remind you that I chair the CommerceJustice- Science appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Consequently. while Ms. Bennett indicated that USAID \"could not provide further detail.\" I am wellversed on the investigation and can say with confidence that releasing Ali Harzi is an affront to U.S. national security and rule of law. given the evidence of his alleged involvement. Furthermore. your assertion that U.S. assistance is critical to \"Tunisias successful democratic transition\" is misguided. Tunisia is not transitioning successfully. I have enclosed for your review a recent piece which ran in Bloomberg Businessweek. \"Revolution and Entropy.\" which paints a bleak picture of progress in Tunisia. A January 14 Reuters piece described large street protests in the capital city during which protestors chanted. \"Where is the constitution? Where is democracy?\" Democratic transition aside. the Tunisian government. as evidenced by this most recent development with Ali Harzi. is working at crosspurposes with U.S. national interests. During these tight budgetary times. when worthy programs face constraints and cuts. our national priorities should undergird our foreign assistance. The administration continues to claim that bringing the perpetrators to justice for the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate is a priority. And yet its actions are inconsistent with such sentiments. particularly in the case of Tunisia. We must send a clear and unequivocal message to the Tunisian government. U.S. aid must not be taken for granted. U.S. national security considerations are a cornerstone of our foreign policy. When those interests are undermined. there are consequences. I look forward to a personal response to this letter and any future correspondence. Best wishes. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. just very briefly. we had a vote today. Theres some wonderfully fine Members of Congress that I have deep respect for who voted \"yes.\" and 32 voted \"no\" from the Republican side. Its not because we dont all hold the same belief that we have to cut spending to be responsible. to avoid continuing to add debt to our children and grandchildren. but a matter of difference in strategy. It is a mistake to suspend the debt ceiling increase. just as it would be to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful cuts. just as Senator Phil Gramm got back in 1985. I believe it was. with GrammRudman and so many of the debt ceiling increases that were accompanied as part of the deal with restrictions on spending. Therere so many things going on in the world today that are just staggering. We know we had Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifying today. One report here today says that Secretary Clinton interrupted one Senator to contradict him and stress that she did not see requests for additional security to protect the Benghazi mission. Thats extremely unfortunate that people in our State Department. committed to helping this country. would make cries for help over a period of months. over a period of years. even going back to when Ambassador Rice was with the State Department and people were killed at an American embassy and a request had been made for extra security that went unheeded. Here it came again. and apparently there were a number of people who made requests. including one of the security officials that I met and talked to personally. They could see that we were sitting ducks. And apparently former Senator Clinton. now Secretary Clinton. is saying she never saw the request. The bucks would have stopped with her if theyd ever made it to her. What it says is something has got to be done so that when people who have dedicated their lives to helping and protecting this country cry for help. that months. years after the cries. we dont again come back and say: never heard the cries. never got to me. Tragic. Tragic. Senator. nowSecretary. Clinton said that the administrations response to the assault was to be defended. and an independent investigation found that the States actions saved American lives in realtime. Well. from what Ive seen on the House side and in the news. without going into anything that might be classified. just from the public information weve discerned. the actions of the State Department in failing and ignoring the requests for help did not save lives. It ended up costing lives. The failure of this President to either receive information when a United States Ambassador he put in harms way was begging. was under fire and people were begging for help on his behalf. weve had people indicate. gee. that immediately gets to the President himself or someone directly around the President who can get the Presidents immediate attention. We have an Ambassador under attack. that goes straight to the President or somebody right around him. And just like Secretary Clinton apparently has testified today: I never saw or heard the cries for help. I didnt know. Well. since this President is going to be in office for 4 more years as of Monday. it is imperative that he clean house and set up new procedures so that even if hes out golfing. even if hes on vacation. body surfing in Hawaii. wherever he is. doing fundraising in Las Vegas. no matter where he is. that when somebody says Mr. President. people that you put in harms way are begging for help. theyre under attack. theyre begging for your help. and I feel sure. you know. he would take time off of one of the greens or body surfing. He would surely take time. I know he would. If somebody would get him the information. your Ambassador is about to be killed. I know he would walk off the green and give some order to protect him. surely. But hes got to get the information. And since I travel around the world meeting with our military. Special Forces. different branches of our military. from Afghanistan to the very far reaches in the southern part of the Philippines. wherever. Iraqand I wont be going back to Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki didnt like DANA ROHRABACHER and me questioning him about repaying some of the U.S. money that we spent to give him the opportunity to be elected. especially since they now have all that oil revenue. and he also didnt like us bringing up the fact that they promised the United States when they took over the government that they would protect the people at Camp Ashraf. the refugees from Iran. and that actually the military had gone in and killed some of those people that he and the U.S. had pledged would be safe. And he didnt like that and apparently sent word that we were not welcome in his country anymore. Were okay with Americans dying so I can get elected here in Iraq. but we dont want anybody making us keep our promises here in Iraq. Ive seen our military in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. all around the world. I was in the Army for 4 years. And one thing that they are very concerned about that they cant talk about publicly. but especially after we had two former SEALs killed trying to protect the Ambassador. when it wasnt their job to do that. they did it because theyre American heroes. American patriots. But our military sees those things. You know. when I was in the military. President Carter was President. We knew we had a President who did not have our back. who was more concerned about other things than the military. And there was a lot of unrest. but its a crime in the United States military to say anything derogatory about anyone in your chain of command. including the top person. the President. and it needs to be that way. When youre in the military. you take orders and you follow your orders. and you dont castigate whoever is up your chain of command. even if they dont have a clue what theyre doing. It has to be for the good order and discipline of the military. But we were not stupid. We knew when the President was not protecting us. was not protecting Americans. We knew when the President was not providing the equipment and what we needed to protect Americans. We knew that. And as I go around the world and talk to different of our military. they notice that we have officials in this administration who. after Americans dedicated to protecting this country are killed. will come forward from the White House down and say. gee. I had no idea that they were in that kind of trouble. I had no idea that our policies subjected them to being killed. I had no idea. I wish somebody had let me know they were in this kind of trouble. The military knows that. And as Ive mentioned. one soldier in Afghanistan said. please let others in Washington know I dont mind laying down my life for my country. but please dont waste it. Thats not much of an ask for those who are committed to protecting the rest of us. And yet this administration still prevents us from getting to the real facts. the real truth. To have someone come forward and say. I really didnt know there was trouble. I didnt know about the request for help. that does not answer the question that this body is demanding answers to and. that is. well. who did know. Who made the decisions not to protect Americans in harms way? Who made that call? Who was it that gave orders. because surely there was somebody out there who said. an American Ambassador is under attack. Were going to go protect him. To attack a consulate is an act of war under anybodys interpretation of international law. Its an act of war. And when somebody commits an act of war against the United States. against a U.S. Ambassador. against our people. they need to know that theres a Commander in Chief. or if he doesnt know because hes busy. somebody that will give the order to protect those that were put in that bad situation. Our military needs to know that their Commander cares. Our military needs to know that theyre not going to lay down their life for nothing. This is not the kind of testimony that we need. We want the truth. If this is the truth. so be it. Of course. wed heard from her doctors after the fall that. gee. it turns out this could be the kind of thing that would result in memory loss. And Im glad shes well enough to get along. My late mother. with a brain tumor. had balance problems. We constantly had to be on the alert for her falling. maybe tripping over a curb and hurting herself. It breaks your heart when you see somebody with bruises from falling. So Im glad Secretary Clintons okay. But we have an Ambassador and other Americans who died. So instead of sending witnesses to say. I dont know what happened. Ill take the blame. I have no clue what happened. but Im responsible. instead of that. please. Mr. Speaker. we need to be provided with testimony and evidence how did these irresponsible decisions get made. and who made them. Because. as I say. our military gets it. They see whats going on. Despite some that might say. yeah. if you dont finish high school or dont get an education. you may end up in the military. if you actually spend enough time with the military. instead of being a 90day wonder and get your Purple Heart and be on your way. if you actually spend substantial time with true military heroes that are dedicated to protecting our way of life. you spend time with them. you know these are smart people. You spend time with SEALs. as I have. and you find out these are not only incredibly trained people. Theyre smart people. You spend time with Special Forces. as I have there at Fort Benning where I spent 4 years. thats where the Rangers are trained. Theyre smart people. and theyre smart enough to know when people in their chain of command do not have their back. they do not take actions that make it appear they care. I know the President cares. I know he does. I know Secretary Clinton cares. But its not enough to say. \"I had no idea that I put people in harms way and that they were begging for help and I got them killed.\" You know. lets find out where the problem is. How come they didnt know that was what was going on and the failure to provide security was going to get them killed? Why didnt they know? Those are the kinds of things we need to find out. Then we find out that there were Americans killed in the attack in Algeria. How could it be that these people in Algeria had the weapons to carry out this attack? Well. some of the reports indicate that these weapons probably came from Libya. Well. where would the Libyans have gotten weapons? Could it be that those were Americanprovided weapons. just like this administration forced the sale of guns that would go to kill at least one American and hundreds of Mexicans before it started claiming weve got to go after entirely. with our full force of the law. anybody that sells guns to criminals? Its a shame they didnt start with the Department of Justice. but I guess if youre the Department of Justice and youre responsible for forcing the sale of guns for criminals. then youre not exactly interested in looking at whose actions in your Department caused the death of hundreds of Mexicans and one or two Americans. But it needs to be looked at. Thats how you avoid mistakes in the future. You find out what caused the mistakes. The three Americans were among 38 workers killed in the siege of an Algerian gas plant in which Islamic terrorists used hostages as human shields after their attempted mass kidnapping for ransom went awry. Some Algerian attackers are placed in Benghazi. This story is from Algeria. in The New York Times. dated January 22. by Adam Nossiter: Several Egyptian members of the squad of militants that lay bloody siege to an Algerian gas complex last week also took part in the deadly attack on the United States mission in Libya in September. a senior Algerian official said Tuesday. Months and months after a U.S. ambassador was killed. we finally have our FBI director go over to check into it himself. After FBI agents went and did some checking. we had reporters go over there and find actual evidence that somehow the FBI missed or did not bother with. Mistakes that get the United States public servants who have committed their lives to the U.S.. and get them killed. requires scrutiny. And this administration. since they will have 4 more years. will. hopefully. be concerned enough about not getting other members of their State Department. their embassies. their consulates. their soldiers. killed for nothing. Now I know the soldiers. Ive been to far too many funerals. And having known so many in harms way. even if theyre sent to the Valley of Death riding with the 600. figuratively speaking. they know they didnt die for nothing. They died devoted to the belief in the things that are set out in the Declaration of Independencethat we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. And just like inheritance. if youre going to keep it. youre probably going to have to fight for it. Again. our military begs. If Im going to lay down my life for my country. dont waste it. So. Mr. Speaker. I hope and pray this administration will stop obfuscating. will stop the hiding of documents. preventing us from getting them. so we can find out what mistakes were made so that we can prevent them in the future. And the great news for this administration. Mr. Speaker. is that gee. it doesnt have to run for reelection again. So there should be no excuse whatsoever for not bringing the facts forward. May I inquire how much time is remaining?",

    "speech": "Since the President doesnt have to run for reelection. there is no reason not to bring out the facts of Fast and Furious and what happened in Benghazi. that has now spilled over and cost American lives in Algeria. Lets get to the bottom of it. And if Secretary Clinton does not know what happened. if she doesnt have a clue. bless her heart. lets get somebody that does. Lets find out how these mistakes were made so we can prevent future lives being lost when they dont have to be. Mr. Speaker. I want to conclude today. since this week marks the 40th anniversary of the landmark case of Roe v. Wade. and those of us who have been involved as a lawyer trying cases such as Roe v. Wade. which was a civil case. those of us that have been involved as a judge. as I was also a chief justice. we know that in order for a case to be ripe. that it can be heard in court. there must be a justiciable issue. as there was in Roe v. Wade. But the person bringing the case actually has standing to bring the case. It took years. but we ultimately find out that at the time there was no standing. We find out from the person who was Roe. a fictitious name. that she deeply regrets what had happened. And that case has been responsible for the killing of millions of lives. I have so many dear friends on the Democratic side of the aisle. I know their hearts. They dont want people to get killed. They care about life. And so many on both sides of the aisle talk about trying to protect \"the most vulnerable among us.\" I would humbly submit there is no one more vulnerable than an unborn child. There is that cord through which nourishment and oxygen flow as that baby grows and develops. There is a desire in the human heart to live. There is a desire to live. And those precious. innocent children want to live. Its who they are. Its part of their genetic makeup to want to live. Theres no baby. born or unborn. who is capable mentally or physically of taking their own lives intentionally. It cant happen. It doesnt happen. They want to live. So our heart breaks as a Nation. thinking about the spilled blood of innocent. vulnerable children all put to death because someone did not understand what was going on and they were led to believe its not a life. its a choice. The children want to live. When our firstborn was born. she came 8 to 10 weeks prematurely. Back then. it was uncertain whether she was going to live. We were encouraged at first. but the doctor said. Shes in trouble. Her lungs were not developed. And I knew from cases that I had been involved in that if too much oxygen is given to a preemie. theres a chance theyll go blind. So doctors avoided that. if at all possible. And I saw them go from 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 100 percent oxygen. When they got to 100 percent. I knew Katy was in big trouble or they wouldnt risk her blindness. They said we needed to ship her to either Dallas or Shreveport. where she could get the toprated neonatal ICU. Shreveport was a little closer. I was tornmy wife was suffering. having given birth prematurelywhether to stay with her or go with the baby. She said. Go with Katy. Do anything you can to help her. So I followed the ambulance to Shreveport. A man named Dr. Tsing was the neonatologist. He cared so deeply for those babies. And I began to understand why the doctor said they seemed to have the best survival rate there in Shreveport. He had a policy that if you went by a child. you had to observe proper sanitization procedures. but you touched those children. you talked to those children. They hear you. They know you. When I got there. they sat me on a stool and said you can stay no more than 2 hours. but talk to this child. she knows your voice. She has heard your voice for maybe 7 months. She knows your voice. Talk to her. Caress her arms. Talk to her. Caress her little face. And I did. The monitors were going so fast. so erratic was the heart rate. so erratic was the breathing. the lungs so undeveloped. As I had been there for a couple of hours. Dr. Tsing came back over. Katie had a grip on my finger. that tiny little hand of hers around the very end of my finger. and she wouldnt let go. He came over after a while and he said. have you looked at the monitors? I looked up. She still had such undeveloped lungs. but her breathing had stabilized. Her heart rate had stabilized. And Dr. Tsing said. she is drawing life. she is drawing strength from you. I couldnt leave. I sat there for 8 hours before they forced me to take a break. but I learned. born or unborn. a child wants to live. I hope and pray we will not continue to allow the killing of 40. 50. 60 million more precious babies like Katie. Katie is alive today. She is a joy. she is brilliant. There are other children that wanted to live as well. We need to stop deceiving pregnant women that its not a life. It is a life. and its endowed by our Creator. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I know that another legislative day has come to an end and that sunset fast approaches in Washington. D.C. I stand before this House with what I call a Sunset Memorial. Because. you see. Mr. Speaker. before the sun sets today in America. almost 4.000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave. That is more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11th in this country. and it happens every single day. Mr. Speaker. it has now been 40 yearsan entire generationsince the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then. the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 55 million of its own unborn children. Some of them. Mr. Speaker. cried and screamed as they died. but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air. we couldnt hear them. All of them had at least four things in common. Mr. Speaker. First. they were just nameless little babies who had done wrong to no one. and yet each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers. whether she realizes it or not. will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity in this world are now lost forever. Yet. even in the glare of such tragedy. this generation still clings to a blind. invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims. those yet unborn. Mr. Speaker. I recently heard Barack Obama speak such poignant words that. whether he knows it or not. apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in America. Let me quote selected. excerpted portions of his comments. He said: This is our first task caring for our children. Its our first job. If we dont get that right. we dont get anything right. Thats how. as a society. we will be judged. And by that measure. can we truly say. as a Nation. that we are meeting our obligations? Can we honestly say that were doing enough to keep our children all of them safe from harm? He went on to quote: Can we say that were truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? He said: Ive been reflecting on this the last few days. and if were honest with ourselves. the answer is no. Were not doing enough. And we will have to change. Oh. Mr. Speaker. how true the Presidents words were. The President also said: We cant tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them. we must change. Then the President asked: Are we really prepared to say that were powerless in the face of such carnage. that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom? What a powerful question. Mr. Speaker. It is the most relevant question we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn children in America every day. The President said: Our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. He said: That is our generations task to make these words. these rights. these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American. Mr. Speaker. never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by President Obama as those I have just quoted. And yet this President. in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself. refuses to apply these majestic words to the helpless unborn babies of this Nation. How I wish that somehow Mr. Obama would just open his heart and his ears to his own words. and ask himself in the core of his soul. why his words. that should apply to all children. cannot include the most helpless of all children. Only a few days ago. no more than 200 yards from this well. Barack Obama put his hand down on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln was sworn in on when he took his Presidential oath. Mr. Speaker. we should remember that we honor Abraham Lincoln most because he found the courage as President of the United States in the days of slavery. and the humanity within himself. to recognize the image of God stamped on the soul of slaves that the Supreme Court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didnt recognize as protectable under the law. Could it still be. could it still be. Mr. Speaker. that President Barack Obama might consider that perspective. as well as his own legacy. and even eternity itself. Mr. Speaker. and recognize that in his day under his Presidency that these little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help? Could it be that the President might finally remember that on the pages of the Bible on which he laid his hand were the words written in red: Inasmuch as you have done unto the least of these My brethren. you have done it unto Me. Mr. Speaker. whether he does or not. it is certainly time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said: The care of human life and happiness. and not its destruction. is the chief and only object of good government. The phrase in the 14th Amendment encapsulates our entire Constitution. It says: No State shall deprive any person of life. liberty or property without due process of law. Mr. Speaker. protecting the lives of all Americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of that selfevident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights. the rights of life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core selfevident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker. It is who we are. And yet today another day has passed. and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our Godgiven responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4.000 more innocent little American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. So. Mr. Speaker. let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hopes that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the very inconvenient truth that abortion really does kill little babies and that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never imagine. and that it is time we stood up together again and looked to our Declaration of Independence and remember that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust. and we are still the courageous and compassionate Nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. It is still not too late for us to make a better world and for America to be the one that leads the rest of the planet. just as we did in the days of slavery. from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4.000 of our own children every day. So. now. Mr. Speaker. as we consider the plight of the unborn after 40 years under Roe v. Wade. maybe we can remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered. and that all too soon. each one of us will also walk from these Chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day. may that be the day when we finally find the humanity. the courage. and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these. the least of our tiny little brothers and sisters in America. from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. Mr. Speaker. it is now 40 years since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. This. in the land of the free and the home of the brave. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam President. yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with my Democratic Senate caucus for the first time this year. It was the first opportunity for all of us to sit down together. to break bread. and to discuss challenges and opportunities we all face. As the majority leader. I was gratified to see so many new faces and to have such an inclusive caucus. It was music to my ears to hear the announcement that the Presiding Officer today would be HEIDI HEITKAMP. We have nine new Democratic Senators. Four of these new Senators are women. and so about onethird of our Democratic caucus is now women. We have. for example. the first Asian woman. We have expanded our majority. I am particularly satisfied that with each passing election cycle our caucus better reflects the Nation it serves. But despite the diversity of the caucusand in particular its freshmenthere is one quality shared by each Democratic Senator: deep and abiding patriotism. As Governor Adlai Stevenson said: Patriotism is not short. frenzied outbursts of emotion. but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. That is true. Patriotism is not short. frenzied outbursts of emotion. but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. If we look at the records. the careers of these new Senators. that is the way it is. Each person coming here reminds me of my first few weeks in the House of Representatives when Tip ONeillwe had a large incoming class. so he called us in these groups of maybe 15 or so. and he told us something I have always remembered. He said: Each of you are successful politicians or you wouldnt be here. And that is true. I say that to each of my new Senators. They are successful politicians. and there is nothing wrong with the word \"politician.\" I am proud I am a politician. I am proud I serve in government. and we should each be proud. So I am pleased now. and I was pleased yesterday. to be surrounded by so many dedicated public servants. new Members and old alike. who have devoted their lives to making their individual States and our shared Nation a better place in which to grow up. grow a family. and grow old. Each new Democratic Member is accomplished. I repeat. in his or her own right. Our new caucus members include a couple of former Governors. a Harvard law professor. an engineer. just to name a few. While they have each accomplished so much already. their greatest achievements are still ahead of them. I know they will look back with satisfaction on the work we do together in the Senate. Our caucus. this Congress. and our country face immense challenges. As we approach these tests and trials. this diverse group of new Democratic Senators will be united by a single objective: to fight for fairness and balance on behalf of the middle class.",

    "speech": "Madam President. earlier this week. through the eyes of the Nation watched the inauguration ceremony here in Washington. A week before that. back in Indiana. I was present for the celebration of the inauguration of Indianas 50th Governor. former Congressman Mike Pence. who is taking over after 8 years of leadership under our former Governor. Mitch Daniels. So backtoback weekends had two special events. Inauguration ceremonies are a time for reflection on what has happened in the past and a time for new vision on how we ought to go forward with the future. It is also a time for new opportunity. An opportunity for the kind of change necessary to address the problems and challenges we face. As I participated in the inauguration events for Governor Pence in Indianapolis just two weekends ago. I couldnt help but think of the remarkable record of achievement and the bold reforms that our former Governor. Mitch Daniels. delivered to the Hoosier State and the lessons they may offer to Washington. In 2005. Indiana faced a severalhundredmilliondollar deficit. This pales by comparison to the deficit we face here. but. nevertheless. for a State of our size it is a significant amount. Although it is constitutionally mandated in Indiana. we had not balanced our budget for 7 years. Governor Daniels and his team had a vision and the political courage to make much needed changes. and the people of Indiana supported and responded. While other States increased spending and raised taxes. Indiana reduced spending. cut taxes. and paid down our debts. Governor Daniels. with the help of the legislature and with the support of the people of Indiana. slowed down the rate of spending. The States expenditures have grown at less than onequarter the rate of the previous decade. We also reduced the size of State government. Indiana has the fewest State employees per capita in the country. We paid down the previous debt by 43 percent. and we currently sit with a budget surplus and a rebate program which will give money collected in taxes back to the taxpayer because of our states efficiency and effectiveness in terms of running our government. Indiana. as a result of this. has received its first AAA credit rating. This means when we do need to borrow or sell bonds to do certain infrastructure or meet other needs. we can receive low interest rates because of our superb AAA rating. All this has transformed Indianas balance sheet and made our State one of the most attractive places to live. raise a family. and do business in the Midwest. if not in the Nation. The story of Indiana and how it got hold of its fiscal issues has been written up in national journals and newspapers and documentaries and others. It is a remarkable story. It is not unique because we see these things happening in other States around the country led not only by Republican Governors but Democrat Governors. These are the kinds of decisions that have to be made and are being made to restore state and local governments. And it has created a much brighter future for the citizens of those States. Governor Daniels has often said. \"Youd be amazed by how much government youll never miss.\" The results of his administration back that up. You can go around Indiana. as I have. and talk to people from big cities to small. rural to urban and everything in between and ask them how we have moved from deficit to surplus in our state. You can ask if they still believe our state performs the necessary functions of government and you can ask Hoosiers what has been cut that you think should have stayed. Frankly. no one could come up with an answer that says: We have had disastrous consequences from these decisions. The vast majority say that things are working pretty well. In fact. I can get my license renewed through a total revamp of our licensing system in just a few minutes over the Internet or just a few minutes at the DMV. Governor Daniels measure for that was in and out in less than 7 minutes. For those of us who have spent hours and hours committing half a day or more to getting our license renewed. this is a remarkable achievement. The use of technology. privatization. and the use of more efficient government demands that our civil servants do more with less and this has proven to be effective. While the fiscal situation we faced in Indiana is not totally analogous to what we face here. the principles are the same. and there still are many similarities. As Washington seeks answers at the start of this new session of Congress on how we move forward and address our extremely serious debt situation and get our fiscal house back in order so that we too can retain a AAA rating and so we too can provide the opportunity for growth and opportunity not just for the middle class but for all Americans in the future. maybe there are some lessons to be learned from Indiana. The spend less. borrow less. and tax less Hoosier model has resulted in balanced budgets. job creation. and a AAA credit rating. In contrast. the spend more. borrow more. and tax more approach in Washington during these last several years has resulted in fewer jobs. higher debt. and a threatened downgrade from credit agencies. So as we reflect back on the last 4 years of this current administration. it is clear to me we must take a different course in the second term of this administration. Whether lawmakers want to admit it. the crux of our problem is this: Washington has promised Americans far too much and committed well beyond our means. Federal spending and borrowing cannot continue at this current pace without dire consequences. Whether one is reading or listening to a liberal. conservative or a nonpartisan economist or an analyst. there is a consensus that sustaining our current rate or continuing our rate of borrowing and spending simply is not feasible and the consequences will be dire if we do not address it. As we seek to address these issues. my suggestion for Washington is to take a look at the Hoosier model. It is tested. it is proven. and it is working. We need to go big and bold. We need to have the political courage to look beyond the shortterm political consequences. as we perceive them. to the longterm benefit from sound policieswhich. interestingly enough. translate into good politics. Strengthening the economy and getting our country on a track to brighter and more prosperous times should be our priority. We have proven in Indiana that good policy. no matter how politically difficult it might seem at the time to achieve. does translate into good politics. But much more important than the politics. good policy can translate into strengthening our economy. improving the lives of Americans. and providing opportunity for future generations. It is time we learn that lesson in Washington that our State of Indiana and many States across the country. as well as other communities. are learning. It is time we exhibit the political courage to stand and do what I think just about everyone in this body understands. that is. to get a hold of runaway spending and borrowing that is putting us in a very deep fiscal hole and will have significant. dire consequences not only on future generations but even our current generation. The time is now. As I said from this spot yesterday. 2013 is the decisive year. In 2014. we will be back into an election year. and that tired old belief that we cannot make these kinds of changes with the election looming will surface again. If we dont act now. more people will say that we need to wait until after the next election. It will push us into 2015. Many who have looked at our situation fiscally and analyzed it from a nonpartisan. nonideological basis have said 2015 is too late. This is the time when we need to summon our courage. summon our political will. and do what is right for the American people. We cannot continue to bump along at less than 2 percent growth. We cannot continue to keep more than 8 percent or nearly 8 percent of our people unemployed. and. obviously. that number is much higher when we count those who are no longer looking for work who have given up. We cannot continue to keep America on the edge of uncertainty in terms of what our fiscal future will look like. Let us summon that courage to go forward. Let us use examples from those States. the support of those Governors and the support they have received from people across those States. Let us summon the courage to do what we need to do. I want to continue talking about how we need to address this with a \"go big. go bold\" type of approach. Everyone says and concludes that if we can put that package together to address our longterm ills over a period of time and bring us back to balance and stability. we will see a revival of the economy of this country and we will see great hope for the American people going forward. Madam President. with that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Madam President. President Obama may have been vague on details in his inaugural speech on Monday. but I will give him this. he couldnt have been clearer about the tone and the direction he has in mind for the second term. Gone is the postpartisan rhetoric that propelled him onto the national stage and into the White House. In its place is an unabashedly leftwing appeal for more bureaucratic control and centralized power here in Washington. On Monday. we saw a President and a party that appeared to have shifted into reverse and jammed on the gas. For Democrats in the Obama age. the era of big government being over is officially over. And anybody who disagrees with their approach isnt just wrong. they are not just standing in the way of progress. they are malevolent. they are the bad guys. they are the ones who want to take food away from children. they want the old and the infirm to suffer. they want to choose between caring for the people who built this country. as the President put it on Monday. and investing in those who will build our future. I dont know if the President buys all this stuff. I dont know if he believes his own caricatureI certainly hope notbut one thing I do know is that questioning the intentions of ones political opponents makes it awfully hard to get anything done in a representative democracy. As the President himself said. without so much as a hint of irony. we cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name calling as reasoned debate. The President won the election. I congratulate him on his victory. It is his prerogative to lay out an agenda and to make an argumentagainst all evidencefor the efficacy of big government. more Washington spending. and centralization. It is even his prerogative to arguemistakenly. in my viewthat Americas greatness somehow rests not on its communities and voluntary associations. its churches and charities. on civil society. but instead on the dictates of Washington. But to suggest that those of us and our constituents who believe otherwise dont want the best interest of our parents or our children or our countrys future is. at best. needlessly provocative. at worst. it suggests a troubling inability to view those who dont happen to share your opinions as beneath you. To suggest. as one of the Presidents spokesmen did earlier this week. that both the American political system and those who belong to the party of Lincoln arent worthy of this White House or its agenda isnt the way to get things done. It makes it impossible to tend to problems we simply have to face up to and that we will only solve together. Frankly. it calls into question the Presidents own belief in the wisdom and the efficacy of the constitutional system of checks and balances that the Founders so wisely put in place. The postinaugural period is usually a chance to pivot to governing after a long campaign. It is an opportunity for Presidents to reach out to the minority and to forge compromises. But that is not what we are seeing this time around. Even before Monday we all noted the harsh change in tone. the reboot of the campaign machine. and how. instead of offering an olive branch to those who disagree with him. the President had already decided to transform his campaign operation into a weapon to bulldoze anyone who doesnt share his vision. Well. I would suggest that one thing the American people dont want is a permanent campaign. That is the last thing the American people are looking fora permanent campaign. They want us to work together on solutions to our problems. And deficits and debt are right at the top of the list. I wish to suggest this morning the President rethink the adversarial tone he has adopted in recent weeks. Our problems are simply too urgent and too big for the President to give up on working with us. I appeal to him once again to work with us on the things we can achieve together. and let us start with the deficit and the debt. Because the only way we will be able to tackle these problems is by doing it together. If he refuses. if he insists on spending the next 4 years pushing a polarizing hardleft agenda instead. I assure him he will meet a determined opposition not only from Republicans in Washington but from the very people he seems to believe are squarely on his side in the push to remake government in his image. The irony in the Presidents attacks. of course. is that the kind of reforms Republicans are calling for are the only conceivable route to saving the programs the President claims he wants to protect. Failing to reform the entitlement programs of the last century nowright nowis the best way to guarantee they no longer exist in their current form. I mean. one could practically hear the ring of the cash register with every new promise the President made. At a time when we can all see the failure of such policies by simply turning on the news. he seems blissfullyblissfullyunaware of the fact that from Athens to Madrid the sad. slow death of the lefts big government dream is on display for all to see. If we want a less prosperous. less dynamic. less mobile society. that is the way to gojust \"Europeanize\" America. The Presidents vision of an allpowerful government that rights every wrong and heals every wound may warm the liberal heart. but it is completely divorced from experience and from reality. So today I wish to do my part to bring the President and his allies in Congress a little closer down to Earth. I know it may be hard for them to accept. but the reality is this: We have a spending problemnot a taxing problem. a spending problem. Lets take a look at the chart to my right. The green represents historic and projected tax revenue. And we can see it goes right straight across here out to 2040. The tax increases of 3 weeks ago were delivered by operation of law. In other words. the law expired and all of the Bush tax cuts were over. The Congress. 2 hours after everybodys taxes went upin other words. after all the Bush tax cuts expiredrestored tax relief for 99 percent of the American people. and they did it on a permanent basis to guarantee we wouldnt have another cliff. as we inevitably have. When a law sunsets. we have a cliff. So the President was able to get some new revenue by operation of law. and that represents this dark blue line right across here. You can see that is pretty steady out to 2040. The President. of course. said that wasnt nearly enough. He said: We need more taxes. and we will be back asking for more taxes later. So as nearly as we can tell. based on what he has said. the taxes he would like to add to the ones he got by operation of law 21/2 weeks ago is this light blue line right across here. If the President were given all the tax increases he says at the moment he wants. that would provide this amount of revenue going out to 2040. As you can see. that doesnt do anything to solve the problem because the red represents spending in the past and the spending escalation that will occur if we dont do anything to solve the spending problem. Look at this line dramatically going up to 2040. So as you can see. there is not enough revenue we can raise without completely shutting down the economy to solve the problem. In fact. it produces a rather static and totally insignificant amount of revenue in order to deal with the massive spending problem. So this constant demand for more and more tax increases on. I guess. whom people assume is the more successful guy down the street may be a great campaign tactic. but it doesnt do anything to solve the problem. Even if the President were able to get every bit of taxes he wants. we still have an enormous gap in spending if we dont deal with the real problem. which is spending. We have a spending addiction. I didnt make this up. This is a fact. This is reality. So the tax issue is over. Congress has restored permanent tax relief for 99 percent of the American people. Even if the President were to getand he will notany more tax revenue. it is perfectly obvious that doesnt do anything to solve the problem. So the challenge for usand looking at the chart we can seeis revenue today is just about where it has been for the past 30 years or so. The President spent nearly his entire first term arguing that we needed to tax the socalled rich to solve our fiscal woes. He harangued Congress about it. He argued for it in rallies and debates. He threatened to push us over the cliff if he didnt get his way. In the end. by operation of law he got part of what he asked for. And the reason he got it. as I said earlier. is because the tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003 carried an expiration date. President Obama got some of the tax increases he wanted because the law expired. Then Congress. led by Republicans. voted to make Bushera tax rates permanent for 99 percent of all Americans. Now. permanency is important. It has been kind of lost on the general public. but the importance is we dont have another cliff. another expiration date where all of a sudden everything changes. Given how much time he devoted to that one topic. one would think his tax hike would have closed the deficit. eliminated the entire national debt. and left us with extra cash to spare. But do you see that tiny little blue line I pointed to right here? That is how much additional revenue he got. This blue area is the revenue he says he wants. He will not get it. but if he did. it is pretty apparent it has nothing whatsoever to do with solving the spending addiction. So if this revenue doesnt come anywhere close to solving the problem. the real challenge. obviously. is how we are going to control all of this red. What do we do about this? Well. we are clearly spending way more than we take in. The real uptick. interestingly enough. occurs about the time the President took office. It has been hard enough to find ways to close the Presidents trilliondollar deficits. But as I just pointed out. they are nothing next to what is going to hit us when tens of millions of baby boomers reach retirement agenothing compared to what is heading our way. I pointed out the massive slope. That is what is headed our way. Nothing short of a bipartisan effort is going to fix this problem. and there is only one way we can do it. We cant tax our way out of this problem. The revenue question is behind us. The law we voted for. as I said. made current tax rates permanent. I am pretty confident not a single Republican in the House or Senate will vote to raise any more taxes. But even if we were to do that. all the taxes the President asked for would only put us here in 2040. And look at what would be spent. So the reality the President needs to faceand quicklyis that there is no realistic way to raise taxes high enough to even begin to address this problem. That is why Republicans are saying we need to start controlling spending. and we need to do it now. That is why if the President wants to do something good right now. he should put us out of the liberal wish list and put us out of the character attacks and join us in this great task. It is the transcendent issue of our time. If we dont fix this problem. we dont leave behind for our children and grandchildren the kind of America our parents left behind for us. There is no bigger issue. even though it got scant mention in the State of the Union. Now. I have no animus toward the President. I just want to see him do something about the problem because the longer we wait. the worse the problem becomes. The more we delay the inevitable. the less time younger Americans will have to plan for the reforms we make today. That is simply not right. So the President has a choice. He can paint himself as a warrior of the left and charge into battle with failed ideas we have already tried before. he can demean and blame the opposition for his own failure to lead. he can indulge his supporters in a bitter. neverending campaign that will only divide our country further. or he could take the responsible road. He can help his own base come to terms with the mathematical reality. Some people over there are living in a fantasy worlda world that doesnt exist. He could reach out to leaders in both partiesand all of the members in both partiesand negotiate in good faith. We would be happy to give him credit. That is fine by me. If boosting his legacy is what it takes and it helps the country. that is all the better. If my constituents believe they are working to help make their future a little better and a little brighter. great. But we cant waste any more time denying the reality that is staring each of us in the face. There is only one way to solve this problem. and that is to do something about this spending addiction that is going to sink this country and turn us into Greece. Senate Republicans are ready to help the President solve this problem. I hope we have an opportunity to do so. Madam President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "I say to my friend from Tennessee. it is counterintuitive. But one could argue that a divided governmentwhich we have had more often than not since World War IIhas produced four of the most significant accomplishments for our country in modern times. In the Reagan administration. President Reagan and Tip ONeill. the Democratic Speaker of the House. agreed to raise the age for Social Security to save Social Security for another generation. Reagan and Tip ONeill did the last comprehensive tax reform. Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress did welfare reform. arguably the most important piece of social legislation in recent times. And Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress actually balanced the budgets in the late 1990s. My friend from Tennessee is correct. Divided government actually is the perfect timesome would argue even the only timewe can do tough things. hardtoexplain things that need to be done to save the country. So I hate to miss the opportunity presented by a divided government to tackle the transcendent issue of our times. The President talked about a lot of things. and that is all interesting. but it had nothing to do with fixing the country.

    "speech": "Madam President. I wonder if I might pose one more question to the Republican leader after making a short statement. I came to this body as a young lawyerlegislative aide to Senator Howard Baker a long time ago. in 1967. I remember very well Senator Bakers story about how the civil rights bill of 1968 was passed. I have discussed this with the Republican leader before. He knows that era as well or better than I do. But there was a time when Senator Baker said he was in Everett Dirksens officehe is the man who had the job that Senator MCCONNELL now has. He was the Republican leader then. He said he heard the telephone ring. He heard only one end of the conversation. but Senator Dirksen was saying: No. Mr. President. I cannot come down and have a drink with you tonight. I did that last night. and Luella is very unhappy with me. And that was the conversation. About 30 minutes later there was a rustle out in the outer office of the Republican leaders officethe very office that Senator MCCONNELL now holds. Two beagles. followed by the President of the United States. came in. Lyndon Johnson. the President. said to the Republican leader: Everett. if you wont have a drink with me. I am down here to have one with you. And they disappeared in the back room for 45 minutes. The point of all that is not their socializing. The point was it was in that very office. the Republican leaders office. that in 1968. the next year. the civil rights bill was written and enacted. Lyndon Johnson got the credit for that in history but Everett Dirksen made it possible. and there were at that time many more Democrats in the Senate than Republicans. What I want to say to Senator MCCONNELL. the Republican leader. the question I want to ask him. is this. He has seen the U.S. Senate and Presidency for the last number of years. He has seen many relationships between the President and leaders of the opposite party. He knows how this place works. My sense of the Republican leader and of the large majority of us is that we wish to see a result. We wish to see a result on this very tough issue of saving Social Security. saving Medicare. saving Medicaid. saving these programs on which seniors depend. I wonder if the Republican leader would agree with me that despite the fact that we engage every day in political matters. that we have big differences of opinion. that on this issue. without Presidential leadership. we cannot get a result and that there are a lot of us on both sides of the aisle who are ready to work with the President to fix the debt?",

    "speech": "I say to my friend from Tennesseein many ways it is a statement of the obvious but a lot of people forget itthere is only 1 person in America out of 307 million Americans who can sign something into law and only 1 person in America who can deliver the members of his party to support an agreement that he makes. The only way to get an outcome on the biggest issue of our time is with Presidential leadership. So it was disappointing to see scant reference in the State of the Union. Of course that is just one speech and I have not given up hoping that this President can make solving the transcendent issue of our time one of his premier accomplishments. The point I think the Senator from Tennessee and I are making this morning is there are potential partners on this side of the aisle to make this happen. I hope we will not lose this opportunity once again to deal with the biggest issue in the country.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Kentucky for extending his time on the floor. On my own I wish to continue that line of thinking a little bit. It is traditional that when we have a new President. a newly inaugurated President. that he has a pretty good opportunity to get what he asks. that it is a time of maximum leverage. it is a time to do important things. it is a time to do difficult things. it is a time to do things that otherwise might not get done. Presidents are defined by their skillstheir communication skills. their electoral abilitybut they are also defined by their capacity over a period of years to identify the hard issues that are important to our country and cause people. as the President said in his address day before yesterday. to work together to solve those problems. Now the problem is whether you want to raise taxes on the guy down the street with the biggest house. That is not so hard to do. The problem is to spend money that you do not havebecause you can do it. that is not so hard to do. If the problem is to address a disaster to help people who are in desperate shape. there might be some debate about whether it is really a disaster or not but it is not hard to do because in the end it is going to happen. What Presidents are remembered for is dealing with important. difficult crises. President Clinton is remembered for a number of things but one of the things he did was challenge the conventional thinking in his own party to deal with welfare reform. It would not have happened if he had not done it. It would not have happened if he had not done it because a Republican could not have made the argument. A Presidents job. according to George Reedy. the former press secretary to Lyndon Johnson. is three things: One is to see an urgent need. two is to develop a strategy to meet the need. and the third is to persuade at least half the people he is right. President Nixon in the early 1960s went to China. That seems like ancient history but that was straight against the core of the Republican Party at that time. That was something that was inconceivable for a Republican President to do. given the history of mainland China and Taiwan. as they were both called. There have been many times in our history when Presidents have had to do the hard work. President George H.W. Bush made a budget agreement which may have caused him to lose the election in 1992 because it angered a number of Republicans. But it also helped balance the budget and gave us a period of time in the 1990s when that budget agreement plus a good economy gave us an actual surplus of funding. I sense that there is at the White House a feeling. two things I wish to disabuse the White House of. The first is that the budget problem is not a real problem. I cannot believe people at the White House think that. Everybody knows it is. Senator MCCONNELL gave a very good explanation of what was going on there. But let me say it this way: In 2025. according to the Congressional Budget Office. every dollar of taxes we collect will go to pay for Medicare. Medicaid. Social Security. and interest on the debt. and there is nothing left for national defense. National Laboratories. Pell grants for education. highways. or the investments that we need to make in research to grow this country. It all goes for Medicare. Medicaid. Social Security. and the interest on debt. every single penny we collect. And that is only 12 years away. That is not me talking. That is the Congressional Budget Office saying that. The Medicare trustees have said that in 2024 the Medicare Program will not have enough money to pay all of its bills. Whose bills? Bills of seniors. bills of Tennesseans. many of whom are literally counting the days until they are old enough to be eligible for Medicare so they can pay their medical bills. It would be a tragedy if that day arrived and there were not enough money to pay the bills. But the Medicare trustees. who by law are supposed to tell us these things. say that day will come in 2024. It is just 11 years away and that is the day for people already on Medicare and people who are going to be on Medicare. Medicaid. which is a program for lower income Americans. is an important program. As Governor. I dealt with it in my State. But when I was Governor. it was 8 percent of the State budget. Today it is 26 percent of the State budget. It is soaking up almost every dollar that would go to higher education. As a result. students around the country are wondering: Why are my tuition fees going up? It is because of Washingtons Medicaid Program requiring States to make decisions that soak up money that otherwise would be used to fund education. In our State of Tennessee. 30 years ago the State paid 70 percent of the cost of going to the University of Tennessee. Today it pays 30. And Medicaid is the chief culprit. Everyone knows this. The Presidents own debt commission has told him this and suggested a way to deal with it. Forty or fifty of us on both sides of the aisle have been working together. meeting together. having dinner together. writing bills together. trying to come up with plans to do it. Senator CORKER. my colleague from Tennessee. has developed a bill on which I am his prime cosponsor which says we have found a way to strengthen Medicare and other entitlements by reducing the growth in spending. We understand this. We passed a Budget Control Act a couple of years ago. People said they didnt like it. It was not so bad because it took 38 percent of the budget. which is all of our discretionary spendingincluding national defense. national parks. national labsand said it will go up at about the rate of inflation. This is before we get to the socalled sequester. But what about the rest of the budget? That is the automatic stuff we do not even vote on: Medicare. entitlements. all this? It is going up at about three to four times the rate of inflation. It is going to bankrupt these programs. Seniors will not be able to have their medical bills paid and the country will be bankrupt. That is no overstatement. The former Comptroller of the Currency says that. President Clinton says this is an urgent problem. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says the national debt is the single biggest threat to our national security. Why are we not dealing with it? I think we are not dealing with it. A. because it is hard to do. B. because on both sides of the aisle we have not been effective in dealing with it before. I remember when we had an allRepublican cast of characters here in townPresident Bush. a Republican majoritywe tried to reduce the growth of Medicare and we could not get the votes to do that. This is not easy to do. but Robert Merry. who wrote a book about President Polk. had lunch with some of us yesterday. made this statement: \"In Americas history every crisis has been solved by Presidential leadership or not at all.\" Whether it was Lincoln in the Civil War or Reagan and Tip ONeill or Nixon to China or Clinton on welfare reformwe can all identify the crises. But it takes Presidential leadership to do it. It takes that to do it. I was a Governor. which is much smaller potatoes. If I sat around waiting for the State legislature. with all respect. to come up with a road program we would still be driving on dirt roads. They were waiting for the Governor to do it. That is how our system works. I wonder if the President thinks that the debt is not a problem? I cannot imagine anybody at the White House thinks that. This is a problem. If the President does not address it during his two terms he will be remembered by history as failing to do that. His legacy may be a failure to address financial matters that put this country on a road to bankruptcy. Or. if he were to do it. if he were to provide the leadership. he would beas the Australian Foreign Minister has said. \"America is one budget agreement away from reasserting its global preeminence.\" Why wouldnt President Obama want to be known as the President who caused America to reassert its global preeminence by dealing with a budget agreement during the first 3 months of his term and then he can get on with his agenda. about which we can argue? That leaves me with only one thought: That the President thinks we dont want to do it. We do want to do it and it is a misunderstanding if he thinks that. I know the Republican leader would not mind me saying he is a wily. clever tactician who knows the Senate as well as anyone here. But if you look carefully. when we got down to the last few days of the year and needed an agreement on taxes. the Republican leader was in the middle of the agreement. When we needed an agreement to try to avoid default on the debt. the Republican leader was the one who was in the middle of doing that. I think if the White House thinks that the Republican leader or we on the Republican side do not want to fix the debt. they are badly misunderstanding where we are and who we are. I do not know how we can say it more clearly. We have written bills that do it. We have held dinners to talk about it. We have made public statements with Democrats. 30 or 40 of us at a time. saying we support SimpsonBowles. we support DomeniciRivlin. or we support this or we support that. What is missing? Two words: Presidential leadership. This is not a partisan comment. It just does not work unless the President lays out his plan. Some say the President does not want to lay out his plan. He has to lay out his plan. He is the President. We are just legislators. Senator CORKER and I have put out our plan. Who pays attention to that? Madam President. $1 trillion in reductions and a $1 trillion increase in the debt ceilingit is out there. That is not going to work. However. if President Obama. with his skills. calls together Simpson and Bowles or his advisers and says: Here is my plan to save Medicare. here is my plan to save Medicaid. here is my plan to fix the debt. and I want bipartisan support to do that. he will get it. At first. because it is a difficult issue. everybody will say: Oh. no. we cant do it that way. We need to sit down. talk. and come up with a result. I think the Republican leader has shown he is prepared and willing to do that. He has said it and done it on other issues. I dont know what else the rest of us can do to show that. What I am trying to respectfully say today. as much as anything. to the President of the United States is congratulations on your inauguration. I was there. I was proud to participate in it and have the opportunity to speak for a minute and a half about why we celebrate for the 57th time the inauguration of an American President. We celebrate it because our country is distinguished from most other countries in the world by the peaceful transition or reaffirmation of the largest amount of power in the world. We have our political contests. and then we have the restraint to respect the results. After winning the election. it is important. first. to get the fiscal house in order. The time to do it is while we have a divided government. The time to do it is while the President is at the peak of his popularity. The time to do it is while the House of Representativesthe Republican Househas created a window of 2 or 3 months to deal with all the fiscal issues. The time to do it is after 2 years of discussion with Republicans and Democrats in a bipartisan way about the need to fix the debt and the importance of it for the country. My hope is that as the President and his advisers look at the Senate. they see a willingness to solve the problem of fixing the debt in a bipartisan way. I get the feeling they dont believe that about us. I dont know what else we can do to cause them to believe that. There is not the same kind of comfortable. backandforth relationship there should be. I have heard some people say: Well. the JohnsonDirksen days are ancient history. That was a long time ago. However. human nature doesnt change. Human nature doesnt change in 50 years. 100 years. or 500 years. There is plenty of good will across the aisle and on this side of the aisle. at the beginning of this term. to work with a newly inaugurated President and say: Mr. President. we are ready to fix the debt. Provide us the leadership. No great crisis is ever solved without Presidential leadership in the United States. You are the President. you are the only one who can lay out the plan. We will then consider it. amend it. argue about it. change it. and pass it. After that. we can get onto the Presidents agenda. about which we will have a difference of opinion. but he will go down in history as the man who was willing to do something hard within his own party. which was to fix the debt and save the programs seniors depend upon to pay their medical bills. I hope I can say that in the spirit of someone who participated in the inauguration and admires the Presidents considerable abilities. I hope he and his advisers stop. take a look. and say: Maybe we were wrong. Maybe this is the time to do it. Maybe we are the only ones who can do it. so lets make a proposal and get started. I thank the President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I was pleased to hear a few days ago that Senator SCHUMER said we would have a budget in the Senate. It has been now. I think. about 1.370 days. give or take. since we have had a budget in the Senate. even though plain statutory law requires the Congress to have a budget. Now Senator MURRAY has followed up today. I believe. with a quote saying: \"... the Senate will once again return to regular order and move a budget resolution through the Budget Committee and to the Senate floor.\" So the Budget Committee has not been meeting. It has not been doing its duty. As the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. I have been aghast at the process and have talked about it for now for over 1.000 days. So this will be a good step. My colleagues would like to suggest somehow that they decided to do this out of the goodness of their hearts because it is the right thing to do. But I think the American people have had a belly full of this. The U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly passed budgets. but the Senate has refused to even bring one up in committee or on the floor for over 2 years now. They have said they are raising the debt limit for about 3 months. but they have declared that the Senate does not get paid until we have a budget. Right now there is no punishment for not passing a budget. I was a Federal prosecutor for over 15 years and know how to read a code. It has no penalty for failing to pass a budget. It says the Senate should bring up a budget. It should complete the budget process in committee by April 1 and then the full Senate should take it up and it should be completed by April 15. The Senate is given priority: 50 hours of debate. virtually unlimited amendmentsan opportunity to debate the financial condition of America. That is why it has not happened. Senator REID. the Democratic leader for the last several years. has said it would be foolish to have a budget. What he meant was that it would be foolish politically. Because when you bring up a budget. this is a tough thing. The House did that. PAUL RYAN offered a historic budget that would change the debt course of America and put us on a sound path. They had to make some tough choices. So they were. of course. attacked in the electionOh. these are horrible people. they want to throw old people off the cliff and that kind of thing and it was irresponsiblewhile during this entire process. the Senate was in direct violation of Federal law that required us to bring up a budget. We did not bring it up because it would be foolish. foolish politically. because we have to take tough votes. We have to stand and be counted. Numbers have to be analyzed: How much are you truly going to raise taxes? Oh. well. is that going to change the debt course? Is this latest $600 billion tax increase going to change the debt course of America? No. it is not. Our deficit last year was about $1.080 billion. How much would this tax increase. this $600 billion. have changed that? That is $60 billion a year. Instead of $1.080 billion or so in deficit. our deficit would have been $1.020 billion. Is that going to fix our problem? No. it will not. These are difficult problems. These are very difficult problems. and it is not going to be easy. But it was easy to attack the House while not producing a budget. It is a pretty flabbergasting thing to me. So I am glad we are now going to have this process. It will not be easy for Republicans. It will not be easy for Democrats. But what are we paid to do? What responsibility do we have as the Congressthat has the power of the purseif not discussing the great issues of our time? We are on an unsustainable debt path. Last year there was another trilliondollar deficit. and they are projecting we will have a trilliondollar deficit this year. That is 5 consecutive years of trilliondollar deficits. I know President Bush was criticized. and correctly sometimes. for spending too much. The highest deficit he ever had in 8 years was $470 billion. The year before he left it was $160 billion. President Obama has averaged well over $1.000 billion a year in an annual deficit ever since. This is not sustainable. as every expert has told us time and time again. So I am worried about it. Maybe we can move out of these secret meetings where the Senate just sits around and we wait for the people to appear. write us a bill at midnight on December 31actually 1 a.m. on January 1that is supposed to handle it and nobody has even read it. That is what we have been doing for the last 4 years. It has worked out good politically because it has kept an honest discussion of the dangerous path we are on from being part of the public debate. We have to have it part of the public debate. I am not saying this budget. if it moves through the Senate. is going to solve our problems and that it will be adopted. I am not saying that. But I do believe the American people will understand better the challenges we face and Senators will understand better the challenges we face. how deep they are. how systemic they are. In 2011. after Republicans won a victory in the midterm elections. there was hope we would have a new budget from the President. that he would reach out to the House that had gotten a Republican majority for a changethey took back the majority. and there were more Republicans in the Senateand that the President was going to produce a budget that would put us on the right path and maybe a historic path that would help make Social Security and Medicare sustainable. preserve those programs so people can go to bed at night and feel confident these programs not going to go bankrupt and there are not going to be dramatic cuts. We can do that. It would take some belttightening. but we could do that. Yet the administration refused: You are just partisan. SESSIONS. I am saying. without fear of contradiction by anybody who knows what has happened. that this administration basically has not wanted to talk about those deep spending issues that amount to more than half the money we spend. That was a challenge. Maybe that logjam has broken and this budget process will give us an opportunity to move forward. I do not like to be critical of nominees or anyone. I try to be as courteous and respectful as we can to people whom we deal with on a regular basis in the Congress. But I have to share with my colleagues a deep feeling that we have a serious credibility problem with credibility on debt and financing. We have to end that credibility problem. We have to be honest and deal with real numbers. In January of 2011. Mr. Jack Lew. the thenDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. with a substantial staffone of their primary duties is to produce a budget every yearsubmitted the Presidents Budget to Congress. The President always submits a budgetit has been late. but they have always sent them over. The Senate has not moved budgets like it is required to. but every President has always sent over a budget. There was great hope that the budget would be the kind of breakthroughwith a Republican House and a Democratic President and a Democratic Senatethat somehow this would be an opportunity for historic agreement to put America on a sound path and get us off these trilliondollar deficits. put us on a path to a balanced budget and do the kind of things that are necessary for the welfare of our country. Mr. Lew produced the budget. and he went on television immediately and talked about it. On Wednesday of that week. he was going to be before the Budget Committee. but this is what he said in his CNN Sunday morning interview about his budget. I would ask you to listen to these words. colleagues and friends. anybody who is watching. and see what they mean to you. He said: Our budget will get us. over the next several years. to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say were not adding to the debt anymore. were spending money that we have each year Money that we have each yearand then we can work on bringing down our national debt. That was on CNN. So he appeared before the Budget Committee and I asked him if that was an accurate statement. did he stand by that. He said: Yes. sir. and he never wavered from that. I will just say that as part of the budget process we get a stack of documentsthis muchfrom Mr. Lews office. The Office of Management and Budget submits themsupporting documentsas part of their process. They are easily ascertainable. The numbers are not in dispute. The lowest single deficit over 10 years that Mr. Lew projected was more than $600 billion. In other words. there was never a balanced budget. never paying down the debt. never a single year we were not borrowing at least $600 billion. None of what he said is accurate. It is breathtaking. I called it the greatest financial misrepresentation in history. It would have added $13 trillion to the debt of the United States over 10 years. by his own estimate. not stuff I made up. Yet he said we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore. So I thought. if a businessman reported to potential stock purchasers. our company is on the right track. we are not adding to our debt anymorewe are going to look the American people in the eye and say were not adding to the debt anymore. we are spending only money we haveyou are borrowingthe least amount of money you have borrowed in a single year is $600 billion. larger than President Bush ever had in 8 years as President. When I asked him about it. he insisted that it was true. So we have got a problem here. and that is why I am not going to support Mr. Lew for the Secretary of the Treasury. I am not going to vote for him. I believe he knew exactly what he was saying. He produced a budget that was panned by virtually every editorial board in America. They hammered it as failing to meet the challenge of our time. and he knew it was that way. He is not a person who doesnt understand these issues. He knew what it was all about. But they decided they would go out and spin it this way. They would say it did what the American people wanted. I hate to be this harsh. but there is only one conclusion. They decided to produce a budget that did not change the debt course of America and left us on an unsustainable path. Even their own numbers show that. but they would tell the American people this. say it was fixed. and maybe lull them into a false sense of confidence. Then they attacked PAUL RYAN of the Republican House for producing a realistic budget. It wasnt a dramatic budget. it didnt even balance in 10 years. but it changed us and put us on a sound path. They would attack him as not caring about people. and for 2 years that is what has happened. Once we bring a budget to the floor of this Senate. Republicans and Democrats are going to find out this is a very difficult situation we are in. The challenge is going to be very difficult. and we are going to have a hard time dealing with it. Mr. Lew didnt just make that comment to CNN. in case you think I am exaggerating here. He also said this in an NPR. National Public Radio. interview on February 15. 2011. the day. I believe. of a Budget Committee hearing: If were able to reduce the deficit to the point where we can pay for our spending and invest in the future. that is an enormous accomplishment. This budget has specific proposals that would do that. He looked the American people in the eye. or. I guess. talked to their ears on NPR. and said his \"budget has specific proposals\" that would put us in a position to pay for our spending and invest in the future and reduce our deficit. He went on to say on February 15. 2011. at the Budget Committee hearingand I think this was my question. Was this an accurate statement that you made. Mr. OMB Director? He said: Its an accurate statement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt. Weve stopped spending money that we dont have. I mean. I almost cant read those words without the hair standing up on the back of my neck. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget appeared before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. and he said. \"its an accurate statement.\" this baloney. \"its an accurate statement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt . . . Weve stopped spending money that we dont have.\" Nothing could be further from the truththe lowest single deficit was $600 billion. What about on a different CNN interview on February 14. 2011: It [the budget] takes real actions now so that between now and 5 years from now we can get our deficit under control so that we can stabilize things so that were not adding to the debt anymore. He promised. and looked the American people in the eye and said. in 5 years. we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore. He knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what he wanted the American people to hear. There is no ambiguity about it. and it was utterly false. February 13. 2011. on ABC. he said: This budget has a lot of pain. [but] it does the job. it cuts the deficit in half by the end of the Presidents first term... Its going to take us a lot of hard work just to take us to the point where were not adding to the debt. There is not one year that they are not adding to the debt. In the seventh. eighth. ninth. tenth years of the budget that Jack Lew presented. when you look at his real numbers. the deficit was going up each year. So it was not a fix to our debt problem. Then he says this on the White House blog. February 13. 2011: Like every family. we have to tighten our belts and live within our means while were investing in the things that we need to have a strong and secure future ... We know that you have to stabilize where were going before you can move on and solve the rest of the problem. This budget does that. So it is going to stabilize us and move us forward. Well. as I say. that was not well received. The New York Times wrote this on February 5. 2011. That was his oped. I wont go into the editorials. but a whole list of those were critical of Mr. Lew. I would just say this. we are in a difficult financial position. We need honesty. we need a budget that is truthful. we need the regular order so the Budget Committee does its work. and then it comes to the floor of the U.S. Senatethis will be first time in over a thousand daysit guarantees 50 hours of debate. it cant be filibustered. it can be passed with a simple majority. we will know what is in it. and people can offer amendments. That is what should have been happening for a long time that has not been happening. That is what the law requires. and that should be completed by April 15 of this year. As we go forward. I am confident that we will be better served by public discussion of our debt. not secret meetings. I have been critical of them. I had hoped that some of them would ripen into some good solutions. but all we have had is temporary \"kick the can down the road\" maneuvers. and nothing substantial has been done to change the debt course of America. By the way. when Mr. Erskine Bowles. whom President Obama appointed to head his fiscal commission. saw this budget in 2011. he said it goes nowhere near where they will have to go to resolve our fiscal nightmare. Everybody knew this budget wouldnt do the job. and that is why it was never brought through the process. and that is why it wasnt brought to the floor for a full budget analysis in committee and in debate on the floor. So as we go forward. I will be meeting with our new chairman. Senator MURRAY. She is a great. tough advocate for her values. but she is a good person to work with. I have told her we will try to work with her. but we are going to talk about the great issues of our time. the difficulties we face. and see if we cant make this system work better and try to put this country on a sound financial footing. We can do it. We can get this country on a sound path. It is not impossible. but anybody who thinks it will be easy is wrong. This is going to take some hard work. As we do that in a bipartisan. open way in the committee. on the floor of the Senate. the American people will be able to digest the difficulty of some of our challenges. and so will our Members in Congress. In the end. that. I think. leaves us in the best position to reach the kind of agreement. compromise. solution. that can put us on the right path. because everybody is going to have to swallow a little bit. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I couldnt help but listen to the words of my friend from Alabama regarding the debt and deficit. and then to be reminded that we did balance the budget not too long ago. In fact. in 1993. we passed a tax bill here in the Senate and in the Houseit was signed into law by President Clintonwhich set us on a course to reduce the deficit. In fact. by the years 1999 and 2000. we balanced the budget. We had a surplus. Can you imagine that? We had a surplus for 3 years in a row. The Congressional Budget Office and OMB said that if we had continued on that pathway. we would have fully paid off the national debt by 2010. When I hear my friends on the Republican side talk about reducing the deficit and the debt. we did that. When the Democrats were in charge of the Senate and the House and we had the Presidency. I would also point out that not one Republican on that side of the aisle voted for that bill in 1993. I can remember standing here and debating with my friend from Texas at that time on this bill. and there were all kinds of dire warnings that if this bill passed. we were going to have depressions and recessions. the business community would stop. and it would be the worst thing that ever happened to this country if we passed the Clinton tax proposal. Well. we passed it. but without one Republican vote. And what happened? We had the largest spurt of economic growth this country had seen almost since the 1950s and 1960s. This was to the point to where. as I said. by the end of the 1990s we had a balanced budget and we had a surplus. Then President Bush comes into office. and we had surpluses. enough to retire the entire national debt by the year 2010. So what did President Bush say? Well. now we are going to give tax cuts. They pushed through this big tax cut bill for which this Senator did not vote. That tax cut bill gave a lot away to corporations and to the wealthy of this country. so that they didnt have to pay their fair share. Also. there were two wars we didnt pay for. plus a recession. and now we are in this huge deficit. We know how to get ourselves out of this fix. We did it in 1993. It was by having the people in this country pay their fair share of taxes. to make sure that corporations. to make sure that those who enjoy the benefits of living in this free and productive society. pay their fair share. This is for all of us to raise the revenues necessary to meet our obligations in education. health. infrastructure building. the security of our Nation. and also to raise enough revenues so we can reduce the deficit. But it can only be done with fairness and with fair sharing by all. and that is what President Obama has spoken about. He spoke about that in his inaugural address. That is what we have been talking about here for a long time. that is. shared sacrifice on behalf of all. and to make sure that all pay their fair share of taxes in this country so we can once again do what we did in 1993. We can do it again if only my friends on the Republican side will join with us in making sure we raise the necessary revenues to get us out of this hole. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. first of all. this is the first time I have spoken on the floor when you were in the chair. Welcome to the Senate and welcome to the presiding chair. I want to talk for a few minutes today about a baseball great. a Missouri great. Stan Musial. who passed away on Saturday at the age of 92. Stan Musial was born in November 1920 in Denora. PA. His title was Stan \"The Man.\" He was the youngest of six children. When he wasnt called Stan \"The Man.\" he was just a guy who worked at a company as a young man. whose dad was a Polish immigrant. whose mother was of Czechoslovakian ancestry. and whose dreams were probably not to become a professional baseball player but who was. indeed. a great athlete from the very start. In his remarks. when he presented Stan Musial the Medal of Freedom in 2011. President Obama said the following: Stan matched his hustle with humility. He retired with 17 records even as he missed a season in his prime to serve his country in the Navy. He was the first player to make get this $100.000. Even more shocking. he asked for a pay cut when he didnt perform up to his own expectations. I dont think that August Busch gave him the pay cutagain. a quotebut I have read the story where Stan Musial was holding out for a pay package somewhere in the mid90s and August Busch. Jr.. who not long before that had bought the Cardinals. called him into the office and said: Im never going to pay you 90whatever thousand dollars he was asking for. He said: Im going to pay you $100.000. and you are going to be the first baseball player to make $100.000. Stan Musial played for the Cardinals from 1941 to 1963. the only Major League team he played for. He entered the majors in 1941 as the fifth youngest player. He ended his career in 1963 as the third oldest player. He had a record of 24 times being named to the Major League Baseball AllStar team. He won seven National League batting titles. three National League Most Valuable Player awards. and he led the Cardinals to three World Series championships in the 1940s. Stan MusialNo. 6had a batting average of at least .300 in every 1 of his 17 seasonsa .300 hitter for every 1 of his 17 seasons. His lifetime batting average was .331. He batted .330 in the year before he decided to retire. He had 3.630 career hits. hitting 1.815 hits in St. Louis at Sportsman Park and Busch Stadium. and he hit another 1.815 on the road. He played as well at home as he did away from home. He missed the entire 1945 season while he was serving in the Navy. It was a fan at Ebbets Fieldwith the Dodgers playing at Ebbets Fieldwho groaned as he came to the plate one time in a gamehe was always particularly good against the Dodgers. The fan said: Here comes the man. And from that point on. his nickname was Stan \"The Man.\" I had a chance to sit by Tommy Lasorda at a luncheon a few years ago after I had read a biography of Stan Musial. Tommy was sort of the longtime Dodgers manager who was a player when Stan Musial was playing. and he said he thought Stan Musial was the best ballplayer he ever saw play. and he was death on the Dodgers. The Dodgers fans liked him. but it was a real rivalry. Stan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame the first year he was eligible. in 1969. and he would be one of the great ambassadors to baseball for the rest of his life. When he retired in 1963. Commissioner Ford Frick said: Here stands baseballs perfect warrior. Here stands baseballs perfect knight. Stan Musial became an American icon throughout ballparks and over the radio in the 1940s and 1950s. KMOX. in the 1960s. had a booming signal that went almost all the way to the west coast and covered a lot of the South. and the St. Louis Cardinals were the furthest south of any baseball team and the furthest west of any baseball team. Because of that. Stan Musial played on a club that. in many ways. became Americas team at that time. I can remember growing up in southwest Missouri on a dairy farm. and particularly late at night when we were hauling hayand I can remember this when I was 10 or 12 years oldand whoever was in the truck must have been almost deaf because the driver would have the radio turned as loud as you could turn the radio up. and the St. Louis Cardinals game would be coming out of both windows as we were out there working in the fields or. if we werent working in the field. we would be sitting on the porch somewhere listening to the Cardinals play. and there was no greater Cardinal than Stan Musial. Bob Gibson. another great Cardinal and Stans teammate and fellow Hall of Famer. said: Stan Musial is the nicest man I ever met in baseball. And Bob Gibson went on to say he didnt particularly associate nice with baseball. but he associated nice with Stan Musial. Bob Costas had this to say about Stan Musial: Stan Musial didnt hit in 56 straight games. He didnt hit .400 for a season. He didnt get 4.000 hits. He didnt get 500 home runs. He didnt hit a home run in his last at bat. just a single. He didnt marry Marilyn Monroe. he married his high school sweetheart. His excellence was a quiet excellence. ESPN titled Musial the most underrated athlete ever. Only Hank Aaronthinking about the things Stan Musial didnt dohad more runs than Stan Musial and extra base hits. Only Tris Speaker and Pete Rose had more hits. And only Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds created more runs. But Stan Musial was at the highest levels in all of those areas. Writing in the St. Louis Post Dispatch this week. Bernie Miklasz wrote: Lets celebrate Musials extraordinary life and be thankful for his enduring presence through the decades. Lets keep it simple in honor of this remarkably uncomplicated man. There has never been a more perfect union. a better relationship between an athlete and a town. than Stan Musial and St. Louis. From the time Stan took his first atbat as a Cardinal. until his death Saturday at his home in Ladue. he was part of the communitys soul for 71 years. 4 months. and 2 days. Many stories about Stan Musial have been told. but I want to mention three that Bernie mentioned in that same article. He talked about when Musial was first inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fameas I said earlier. as soon as you could possibly be inducted. It was an overcast day in Cooperstown. The crowd was quiet. subdued. and a little bit put off by the day. Moments before Musials official ceremony. the clouds got out of the way and the sunshine emerged. and Dizzy Deans widow said: \"Stan brought the sun. He always does.\" In the 1960s. a second story emerged of Musial and other Major League stars visiting U.S. troops in Vietnam. and they went to the military hospitals to console the wounded soldiers. One seriously injured soldier looked up at Musial from his hospital bed and said: \"Youre the best.\" And Musials response was: \"No. you are.\" Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Joe Black. an African American. told a story about being racially taunted by players in the St. Louis dugout during a game. Musial. who was batting at the time. and facing Joe Black. stepped out and angrily kicked the dirt to display his disapproval of his own teammates. He waited after the game to tell Black: Im sorry that happened. But dont you worry about it. Youre a great pitcher. You will win a lot of games. Black said Musials support helped him gain the confidence he needed to become a top pitcher. The fourth and last story Bernie told was of legendary center fielder Willie Mays. who frequently talked about Musial befriending AfricanAmerican players. relating that at an AllStar game black players were being ignored by the other players. Mays said: We were in the back of the clubhouse playing poker and none of the white guys had come back or said. \"Hi\" or \"Hows it going?\" or \"How you guys doing?\" or \"Welcome to the All Star Game.\" Nothing. Were playing poker and all of a sudden I look up and here comes Stan towards us. He grabs a chair. sits down and starts playing cards with us. And Stan didnt know how to play poker! But that was his way of welcoming us. of making us feel a part of it. I never forgot that. We never forgot that. Musial didnt make a lot of fiery speeches. He didnt \"lead\" a movement or try to promote himself as an angelic humanitarian. He just did good things. There is one last story. a love story. between Stan and his wife Lil. This may be the best Musial statistic of all. They were married for 71 years. 4 months. and 2 days until Lils death on May 3. with Stan following her in January. I listened to KMOX from the hay truck I talked about earlier. like lots of other Cardinals and Musial fans. but I remember the first time I saw Stan Musial play at Sportsman Park. I remember the first time. 30 years later. I actually met him. when I was the Secretary of State in Missouri. Getting to meet Stan Musial was about as good as it got even then. I remember hearing him play \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" on his harmonica. Baseball was lucky to have him. Missouri was lucky to have him. and the Cardinals and St. Louis were lucky to have him. and I am pleased to be here today to say how much we appreciate Stan Musial. I am also pleased to be joined by my colleague from Missouri. Senator",

    "speech": "Madam President. I want to thank my colleague. He and I disagree on many things. but we agree on many things also. and one of those things usually begins and ends with the State we love. Missouri. and certainly some of our most famous and beloved people who come from Missouri. Obviously. there is no one who deserves more love and respect than Stan Musial. There are so many memories about Stan Musial that I want to try to encapsulate today. but the interesting thing about the memories I have about Stan Musial is that I dont have these memories because I am a Senator. They do not belong uniquely to me because I am an elected official. I have these memories that I share with hundreds of thousands of people who were lucky enough to encounter Stan Musial during his time on Earth. You know. when you meet somebody. and you can tell they are kind of looking over you to try to find the person who is more important behind you or maybe they are impatient because they do not think you are a big enough deal to be taking their time? If you look at our sports icons today who travel with posses and have entourages and certain rules about who can come near them and who cant and when. that was not Stan Musial. Not one day of his career or one day after his career did he consider himself untouchable. He saw it as his duty and obligation to be there for all fans. Whether it was somebody who worked at the ballpark sweeping after the game was over or whether it was a very talented ballplayer from another team. everyone was equal in Stan Musials eyes. What a wonderful American value. I could stand here today. Madam President. and talk about his amazing record as a baseball player. his unique swing. and the beauty of his accomplishments in Americas favorite pastime. but what we need to focus on as we mourn the loss of this living legend is his character because it was his character that brought universal love. respect. and devotion to the man. our man. Stan \"The Man.\" I know Senator BLUNT talked about this story. but I want to elaborate a little bit. It is 1952. Joe Black has just been called up to the majors after spending 1 year in the minors with the Brooklyn organization. He is facing Stan Musial. Now. keep in mind that this is an accomplished baseball player who had won two championships in the Negro Baseball Leagues. and it had only been a few years since Jackie Robinson had. in fact. broken the color barrier for Major League Baseball. He is facing Stan Musial. who already was the most feared hitter in baseball. He is standing there as a Black man on the mound in this baseball game. and out of the Cardinal dugout come jeers and taunts. In fact. one of the things said was. hey. Stan. you are not going to have any trouble hitting that ball against that dark background. When the game was over. Stan Musial decided not to stay in the Cardinal dugout. Joe Black told the story that as he sat in the dugout. he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up. and there was Stan Musial from the opposing dugout saying to Joe Black: You are going to be a great pitcher. Now. that encapsulates the character of Stan Musial. Chuck Connors. \"The Rifleman.\" used to tell this story. He was a struggling hitter for the Chicago Cubs. I may need to explain to you. Madam President. but I certainly dont need to explain to anybody in Cardinal Nation that the Chicago Cubs are an opponent. Now. we dont like the Chicago Cubs in Cardinal Nation. Chuck Connors asked a teammate what he should do about his swing. He was struggling with being able to hit in the majors. and they all told him the same thing: The only guy who can help you is Stan Musial. So even though he was reluctant to approach a hitter on the opposing team. he went to Musial and asked for help. and. of course. Stan responded as all of us would expect he would. he spent 30 minutes in the cage with an opposing player trying to help him with his swing. Connors recounted that he really wasnt ever that good of a hitter. but he said he never forgot Stan Musials kindness. And when he finished watching me cut away at the ball. Stan slapped me on the back and told me to keep swinging. After the 1946 season. the promoters from the Mexican League decided it was time for them to up the ante on baseball. At the time. Stan Musial was making the enormous sum of $13.500 playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mexican League came to Stan Musial and said: We are going to offer youa kings ransom at the time$125.000 for 5 years. That was a lot of money for Stan Musial and his family. but he turned down the Mexican League. When asked about it later. he said: Back in my day. we didnt think about money as much. We just enjoyed playing the game. We loved baseball. I didnt think about anybody else but the Cardinals. Harry Caray knew Stan Musial for over 50 years. He would often tell the story of Stan Musial wandering out of the ballpark after a steaming doubleheaderand trust me. we can have steaming doubleheaders in Missourilooking as if he had been through 15 rounds in a prize fight and every single thing in his body language signifying that he was exhausted and just wanted to go home and lie down. Instead. when he got to his car. he found fans waiting for him. \"Watch this.\" Harry Caray told a friend. And sure enough. Musials whole body straightenedlike Popeye had just eaten a can of spinachand he started shouting. \"Whaddya Say! Whaddya Say!\" And he signed every single autograph of all the fans surrounding his car. Harry Caray loved telling that story not because it was unusualthat is who Stan Musial wasbut for the opposite reason: because it was ordinary. Even in his time. when baseball players werent paid as much and so were more part of the community. Stan Musial stood apart by standing with the people in the community. It wasnt just Cardinal Nation that worshipped Stan Musial. His opponents. the opposing teamscan you imagine this happening today? Believe it or not. the New York Mets had a Stan Musial Day at their park. And in Chicago. the home of the Cubs. he once finished first in a favorite player survey. edging out the legendary Ernie Banks. who was also a very nice guy who was beloved by the fans of baseball in the Midwest. I could go on and on with stories that reflect this mans character. Yes. he has amazing statistics. Yes. him hitting a baseball was a thing of beauty to all baseball fans in America. But. really. what this man was about was that phrase we love to throw around in politics way too often. that is. American values. This was a man who didnt have to talk about his values because he lived themhis love for his family and how close they are. I am very fortunate to be friends with the Musial family and have visited with them in the days since his death. They received messages from every star in the constellation of American baseball. but one stood out. Joe Torre. upon hearing of Stans death just a few days ago. sent a message to the Musial family. and it simply said this: Stan Musial was a Hall of Famer in the game of life. We will miss you. Stan Musial. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as we get started on this next Congressand I wish to congratulate the Presiding Officer for joining this Chamber. As someone who has had the opportunity to preside during my first 2 years in the Senate. I commend the Presiding Officer for those actions and look forward to working with you on a variety of projects. What I want to do today is continue a tradition that I actually inherited from one of our former colleagues. Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware. Senator Kaufman. who had been a longtime employee of the Senate. came to this floor on a fairly regular basis during his time here to basically celebrate and acknowledgein most casesthe tireless. unsung work of so many of our Federal employees. As we debate budgets. debt. and deficit. we oftentimes recognize we have to make extraordinary and difficult choices in cuts. In many instances. behind all of those cuts are Federal employees who do remarkable work in keeping us safe. providing services. and helping our country grow. Ted Kaufman used to come down here on a regular basis and celebrate some of those unsung heroes. I was proud to continue his tradition during the last Congress and look forward to carrying it on through another session. I start this next Congress actually celebrating two great Federal employees. I might add. who both happen to be Virginians who serve as excellent role models. They represent the thousands of professionals who work quietly every day across our intelligence community to keep our Nation safe. Very often these professionals work in anonymity and many risk their lives in troubled spots far away from the limelight. and that is how it should be. Recently we have seen certain incidents abroad. and sometimes they pay with the highest sign of sacrifice in terms of their lives. For their service. their late nights and early mornings away from their families. the risks they take. and the sacrifices they make every dayand because they do not hear this nearly enoughallow me to say thank you to those members of the intelligence community.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it has been said in St. Louis. MO. baseball is not a sport. it is a religion. If that is true. Stan Musial was a St. Louis civic patron saint. Stan Musial was an icon in St. Louis. He was the best ballplayer to wear a Cardinals uniform and one of the best to play the game of baseball. Stan Musial was my childhood hero when I was a boy and he remains a hero in my life to this day. When a person reaches my age. and maybe my station in life. they are supposed to be beyond the stage of swooning adolescence. But when it comes to Stan Musial. I am a 10yearold kid all over again in East St. Louis. IL. buying more bubble gum than I can possibly afford in the hope that I would open one of those packages and find. covered in pink powder. a card that had Stan Musials picture. It was the treasure of my youth. and it still would be today if my mom had not thrown those cards away. Stan Musials death has hit the Cardinals Nation like a death in the family. One Cardinal fan spoke for many of us when she said losing Stan Musial \"is like losing a grandparent. Its hard not to tear up.\" I grew up in East St. Louis across the river. and my most prized possession when I was a kid was my very first Stan Musial Rawlings baseball glove. As a kid I rubbed that glove with something called Gloveoleum until I was the only one who could still see Stan Musials name burned in the leather. One of the highlights in my life came 2 years ago when I got to meet Stan Musial in person for the very first time in my life. It was at the White House. February 11. 2011. Stan Musial was there to receive from President Obama the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is one of only eight other baseball players in the history of America to receive that prestigious honor. Listen to the company he joined: Joe DiMaggio. Jackie Robinson. Ted Williams. Roberto Clemente. Hank Aaron. Frank Robinson. and the famous Buck ONeill. At the White House I stood patiently waiting for the moment to ask Stan Musial to sign that old baseball glove. which I still have and have had since I was a kid. He agreed to do so. What a thrill. I was 10 years old all over again. Outside Busch Stadium in St. Louis is a statue of Stan \"The Man\" in his playing prime. He is coiled up in his batting style. Every coach said dont bat like Stan \"The Man.\" even though he has great numbers. If you do that. you will never hit the ball. We all tried. the coaches were right. Etched in the base of that statue are words that Major League Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick said when Stan retired in 1963: \"Here stands baseballs perfect warrior. Here stands baseballs perfect knight.\" On the field and off Stan Musial was always a gentleman. always a champion. He exemplified the values of sportsmanship. discipline. hard work. grace. consistency. and a love of family. Baseball broadcaster Vince Scully. a Hall of Famer himself. once said: \"How good was Stan Musial? He was good enough to take your breath away.\" Stan Musial played his entire 22year career for the St. Louis Cardinals. He did take off one season in 1945 to serve our country in the U.S. Navy during World War II. His 3.026 games with the same club are second only to the 3.308 games over 23 years by Carl Yastrzemski. When Stan Musial retired from baseball after the 1963 season. he held 29 National League records and 17 Major League records. Here are just some of his career numbers: a batting average of .331. an onbase percentage of .417. 3.630 hits. 725 doubles. 177 triples. 475 homersand the first homer I can ever remember seeing on television was the AllStar game in St. Louis. and darned if Stan Musial didnt get up in the 12th inning. parking a home run into the outfield stands. winning it for the National League. I couldnt have been more thrilled. my first exposure to baseball on television. He had 1.951 RBIs and 1.949 runs. He is the only baseball player to finish his career in the top 25 in all of these categories. Where did he get that nickname? It was coined not by a Cardinals fan but by a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in May 1946. after Musials four hits helped lead the Cardinals to a 13to4 drubbing of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Every time Stan Musial came to the plate. the fans in Ebbets Field said. \"Here comes the man.\" And the name stuck. The legendary baseball writer Red Barber once described the 1947 season as \"the year all hell broke loose in baseball.\" It was the year Jackie Robinson integrated Major League Baseball. Jackie Robinson would later recall when asked about his baseball career that it was Stan Musial and Hank Greenberg. two players who went out of their way to be friendly and encouraging in that historic and difficult year. Maybe Stan Musials greatest baseball day came on May 2. 1954. It was a double header in St. Louis against the New York Giants. He hit three homers in the first game and two in the second. In 1957. Stan Musial became the first Major League Baseball player to earn the amazing salary of $100.000 a year. Two years later. when his batting average dipped to .255. it was Musial who went to the Cardinals owners and asked them to cut his salary back to $80.000. He wasnt playing up to what he thought he had the potential to play up to. Late in his final season. he stayed up all night waiting for the birth of his first grandchild. and the next day he became the first grandfather to ever homer in the Major Leagues. Umpiresand this says something about what a gentleman he always wasumpires never once ejected Stan Musial from a baseball game in more than 3.000 games. On January 21. 1969. Stan Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot. He was named on 92 percent of the ballotssomething on which to reflect after what we just went through a few weeks ago when no one made the cut for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Stan Musial was the first player to receive 300 votes on a Hall of Fame ballot. When he retired. the St. Louis Cardinals retired his number. No. 6. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny has said that when the entire Cardinals team takes the field this year. they will be wearing a No. 6 patch on their uniforms. But then he said: It will be a call for us to do our very best to live up to that high standard of excellence. Then he added: You dont come across names like warrior. prince and knight by just having Hall of Fame statistics. It comes from making an impact in peoples lives. I was in that group. Mr. Musial. I say thank you. Hes a perfect example of what it means to wear this jersey. I want to give credit to my colleague. Senator CLAIRE MCCASKILL. She worked with mein fact. she led the way in terms of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. along with Senator Bond. for Stan Musial. And she came up with a great idea. I dont know if it is going to go anywhere. but I am going to try to help her make it a reality. She has suggested we can honor this American hero. this regional hero and the values he stood for by naming the new bridge being built across the Mississippi River at St. Louis in honor of Stan Musial. I grew up on the Illinois side. and we kind of looked over at Missouri a little differently than most. and they looked at us a little differently too. But if there was one thing that ever united us it was baseball loyalty and Stan Musial. It is a perfect name for a bridge that spans between Illinois and Missouri in that region of the country. I am proud to join Senator CLAIRE MCCASKILL. and we will be introducing a bill to name the bridge the Stan Musial Memorial Bridge. Other legislation is being considered in the Illinois and Missouri General Assemblies at this time. I wish them the best in honoring this great man. It was my great honor to join him on that historic date when he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

    "speech": "Mr. President. more and more Americans from all walks of life. of both political parties. feel there is not just a pond or a sea but an ocean of difference between the real world where they live and Washington. DC. They viewI think correctlyWashington. DC. as a different planet where normal rules do not seem to apply. That is why on the first day I could introduce new legislation in this new Congress. I chose to introduce a package of reform measuresmeasures aimed at bridging that gap. bringing those two worlds together. returning usreturning Washington to the real world and reconnecting with the American people. The American people are also concernedrightlyabout the bitter partisanship. the overly ideological tone of almost all of the debate we have here in Washington now. here in Congress. I believe these sorts of reform measuresthe four bills I have introduced in particularcan also help bridge that divide because they are not ideological. they are not partisan. they are goodgovernment reform. things that can and should and. hopefully. will bring us together and bring us together and reconnect us with the American people. Again. it is another reason I chose to introduce this package of four reform measures. four goodgovernment bills on the first day I could introduce legislation this Congress. The first is a very simple and basic but fundamental idea: term limits for Members of Congress. I am honored to be joined by six other Senators right out of the gate. right out of the box in terms of cosponsoring this important legislation: Senators PAUL. AYOTTE. COBURN. LEE. RUBIO. CRUZ. and JOHNSON. I thank them for their cosponsorship and their support. This measure would limit Members of Congress in the House to three consecutive terms. a total of 6 years. and the Senate to two consecutive terms. a total of 12 years. It is a consensus measure supported by citizens groups very active and supportive of the concept of term limits. The idea. again. is simple: to reconnect Congress with the American people. to do away with the notion of legislating as a career. and to get back to the Founders vision of citizen legislators. When I was in the State legislature. I authored and passed term limits for the State legislature. That required a State constitutional amendmenta big deala twothirds vote in each body. and then a vote of the people. But because of the peoples voices rising and being heard. we achieved that. With that reform. which was voted overwhelmingly into the State constitution by the people of Louisiana. we have a regular influx now of new. fresh blood. real experience from the real world that reconnects in a very healthy way the State legislature and all of us. the citizens. whom it is supposed to represent. That was needed for the State legislature. and if it wasand it wasit is needed a thousand times more for Congress because that divide. that sea. that ocean. that difference between different planets in the eyes of so many Americans is even greater between Congress and the real world. Congress and the American people. The second bill I have introduced is a bill to do away with automatic pay increases for Members of Congress. That is present law. that we get regular increases of pay with no proposal. no bill put in the hopper. no debate. no need for an inconvenient vote. I think that is just outright wrong. I think it helps build that distrust on the part of the American people. I am joined by a bipartisan cosponsor. Senator MCCASKILL of Missouri. I thank her for her leadership and her support of this measure. Again. the measure is very simple: Just repeal. do away with any automatic pay increases for Members of Congress. If there is to be a pay increase. there should be a bill proposing it and open debate and a public vote. The third measure is also fully bipartisan. I am introducing it with Senator BILL NELSON of Florida. It is reform of the Corps of Engineerssomething very important for our two States but also for. indeed. the whole country. In Louisiana. in Florida. and elsewhere. unfortunately. the Corps of Engineers has become a poster child for a dysfunctional Federal Government. a Federal bureaucracy. a Federal system that is just bogged down. does not work. It takes 10 and 20 years to study something. never ever getting to construction. We need to streamline and reform that process. and the VitterNelson bill does just that by greatly streamlining the process by which Corps projects can come to fruition. putting State and local leaders more in charge of that effort. at first on a pilot basis. Hopefully. we will expand that in the future for important Corps of Engineers projects. Again. that is particularly important for our States of Louisiana and Florida. but it is important for so many States and for the country as a whole. Fourth and finally. I am introducing a measure that I have had before to reform Federal campaign finance law to prohibit PACs and campaign funds from employing Members spouses or family members. That is just a way. quite frankly. in some circumstances for Members of Congress. politicians. to pad their family income. I think that is wrong. and that leads directly to the real suspicion and low regard in which so many Americans hold this institution. Again. this bill is simple. straightforward. but important. It would prohibit spouses and immediate family members of Members of Congress from receiving payments from that Members campaign accounts or leadership PACs. That is a loophole and an area of abuse we must close. We must prohibit that abuse in the future. These four bills wont solve every problem out there. They wont be the beall and endall of important reform and goodgovernment efforts. but they would be an important start. They would help us truly reconnect with the American people and narrow this divide. which is so vast right now. between the real world. real Americans. and this institution. They would be important. nonpartisan. nonideological reform efforts that we can gather around. Republicans and Democrats alike. to do something positive. to do something productive. and to reconnect with the American people. I urge my colleagues from both parties to support these measures. to come on as cosponsors. Many of you already have. and I thank you for that. Mr. President. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to honor the life. legacy and service of a dear friendJohn Edward Bresch. Jack lead a life filled with compassion. He worked tirelessly for everyone to have access to affordable. quality health care. especially needy children and families. His heart was as big as heaven. But Jacks life was also a life of great humor. Anybody who knew him also knew his warm and infectious laugh. It was a sure sign that Jack was somewhere nearby because you could almost hear his laughter before you saw his face. And everybody was glad to see Jack coming their way. He truly never met a stranger. Sadly. we wont be able to hear that distinct laughter again. Jack passed away on September 1. 2012. surrounded by his family after a brief and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. From the moment of his fateful diagnosis until the day he left us. we saw in him grace and courage. dignity and humility. joy and. yes. laughterand so much love and gratitude lived out on a daily basis that. even in our sorrow. his memory will never be lost. Tomorrow. Jack will be laid to rest in our Nations most hallowed groundArlington National Cemeterywith full military honors as a decorated Naval Lieutenant who served as a Chaplain during the Vietnam war. In his life. Jack Bresch was many things but above all. a family man. devoted to his wife. JoAnn. his children. Mary Elizabeth. James Richard. and Jeffrey John. and 10 grandchildren on whom he doted. He also leaves behind countless friends and colleagues whose lives are enriched with memories of this gregarious. energetic. largerthanlife man. But when a loved one is gone. it is often the little things you remember most. Some of us will remember how much Jack loved neckties. Some of us will remember sharing Jacks favorite drinka Manhattan. made with Makers Mark. up. no bitters. with a twist of orange. Some of us will remember how often Jack quoted the 19th century German politician Otto von Bismark-\" Politics is the art of the possible.\" And some of us will remember how proud Jack was to be at the White House when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act for which he worked so tirelessly. A friend saw Jack on TV and sent him a text to let him know. and Jack texted back. \"Just a pleasure to be here.\" It was a pleasure for Jack to be anywhere. Simply put. Jack enjoyed being with people. and people enjoyed being with Jack. He was a great person to talk toprobably because he began his adult life as a Roman Catholic priest. Jack was a priest in the Diocese of Pittsburgh. his native city. from 1966 to 1974. In 1968. at the height of the Vietnam war. he entered the U.S. Navy and served as a Navy and Marine Corps Chaplain in posts around the world. During his time in the service. he supervised drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and worked as a liaison with the American Red Cross. After the war. Jack left the priesthood. But in some ways. he never stopped being a chaplain. in the sense that he never wavered from his steadfast belief in social justice. He carried that belief forward in career that made the world a better placeworking for Congress. the Federal Government. the Illinois Hospital Association. the Catholic Health Association. and the American Dental Education Association. Many members of Congress got to know Jack through his work as the lead lobbyist for the Catholic Health Association. They also learned quickly just how hard it was to say \"no\" to Jack. While at the Catholic Health Association. Jack worked closely with then First Lady Hillary Clinton and the White House to develop a plan for reforming the Nations health care system. While at the American Dental Education Association. he was instrumental in improving access to dental care for needy children. For more than a decade. he worked diligently to ensure that policymakers understood the value of oral health to overall healththe reason why he was invited to the White House for the signing of the Affordable Care Act. Jack lived long enough to see the Supreme Court uphold key portions of the Affordable Care Act. He knew the law wasnt perfect. but he was happy to see it move forward. Remember. he believed that \"politics is the art of the possible.\" To JoAnn and Jacks entire family. my wife Gayle and I extend our deepest sympathy because we are part of that family. Jack and I shared four of his 10 grandchildren. but he lent all the rest of them to me. too. It is hard to think of this world without Jack being a part of it. making us laughand hearing him laughand making us carethe way he cared. There is a wonderful anonymous quote which may well describe how we should think of Jacks passing. especially since he served so courageously in the Navy. It offers great comfort to those who grieve. And it goes something like this: I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength. and I stand and watch her until. at length. she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to mingle with each other. Then someone at my side says. \"There! Shes gone.\" Gone where? Gone from my sight that is all. She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side. and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the place of destination. Her diminished size is in me. not in her. and just at the moment when someone at my side says. \"There. shes gone.\" there are other eyes watching her coming. and other voices ready to take up the glad shout. \"There she comes!\" Jack Bresch was a man whose optimism could overwhelm any doubter and whose joy for life was wonderfully contagious and completely irresistible. The ancient poets tell us that \"one must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.\" Our day with Jack Bresch was splendid indeed. As we prepare to honor Jack with the military honors due a decorated Navy Chaplain. I would like to end my tribute to Jacks life with a traditional nautical blessing and wish my dear friend \"fair winds and following seas.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Patti Page died on New Years Day this year. She was 85 years old. The Senate has not been in session for most of the time since then. I wanted to come to the floor to pay a Tennesseans tribute to Patti Page. Patti Page is best known for our State song. the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" A few years ago. in 2007. when I met her for the first time. she told me the story of the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" I knew some of it. but she completed the rest of it. In 1946. a couple of Tennesseans. Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart. were driving from Memphis to Nashville. That was before the interstate highways. It took a pretty good amount of time to drive that distance. I dont know whether or not they were drinking a beer on the way from Memphis to Nashville but they were relaxed. and one of them said to the other. Why is it Kentucky and Missouri have a waltz and Tennessee doesnt have a waltz? So on the way from Memphis to Nashville they took out a penny matchbox. which is one of these big boxes with wooden matches in it. dumped out the matches on the floorboards of the car. and on the back of the penny matchbox. between Memphis and Nashville. in 1946. Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart wrote the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" They sang it around a few places. Pee Wee King sang it at the Grand Ole Opry. Nobody paid much attention to it. Cowboy Copas sang it. They sang it on Red Foleys show in Missouri. Nothing much happened to the \"Tennessee Waltz\" until 1950. and this is the story Patti Page told me. Mercury Records in New York had a new song they were sure was going to be a big hit. It was called \"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus.\" I dont know whether it was a follow up to \"Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer.\" but the executives in New York were sure it was going to be a big hit so they wanted the hottest young female singer in America to record \"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus\" so they hired Patti Page. She flew to New York. recorded it for Mercury Records. and then in those days you always had to put a record on the back of the main record. You had to pick a song. It would be the \"B\" side. Just as a throwaway they put on the back of it the song by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart. the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" We know the rest of the story. The \"Tennessee Waltz\" sold about a million copies. Nobody ever heard of the \"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus\" except those who bought the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" Mike Kerr. who runs Kerr Records in Nashville. told me it was the best selling record ever by a female artist. Patti Page eventually sold 100 million records. She was the top selling female artist in record sales in history. Growing up I heard her songs. \"Mockingbird Hill.\" \"I Went To Your Wedding.\" \"Old Cape Cod.\" In 1952 she had a song called \"Doggie in the Window.\" It sounds like a silly little song. but it sold a lot of records and a great many Americans remember it. When I was Governor of Tennessee I would travel to Japan. recruiting industry. In the evenings I would go to a restaurant bar with friends. and to my astonishment all of my Japanese friends. many of whom did not know much English. could sing every word of the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" When I inquired about it. it was because it was introduced during the time of the American occupation of Japan in 1950 or so. and according to them. the Asian music doesnt have the same kind of standard that American music has. We get a phrase or a theme in our minds and we never forget it. such as the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" So the \"Tennessee Waltz\" became a song that most Japanese men of that age knew. remembered. and could sing from memory. I met Patti Page for the first time 6 years ago. It was 2007. She was about 79 or 80 years of age at the time. She told me the story of the recording of the \"Tennessee Waltz\" for Mercury Records. It turned out it was her last recording session. Mike Kerr. the owner of Kerr Records. had invited her to come to Nashville and record an album. \"Best of Patti Page.\" He had invited me to come play the piano while she sang the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" which I did. It was a real thrill and she was very patient to put up with an amateur piano player for her very special song. She told me then it wasnt the first time she had performed with a Tennessee Governor. In 1950 she had performed with Tennessee Governor Gordon Browning at a Memphis theater. This was when she was all the rage. the \"Tennessee Waltz\" was all the rage. and the Governor wanted to sing it with her. I asked how it went. She said. \"Well. to tell you the truth. the Governor wasnt a very good singer.\" I dont know what she said to others about my piano playing. but I think that was probably about as harsh a verdict as Patti Page ever rendered of any other person. According to the New York Times obituary. Patti Page once said: But I dont think Ive stepped on anyone along the way. If I have. I didnt mean to. Well. Patti Page is gone now. but her music is not. Whenever we Tennesseans hear our State song. the \"Tennessee Waltz.\" played. or whenever we sing it. we will remember the voice of Patti Page. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks that the obituary about Patti Page from the New York Times be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have only been a Member of the Senate for 2 years. but in that short period of time at least seven other countries have taken actions that we have not taken to better support and attract entrepreneurs to their countries economies. The map beside me shows those countries: the United Kingdom. Russia. Singapore. Australia. Brazil. Chile. and Canada. Those countries have changed their rules. regulations. passed laws. changed their policies to make their country more friendly to startup businesses and to entrepreneurship. I wish to focus on and visit with my colleagues about what is happening in one of those countriesour neighbor to the north. Canadaand explain why it is in the interests of our own country to act quickly to retain highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants. In 2002. Canada announced plans to create a new visa to attract foreign entrepreneurs to their country. Canada is developing a plan to admit foreign entrepreneurs who have received capital from venture funds to start businesses in Canada and to admit them to Canada within weeks. A spokesman for the Canadian immigration agency was quoted in September as saying: \"Canada seeks young. ambitious innovative immigrants who will contribute to Canadas job growth and further drive our economy.\" But Canada is not just changing its laws to attract entrepreneurs. it is advertising and trying to lure talent there. The ad we are now showingthis is a fullpage ad that appeared in a publication called Fast Company. It is an American magazine dedicated to startups. to technology and innovation. The advertisement for Ontario highlights R&D incentives and innovative and dynamic business environment and the top talent needed to grow new businesses. We in Congress and in the administration need to take note of this. Other countries. including our friends to the north. are aggressively courting entrepreneurs and talented individuals and they are luring them from here. they are trying to get them from the United States. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said: \"We need to proactively target a new type of immigrant entrepreneur who has the potential to build innovative companies that can compete on a global scale and create jobs for Canadians.\" While we work in the United States to continue educating our children with the skills for a 21st century economy and training the next generation of great American entrepreneurs. we also need to be welcoming to those who want to create a business in the United States and employ Americans now. With respect to Canada. America is the country of entrepreneurs. a place where those with good ideas who are willing to work hard can come and make something for themselves. There is a global battle for entrepreneurial talent and the United States is falling behind. A story I heard while visiting California. the Silicon Valley. last year. illustrates this point pretty well. A large company that just a few years ago was a small startup told me they had plans to hire 68 highly skilled immigrants but could not get a visa for them to work in the United States. Rather than letting this talent go. the company hired them but hired them at their location in Canada. It is certainly troubling that 68 jobs went outside the United States. They were lost in our country because the United States does not have a visa program that works. What troubles me even more is that some of those 68 people hired in Canada will go on to start a business that may result in significant job creation in Canada. Those jobs that could have been in the United States are now in another country and those individuals who may start a company are no longer in the United States but are now in Canada. When we lose entrepreneurs and highly skilled immigrants. we lose the jobs they create. The good news is there are steps we can take to attract and retain foreign entrepreneurs and highly skilled immigrants. In a bipartisan effort. Senator WARNER. Senator COONS. Senator RUBIO. and I introduced Startup Act 2.0 last year. Senators BLUNT and Scott Brown of Massachusetts joined as cosponsors. and an identical bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with an even number of Republican and Democratic supporters. Again. this year. I am working with those colleagues to reintroduce a bill very similar to that in very short order. Startup Act 2.0 makes changes to the Federal regulatory process to lessen government burdens on job creators. modifies the Tax Code to encourage investment in new businesses and capital formation. seeks to accelerate the commercialization of university research that can lead to new ventures and. most importantly. provides new opportunities for highly educated and entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States where their talent and new ideas can fuel economic growth and. most importantly. create jobs for Americans. Startup Act 2.0 creates an entrepreneurial visa for foreignborn entrepreneurs currently in the United Stateslegally in the United States. Those with good ideas. with capital. and the willingness to hire Americans would be able to stay in the United States and grow their businesses. In many instances. foreignborn entrepreneurs. here legally. have an idea and want to begin a company that will employ Americans but are told their visa does not allow them to remain in the United States. Take the story of Asaf Darash. Asaf was born in Israel and came to the United States in 2007 after being awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study at the University of California. After completing his doctoral thesis. he founded a software company called Regpack. Asaf raised $1.5 million in financing for the company and hired more than a dozen Americans. His company has the potential to grow quickly and to further create additional jobs. But Asaf. the founder of this dynamic company. is no longer in the United States. My staff contacted him this morning and he said that because of the difficulty in obtaining a visa and the amount of time and effort it was taking. he decided it was easier to move to Israel and take the core of the company. including its jobs. with him. As Regpack grows. new jobs are going to be created in Israeljobs that could have been in the United States if we had a visa dedicated to foreign entrepreneurs such as Asaf. Sadly. his story is far from uncommon. Immigrants legally living in the United States who have a good idea and want to start a business have few options available to them. With very few ways to stay. these entrepreneurs. just like Asaf. are forced to move and take their businesses with them and take the jobs they have created and will create to other countries. I wish to make certain America is the best place for entrepreneurs who want to build America and hire Americans. Passing Startup Act 2.0 will help make this happen. Entrepreneurial immigrants have long contributed to the strength of our country by starting companies and creating jobs. Of the current Fortune 500 companies. more than 40 percent were founded by first- or secondgeneration Americans. Today. 1 in every 10 Americans employed at a privately owned U.S. company works at an immigrantowned firm. In our mobile world. entrepreneurs have a choice as to where they start a business. For decades. there was no better place than the land of opportunitythe United States of America. But things are changing. Other countries are aggressively seeking the best and brightest. those with entrepreneurial talent. as a way to grow their economy. I believe mostin fact. I would say at least 80 percentof my colleagues in Congress agree with the visa provisions in Startup Act 2.0. They understand that retaining highly skilled entrepreneurial immigrants will lead to economic growth and new jobs for Americans. Unfortunately. there is an approach in Congress that has been here for the last several years that says if we cant do everything. we will not do anything. I urge my colleagues lets pass what we can agree on now and keep working to find common ground on issues that still divide us. Canada and other countries are creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs. for startup companies. but the United States is still the home of the American dream. We need to pass Startup 2.0 so individuals can pursue their ambitions in America. Millions of our citizens remain out of work. Our economy is barely growing. One would think. common sense would suggest we would work hard together to deal with the issues we have agreement on that would help jumpstart the economy. Lets do that. Lets jumpstart the American economy through entrepreneurship and allow those with talents and skills we need to pursue the American dream in the United States of America and thereby strengthen our economy. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we all know in the Senate and in the House of Representatives about the low grades Congress receives in public opinion polling. Everybody knows what the public reports: Congress is partisan. Congress is divided. Congress is dysfunctional. One recent survey that got a lot of media attention reported that Congress is less popular than a root canal. Across the country. people are fed up with Congress. Indeed. Members of Congress are fed up with Congress. Americans want a Congress that can take on the tough challenges of today. But another recent poll by USA Today and Gallup showed that 77 percent of Americans feel \"the way politics works in Washington these days is causing serious harm to the United States.\" Americans think Congress has a problem. Indeed. Americans think Congress is a problem. Well. if we want to fix a problem. we ought to be specific about it. A doctor wouldnt try to fix a patient without a precise understanding of the patients problem. An engineer wouldnt try to fix a system without a precise understanding of the systems problem. A mechanic wouldnt try to fix your car without a precise understanding of your cars problem. So if we are going to fix what is wrong with Congress. we better have a precise understanding of what Congress problem is. Lets start with the Senate. We do have our share of dysfunction in the Senate. I will confess. Undoubtedly. the filibuster is being abused. Certainly. nominees awaiting confirmation are unjustifiably delayed. Indeed. they are held hostage. So everything is not all roses in the Senate. But we did pass a highway bill. a bipartisan highway bill. that passed the Senate with 74 votes. We did pass a farm bill. a bipartisan farm bill. Although I did not support that particular measure. it was a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate with 64 votes. We passed the Hurricane Sandy emergency relief bill. also in bipartisan fashion. with 62 votes. We had open debate. we had discussions. we had amendments. and we passed legislation. Particularly. we passed. by a powerful bipartisan vote of 89 to 8. a bill that avoided tax increases for 99 percent of Americans and extended emergency unemployment benefits for another year and protected us from the fiscal cliff. When it comes to legislating. the Senate actually has a pretty strong bipartisan record. How did those Senate bills do on the House side? Well. the House couldnt pass its own highway bill. Congress has been doing highway bills since the Eisenhower years. This isnt rocket science. The House couldnt do one. The best the House of Representatives could do was to pass a shortterm extension that allowed some of their Members to get to conference on the Senate bill. but they took no bill into conference because they couldnt pass one. Even then. they delayed the conference negotiations. putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy before they finally came around and passed an amended version of the Senate bipartisan highway bill. So their record on the highway bill is nothing to be proud of. The House also couldnt pass a farm bill. Farm bills are pretty ordinary legislative business too. We do them all the time. but the House has passed no farm bill. We passed a strong bipartisan Senate farm bill. They cant even agree to call up the bipartisan Senate farm bill and pass it. With 80 percent of the agricultural land of the country in drought. there is no farm bill. It is trapped in the sinkhole of the House. The House almost couldnt pass a disaster bill. If you go back to Hurricane Katrina. when Katrina hit back in 2005. the House of Representatives then had emergency aid on its way to the 850.000 damaged or destroyed homes of the gulf coast in 11 days. In 11 days aid was on its way. This time. with this House of Representatives. the House balked at the bipartisan Senate disaster bill and. finally. it took them 78 days after the landfall of Hurricane Sandy to send help to the half million homes and businesses damaged or destroyed by that storm. The condemnation of the House of Republicans was bipartisan. The Republican Governor of New Jersey blamed. and I quote. \"the toxic internal politics.\" the toxic internal politics. of the House Republicans for this fiasco. \"This.\" he said. and I will quote again. \"is why the American people hate Congress.\" Is there a problem over in the House? You bet there is. to the point where one departing House Republican Member compared the Speaker of the House to the manager of an asylum and the Speakers House Republican colleagues to the asylum inmates. That is pretty strong criticism from within the Republican Party. The reason I give this speech is to try to be precise about what the problem is that has driven Congresss approval into the cellar. and what exactly is that problem? Well. I think the House votes on the socalled fiscal cliff bill and on the emergency Hurricane Sandy aid illustrate what the problem is. Those bills passed the House for one reason and one reason only: The Speaker of the House of Representatives waived what is called the Hastert rule. What is the Hastert rule? The Hastert rule is probably the most significant contributor to dysfunction in Washington right now. It is not even really a rule. it is a policy. a political policy of Republican Speakers. It began under former Republican Speaker Hastert. hence its common name as the Hastert rule. The rule is that the Speaker will bring no bill to the floor of the House of Representatives without a majority of his own party supporting the bill. It doesnt matter about a majority of Congress. Democratic votes dont count. It is only when the Speaker has a majority of Republican votes supporting it that the Speaker will allow legislation to come to the floor. It has actually gotten a little bit harder under Speaker BOEHNER. who has said. I dont feel comfortable scheduling any controversial legislation unless I know we have the votes on our side first. which sounds like he is saying he has to be able to produce a majority of the House out of just the Republican caucus before bringing a bill. But whether it is the original Hastert rule requiring a majority of the majority before they will even bring a bill to the floor or what appears to be the Boehner rule. that they have to have the votes on \"our side first.\" it is a rule of obstruction. There are somewhere between 50 and 60 Members of the House Republican tea party caucus and a whole bunch more House Republicans who are scared of the tea party and scared of what might happen to them if they get a tea party primary challenger. So getting a majority of his party together for anything reasonable is a challenge for Speaker BOEHNER. House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to support a highway bill. So the Hastert rule kicked in and there was no House highway bill. nonethey couldnt do one at all because they couldnt get it through their conference under the Hastert rule. That is why there was no highway bill. The House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to support a farm bill. so under the Hastert rule there is no House farm bill. The Speaker wont bring up the stalled bipartisan Senate farm bill. because under the Hastert rule he cant get a majority of his party to support even the bipartisan Senate farm bill. We were headed for the exact same result on the fiscal cliffwe were headed for the exact same result on the fiscal cliff. Speaker BOEHNER could not get his party to support protecting America from the fiscal cliff. So. with literally minutes left to spare. and with the House Republican Conference ready. willing. and about to pitch the country off the fiscal cliff. Speaker BOEHNER did what? He ignored the Hastert rule. He ignored the Hastert rule. and he let the fiscal cliff bill come to the floor of the House without having the votes on \"our side first.\" to use the Speakers language. Twothirds of House Republicans actually voted to roll America off the fiscal cliff. Here is the vote count. Republican \"yes\" votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were only 85. Republican \"no\" votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were 151. He wasnt even close to making the Hastert rule. That fiscal cliff bill passed the House 257 to 167 because the Democrats came out and voted for it. 172 to 16. 172 Democratic \"yes\" votes. 16 Democratic \"no\" votes. Twothirds of the \"yes\" votes that put the fiscal cliff bill across and saved America from a 100percent tax increase and protected our economy from the fiscal clifftwothirds of those votes came from Democrats. If the Speaker had enforced the Hastert rule. we would be over the fiscal cliff today. What happened on Sandy? After nearly 3 months of stalling. while my State. while the Presiding Officers State of New York. while the States of New York and New Jersey. struck by Sandy. were waiting urgently for the relief that we got to the coast within 11 days. they stalled and they stalled because they could not get a majority of the Republican caucus to support Federal relief for our hurricaneravaged States. Under the Hastert rule. they couldnt get that bill to the floor. So Speaker BOEHNER once again decided to forgo the Hastert rule. That is how they got the Sandy emergency aid bill passed. Look again at the votes. Republican \"yes\" votes for the disaster bill. 49. Republican \"no\" votes for that bill. 179. That bill was dead on arrival under the Hastert rule. The Republican caucus couldnt support it. wouldnt support it. and we would be without any help now if they had followed the Hastert rule. On the Democratic side. what was the vote on the Hurricane Sandy bill192 \"yes\" votes to 1 \"no\" vote. The final count was 241 ayes. 180 nays. The bill passed. but about threequarters of the support came from Democratic votes. If the Speaker had imposed the Hastert rule. not only would we be off the fiscal cliff. but we would have failed at providing disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy. The only reason these critical pieces of legislation avoided the fate of the highway bill and of the farm bill is that the Speaker didnt follow the Hastert rule. He couldnt follow the Hastert rule because he wouldnt have been able to pass legislation. If his tea party caucus had forced America off the fiscal cliff. he knew there would have been hell to pay. so he waived the Hastert rule. Now. of course. House Republicans are all in a fuss about having waived the Hastert rule. One tea party lawmaker admitted that the New Years Day tax vote left a lot of his fellow Republicans with a very bad taste in their mouth. So it is probably back to Hastert rule business as usual on the House side. with death by tea party to any major bipartisan Senate legislation. The tea party over on the House side wanted to vote for extreme things. such as voting to repeal or defund ObamaCare over 30 timesover 30 timesor voting to turn Medicare into a voucher program. If it is extreme enough. then they will vote for it. But those are actions which are not supported by the American people. and they cant pass the Senate. For the regular business of government. for the regular business of passing Senate bipartisan legislation. the tea partyHastert rule combination is deadly. So back to where I began. If you are concerned about dysfunction in Congress. if you are wondering why we are less popular than a root canal. if you are wondering why 77 percent of Americans look at Congress and think we are actually doing more harm than good. and if you want an explanation of the dysfunction. take a look at the Hastert rule. If you look at this problem the way a doctor would look at a patient. the way an engineer would look at a system. the way a car mechanic would look at an automobile. and you look for what is broken. be specific. it is the application by the Speaker of the Hastert rule that prevents strong. bipartisan Senate legislation from going forward. When something moves. it is because the Hastert rule has been waived. So if you want to see what is wrong. that quest takes you straight to the House of Representatives. and there it leads you straight to the House Republican conference. and there it leads you to that toxic combination of the tea party and the Hastert rule. When you understand the problem. the cure is obvious: The House should ditch the Hastert rule. Call things up for a vote. Let everybodys vote count. Dont refuse to proceed unless only your own party will let you. It is the obvious and only solution. The fiscal cliff bill and the Sandy bill and the votes on those bills prove it. With those tea party extremists dominating the House Republican conference and ready to pitch the country over the fiscal cliff and leave hurricane victims high and dry. the Speaker had to ditch the Hastert rule. The only way the House can do bipartisan business on major issues is to ditch the Hastert rule. As we saw. the Senate has its problems. but we are actually doing OK. just as our legislative record shows. Over and over. we pass real. significant. bipartisan legislation after a real process on the floor of argument and amendment. As the Houses legislative record shows. the problem is over there. More precisely. the problem is within the House Republican conference. Still more precisely. again. the problem is that toxic combination of the tea party and the Hastert rule. If we want Congress to function effectively. if we want to succeed at doing the work of the American people. such as the fiscal cliff bill and the hurricane relief bill. and if we dont want to see more important legislation. such as highway bills and farm bills. fail in the House. unable to pass in the House. blocked in the House. the solution for the problem is clear: We have to ditch the Hastert rule and let the House as a body work its will. just as the American people elected it to do.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to encourage the Senate to seek quick action on the Sandy relief package that has been long overdue. I know the majority leader is committed to bringing it to the floor as soon as we can get some type of agreement with the other side of the aisle. and I hope that agreement can come quickly because a recovery that is delayedas this has already been significantly delayedis a recovery that very likely can fail. We cannot afford for one of the biggest engines of the national economy. which is the Northeast. to fail in its recovery. This is not only for the sake of the Northeast but for the entire country. I appreciate the majority leaders steadfast commitment to provide that relief as quickly as possible here in the Senate. but time is awasting. It is already Wednesday. and I am concerned we will lose another week before we. in fact. seek passage and then go to the President. From there. it would move on so the resources could begin to flow to communities across the Northeast that have languished since Sandy took its toll. There is no excuse for delay. We already had the delay in the House. They could have passed the package the Senate passed in a transparent process that had the Appropriations Committeeon both sidesscrubbing the bill. It was brought before the Senate in a fashion in which we like to see the Senate work. I believe there were 25someodd amendments that were considered. a full vetting of the legislation. and there was a strong bipartisan vote at the end of that process. It was then sent to the House. and unfortunately it languished and died at the end of the last Congress. Now the House has acted in a different fashion. So I am happy at this point to accept the Houses versioneven though I do believe the Senate version is superior in a variety of waysso it can be sent to the President. Getting relief to the citizens in the Northeast is critically important. I look at the package the House has. and I say to myself that $50.7 billion in resources. in addition to the flood insurance package that has already passed. will allow our residents and small businesses that have been waiting so long to recover and begin to rebuild. Finally. it will show them that they have a strong partner in the Federal Government and that someone is there for them. as we have been whenever and wherever disaster has struck our fellow Americans throughout this Nation. Obviously. I would have preferred the Senate bill. which was stronger. but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We need to get assistance to the victims of Sandy as quickly as possible. This is a vehicle that gets us to that goal. While the House bill significantly reduces assistance in a couple of areasincluding fishery disasters and community development funding. which I think in that respect may stump the recovery of an important industry along our coast and could potentially siphon off billions in CDBG funding that is badly needed right now in New York and New Jersey by amplifying what disasters are eligible for itI am pleased to say we protected the overall amendment of the CDBG funding from the Senate bill. which is about $16 billion. While it is not everything we needed since it will now be spread even thinner across even more disasters. we can certainly help as many communities rebuild and recover as we can because time is of the essence. There is a fierce urgency right now. There are many business owners whom I have spoken to who said to me: Senator. I am at a critical juncture. I dont know whether I can reopen. If the government is not going to give me assistance. then I likely wont open because adding more debt. even in terms of a longterm. lowinterest loan. is still debt. They say: I took out debt to start this business or: I took out debt to get through the great recession. but I dont really have the option to take out more debt without some direct assistance. such as a grant. A grant would give the help I need to jumpstart my business so I can get those individuals I had employed reemployed once again and create an opportunity for our community. That decision right now for those businesses. which are lifeanddeath decisions. is pending and hanging by the will of the Senate to act. I am also pleased that the package the House passed recognizes what I have been saying all alongthat funding the Army Corps of Engineers efforts is critical to rebuilding coastal communities. particularly New Jerseys weakened coastal defenses. We are at the lowest of our immune system as a coastal State. and we already see the biting cold. It is cold throughout the Capitol today. which shows how cold it is outside. Think about those residents who are fellow Americans and dont have a place to call home because they dont have the wherewithal to get their home back in a way in which they can once again be able to live there. raise their families there. and meet their challenges as a family in a warm nurturing environment. That does not exist for many of our fellow Americans because they dont have the wherewithal to decide whether they are going to get the type of assistance to help them rebuild their homes. All of that is pending. Part of that is the Army Corps of Engineers ability to reengineer our beaches in a way that ultimately provides not only for the potential of tourism. which is a $37 billion industry in our State. but even more importantly for the protection of lives. property. and protection against repetitive losses. That is what is going to happen when we get this money to the Army Corps of Engineers so they can rebuild our coastal defenses. This package would give Jersey Shore residents and businesses the comfort of knowing they would be better protected in the future than they have been in the past. It also includes $13 billion in critical funding I sought to help to restore our transportation systems. For example. it would allow New Jersey Transit to repair extensive damage from the storm and allow the agency to build facilities on higher ground to prevent future flood damage. which is a commonsense option. When we think about fiscal responsibility. why would we rebuild only to the very same status that was allowed to be flooded in the first place and caused all of the damage the government would pay for? The passage of this potential package from the House would allow the port authority to finish repairing the PATH station and harden electrical equipment to prevent future damages. If we could get an agreement. the package that would come to the floor would include necessary policy reforms that I have supported that will streamline recovery efforts and improve FEMAs public assistance programs. which is critical to a successful recovery. These reforms would allow us to rebuild what is in place even stronger and better before there is another storm. Again. this is important in terms of the end results. It is important in terms of the fiscal responsibility to ensure we rebuild in such a way that we dont end up with repetitive damage. which would be more costly to the government. It would allow a thirdparty dispute resolution process for major projects. Some of the history we have. particularly with Katrina from Senator LANDRIEUs experience. is the reality of not having a dispute resolution process. which ultimately forestalled recoveries and critical projects to that State and in those communities. Also. coverage for childcare costs related to disaster recovery through FEMA individual assistance is a critical element. Without going through all of the provisions of the House bill. let me just say we need to pass this relief package. People are suffering. They are desperately waiting for certainty so they can start rebuilding their lives. their businesses and communities. They are trying to get back on their feet. They need this aid even if it is late and even if it is ultimately longer than other disasters have had to wait. As I pointed out in the past. I think it was 10 days or so when $50 billion flowed to Katrina victims. We are nearly 3 months since the worst disaster on the east coast in terms of a natural disaster that has taken place. The people of the Northeast. the people of my State of New Jersey and our neighbors in New York desperately need this funding. and it is time to help these fellow Americans. It is time to do it now. It is time to do it this week. It is going to take time for this recovery to take place. The longer we delay. the greater the chance of failure we. in fact. create. I think we want success. not failure. I think we want to understand. as an institution. as I have said many times. that this is the United States of America. That means we respond to the challenges and the disasters that take place in other parts of the country. We do it. hopefully. more expeditiously than this. and at the same time we stand by our fellow Americans so they can reclaim their lives. reclaim their commitments to their communities. reclaim the opportunity to reopen their businesses. to contribute to those communities. to our State. to this Nation. to our society. So I strongly urge our colleagues who have some reticence to agree to moving forward on a Sandy bill to come to common ground with us. to come to agreement to move this relief package. No American should have to languish months after a disaster to get help. That should not be the standard. The hallmark of our response should be an intelligent but expeditious response to the consequences of a disaster that any American faces. That is our tradition. It is a tradition we should maintain. It is a tradition that. unfortunately. in this particular instance has not been a reality. It is a tradition that I hope we can ultimately embrace once again this week in finally pushing through a Sandy package that can move to the President for signature and bring relief to our communities. With that. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to celebrate Ken Squier. of Stowe. VT. for his historic contribution to motor sports and to broadcasting. and for his deep and abiding commitment to the people of Vermont. On November 29. 2012. NASCAR presented Ken with the prestigious Buddy Shuman Award. given to \"an individual who has played a key role in the continued growth and success of Cup racing.\" Most Americans know Ken Squier as the \"Voice of the Daytona 500.\" In 1979. Squier convinced CBS Sports to broadcast the Daytona 500 in its entirety. This event was a seminal moment for stock car racing in the United States. later described by ESPN as \"NASCARs most revolutionary event.\" the one that convinced the national networks that NASCAR had a very wide following around the country. When he was 14 years old. Ken Squier announced his first race at a small dirt track in northern Vermontfrom the back of a logging truck. In 1960. he opened Thunder Road SpeedBowl. a quartermile racetrack in Barre. VT. In summer. the track has hosted stock car races every Thursday night for the last 50 years. These events have become fixtures in the culture of northern Vermont. As NASCAR developed a national following. Ken Squier became one of its most celebrated personalities. He pioneered the use of incar cameras during broadcasts. putting viewers right next to the driver during the race. Kens voice became inseparable from the sport. providing turnbyturn coverage of all CBSbroadcast races for almost two decades. This included the sports most prestigious event. the Daytona Ken Squier is not at all defined solely by his importance to racing. He has deep roots in northern Vermont. In 1969. he became president of Radio Vermont. Inc.. a family business that is one of the only independent. familyrun radio companies left in the United States. Radio Vermonts stations provide a variety of music. sports. and news. in particular. they focus on local events. the happenings that bind communities together and give them identity. Over the years. Ken has staunchly opposed corporate consolidation of the media because he believes. strongly. that radio stations should serve the community and provide vital conduits for local information. He has practiced what he preaches. Radio Vermonts immense value to the communities it served was proven during the aftermath of Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011. Irene was the most destructive storm to hit Vermont in decades. Torrential rains and Vermonts mountainous terrain brought flooding on a vast scale. wiping out houses. businesses. and historic downtowns. Roads and bridges were washed away. cutting dozens of towns around Vermont off from the outside world. Ken and his staff. Eric Michaels. Lee Kittell. Tom Beardsley. meteorologist Roger Hill. and others kept the station on the air 24 hours a day in the weeks after the storm to ensure vital emergency information reached Vermonters in towns that had been cut off. With the State of Vermonts emergency communications equipment washed away. Radio Vermont proved that local radio stations are fundamentally important to their communities. Ken Squier has helped change sports in America. but even more significantly. he has been a true exemplar of a good citizen. Vermont is. and will remain. deeply in his debt.*",

Cathy was my friend and neighbor. and I will miss her. Catherine was born in 1942 in Queens. NY. the daughter of Irish immigrants Patrick and Bridget Vesey. After graduating from St. Josephs College in Brooklyn and teaching as a Catholic missionary in Texas. she earned masters degrees in social work from Howard University and in international affairs from Columbia. Cathy had an extraordinary career as a social worker. writer. editorial director. businesswoman. and director of the UN Information Center in Washington. DC. She was also active in political life. twice running for office in California and serving as finance director for Governor Jerry Browns 1976 presidential campaign. but she is best known for her groundbreaking and heroic efforts to help refugee women and children. In 1989. after visiting refugee camps around the world as a board member of the humanitarian International Rescue Committee. Cathy became a founder of the Womens Commission for Refugee Women and Children. now Womens Refugee Commission. As the Commissions board chair. Cathy traveled the world to listen to refugee women and children and learn about their most pressing needs. She attracted prominent women journalists. academics. and philanthropists to the Commission and became a leading advocate for refugee issues on Capitol Hill. at the UN. and in the media. Under her leadership. the Womens Refugee Commission has shaped policies and practices in the U.S. and around the world to address the needs of women and children displaced by war. persecution. and natural disasters. On behalf of the people of California. I send my gratitude and condolences to Cathys husband. Richard Reeves. her daughter Fiona Reeves. sons Colin and Conor ONeill.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to pay tribute to a proud veteran. a committed Marylander. a great American. and my good friend. Francis Joseph \"Frank\" Chase. Frank passed away on December 11. 2012 in his Columbia. MD home after a brief illness. He leaves behind his beloved family: his wife of 50 years. Carole. a daughter Margaret. and a granddaughter Grace. Frank loved his country dearly. and he showed it through years of public service. which began in 1955. when he entered the Army for 3 years. Frank then joined the civil service. beginning at the Social Security Administration and later moving to the Health Care Financing Administration. both in Baltimore. When he retired in January 1993. Frank left government service with far more than his Federal pension. For at SSA and HCFA. he had honed expertise that would for many years guide him to continue. as a volunteer. to improve the lives of retirees. persons with disabilities. and others. A man of boundless energy. Frank was a valued confidant and a member of my health advisory group for the past 20 years. With nearly perfect attendance at meetings and conference calls. he could always be counted on for a warm greeting. sage advice. and wisdom born of compassion and clearsightedness. A graduate of Dartmouth College. Frank maintained strong ties with his alma mater. serving terms as president of the Dartmouth Alumni Association and president of the Dartmouth Club of Maryland. He also served his community through volunteer work at Common Cause of Maryland. United Seniors of Maryland. and the National Association of Retired Federal Employees. Through his involvement in Maryland politics. Frank fought tirelessly for fair election practices. propelled by the belief that. regardless of their views. all Marylanders deserved to have their voices heard. Through my many conversations with him over the years. I discovered a man who loved democracy and justice. and who felt compelled to live his life in service to these causes. In closing. when I think of Frank. I am reminded of the words of Robert Frost in \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\": The woods are lovely. dark and deep. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Frank could have led a comfortable. quiet life after retirement. but he chose instead to keep going for many more miles. working for the causes he believed in deeply and the Nation he loved. Like all who were privileged to know him. I will miss my dear friend Frank Chase. and I ask you to join me in celebrating his life.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we are no longer in an election year. which makes this the perfect time for this Congress to take action on real and meaningful election reform. Regardless of which candidates we voted for last November. we can all agree that in the worlds greatest democracy. in the year 2013 we should put in place systems which ensure every voter will be able to cast their ballot without unnecessary delays. redtape. or restriction in our next elections. That is why I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate. with leaders in State and local governments across the country. and with folks in the U.S. Department of Justice to discuss ways we can reform our election process to make voting more accessible for more Americans. In his second inaugural address delivered just this Monday. President Obama made a point to tie voting rights to civil rights. President Obama spoke of the long American march toward justice. He said: And the first steps of that march of the journey toward a better. fairer. more equal society. one where every American. regardless of their race. gender. sexual orientation or economic status. has the same shot at successhas always started at the ballot box. President Obama mentioned Seneca Falls. a central moment in the movement for womens suffrage. and Selma. the emotional heart of the fight for equal access to voting rights for African Americans. He said: Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. He is right. The 2012 elections were a wakeup call to those of us who treasure the right to vote. All over our countryin blue States and red StatesAmericans saw their fundamental right to vote eroded by exceptionally long lines. confusing rules. and widespread voting machine malfunctions. There were problems in more than a dozen States documented in the media. There were voting machine irregularities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. errorridden voter rolls in Ohio. delays counting ballots in Arizona. voters waiting in lines 5 hours long in Virginia and 8 hours long in Florida. We have to do better than this. As Americans. the right to vote is in our DNA. So just days after these 2012 elections. which had such widespread problems. I introduced the FAST Voting Act. the Fair. Accurate. Secure. and Timely Voting Act. along with Senator WARNER and colleagues in the House. Congressman CONNOLLY and Congressman LANGEVIN. Our bill challenges States to implement commonsense changes well before the next election. It would provide incentives and competitive grants to those States that can turn around their poorest performing polling places. improve the administration of their elections. and make voting faster and more accessible to all voters. As a former county executive myself. I know States and local governments are laboratories of democracy. When it comes to administering elections. many States and counties are getting it right. We can learn from them and replicate their successes elsewhere in the country to ensure these same problems do not plague the next national elections. For example. Florida was one of many States with rampant election problems in 2012. There were long lines. limited early voting. and other issues that may have disenfranchised as many as 49.000 Floridians. according to a study by Professor Theodore Allen of Ohio State University. Floridians such as Richard Jordan waited more than 3 hours in a line that just was not moving to try and cast his ballot on election day 2012. He had already worked a 10hour shift that day. He was exhausted. his back hurt. he was hungry. and ultimately in anger decided he could not wait anymore. He simply gave up and walked away. He was denied the opportunity to cast his ballot by an unprepared. underresourced. or just incompetent election system. On behalf of voters across the State such as Richard. earlier this month Floridas elections administrators presented Floridas Governor Rick Scott with a list of reforms they would like to see implemented to prevent these problems from happening again. Governor Scott admitted that his own States election process was clearly in need of improvement. He said he agreed with some of the election supervisors proposals. In my view. this is a very positive step forward. and one which should be undertaken in every State where there is documented need for stronger. fairer. faster. and freer elections. In my view. the government can and should play a role in incentivizing that process to ensure that election improvements are made to last. It can help States move forward in using available technology. and it can ensure States do a better job of enforcing laws that are already on the books. For example. the National Voter Registration Act. commonly known as the motor voter law. requires States to allow voters to register when they renew their drivers license at the DMV or at other governmental agencies. Yet there are substantial and credible allegations that some States all across this countrywhether blue. red. or purpleare not fulfilling their obligations under this act. In talking with elections administrators from around the country. it is clear to me that compliance with existing law is not complete. We have to do more to ensure voters are afforded the rights given to them under current law and that State agencies are doing what is required to simplify the registration process to maintain uniform and nondiscriminatory voter rolls and provide widespread registration opportunities. Enforcing existing law is just part of the solution to the voting problems we saw across our country in 2012. We also have to look forward at ways to deliver the best and most efficient voting process to all Americans. There is still much more we can do to meet that goal. and I think part of the solution is the mechanism of the FAST Voting Act. Our legislation focuses on costeffective reforms. such as making it easier to register online and ensuring citizens who move to a new jurisdiction can easily transfer their voter registration. If we use modern technology that we already have at our disposal. we can make it easier for all eligible American citizens to cast their ballot and ensure every vote is counted. President Obama was right to mention election reform alongside the most essential civil rights struggles in our countrys history in his inaugural address on Monday. Making it harder for citizens to vote is a violation of their civil rights. Long lines are just another form of voter disenfranchisement. Running out of ballots can be just another form of voter suppression. The fact is access to vote is denied when registration is cumbersome or inaccessible and when early voter votebymail options are just not available. Lets do something now when we are no longer hamstrung by election year politics in the Senate so that changes that last and make a difference can be implemented well before the next election. As someone who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and who often speaks with foreign heads of State. civil society leaders. and voting advocates from around the world. it is an embarrassment that in 2012 our Nation could not overcome the simple challenges to ensuring fair and accurate elections all across our country. If we ignore these assaults on Americas civil rights that we saw last November. we are certain to have to endure them the next time around. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen. Our democracy needs to be a model to the rest of the world for how to ensure that every citizen gets to exercise the right to vote. Lets find a way to come together to put meaningful election reforms in place now before we deny one more American their fundamental right to vote for the candidate of their choice. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am proud to introduce the Justice Thurgood Marshalls Elementary School Study Act. The elementary school that Justice Marshall attended. known as PS 103. located in my hometown of Baltimore. is a place of national significance because it marks the site where one of our Nations greatest legal minds began his education. Thurgood Marshall is well known as one of the most significant historical figures of the American civil rights movement. By the time he was 32. he was appointed the chief legal counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. NAACP. He served at the NAACP a total of 25 years and was a key strategist to end racial segregation throughout the United States. Perhaps the greatest illustration of this effort was his victory before the Supreme Court overturning the Plessy doctrine effectively ending school segregation with the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. KS. in 1954. Not only did this case open up educational opportunity and sparked the civil rights movement in this Nation. it also marked the beginning of Thurgood Marshalls career. still a young attorney from Baltimore. as one of the greatest legal minds in all the land. This case was just one of the 29 cases he won before the U.S. Supreme Court. Fittingly. Marshall was the first African American confirmed to the Supreme Court. He was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 and served 24 years. until 1991. On the high court. Marshall continued his fight for the Constitutional protection of individual human rights. But Thurgood Marshall was not always a legal giant. He was once a young boy growing up in West Baltimore. He received the first 6 years of his public education at PS 103. An apocryphal story goes that a young Thurgood Marshall studied the U.S. Constitution in the basement of the building while serving detention. Regardless of whether or not this is true. the building powerfully tells the story of racial segregation in America. PS 103 was a \"blacks only\" school when Justice Marshall was a student. and marks the academic beginning of one of the countrys most brilliant legal thinkers and a pioneer of the civil rights movement. The building is located at 1315 Division Street in the Upton Neighborhood of Old West Baltimore. The building is part of the Old West Baltimore National Register Historic District. and is listed as a contributing historic resource for the neighborhood. The Old West Baltimore historic district is one of the largest predominately African American historic districts in the country. and its significance is centered on the African American experience in the area. In Baltimore. we are fortunate to have the National Park Service operate two historical sites. Fort McHenry and the Hampton Mansion. Adding PS 103 is a unique opportunity for the National Park Service to work in Baltimores innercity and to reach out and engage people about African American history. Needless to say. Thurgood Marshalls legacy is one that should be preserved. He was one of our countrys greatest legal minds and a prominent historical figure of one chapter of our countrys great historythe civil rights movement. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of PS 103 to evaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the building as a unit of the National Park Service. Preserving the building that was Justice Marshalls elementary school will give Americans insight into Justice Marshalls childhood. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to reintroduce two pieces of legislation: the Know Before You Owe Act and the Fairness for Struggling Students Act. These bills will take critical steps toward addressing the student debt crisis facing America. Every week my office is contacted by young people and their families who share with me their horror stories about student debt. Many of them are college students or graduates who are getting crushed by student loans the size of mortgages. All too often. these young people were lured into attending worthless. forprofit colleges that left them with worthless diplomas and mountains of debt. It is disgraceful. But it is not only young people facing this debt crisis. it is their parents. their siblings. even their grandparents who did them a favor by cosigning on these loans. They. too. are being held responsible when the loans go into default. Many of these people contact my office because they dont know where to turn. Their debt loan leaves them feeling helpless. They are putting off major life decisions such as buying a home or even starting a family because of crushing student debt. We cant stand idly by any longer and ignore this reality. We have to step up and recognize that this student debt bomb is ticking away. Student loan debt among college students surpassed $1 trillion last year. The New York Fed reports that balances of student loans have now exceeded the balances on automobile loans and credit card debt in Americastudent loans. That makes student loans the largest form of consumer debt outside of home mortgages. Last year. 37 million borrowers held student loan debt. That is more than 10 percent of the population of this country. The average balance is $24.300. But. remember. that is an average. This is a massive amount of debt. and it is having a profound impact on the lives of students and their families across America. The overall growth in student debt is troubling. The most pressing concern is what is known as private student loans. If a student goes to college. they could qualify for a governmentguaranteed loan with dramatically lower interest rates with accommodations based on their employment and even some loan forgiveness. Not so when it comes to private student loans in most cases. Students who take out Federal loans receive affordable interest rates. a lot of protections and repayment options. Private student loans are totally different. Private student loans often have high variable interest rates. hefty origination fees. lack of repayment options. and. unfortunately. crushing penalties. In 2012 the amount of outstanding private student loans exceeded $150 billion. Students are being steered into these private loans while they are still eligible for the better government loans. Why? Because somebody is making more money when they sign up for private student loans. As a result. many students are being saddled with debt they dont have to be saddled with and sometimes debt they can never repay. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year reported that at least 850.000 individual private student loans were in default amounting to more than $8 billion. Let me tell my colleagues about one of those students. I have opened on my official Web site a place where those who have student loans and want to share their stories can come. Anna Wilcox. who is 31 years old. did. She attended the Brooks Institute of Photography. a forprofit college owned by the Career Education Corporation. Anna Wilcox saw a TV ad one day about this socalled Brooks Institute of Photography and decided she would call and inquire. The school called her twice a day until she finally enrolled. The recruiter at the schoolthis Career Education Corporation Schooltold her that a Brooks degree would help her make $85.000 a year as a photographer. So Anna enrolled. and when she graduated in 2006. she had a debt of about $170.000. almost all of it in private student loans. Anna was 24 years old with $170.000 in student debt from this forprofit school. With a variable interest rate that went as high as 18 percent. her balance just kept growing. Her monthly payments on her private student loan now exceed $1.000 a month. Her Federal loans she took out as well had low interest rates. She said those payments are reasonable. and she can handle them. Her parents decided to help her out and cosigned on the loans. Now her parents. in their sixties. are on the hook as well. They have to change their life plans because they wanted to help their daughter. and now they are stuck with a debt of $170.000 for a worthless diploma from a forprofit school. Well. Anna did find a job. but the job doesnt pay anywhere near $85.000 a year. She just cant keep up with these staggering monthly loan payments. She said she would like to file for bankruptcy. clean the slate. and start over. She cant borrow money to go to a real school. She has wasted her borrowing power on these forprofit schools. It doesnt do her any good to want to file for bankruptcy. Private student loans are not dischargeable for bankruptcy. If a person signs up as a college student for one of these student loans. it is debt that will follow that person for a lifetime. There is no way to escape it. It is something to think about long and hard when students make that decision. Anna is very blunt and despondent. She said she made a big mistake going to the school. It was a waste. She thought she would get a better life by going to college. She didnt realize these forprofit schools by and large are a waste of money and cause debt that most students can never pay back. She has bad credit now and a mountain of debt to show for it. So what are we going to do about it? Are we going to say: Well. Anna. you should have been a little bit smarter when you were 19 years old and sat across the desk from somebody who said: We want you as a college student. You made your mistake. girl. That is the way it works in America. and now you have to pay the price. Is that the answer? Is that the answer when these forprofit schools depend on the Federal Government and taxpayers for 85 to 95 percent of all of the revenue they take in? These forprofit schools. if we took the Federal money we send their wayif these forprofit schools were a Federal agency. it would be the ninth largest Federal agency in America. That is how much money we are pouring into these forprofit schools. Let me just put three numbers out for people to reflect on: 12 percent of the students out of high school go to forprofit schools. We know their names. They are students who gather in Washington and come to the galleries. They know what I am talking about. Go on the Internet and try to escape an ad for a forprofit school: University of Phoenix. DeVry. Kaplan. Ring a bell? Well. I can tell my colleagues these are the biggies. but there are hundreds of them. Twelve percent of the students after high school go to forprofit schools. Forprofit schools. though. account for 25 percent of all of the Federal aid to education. They just soak it up. Students borrow and turn it over to the forprofit schools. The student is stuck with the debt. The forprofit school may never graduate you. but they have their money. There is a third number to remember. The first is 12. the second is 25. The third number is 47. Fortyseven percent of the student loan defaults in America are students from forprofit schools. students being dragged into these schools that charge way too much for tuition and then the student either cant finish the school or gets out of school and cant find a job and they are stuck. I tell my students back home. if you are not sure. start at a community college. It is affordable. It has a wide array of courses to be offered to you. You will learn a lot about yourself. you will learn a lot about what you want to do in school. and you will not end up sunk in debt like these forprofit schools want to do to you. We have to do something about Anna Wilcoxs plight and many others just like her. I wish to commend especially one community college in my State. the Elgin Community College. I have been visiting that school regularly and always come home thinking: This college gets it. They have implemented a financial counseling program that goes above and beyond anything I would put into law. All of the students at Elgin Community College in Elgin. IL. must submit a monthly budget detailing all their costs when they are seeking financial aid. The student then has a mandatory. oneonone meeting with a counselor to review the loan balance. the repayment options. and what happens if they default. This community college has implemented a workshop for students who will be graduating during the upcoming semester to discuss repayment options and give them a complete summary of every loan they have taken out. These students are facing debt the likes of which they have never seen in their lives. They are motivated by all of the preaching they have heard from their parents. like me. saying: Go to school. Get a degree. They are ready to sign up because they want to do what they think is the right thing. They do not know that the forprofit school is worthless. they do not know that the thousands and thousands of dollars of debt will never be able to be repaid. and they do not know that debt will be with them for a lifetime. So here are some bills I am introducing to address it. I believe students will benefit more if they have the kind of loan counseling we see at the Elgin Community College. I am joining Senator TOM HARKIN of Iowa. chairman of the HELP Committee. in reintroducing the Know Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act of 2013. The legislation requires colleges to confirm a students enrollment status. cost of attendance. and estimated Federal financial aid assistance before any private student loan can be approved for that student. In other words. if you are eligible for the government loan. for goodness sakes. take that first. The private student loan is much more expensive. and it is tougher to pay it back. So we want to make sure students who are eligible for government loans know that before they sign up for the private student loans. Often. students have not even applied for Federal aid before they are encouraged by some of these schools to apply for private student loans. or students have not exhausted their eligibility for Federal aid. Requiring school certification would give the school the opportunity to make students aware of Federal student aid options and the most affordable options. The bill would also require schools to counsel the students about their loan options. Schools would be required to inform students about the differences between Federal student loans and private student loans. and they are stark and dramatic. For students who decide to take out private student loans. the bill would require lenders to provide them with quarterly uptodate information about their balance and interest accrued. It is not one of these deals where you just keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing. and finally when you are about to finish schoolor years laterthey give you the total. and you look at it and say: My goodness. I did not realize I had signed up for all of that debt. This legislation is supported by a large coalition of educational. student. and consumer organizations and has been recommended by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The other bill I am reintroducing today is the Fairness for Struggling Students Act. This bill. cosponsored by Senators WHITEHOUSE. FRANKEN. HARKIN. and JACK REED. would restore the Bankruptcy Codes pre2005 treatment of private student loans. As I said earlier. since 2005 private student loans have enjoyed a privileged status under the Bankruptcy Code. They cannot be discharged in bankruptcy except under the most extreme circumstances. Only a few other types of debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcycriminal fines. child support. taxes. and alimony. In contrast. nearly all types of private. unsecured debtcredit card debt. doctor billsare dischargeable in bankruptcy. but not student loans. There was no good reason for Congress to give such preferred treatment to these financial institutions that are peddling these private student loans. It was a provisiona sweetheart provisiontucked into a massive bankruptcy reform bill with very little debate and even less justification. There is no evidence that private student loan borrowers were abusing the bankruptcy system before this law was changed. In fact. the private student loan market has been growingeven before this measure was enacted into law. But the private student loan industry got a sweetheart deal out of Congress. and now we are in a situation where many students have overwhelming private student loan debt. and they cannot repay. and they cannot escape. This is devastating for those students and a drag on our overall economy. There was an article a few months ago in the New York Times. and it talked about a grandmother who was having her Social Security check garnished because she had signed on as a cosigner of her granddaughters student loan. Her granddaughter dropped out of college and could not pay back the loan. and now we are going after grandmas Social Security check. That is how serious this can be. A large coalition of student. educational. civil rights. and consumer organizations support this bill. I hope we can move forward with legislation this year. It is time to restore fairness to our Bankruptcy Code when it comes to student debt. Let me be clear: When used appropriately. student loans are valuable and important. I would not be standing here today if I had not borrowed money from the Federal Government to go to college and law school. I never could have afforded it otherwise. It was called the National Defense Education Act. If I told you the numbers that I borrowed. you would realize how old I am. But at the time. it was scary to have that much debt coming fresh out of law school. I paid it back just like I was supposed to so the next generation could take over. But what I faced. the debt I incurred to go to school and law school. does not even come close to matching what many students have to borrow in the first semester. and that. unfortunately. leads to a debt that some will be crushed with for a lifetime. In many instances. student loans help Americans get a quality higher education and the job skills they need to repay their loans and have a rewarding life and career. But. unfortunately. there are far too many Americans who have been steered into highcost private loans that will burden them for life and prevent them from fully contributing to our economy. It is about time we woke up to the reality of what studentsmillions of studentsacross America are facing. and their families. We have a responsibility to them over and above the profits that are being earned by forprofit schools and the financial institutions peddling these private student loans with these outrageous interest rates and terms. It is time for this Congress to listen to working families and their kids all across America to restore transparency. fairness. and common sense to private student loans. I urge my colleagues to support these bills. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to speak today about our Tax Code as well as our economic future. There is a problem with our Tax Code. one that hits home with nearly all Americans. that is. its complexity. In the past few years I have met with hundreds of constituents who are worried about this issue. Individuals. small businesses. farms. and large corporations alike struggle with meeting their obligations to the IRS because of the complexity of our current Tax Code. Earlier this month the IRS Taxpayer Advocate revealed some startling figures in the Agencys annual report to Congress. It estimates that individuals and businesses spend 6.1 billion hours each year complying with the IRS tax filing requirements. The complexity of the Tax Code is so burdensome that 9 out of 10 taxpayers now pay a professional preparer or use often costly commercial software to assist in tax preparation. Then there is the problem with our corporate taxes. The United States has the highest marginal effective tax rate among the largest developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to recent studies by the Cato Institute. that rate for U.S. corporations is al most 36 percent. In fact. only Argentina. Chad. and Uzbekistan have higher tax rates than does the United States. While the U.S. corporate rates have remained high. other countries are lowering their rates. Sweden. for example. has become the latest country to announce that it will lower corporate tax rates. in part to help attract more foreign investment. Our corporate tax rates continue to be higher than they should. and we lose our competitive advantage to other nations in part because of that high tax rate. I want to talk about a way to fix both these problems. Since joining the Senate. I have introduced in each new Congress the Fair Tax Act. Today I am reintroducing this legislation because of my belief that the Fair Tax Act can fix the problems built into our current Tax Code. The fair tax will promote freedom and economic opportunity by eliminating our current archaic and inefficient Tax Code and replacing it with a simpler. fairer means of collecting tax revenue. It will repeal the individual income tax. the corporate income tax. capital gains taxes. all payroll taxes. selfemployment taxes. and the estate and gift tax in lieu of a 23percent tax on the final sale of goods and services. Elimination of these inefficient taxing mechanisms will not only bring about equality within our tax system. it will also bring about simplicity. It will provide tax relief for businesstobusiness transactions. These transactions. including those for used goods that have already been taxed. are not subject to the sales tax. so there would be no double taxation. Some of my colleagues have asked how the fair tax would affect our revenue on our entitlement programs. Social Security and Medicare benefits would remain untouched under the Fair Tax Act. There would be no financial reductions to either of these vital programs. Instead. the source of the trust fund revenue for these two programs would be replaced simply by the sales tax revenue instead of by payroll tax revenue. Another question I get is how the fair tax would affect impoverished Americans. Under the Fair Tax Act. every American would receive a monthly rebate check equal to the spending up to the Federal poverty level. according to Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. This rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of necessities. We have made nearly 5.000 changes to the Tax Code since 2001I have supported some of them. and I have not supported othersall in the name of improvement and economic benefit. I believe we can do better than simply lowering our taxes. I know we can make a bigger impact on our economic future by ridding ourselves of a tax structure that is holding us back. Ronald Reagan once said: I believe we really can. however. say that God did give mankind virtually unlimited gifts to invent. produce and create. And for that reason alone. it would be wrong for governments to devise a tax structure or economic system that suppresses and denies those gifts. With that statement. I could not agree more.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am rising to submit a resolution making it absolutely clear that Congress. and only Congress. has the authority and responsibility to set the Federal debt limit. I should not even have to submit a resolution such as this. but I feel it is absolutely necessary. Raising the Federal debt limitthe limit we place on government borrowingas everybody knows. has been a hot topic around Washington. It is a key issue for the start of the 113th Congress. It is another case where if we could just maintain regular order. regular authority to address our problems. that is the best way for us to approach the task of getting our fiscal house in order. I know there is a lot of dispute over what breaching the limit means. There is a lot of talk about that. It is clear a great deal of the public and our financial markets are extremely concerned about the Federal Governments ability to meet its financial obligations once we do hit the limit. The President has asked for a very large increase in the debt ceiling. and some in the administration have called for no limit at all. Others of the administration and in the House are calling for Congress to give up its authority to set the debt limitrather amazingthus giving the executive branch unilateral authority to borrow. This is not a good idea. If the Federal Government does not collect enough revenue to pay for all its spending obligations. it must borrow to make up the shortfall. Everybody knows that. We are borrowing now about 42 cents of every $1 we are obligated to spend. This is clearlyI think everybody would agree on either side of the aisle and the publican unsustainable situation which will only get worse if we do not begin meaningful discussions over our spending priorities. includingincludingentitlement spending to strengthen and preserve those programs for future generations. The national debt is growing. Everybody has seen that chart. It is about $16.4 trillion. The total public debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter just passed was $16.07 trillion. That is up from $15.86 trillion reported in June 2012. We are on the wrong path. The Federal debt is now equivalent to at least 73 percent of the Nations gross domestic productnearly double the level as a percentage of GDP that we had back in 1990. That is not too long ago. According to some measures. there has been a 60percent increase in the debt limit since 2009. At the rate we are going. in a few short years we will be spending more to pay interest on the debt than we will on all discretionary programs outside of defense. Even defense now is going through a very difficult time with the sequester and has already been cut about onehalf trillion dollars. Let me just say that means no money for education. That means no money for agriculture. That means no money for the environment. That means no money for health care. It all goes to pay off interest on the debt. The Federal debt is the accumulation of this borrowing. including all bills. notes. and bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury. The current statutory debt limit is $16.394 trillion. which was established on January 28 of last year. 2012about 1 year agounder the procedures of the Budget Control Act of 2011. According to the Department of the Treasury. as of December 31just last monthtotal debt outstanding subject to the limit was only $25 millionmillion. it used to be a lot of moneybelow the current limit. Once the amount of outstanding debt reaches the debt limit. the government can no longer issue additional debt to cover the cash shortfalls needed to fund government operations and meet legal obligations. Similar to the power of the purse. Congresss powers over borrowing are firmly rooted in our constitutional traditions. The Founders understood the potential danger of permitting the executive branch to unilaterally incur new public debt. Article I of the Constitution empowers onlyonlyCongress \"to borrow money on the credit of the United States.\" The debt limit is the means by which CongressCongressexercises this critical legislative responsibility. I can remember well that lesson. that lecture. if you will. from Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. the institutional flame of the Senate. who would have repeated that Congress cannot give debt limit authority to the executive. should not. cannot. It is not constitutional. To implement this congressional prerogative. the amount of money the Federal Government is allowed to borrow is subject to a specific statutory limit. From time to time. Congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit and has done so more than 100 times since the first modern debt limit was set way back in 1939. and we will do so again shortly. We have to. So preserving this role and establishing the debt limit is vital to encourage deficit reduction and to uphold our constitutional tradition of legislative control over borrowing. Not only does the debt limit provide an essential check on executive borrowing. it provides public accountabilityeverybody is talking about transparencyfor Congresss borrowing and debt management practices. We cannot duck that responsibility. We cannot pass this debt limit simply to the Executive and duck our responsibility and the public accountability. In other words. debates over the debt limit. as difficult and as contentious as they areand they are. I know thatshed the light of day on the overall financial condition of the Federal Government. Precluding these discussions by removing Congresss authority over the debt limit would lead to a less wellinformed decisionmaking over fiscal policy. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. It is a nice way to put it. We can do this. In the past. legislation to raise the debt limit has frequently been coupled with legislation to reduce the overall Federal debt and deficit. That is the way we should do it. These extensions. often approved on a bipartisan basis. have been important catalysts for fiscal reform. In this respect. the debt limit is a strong mechanism. a strong tool. a way for Congress to evaluate fiscal policy and to maintain control over such policy. Abdicating this role would fundamentally alter the checks and balances embedded in the Constitution. This is a power that should not be bargained away. The necessary and critical battle to control spending is far from over. I view the debt ceiling debate as a critical means in what has to be an ongoing effort to tighten the governments fiscal beltif we can just do that. But we cannot settle our national finances by fundamentally altering the constitutional structure and processes governing those finances. We cannot cavalierly give up one of our most important tools in evaluating and reining in the Federal Governments runaway spending. Equally clear. we cannot keep spending what we do not have. We must continue to fight for spending cuts. for debt reduction. and against tax increases and. I might add. the tidal wave of regulations that continue to pour out of Washington. In response to calls to give up this vital congressional authority over debt issuance. I am submitting today a simple resolution. Lets put the Senate on record. The Congress holds the sole authority to borrow money on the credit of the United States and cannot cede this power to the President. I invite everybody to cosponsor this important measure and look forward to passage of this resolution. This should be a bipartisan effort. and it is absolutely necessary.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit the following. Disease. Death. Bankruptcy. Thats how the Panama Canal got started. At the time. the nineteenth century. trade and economic activity boomed in this part of the world and with it. other nations tried to cash in. As the U.S.. Britain and France competed to assert their influence in the region. they ran into one problem: land. They didnt have a way to ship goods from the Atlantic to the Pacific without making the treacherous and lengthy journey around the tip of Cape Horn in South America. All three nations knew there was a need for a shorter sea lane connecting the two oceans. Unfortunately. the French got there first. In 1881. the French sent veteran builder Ferdinand de Lesseps. who oversaw the successful construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt. to build a canal in Panama. then a province of Colombia. In the first nine years of construction. the French spent hundreds of millions of dollars. lost 20.000 workers to malaria and yellow fever and only completed eleven miles of the canal. The project went bankrupt and failed. The dream of a connection between east and west seemed all but dead . . . then came Teddy Roosevelt. The former Roughrider knew an opportunity when he saw one and seized upon it. The U.S. was emerging as a world power and Roosevelt saw that having a shorter route to the Pacific and beyond was a way to expand American Naval Power and Economic opportunity. Such foresight proved correct in WWII. Roosevelt quickly got to work. having his Secretary of State. John Hay negotiate the HayHerran Treaty to purchase land in the Colombia province of Panama. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty. But there was a big hiccup: the Colombians wanted more money and refused to approve the treaty. Roosevelt wasnt about to be duped and pour more money in the project. perhaps ending up like the French. He knew that the Panamanians wanted the U.S. to complete the 51mile canal and he knew that they wanted independence. (Some claim that Roosevelt took advantage of the unrest and stirred up Panamas revolution against the Colombians. but thats for historians to debate). The U.S. did not get involved in the fight. but helped the Panamanians by sending the gunboat. the U.S.S. Nashville. and ten other warships from both the Atlantic and Pacific to show support. This is now known as \"gunboat diplomacy\". Panamas nonviolent coupdetat was successful. and the nation of Panama was born. With that. the U.S. and Panama ratified a treaty and construction of the canal began. One revolution. $700 million and ten years later the Panama Canal Zonenow U.S. Territorywas completed in 1914. Fast forward 99 years. After President Carter returned the canal zone to Panama. it has since maintained control of the security and operation of the canal. Panama has undertaken a critically important expansion of the canal. One that will add a third channel and a new set of locks. allowing larger cargo ships to pass through. Approved in 2006. this new expansiondubbed PanamExwill finally completed next year. Surprisingly. no Panamanian chapter of the EPA held it up. and only a few environmental groups opposed. Perhaps its a transportation miracle. Of course. Panama benefits from this widening and deepening of the canal. but so will the United States. The recent implementation of the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement approved by Congress. along with this $5.25 billion canal expansion project. ensures that free trade between the U.S. and Panama will continue to grow. And. because of our geographic location. this expansion will \"expand Texas position as a global gateway for the nation.\" according to the Panama Canal Working Group. That means a huge increase in exports from the gulf coast and our Great State. including the Port of Houston. to countries around the world. Trade in Texas and Houston drives our economy. and the engine for trade is ports. With that. well see more exports of dry and liquid bulk. agriculture products. coal. petrochemicals. military cargo. and consumer goods. Larger and wider vessels. like tankers carrying liquefied natural gas. will now be able to enjoy quick. reliable transit through the canal. Thats good news for us here in Houston and good news for our State. Next year. we celebrate 100 years since Roosevelts dream became a reality. Thanks to Teddys dream. the U.S. built the canal and our economy and security have benefitted from the opportunities that it created. God bless Teddy. And thats just the way it is.",
