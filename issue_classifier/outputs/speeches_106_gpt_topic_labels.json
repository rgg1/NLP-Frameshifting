    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout our lives we receive countless blessings and among these. the greatest gift is that of love. Today. I am proud to be able to pay tribute to two people who have cherished this gift and demonstrated their love and devotion to one another each and every day over the past fifty years. On June 24th. two extraordinary people. Daniel and Bernita OConner are celebrating their golden wedding anniversary. Together with their children Patrick. Daniel and Erin. their grandchildren Danielle. Caitlin and Meaghan. and a number of friends that their years of work and community involvement have brought them. they will celebrate this most special of days. After meeting at Sacred Heart Church in Kawkawlin. Michigan. these two young people soon fell in love. They were married on June 24.1950 in Essexville. Michigan. and ever since that day. Daniel and Bernita have shared a wonderful life together. They have found happiness as lifelong companions. As nurturing parents. tireless workers. selfless community leaders and lifelong Democrats. the OConners truly represent all that is right in this country. Daniel and Bernita are not only dedicated to each other and their family. but they are also dedicated to their church. They have always been active in the Catholic Church. including several parishes in my district. Holy Trinity in Bay City. St. John the Evangelist in Essexville and Sacred Heart in Kawkawlin. have been fortunate to have the OConners as members. Their commitment to their faith and strong family values makes them excellent role models for everyone who crosses their paths. Mr. Speaker. in these days of disintegrating families. it is reassuring to see a strong. stable marriage built on love. respect and trust. Their lives together have been a blessing to each other. and an inspiration for those of us fortunate enough to know them. I urge you and all of our colleagues to join me in wishing Daniel and Bernita OConner the happiest of anniversaries. on this their fiftieth. and many more to come. May Gods continued blessing be upon them and their beautiful family.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the immediate reaction of the advocates of additional gun control to violence we see in our communities is to call for new. more restrictive gun controls on lawabiding Americans. The American people are smarter than that. In fact recent surveys have shown that the American people dont believe additional gun control laws passed by the Congress will reduce crime. The American people know that criminals. by definition. are not law abiding citizens. Criminals are lawbreakers and if they are not willing to abide by laws against murder and robbery. they are not going to comply with a new law that would require that they go down to the local police station and register their firearms. To believe that they would do such a thing is lunacy. Mr. Speaker. the solution to our problems is two part. To address the nearterm problem of violent crime we need to lock up criminals. including those who use guns in the commission of a crime. Examples of where this has been initiated in various states shows that this works. Second. we need to emphasize in our society that life has value. that life is not expendable. Many Americans may recall just a few months ago. the standoft between police and Joseph C. Palczynski. the Maryland man who killed four people and held three others hostage in Baltimore this past March. Lets take a look at this guys criminal record. and ask whether or not this man should have been out on the streets. (According to Wash Times) In 1988 he was convicted of battery and sentenced to two years probation. In 1989. he assaulted a 16 yearold girl and was subsequently sentenced to four years in jail. However. he was somehow let out and in 1991 he beat up his girlfriend. while she attended high school. In 1992. following another domestic violence complaint by a girlfriend. and after holding police at bay for 16 hours. he was arrested on two outstanding warrants including a weapons violation charge. In 1995 he received a 10 year suspended sentence for the battery of another girlfriends father.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I recognize and pay tribute to The Monroe Evening News. The longest continuously published newspaper in Michigan. The Monroe Evening News traces its roots back to 1825 when it was first published by Edward D. Ellis as The Michigan Sentinel. The 175 year history of this distinguished paper is one in which the people of Monroe County take great pride. The Monroe Evening News has survived and flourished because it has changed with the times while remaining true to the journalistic values first put forth by Mr. Ellis. Perhaps the most significant change in The Monroe Evening News occurred in 1994 when the employees acquired a majority stake in the paper. In 1999. the employees bought all of the remaining shares. making it one of only two newspapers in the country to be owned. in its entirety. by its employees. Employee ownership will preserve for future generations the controlling local interest that characterized its first 175 years. With such a long history. The Monroe Evening News has seen many changes. In 1987. the publication delivered its first Saturday morning edition. The success of the Saturday morning edition led the paper to publish a Sunday morning edition only two years later. Today. The Monroe Evening News is published seven days a week. In 1998 another major change occurred. The Monroe Evening News built a stateoftheart printing facility. This new printing plant enabled the paper to adopt a computerized. full color layout. Before the plant was constructed. the paper was published on two printing presses that were built in 1924 and 1932. believed to be the oldest in the country. Through 175 years of change and progress. the one constant at The Monroe Evening News has been its journalistic commitment to objectivity and fairness. These values reflect those of the community the paper serves and account for the growth and success it has enjoyed. Mr. Speaker. I would ask my colleagues to rise with me in tribute to a fine institution. The Monroe Evening News.",

June 25th. the Winchester Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4379 and the 23rd VFW District will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War to \"Honor Americas Heroes.\" On June 30th. 1950. President Truman ordered United States ground forces into South Korea and a naval blockade of the Korean coast. Only a few days earlier. North Korean forces had crossed the 38th parallel invading South Korea and capturing the South Korean capital of Seoul. One of the wars most dramatic battles. Chosin. saw 17 Medals of Honor and 70 Navy Crosses awarded. more than any single U.S. action. The Marines and other Allied troops saw nearly 2.400 of their own killed and 10.000 wounded or frostbitten. And yet. this is often called the \"forgotten war\" by our veterans. who found themselves returning to an indifferent home front keeping their experiences to themselves. Well. I say \"NO MORE.\" Mr. Speaker! And ask that my home district of Riverside County. California and the whole nation open their minds and hearts to the stories of our Korean War veteransthat they join in the celebration. The sacrifice that service men and women have selflessly accepted over the centuries deserve at least that much.

Today the CONIFER will be decommissioned after 57 years of distinguished service. A member of the Coast Guards Buoy Tender fleet. the CONIFER was commissioned on May 4. 1943. Throughout the years. many have relied upon the Coast Guard Cutter CONIFER to perform lighthouse service visits and renovations. service weather data gathering buoys. perform law enforcement operations. assist with national defense. protect the environment. and perform search and rescue missions. The CONIFER has had an illustrious history. patrolling the nations waterways and ensuring the safety of those navigating the high seas. Shortly after being commissioned. the Conifer was called upon to patrol the North Atlantic during World War I1. Nearly six decades later. it was the CONIFER serving as the On Scene Commander in charge of search and rescue efforts following the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261 off Point Mugu in January. She and her crew have served the country with honor and distinction. Based in San Pedro the last 14 years. the CONIFER has patrolled the waters of southern California. The seafaring men and women of the Conifer have touched the lives of many during her tenure in San Pedro. We are grateful for her service. Honor. Respect. and Devotion to Duty. these are the core values of the United States Coast Guard. The CONIFER exemplified these values during her service to the nation and southern California over the last 57 years. For nearly six decades. the CONIFER has served the nation with great diligence and distinction. I commend the men and women who have served aboard the CONIFER over the years. I also commend Lieutenant Commander Jeff Loftus and his crew for their service to southern California. Your contributions to the community are deeply appreciated. We look forward to the Coast Guards continued presence in the region when the Coast Guard Cutter George COBB assumes the CONIFERs duties this fall.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this Sunday. June 25 will be the 50th anniversary of the commencement of the Korean War. I join my colleagues. veterans. their families and all Americans in forever memorializing those who fought and died in the quest for freedom in South Asia. Millions today live in freedom and thrive in economic prosperity as a direct result of the U.S. and our U.N. allies intervening in Korea and taking a stand on the 38th parallel. For that sacrifice. I applaud the thousands of veterans who risked and sacrificed their lives so others could be free. Your service will stand as a permanent reminder of our nations commitment to securing freedom and liberty for all. Last week we saw a historic meeting which many regard as the first step towards reuniting North and South Korea. While eventual reunification would still take many years of patient diplomacy. such an event looks more and more like a reality. I am hopeful that we can close this chapter and bring home our troops who continue to face danger along the demilitarized zone (DMZ). All across the country. Americans have been and will be commemorating the Korean War. I commend all those who take time out from their everyday lives to pay homage to those who served and sacrificed in Korea. I express my hope that across San Antonio. in South Texas. all over the U.S. and around the world. Americans will make every effort to remember the price we paid in that conflict. Earlier this session. the House unanimously passed H.J. Res. 86. recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. The bill was subsequently enacted into law. It expresses congressional recognition of the significance of the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. The resolution expresses gratitude for members of the Armed Forces who served in the Korean War. especially those who died in action or remain unaccounted for. Finally. the resolution calls upon the President to issue a proclamation recognizing the Korean War and those who fought in it. and to call on the country to observe the anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I look forward to this and future opportunities that we have to remember those who fought and sacrificed so that the U.S. and her allies could live in peace.",

It is with great pride and pleasure that I would like to take this moment to honor Sam Suplizio for being inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Sam has dedicated a significant portion of his life to the great American game of Baseball. His many successes as a player and coach make him most deserving of this Hall of Fame induction as well as the praise and esteem of this great body. For these reasons. I feel it is proper that we pay tribute to him now. Sams devotion to baseball started with his stellar career as a player. He got his start as an AllAmerican Center Fielder for the University of New Mexico. where he had a threeyear varsity career. To further his playing career. Sam was drafted in 1953 by the New York Yankees. While with the Yankees organization. Sam earned such honors as Eastern Leagues best defensive outfielder and was recognized as a league allstar. Sam began his coaching career as a manager for the Dodgers Thomasville affiliate. After a short stint with the Dodgers. Sam moved to Grand Junction. Colorado where he landed a job coaching the Grand Junction Eagles. a job that provided him with 20 years of success. Sams coaching career has also steered him overseas. where he headed the World Port tournament in Rotterdam. Holland and instructed teams in both Europe and Israel. In all. Sam has spent 46 years as a player or coach in professional baseball. His professional career has seen him serve as a coach/instructor for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Anaheim Angels. Mr. Speaker. Sam Suplizio is truly an American baseball legend. His dedication and devotion to the great American game of baseball are unparalleled and should not go without recognition. Beyond his remarkable career in baseball. Sam has been a pillar of the community in Grand Junction and a role model for many. His love for the game is eminently worthy of this bodys recognition even as he receives this prestigious award from the American Baseball Coaches Association. Great job Sam!

Second. he tells us that he will provide only $223 billion of tax relief to the richest one percent of Americans. He does this by ignoring his own estate tax repeal. which will cost $50 billion a year. $500 billion over 10 years. meaning that his plan will actually provide well over $700 billion to the wealthiest one percent of Americans. Mr. Speaker. this debate is important. We need to look through the fuzzy fiscal facts and see it clearly.",

The debt continued to rise and we did not have a balanced budget. For many years they talked about welfare reform. But it never happened. For years Democrats talked about middle class tax relief. But they raised taxes on everybody in America. not just the middle class. but everybody. Then. 6 years ago. Republicans took over the House and we finally saw a balanced budget. we finally saw welfare reform. even though the President vetoed it twice before finally signing it into law and taking credit for it. And we have seen welfare rolls come down across country. Now that we have a balanced budget. we have a surplus. Republicans want to use that surplus to save Social Security and Medicare and give prescription drugs to seniors. to pay down the debt. and to cut taxes on everybody. especially the middle class.

The purpose of that continuing resolution was to keep the Government going for another week while we negotiated some thorny issues over how much we are going to spend and what tax relief was going to be for the American people. But that resolution had a very important provision because it authorized the Clinton administration to prepare the November 1 Social Security pension checks and the Veterans Administration checks. LI 1030 It is very important for those seniors and those people who are reliant on those checks to know that they are going to be there on November 1. What is important is that the majority of the Democrats. and virtually all of the Democrat leadership. came to this floor and voted against the resolution to keep those checks going. What that means is that the Democrats want to make Social Security a political issue. and it is the Republicans who are saying we are going to make sure that the people who are dependent on those checks have the security they are intended to provide. Mr. Speaker. today we will vote again on a continuing resolution. It will be interesting to see whether the Democrats really care about security. or they are after a political issue.

We are very happy with the fact that the level of assistance to Armenia at a minimum will be $90 million. which is more than what the administration had requested. We also have the provisions in the bill that the House language provides funding for confidencebuilding measures and other activities in furtherance of the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts. particularly with regard to NagornoKarabagh.

I think that is very important. because we need to continue to send the message that this should not be direct assistance as long as the blockade of Armenia continues. Lastly. I wanted to say that there is language in the report. language that says that in the event that Armenia is selected as the host site for the SESAME project. which is essentially a physics project. the Synchrotron Light Source Particle Accelerator Project. there is report language that says that $15 million of the funds made available for Armenia should support this or a comparable project. I mention this. not only because the project itself is very important for the economic development of Armenia and I think the whole Caucasuss region. but also because it is an example of the type of development project that we would like to see more of.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this wellintentioned but. I think. flawed substitute. There are three deficiencies in the substitute which I believe compel its rejection and the adoption of the underlying NorwoodDingellGanske bill. First is that this substitute usurps States rights and States causes of action with respect to tort law. One of the pieces of wisdom of the regulatory system in the United States is that different States have the authority to set different standards of care and different causes of action according to their State law. Each of our several States is very different. There are different needs of the people. there are different legal problems. and we recognize this by recognizing the fact that tort law causes of action typically. and sometimes exclusively. come from State law. This substitute creates one single Federal cause of action. and I believe that onesizefitsall approach is inappropriate to solving the problem that is before us. The second defect is that this substitute does not provide full relief for people who are wronged. The limitation on damages is a very meaningful limitation on damages. For example. by tying the limitation to a multiple of economic damages. what about the case of a person who is a stayathome parent who does not have a job that pays in remuneration. but pays in psychic rewards. and that person is severely harmed by the actions of a managed care company. The damages that person would be able to recover would be significantly limited by this amendment. and I believe that is another reason for its rejection. Finally. the cause of action has some technical flaws in it which could exclude some managed care decisionmakers from accountability. By creating the requirement that the decisionmaker both have the authority to make the final decision and exercise that authority. there are certain decisionmakers and certain decisions which would be exempt from accountability under this process. So although I congratulate the author for frankly offering a substitute that moves much closer in the direction of the underlying bill. I believe for these three reasons it should be rejected. and I urge the defeat of the substitute.",

Additionally. the arbitration process must include a fair de novo determination. the opportunity to submit evidence. have representation. and make oral presentation. The health insurer must also provide all records and provisions of the plan relating to the matter. Arbitration is a voluntary option to operate in lieu of court. Some people just do not want to go to court. Because arbitration is voluntary for the patient to choose. it will not take away from the patients right to sue in court. but instead. adds a choice to the accountability process.

I think. speaks more eloquently to the need for their proposal than the case of my constituent. Stephen Parrino. from San Francisco. Stephen was diagnosed with a brain tumor. His HMO referred him to Loma Linda Medical Center. which successfully removed the tumor. Stephens treating physician then ordered him to undergo proton beam therapy no later than 2 or 3 weeks following the operation. but Stephens HMO refused to pay for the therapy. saying that it was experimental. unapproved. and not medically necessary. For those reasons. it did not fall within the managed care guidelines. After repeated calls to the claims reviewer. Stephen was told that the HMO would ask for a second opinion. Seven weeks after surgery was completed. the second opinion came back. It was medically necessary. But it was now too late. Two weeks later. Stephen was informed his brain tumor had spread. it had reoccurred to the same place. and spread to the rest of his body. including his lungs. He subsequently brought suit against the HMO in State court. but claiming ERISA preemption. the HMO had the action removed to the U.S. District Court. which dismissed his case. With no remedy against the HMO. Stephen Parrino ultimately died as a result of the tumor. Mr. Chairman. this story has been told over and over again in our country. of desperately sick people who thought they had access to the best health care in the world. and who find themselves at the mercy of the managed care bureaucrats in a judicial system that provides them with less assistance than they need and no compensation after the damage has been done. We have a responsibility to stop this. Health care consumers must be able to hold their health care plans accountable and get lifesaving care.

I would like to say some things today that really will remind us of some of the greatest things that have happened in this Chamber in the past chapters of American history: when a Congress and a President put together Social Security. when a Congress and a President put together Medicare. In our day and our time. we. too. can do something noble. The American people are really pleading with us. They are saying to us in our town hall meetings. wherever we gather in our congressional districts all over the country. fix the ills in this system. There are parts of it that are broken. We need access. We need fairness. We want our physicians. our doctors. that sacred relationship between a patient and a doctor. We want the doctor to make the calls. There is interference in the system. and we know what we need to do. The Patients Bill of Rights is the bill that the American people genuinely support. We know that. There is politics of special interests here that take amendments and debates one way or another. But I am convinced that the American people still respect access to the courts. not overuse of the courts. but access to the courts. and that they want the laws to be enforceable ultimately if that is where it has to go. We can cast a vote that is going to keep faith with the American people. I believe that when they come back to judge us. that this will be the yardstick by which they will measure Members of the 106th Congress. I ask my colleagues to defeat the substitute. There is no substitute for the NorwoodDingell bill. Let us pass the Patients Bill of Rights and do ourselves proud in this Congress.",

Senator C6rdoba was abducted on May 21 by paramilitary forces under the command of Carlos Castafio. I urge the Government of Colombia to take all appropriate measures to obtain her safe release and to bring those responsible for this kidnapping to justice. Senator C6rdoba. as President of the Colombian Senates Human Rights Commission. is a strong voice in Colombia for the promotion of human rights. She has also been a leader in efforts to bring peace to Colombia after fifty years of political violence. Senator C6rdobas role as a leading advocate of human rights and peace makes this crime particularly shocking. UN SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan has also condemned the kidnapping of Senator C6rdoba and has urged the Colombian authorities to do everything possible to obtain her release. SecretaryGeneral Annan called Senator C6rdoba \"a firm supporter of peace\" who had \"performed invaluable work towards the achievement of fundamental rights and freedom\". It is extremely disturbing to see that paramilitary forces and guerrilla groups involved in Colombias internal conflict continue to resort to kidnapping as a means of political pressure. This violent action against a prominent human rights advocate emphasizes the importance of the efforts of President Pastrana to eliminate all links between the Colombian Government and the paramilitaries. I urge the Government of Colombia to take all necessary and appropriate measures to break these links. obtain Senator C6rdobas release. and bring to justice those responsible for her kidnapping.",

I wish to honor the memories of the 1.1 million Americans who gave their lives in defense of America and American ideals. Americans have fought and died in various wars spanning over two centuries. Her fallen soldiers have left indelible marks on the annals of history in conflicts notable for the good attained over the evil vanquished: independence over monarchial tyranny. freedom over slavery. and democracy over fascism and communism. Indeed. in this century alone. American servicemembers can be hailed for turning the tide of historys two world wars. As we head towards the dawn of a new millennium. I ask my colleagues to join with me to give homage to Americas patriots. in deed as well as word. I believe the best way to commemorate the spirit of those who gave their lives is to honor. respect. and care for the 26 million American veterans living today. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. I have striven to accomplish this goal through a number of legislative measures and processes. After a successful battle over the budget resolution. I and 52 of my Senate colleagues signed on to a letter urging the Appropriations Committee to match the budget resolutions recommendation of an additional $1.66 billion for veterans health care. This funding is vital to ensure that our nations veterans get the highest quality of health care available. I have also pushed for enactment of legislation which would increase veterans education benefits. allow for a Medicare Subvention demonstration project. require additional national cemeteries to be built in areas with high veteran populations. and ensure that construction of the World War II Memorial begins next year. The Athenian leader Pericles had these words to say about those who lost their lives in the Peloponnesian War over 24 centuries ago: \"Not only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions. but there dwells also an unwritten memorial of them. graven not on stone but in the hearts of men.\" This Memorial Day. I challenge my colleagues to make a commitment to engrave the memory of 1.1 million Americans not only in our hearts. but in the legislation we enact for veterans and servicemembers during the remainder of the 106th Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I join with my colleagues to introduce the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act. This legislation will provide compensation to the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes for damages incurred by the development of the PickSloan Missouri River Basin program. As a result of the construction of PickSloan development projects on triballyheld land adjacent to the Missouri river. Tribes were subjected to forced land takings. involuntary resettlement of families. and the loss of irreplaceable reservation resources. The Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska lost approximately 600 acres of Indian land located near the Santee village and an additional 400 acres on the Nebraska Island of the Santee Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation. Congress provided compensation to other Native American Tribes for losses caused by the PickSloan projects. However. the Yankton and the Santee Sioux Tribes were not provided opportunities to receive compensation by Congress. Instead. they received settlements for the appraised value of their property through condemnation proceedings in U.S. District Court. But these Tribes did not receive rehabilitation compensation. As a result. the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes are entitled to this additional compensation. This legislation seeks to utilize revenues from the sale of hydropower generated by the PickSloan dams to redress tribal claims for land takings. Congress has endorsed this approach on three separate occasions by enacting legislation which established compensation for several other Tribes adversely impacted by the PickSloan projects. We propose to establish trust funds for the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes from a portion of the revenues of hydropower sales made by the Western Areas Power Administration. More specifically. the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska would received a yearly payment of interest earned on the principal in the trust fund. Our legislation encourages the Santee Sioux Tribe to craft an economic development plan for use of the interest income. This selfgovernance approach will enable the Santee Sioux Tribe to continue to address improving the quality of life of its tribal members. This legislation values the importance of redressing tribal claims and selfgovernance for Nebraska Native American Tribes. It will enable the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska to address past grievances and look forward to investing in its future. By Mr. LAUTENBERG:",

    "speech": "Act is necessary because the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") and Occupational Safety and Health Agency (\"OSHA\") are two aggressive. wellfunded agencies which share a \"find and fine\" philosophy. The destructive consequences that small businesses suffer as a result of these agencies \"find and fine\" approach are magnified by the abuse of \"salting\" or the placement of paid union organizers and their agents in nonunion workplaces for the sole purpose of disrupting the workforce. \"Salting abuse\" occurs when \"salts\" create labor law violations or workplace hazards and then file frivolous claims with the NLRB or OSHA. Businesses are then often forced to spend thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves against NLRB or OSHA as these agencies vigorously prosecute these frivolous claims. Accordingly. many businesses. when faced with the cost of a successful defense. make a bottomline decision to settle these frivolous claims rather than going out of business or laying off employees in order to finance costly litigation. The \"FAIR Act\" will allow these employers to defend themselves rather than settling. and. more importantly. it will force the NLRB or OSHA to ensure that the claims they pursue are worthy of their efforts. The FAIR Act will accomplish this by allowing employers with up to 100 employees and a net worth of up to $7.000.000 to recover their attorneys fees and litigation expense directly from the NLRB or OSHA. regardless of whether those agencies decision to pursue the case was \"substantially justified\" or \"special circumstances\" make an award of attorneys fees unjust. Thus. the Congressional intent behind the broadly supported. bipartisan \"Equal Access to Justice Act\" (\"EAJA\") to \"level the playing field\" for small businesses will finally be realized. The \"FAIR Act\" is solid legislation. it is a common sense attempt to give small businesses the means to defend themselves against unfair actions. Accordingly. I ask my colleagues for their cooperation and assistance as I work to ensure that the \"FAIR Act\" is enacted into law.* By Mr. STEVENS (for himself.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I have introduced legislation to clarify the proper depreciation of natural gas gathering lines. While depreciation is an arcane and technical area of the tax laws. continued uncertainty regarding the proper depreciation of these assets is having real and adverse impacts on members of the natural gas industry. The purpose of this bill is quite simpleto clarify that natural gas gathering lines are assets that are properly depreciated over seven years. The legislation would codify the sevenyear treatment of these assets as well as providing a sufficient definition for the term \"natural gas gathering line\" to distinguish these lines from transmission pipelines for depreciation purposes. I believe that these assets should currently be depreciated over seven years under existing law. and that this is the long standing practice of members of the industry. However. it has come to my attention that the Internal Revenue Service has been asserting both on audits and in litigation that sevenyear depreciation is available only for gathering assets owned by producers. The IRS has asserted that all other gathering equipment is to be depreciated as transmission pipelines over a fifteenyear period. This confounding position ignores not only the plain language of the asset class guidelines governing depreciation. but would result in disparate treatment of the same assets based upon ownership for no discernible policy reason. Moreover. this position ignores the fundamental distinction between gathering and transmission of natural gas long enshrined in energy regulation and recognized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as other state and federal regulatory bodies. Nonetheless. the IRS position on this issue has resulted in the past in a division of authority among the lower courts. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recently held that the sevenyear cost recovery period was properly applied to natural gas gathering systems under existing law. this legislation is needed to provide certainty and uniformity regarding the proper depreciation of these assets throughout the country. With extensive gathering systems totaling many thousands of miles. we cannot afford to allow the proper depreciation of these substantial investments to remain subjects of dispute. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in securing the adoption of this important legislation. By Mr. McCAIN:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague from California. Senator FEINSTEIN. in introducing legislation that will intensify our fight against the terrible scourge of drugs. A version of this bill was originally introduced on March 2. Since then. we have conferred with various agencies. including the Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control. the Department of Justice. and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. All are supportive of this concept. The current bill includes some of their comments and suggestions. Simply put. Mr. President. this legislation decertifies the drug kingpins by preventing them. and any of their associates or associated campanies. from conducting business with the United States. The bill codifies and expands a 1995 Executive Order created under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). which targeted Colombia drug traffickers. The bill expands the existing Executive Order to include other foreign drug traffickers considered a threat to our national security. The bill freezes the assets of the identified drug traffickers and their associates and prohibits these individuals and organizations from conducting any financial or commercial dealings with the United States. In the case of the Cali cartel in Colombia. this tool was remarkably effective in weakening the drug kingpins. The United States targeted over 150 companies and nearly 300 individuals involved in the ownership and management of the Colombian drug cartels nonnarcotics business empire. everything from drugstores to poultry farms. Once labeled as druglinked businesses. these companies found themselves financially isolated. Banks and legitimate companies chose not to do business with the blacklisted firms. cutting off key revenue flows to the cartels. The goal is to isolate the leaders of the drug cartels and prevent them from doing business with the United States. Taking legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers pockets is a vital step in destroying their ability to traffick narcotics across our borders. This is a bold but necessary new tool to wage war against illegal drugs and to curb the increasing power of the drug cartels.. By Mr. TORRICELLI:",

In 1936. as World War II approached. additions to the Work Project Administration building were erected. Its research was expanded to help the war effort. During the 19731974 energy crisis. the center was renamed the Bartlesville Energy Research Center. When the Center privatized in 1983. it was renamed the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER). NIPER closed its operations on December 22. According to the Surplus Property Act of 1949. excess federal property is screened for use by the following: Housing and Urban Development. Health and Human Services. and local and state organizations including nonprofit organizations. At the conclusion of the screening process. a negotiated sale is conducted. If the property is still undeclared it goes to auction. Unfortunately this process can take many years. thus preventing the city of Bartlesville from realizing any nearterm economic boost from NIPERs redevelopment. Consequently. this legislation is needed to ensure that the NIPER facilities are redeveloped as quickly as possible in order to provide a prompt economic boost to the community. This legislation also will ensure that the NIPER facilities do not deteriorate while the property is being processed through the lengthy steps of the Surplus Property Act and therefore make reuse impossible. The City of Bartlesville intends to provide an educational facility and a place for business and industry that would facilitate job creation through technology and investment. The NIPER facility will also provide housing for administrative services for community development organization such as United Way. Women and Children in Crisis. and various homeless programs.

The way we have constructed this package is that the general fund money we get to strengthen Social Security comes from the interest we are no longer paying on this debt. Remember again. there are three ways to make this trust fund more secure: Cut benefits. you do not want to do that. raise taxes. you do not want to do that. You have to invest some general fund money. Where are you going to find the general fund money? Over time. by drawing down that debt. you free up interest payments that we are now having to make. You have got a smaller debt. You have got a smaller interest payment. You take the difference in interest payment. and you put it into the Social Security Trust Fund. and you strengthen it for years. In fact. under the plan that we have introduced. it will carry the life of this trust fund out to the year 2050. 2050. What is so important about that is this baby boom demographic bulge that we have got. it will be pretty well wiped out by then. I say so as a baby boomer myself. born in 1952. I would be 98 years old in 2050. Quite frankly. I do not think I will be drawing a Social Security check anymore personally. Most of us will not be. Our time will be at an end. That is why our children and grandchildren and their children will have a shot at getting a Social Security benefit themselves because we will have seen this program pass the middle of the 21st century. and that is exactly the steps we need to take to make sure this program can meet our needs going forward.

Basically. we have a majority here that says the Democrats are spending the Social Security money. when in fact the media coverage. based on the Congressional Budget Office shows it is the GOP spending bills. based on the GOP budget. After all. they are the majority party in the body. If anyone is raiding Social Security. it is the majority. not the minority. We do not have the votes. if we wanted to. and we do not want to. Second. they accuse the Democrats of jeopardizing Social Security when this same crowd running the Chamber has not offered a proposal and debated on this floor any ideas relative to strengthening the trust fund. I think it is terribly unfortunate that we cannot work together. Democrats and Republicans. to strengthen this program. Because it is not a Democrat program or it is not a Republican program. it is Americas program. And in the middle of all this political smoke I hope Americans keep one thing in mind: The way to evaluate whether anything is happening or not on Social Security is to look at that 2034 date. the date at which the trust fund goes bust. If that date is not addressed. those benefits are going to fall by 25 percent. And the prospects of our children and grandchildren getting a meaningful Social Security benefit are greatly reduced. even though they definitely face the prospects of significantly higher taxes. So has the trust fund been strengthened? The answer. not by anything they have done so far this year. And that is a deep disappointment to me. and I am sure the American people. Joining me.

And I am convinced that because we are dealing with Social Security and our kids futures. their retirement. and our neighbors future and retirement. I guess I would ask that the President rather than the President acting like a Democratic President and perhaps trying to make us just conduct ourselves a Republican Congress. I am convinced that if we acted as an American President. an American Congress. worked together on this. that would solve this. So I ask.

I am very pleased now to be able to support both the design and construction. One of the things. I say to my friend from Virginia. that happened during this process was that there was a deletion made from this design that I think at some point needs to be corrected -not on this site because its too small a site to accommodate itand that is the construction of a museum that tells the full story. And I think it has relevance. in fact. to the debate on this bill because when George Marshall accepted Roosevelts appointment to be Chief of Staff of the Army on September 1. 1939. the Armed Forces of the United States of America were approximately 137.000 people. Marshall had to build the Army to 8 million people in order for it to be an effective fighting force. and it wasnt just the military people who responded. There was a huge civilian effort that supported that buildup. It is a story of how dangerous it is. even though you may not see an enemy on the horizon at the moment. how dangerous it is to stack arms for the United States of America. We had a resolution a couple of years ago. I think. on this bill to try to allocate the resources and do the study to build. There were a number of terrific places in the Senators State right across the river that were cited. I believe this will be a wonderful memorial. but the missing piece is to tell the full story of what happened from Versailles all the way through the Second World War. There was basically an interruption for 20 years while America tried to withdraw one more time from the world. We paid a terrible price for it.

In the Second World War. there were an awful lot of mistakes made in the 1920s and the 1930s that created the necessity for that terrible war. It is a very important reminder. especially today. It is something I am asked all the time when debating authorization for the military. People say: Do we need it? Who is the enemy? We are spending more than 20 leading nations. et cetera. et cetera. People say: Why do we need to continue to do this? The cold war is over. and so forth. The best answer lies in that 20year period between 1919 and 1939 during which the United States of America tried. in the face of all evidence to the contrary. to stack arms and withdraw and become isolationist.

Should the Congress. under any circumstances. impose a limitation on the Commander in Chief? As it says. the Commander in Chief cant go below a certain level of strategic nuclear weapons. We imposed this for the first time in 1998. One of the strongest arguments made in 1998 and 1999 was that we needed that in order to put pressure on the Duma to ratify START II. They have now ratified START II. I think it is unwise to impose a limitation. Whether the President is a Democrat. whether the President is a Republican. I think it limits that Presidents ability to be able to negotiate. As a consequence. it puts the President in a weaker position when he is talking. whether to Russia or other nationsit puts that President in a weaker position and gives him less maneuverability to be able to protect the people of the United States. If we dont like the action a President takes. the Congress can intervene to act. That is question No. 1. Do you think. under any circumstances that you can describe. we ought to pass a law that says a President cannot go below a certain level?

That is the provision which the Senator from Nebraska is trying to strike. In response to that. Congress took action and the President of the United States signed it into law one time. two times. three times. four times. five times. That should answer the question posed by the Senator from Nebraska. The President concurred in the judgment of the Congress which said that you should not drop below those levels. What the amendment from the Senator from Virginia says is it doesnt. in my judgment. restrict the Presidents constitutional right to negotiate. but it says. Mr. President. you should not unilaterally. as Commander in Chief. reduce our Armed Forces in terms of those strategic levels until you do two things which have been followed by previous Presidents. and. indeed. this President when he first came to office. You make a QDR study. For those that do not understand it. it is an entire study of the world threat situation. our force levels. force levels which are conventional. force levels which are strategic. and you do a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture. Those two things having been done. then you can proceed to exercise your judgment as Commander in Chief to reduce certain force levels. There it is. The President signed it five times. clearly. He could have vetoed it. He did not. He signed it into law five times. It remains the law of the land today. I will vigorously oppose the efforts of my colleague and good friend from Nebraska to repeal that law because that law very clearly says you must take prudent actions. My amendment sets out what those prudent actions are. Then my amendment gives the President the right. after taking those actions of the QDR and the posture review of the nuclear forces. to waive the statute that has been signed five times by the President of the United States.",

It is irresponsible for the Republican leadership to bring this kind of tax cut measure to the floor outside of the context of the entire budget. If we are to be fiscally responsible and maintain our balanced budget and the era of surpluses. we cannot make these kinds of decisions in a vacuum. Mr. Speaker. American working families need tax relief. A couple on their wedding day should not be handed a tax bill from the Federal Government. and in my district in the East Bay Area of San Francisco more than 65.000 working families pay a marriage penalty. This is the money they should be spending on educating their children. providing health care for their families. or saving for their retirement. Bringing this bill to this floor in this way is wrong.

The stock market is already doing quite fine by them. Even the rich would not object if we bring in millions of low- and moderateincome Americans who do pay the marriage penalty but get nothing under the Republican bill. These are the lost couples.

But the truth is. bringing this bill to the floor at this time is not only a violation of the Congressional Budget Act. section 303. but it is totally contrary to common sense and it is fiscally irresponsible. It defies common sense to bring a bill to the floor that is a major tax cut before we have even drawn up the budget. Every city council. every school board. every State legislature that adopts an appropriations act or tax cut first adopts a budget. To think today that we would come to this floor and act on a major tax bill before the Congress has even adopted a budget is simply irresponsible. It violates the basic rules that every American family understands. Every American family understands that it is important to have a family budget. They know that sitting around the kitchen table and deciding what they are going to be able to spend for the year. what their income is going to be. is important before they embark upon a spending plan. Every family understands that when one creates a budget. everybody in the family needs to try to buy into it. This bill comes to the floor without any hearings. without any consultation with the White House. without any consultation with the Democratic side of the Congress. Every American family understands that one needs to pay off ones debts first when one establishes ones budget. We have a $5.7 trillion national debt. That ought to be the priority. We ought to be sure we are going to deal with that before we pass major tax relief. Every family understands one does not spend money that one does not have. One man on the other side of the aisle this morning said we had a $1.8 trillion surplus. Well. that is only true if one assumes that we are going to stay with the spending levels that we have in the year 2000. I suspect we will probably see inflation causing some of our spending to go up. For all of these reasons. we need to be sure that we oppose this rule and oppose this legislation.",

I have come to Congress with a firm belief that we need to be responsible in our budget efforts and that we need to take aggressive steps toward a process in paying down the national debt. But this issue does not wait. Fairness does not wait for another day. We have for too long penalized those who have chosen to be married in this country. We have chosen for too long to penalize those whose families suffer. In Kansas alone. 61.000 people in my Congressional District are impacted by this unfair penalty. this unfair Tax Code. And of that. it happens to impact those of very modest and middleclass incomes. The people who are impacted in Kansas earn between $20.000 and $75.000. We are talking about $1.400. on the average. that they pay more simply because they chose to be married and to have families. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this rule and encourage its adoption and encourage today. later in the day. that we end this unfairness that has existed too long in the Tax Code.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of this rule and of H.R. 6. I think the case for supporting this bill is really very straightforward. First of all. let us bear in mind. taxes are at an all time postwar record high. When taxpayers are paying more than it takes to fund the biggest Federal Government in history. when taxpayers are paying more than it takes to also pay all the Social Security benefits for the next 10 years and a $2 trillion surplus above and beyond that. which is going to be used to either reform Social Security or pay down debt. when taxpayers have already paid down $350 billion in debt just over the last 3 years and will continue to do so each year. when taxpayers are paying for all of that and still there is another trillion dollars that is going to come into the Federal Government from these taxpayers. it is obvious to me that taxes are simply too high. Meanwhile. we have an IRS Tax Code that is terribly unfair. It is ridiculously complicated. It is downright immoral in its treatment of married couples. Today we have a wonderful opportunity to do two things: To relieve some of that tax burden on our working families. and to rid the Tax Code of one of its most ridiculous features. punishing couples for choosing to get married. It is senseless. It is immoral. We have an opportunity to change that today. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and vote yes on H.R. 6 so we can accomplish that today.",

I have to say that the Democrats objections based on budget concerns rings a bit hollow. As the party who oversaw decades of deficit spending and reigned over an era when the Social Security Trust Fund was raided to finance big government spending. this newfound dedication to balanced budgets and debt reduction. while welcome. seems to be guided by an even stronger desire to deny the American people tax fairness and tax relief. We are in no way jeopardizing those goals by promoting legislation that provides fundamental tax fairness to 42 million Americans and returns a very small percentage of the peoples tax dollars to them in a time when we expect a $1.82 trillion revenue excess in the next decade. If we cannot give tax relief now. when can we? Let us loosen our clutches on the American taxpayers money. act in fairness. and let families have just a little bit of their money back.

One hundred years ago. on October 13. 1900. in a borrowed school building at the intersection of McDaniel and Rockland Roads. sixteen original members of the Turner Hill Baptist Church convened for the first time. The group enjoyed being together and quickly became a strong extended family. In fact. within months of their first meeting at the Old County Line School. the members decided to cement their closeness by constructing a permanent church building of their own. On land donated by E.L. Turner and as a result of its members ingenuity and hard work. the beginning of 1901 marked the opening of Turner Hill Baptist Church. a wooden structure heated by one wood stove and lit by kerosene lamps. Although the congregation moved to a new brick structure in 1954. the original wooden building and the work that went into its creation continue to embody the values of all those associated with the church. Despite the absence of Turner Hills original sixteen members at todays centennial celebration. many of their descendants are delighted to take part. By the same token. some of the original nine families. including my own. who were present as the church opened in 1901 continue to attend regular services: Turner Hill has both fifth and sixth generation members. I am also proud to be related to both the churchs current youngest and oldest members. While my father. Mr. Joseph Hugh Cleland. and Aunt. Mrs. Georgia Mae Cleland Johnston. are Turner Hills most senior members. my cousin. Miss Jessica Wages is the newest addition to the 151 member congregation. Over the years. the church itself and the faces in the pews have changed. but one thing has remained a constantcommunity. My friends and family at Turner Hill have pulled together in times of crisis and joined each other in celebration throughout the years. Behind the leadership of Reverend Farrell Wilkins and with God and family at the center of their lives. the members of my church today commemorate an historic anniversary. May their next hundred years be as prosperous as their first.*",

While DNA testing is standard in pretrial investigations today. the issue of postconviction DNA testing has emerged in recent years as the technology for testing has improved. Because biological evidence. such as semen or hair from a rape. is often preserved by authorities years after trial. it is possible to submit preserved biological evidence for DNA testing. In cases that were tried before DNA technology existed. and in which biological evidence was preserved after conviction. postconviction testing is feasible. While the exact number is subject to dispute. postconviction DNA testing has exonerated prisoners who were convicted of crimes committed before DNA technology existed. In some of these cases. the postconviction DNA testing that exonerated a wrongly convicted person led to the apprehension of the actual criminal. In response to these cases. the Senate Judiciary Committee has examined various state postconviction DNA statutes. held a hearing on postconviction DNA testing. and sought the expertise of federal and state prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers.

The issue of competency of counsel for indigents in state capital cases is a difficult issue for several reasons. First. it is not clear that this is a nationwide problem. For example. in Utah and Oregon. there does not appear to be a problem concerning the representation of indigents in capital cases. Second. the anecdotal examples cited in the media of poor capital representation occurred many years ago. For example. the death penalty trial of Gary Graham. which has been repeatedly mentioned in the press. occurred in 1981. Third. the States that seem to have a problem in this area recently made improvements. In 1995. Texas Governor George W. Bush signed legislation that provided indigent capital defendants the right to have two attorneys represent them at trial. Just this year. Alabama passed a law that compensates lawyers who represent indigents in capital trials at $100 per hour. In short. I would like to know more about the extent of this problem before I introduce legislation. Thankfully. the Bureau of Justice Statistics is releasing a comprehensive study of state indigent legal defense services in December. I am hopeful that this study will provide the information necessary to evaluate the extent of this problem. I look forward to working with Senator SMITH in the months ahead.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the man who would later become Americas first president. George Washington. was born at Popes Creek Plantation on the banks of the Potomac River in 1732. Although most Americans are familiar with his later residence at Mt. Vernon. fewer people know that George Washingtons childhood was spent on this sprawling 550 acre plantation in Westmoreland County. Virginia. The Washington family first settled at Popes Creek in 1656 when John Washington. greatgrandfather of George Washington. acquired the property. Although he later moved to Mt. Vernon. most historians agree George Washington returned on a regular basis to his birthplace. Located on the property is the Washington family cemetery that is the final resting place for George Washingtons father. grandfather. and greatgrandfather. To this day. Washington family descendants continue to live in the area. In 1930. Congress recognized the historic importance of this site to the nation and created the George Washington Birthplace National Monument. The park is truly a national treasure which tells of George Washingtons formative years. In addition to providing an excellent example of colonial life. the park contains acres of woodlands. wetlands. and agricultural fields. I am told numerous baldeagles now call the park home. In this age of rapid development. it is remarkable that despite the passage of two hundred and sixtyeight years. the Popes Creek area is remarkably unchanged since the time of George Washingtons birth. The 131.099 annual visitors to the park can still experience a rural. pastoral countryside that George Washington would recognize. Much of the credit for this bucolic atmosphere is due to the efforts of the owners of the private property surrounding the park. They have done their best to avoid developing the property adjacent to the park. But. as these landowners gradually decide they wish to sell their property. I believe the Park Service should acquire the surrounding property to preserve this historic setting for future generations. The alternative is to risk development that could forever scar this beautiful national landmark. Today. I am introducing legislation to expand the boundary of the George Washington Birthplace National Monument by allowing the U.S. Park Service to acquire portions of the surrounding property from willing sellers. As a nation. it is our duty to preserve Americas heritage for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support the preservation of George Washingtons birthplace.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the bill which will provide longoverdue compensation to agricultural producers in my state and across the country. The \"Wheat Protein Mismeasurement Compensation Act\" provides a legislative remedy for producers who suffered a loss due to the U.S. Department of Agricultures erroneous underestimation of their wheat protein content for wheat sold between May 2. 1993 and January 24. In May 1993. the Secretary of Agriculture. acting through the Federal Grain Inspection Service. required the use of new technology for determining the protein content of wheat. However. the calibrations provided by the Secretary for the new protein measurement instruments were erroneous and resulted in protein determinations that were lower than those produced by the technology in use before use of the new technology was required. As a result of this miscalibration and the USDAs failure to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment. hundreds of wheat producers in my state were forced to adjust their protein measurement and pricing system in order to protect themselves on resale. The result was a significant loss of revenue from the sale of highprotein wheat. Mr. President. I have worked on this issue for several yearsfirst as a case for my injured Montana producers. In a perfect this world. this problem would have been resolved by the USDA at an administrative level immediately after the miscalibration was identified and readjusted. Instead. it has lagged on and on and on. Unfortunately this matter for technical sovereign immunity reasons cannot be resolved in the courts. That is why we in Congress are their last chance at getting this resolved once and for all. It is clearly. however. that these wheat producers by no fault of their own were injured by the USDAs implementation of a flawed system. But for that error. they would have received a fair price for their wheat. At a time when the agricultural community continues to suffer from record low prices and disastrous weather conditions. this continued injustice is simply unacceptable. We must do all in our power to correct this problem and justly compensate our producers for their losses. I urge my colleagues to assist us in the expeditious passage of this legislation.",

The simple fact is that the USDA has failed to work with the farmers harmed so we can determine the actual financial impact to all producers. However. I am very confident we can address the losses shouldered by Montanas producers with the $465 million cap in this legislation. My number one priority is to ensure that those producers who were harmed by the Federal Governments miscalculation are fully reimbursed for their losses. As we work this bill through the legislative process I believe we may need to readdress the section on the amount of compensation for the attorneys. but only time will tell.

Dangerous for whom? Working families that are requiring two incomes to pay for their taxes? Overtaxed single mothers who cannot afford to feed and clothe their children? How about family businesses that must be liquidated to pay the death taxes? Do these people have any reason to fear a constitutional amendment? Of course not. Even more laughable is the notion that this amendment is unnecessary. The American family currently pays over 25 percent of its income to the Federal Government in the form of taxes. This figure is up from just 2 percent 40 years ago. In fact. taxes have been become the single largest expenditure for the American family. More is spent on taxes than housing. food and clothing combined. Yet despite this. opponents of this amendment want us to believe this amendment is unnecessary. Give me a break. Of course. the real reason for the taxandspend caucus opposing this amendment is because limiting taxes would limit their power. If government confiscates less of the taxpayers money. it will be harder to spend money. which is the sole reason for their existence.

I am also pleased that Arizonas Congressman John Shadegg and Senator Jon Kyl are key sponsors. We. in Arizona. have been operating for several years now with a similar amendment to our State Constitution. Proposition 108 was passed by the voters in 1992 and requires a twothirds majority of the Arizona Legislature to increase state revenues. broadly defined. Since the passage of Proposition 108 with 72% of the popular vote. we have been continuously cutting taxes in Arizona. In fact. cumulative tax cuts enacted since 1992 are now over $1.3 billion. which is equivalent to over 20% of Arizonas general operating budget. Meanwhile. state revenues have continued to grow. we have set aside nearly $400 million in budget stabilization funds. and we concluded last fiscal year with a record surplus of over $500 million. I am sure you would agree that the government closest to the people governs the best (and probably the least).

Joe Barton. Rep. Ralph Hall. and Rep. John Shadegg. I support a twothirds vote requirement to raise taxes both at the federal level and within the New Jersey Legislature as a means of preventing unwarranted tax increases from stifling economic growth and blighting job creation. A supermajority requirement will force budget writers to consider first eliminating unnecessary government spending before rushing to propose tax increases as a way to finance government initiatives. A supermajority requirement will not mandate tax cuts nor will it prohibit tax increases. but it will require a broader consensus among legislators before seeking a greater share of taxpayers earnings. The fiscal policies adopted at any level of government influence the economic wellbeing of the surrounding community. state. or nation. and requiring a broader consensus to raise taxes is practical change that will likely result in more money circulating in the private sector. the primary creator of jobs and the stimulant for economic growth. As a Governor who has used the tax code to stimulate growth and job creation. I call on Congress to enact the Tax Limitation Amendment as a sensible safeguard against unnecessary tax increases.

Our commitment as public servants ought to be to promote efficient government. which means cutting taxes. first and foremost. It is a commitment to freedom. since we know that to deny people their economic freedomthrough excessive taxation or over regulationis to deny them their right to create opportunities and to pursue their dreams. New York is leading the nation in cutting taxes and leading America into a new century of hope and opportunity. Since I have been in office. we have cut taxes 36 times. returning more than $19 billion to taxpayers. created more than 400.000 net new private sector jobs. bringing the number of private sector jobs to its highest level in history. reduced the number of people on welfare by 608.000. dropping the rolls to the lowest level since 1968. and led the nation in reducing all crimes in 1997. making our communities safer than they have been since 1970. We have shown that we have the courage to bring about change for the good of ourselves and our children. and for that we can be proud. Four years of tax cuts have created stronger families. a stronger economy and a stronger New York. In order to protect taxpayers now and in the future. we must lower taxes and make fiscal integrity the law of the land in New York State. The act of raisIng taxes is a destructive act and should therefore be a difficult act. To meet that standard. I have proposed a State constitutional amendment to require approval by a twothirds majority of the Legislature to raise State taxes and also firmly support the enactment of Tax Limitation Amendment at the federal level.

One of the problems we have had in the pastand it has been referred to by many Senatorsis that we havent had funds available to States and local school districts to ensure that title I funds are spent to accomplish their purposes. We need to enable States to assist failing schools. They have not been doing that effectively. The Council of Chief State School Officers supports this. I have a letter from them that I have printed in the RECORD. Last year. we put $134 million into this effort on this exact bill. This year. the President has requested we put $250 million into it. That is what my amendment proposes to do. Otherwise. current law limits them to onehalf of 1 percent of the title I funds. They cannot ensure accountability unless we add this amendment. For that reason. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.",

It will also make it easier for people to keep the family farm or the family business when an owner dies.

During committee consideration.. several amendments were included to deal with concerns over price volatility. manufactured product formula pricing. and price support. Mr. Chairman. I know Members are split on dairy policy. I am also aware that there is no great sense of camaraderie within the industry on this issue. This is a modest bill which makes some modest changes in the federal dairy program. I urge all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker. as the distinguished dean of the Massachusetts delegation noted. H.R. 4118 raises legitimate security issues. However. the bill puts forth the worst possible recommendation on how to deal with these issues. Mr. Speaker. the Cold War is over. We are now in an era of engagement. Unfortunately. the sponsors of this bill want to link our policy with Russia to the failed U.S. policies towards Cuba. This bill would undermine U.S. leadership on engagement with Russia. It would cripple U.S. leadership in the Paris Club. that negotiates debt forgiveness and rescheduling of debt for Russia. It would place Russias shaky economy in an even more precarious situation. Why? Because the sponsors of this bill reject U.S. engagement with Cuba. If we had relations with Cuba. the United States could negotiate directly with the Cubans and the Russians about how to resolve the security issue. Even worse. this bill will actually create new security problems for the United States. The United States maintains many listening stations around the world. We enjoy a significant advantage over Russia. Why do we want to bring public attention to these intelligence matters? H.R. 4118 is part of the same effort that would deny Americans the right to travel to Cuba. and that would deny our farmers the ability to finance the sale of food and medicine to the people of Cuba. Sadly. the leadership of this Congress has. in a back room deal. refused to allow this House to work its will on that issue. It is also part of the effort to block all efforts to pursue a new policy towards Cuba. one that engages the Cuban people. in order to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy. This bill is a loselose proposition for American interests. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4118.",

I support the adoption of this rule for consideration of H.R. 4118. the RussianAmerican Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000. This measure addresses a very serious situation. a situation that confronts our Nation with regard to espionage being conducted against our American Armed Forces. against our citizens. and against our companies from an expansive intelligence facility located in Cuba. This measure also addresses a very serious situation with regard to the financial support that the Communist regime of Fidel Castro receives from the Russian Federation for the use of that intelligence facility. In brief. this measure prohibits any further debt relief for the Russian government on the debts it owes to the United States until it closes down that espionage facility in Cuba. but the bill does contain a provision. adopted with bipartisan support in our Committee on International Relations. that grants the President limited waiver authority in the application of the requirements of this bill.

While the Cold War may have ended 10 years ago. the threat of Russian espionage remains alive and well on the island of Cuba. Few Americans may know that the Russian government still maintains an agreement with the Castro regime that allows the Russians to operate an intelligence facility at Lourdes. Cuba. the largest espionage complex outside the former Soviet Union. With over 1.500 Russian engineers. technicians and military personnel. the Russian government is able to monitor communications activity in the United States and gather personal information about U.S. citizens. In fact. this facility enabled the Russians to intercept sensitive information about U.S. military operations during the Gulf War. Now we have received startling news from our own intelligence that the Russian government is increasing its presence at Lourdes. It has been reported that the Russians have spent more than $3 billion to modernize and expand the Lourdes facility. Our government must respond immediately and forcefully by prohibiting the forgiveness of bilateral debt owed to the U.S. by the Russian Federation and instruct our representative to the Paris Club of official creditors to vote against the rescheduling or forgiving of such debt until the President certifies that the Russian government has stopped all operations. removed all personnel. and permanently closed the Lourdes facility. The bill would provide the President a waiver if he certifies that doing so is in the national interest of the United States and that the Russian government is in compliance with multilateral and bilateral nonproliferation and arms limitation agreements.

We are not discussing a general policy towards Cuba. Any attempt to focus on a general policy towards Cuba is nothing more than an effort to get people not to confront the common sense alternative and the common sense policy that is being advocated in H.R. 4118. I would ask anyone reading the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD or listening to the debate or my colleagues on either side of the aisle to ponder this question: Does it make sense for us to offer debt relief to a country. to a regime. namely. Russia. if Russia is using the economic resources that we are then making available to them through that debt relief to finance a facility that is aimed at undercutting American security. at a facility that is aimed at gathering intelligence that will put Americas military personnel in jeopardy? Does that make sense? Does it make sense for us to do a favor for someone. the Russians. giving them resources so they can spend more money to put American lives in jeopardy? If that does not make any sense. then you should support H.R. 4118. because it makes no sense to help finance someone who is putting their money into a facility that is aimed at gathering intelligence that puts the lives of American military personnel at risk. That is as simple as it gets.

We should not reward this type of belligerence by restructuring their debt. There is no moral equivalence between an American intelligence post and that of Russia.

So that part of the Cuba question never comes to the floor. It is only this part. the pilingon part. the continuing of the outdated sanctions part. all inconsistent with this theme. that comes to the floor for consideration. As to the issue before us. it is very. very bad business. Last week we marked up a foreign operations appropriations bill. The fact of the matter is we know that extension of taxpayer aid to other countries is at an alltime low relative to the size of our economy. at least in the context of recent history. So we have to have private economic opportunity flowing across the world and in the global marketplace. It will be a critical part of bringing developing countries along. If any action by this Congress would push Russia into defaulting upon its debt. the ramifications would be felt far beyond Russia. They would be felt in countries like Brazil. struggling to get their economic house in order. They would be felt in countries like South Korea and Malaysia and elsewhere. as the market would contract and pull investment capital out of those developing countries. Mr. Speaker.

If it were true that this agency is profitable. we would not be here. They would be making profit. and OPIC would not need to come here every year. They are asking for $55 million. Where does the profit come from? It was stated earlier very clearly. from the interest they earn. They have a portfolio of $3 billion of U.S. securities. But these did not reduce the national debt. That is part of the national debt. We pay interest on that $3 billion. And this agency gets $194 million from it. four times the amount of the requested appropriation. No wonder on paper it looks profitable. And they say. well. the private companies will not insure some of these projects. That means it is probably risky. Why should the taxpayer assume the risk? Why should these corporations be protected with this corporate welfare? This is the reason why jobs are exported at a cost to the American taxpayer. It is bad economics. And it is a lot of twisting of the facts if we call this agency profitable at the same time they are getting $194 million that we barely talk about. How many other agencies of government get interest like this? This is almost a government unto itself. the fact that it has that much financing without even a direct appropriation because it is paid out of the interest budget. This is indeed a very important amendment. I believe that we should definitely vote for this.

But the good thing about that is they ship those products through the port of Mobile and enhance the ability of the people in my district to benefit from exporting these products. They say OPIC is not really making any money and how the books say that. but OPIC is making $200 million a year. period. That is the fact. They are not losing money. It is true that when our countries go now into a foreign country. they are on a levelized playing field with all of the other industrialized nations because all of the other nations have similar programs. These are insurance programs that for the most part insure that if the government expropriates all of the properties there. that OPIC. the United States of America. will guarantee payment to the bank from which most of this money comes from for their guarantees. This is not corporate welfare. This is a sensible export program that is vital to American industry. I would urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the Andrews amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to the Andrews amendment and in support of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. or OPIC. Let me tell you what OPIC has meant to companies. large and small. in my state of New Jersey. With the help of risk insurance provided by OPIC since the program began. New Jersey companies have generated $3 billion in exports which supported 10.000 jobs. I hope my colleague from New Jersey will take note of the companies from New Jersey who needed OPIC insurance in order to sell their products abroad and thus support jobs here at home in our state of New Jersey. Many New Jersey companies have benefited from OPIC financing and insurance. They include. among others. Copelco Capital of Mahwah. Croll Reynolds Co. of Westfield. Engelhard Pollution Control of Iselin. Guest Supply Inc. of Monmouth Junction. H.W. Baker Linen Co. of Mahwah. IngersollDresser Pump Co. of Liberty Corner. IngersollRand of Woodcliff Lake. ITT of Midland Park. Maersk Inc. of Madison. Regal International of Closter. And what have these companies been able to do with OPIC Insurance? Lets just talk about some of the small New Jersey companies that have benefited. Misco America from Holmdel supplied products for a project in Ethiopia. Casale Industries from Garwood was involved in an electrical service project in Turkey. GAR International from Red Bank was a supplier for the privatization of a copper mine in Peru. So. again. I hope my colleague from New Jersey takes note of the importance of OPIC to New Jersey companies. large and small. and their employees. OPIC is a key component in our efforts to open up markets all over the globe to U.S. products and services. Again. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support OPIC.",

They are then in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service pending the acceptance back by their country of their citizenship. Unfortunately. we have many countries. well over 100 countries now. who have either refused to accept their citizens back or are unduly delaying the process of accepting them back. over 3.300 people. and we are adding approximately 60 every month to this list. These are individuals who are having to be detained in our Federal detention facilities at a cost of about $67 a day. and the cost on an annual basis is somewhere in the neighborhood of about $80 million. My amendment would have addressed that by simply saying to those nations. many of whom do receive assistance under this particular bill. that they would not be able to receive that assistance unless they cooperated. which is the responsibility and the comity of nations to accept your citizens back once they have been ordered deported from another country. and that that would be a condition for their receiving assistance under this bill. As the chairman has indicated. unfortunately. we did not receive the waiver from the Committee on Rules. but it is a serious problem. not only in my district. but in many other parts of the country. We cannot criticize the INS for not issuing deportation orders when we run into the problems of these over 100 countries who refuse to cooperate with that deportation process. I want to thank the chairman for his cooperation in making the matter a matter before the House tonight. I appreciate his cooperation and look forward to working with the gentleman as we approach the Commerce.

However. the Presidents fiscal year 2000 budget request for all development assistance to India. including both aid to the government and aid directly to nongovernmental organizations. is only $28.7 million. In fact. about 85 percent of all aid funding to India goes through NGOs. not the government. Therefore. the amendment of the gentleman from Indiana would actually allow considerably more funding to the government of India than the President. the Secretary of State.

Cutting development assistance for India at this time would be totally counterproductive because it would undermine U.S.-India relations just when were starting to make some real progress. India showed great restraint in the recent Kashmir crisis. and the Indian government has made a strong commitment to resuming bilateral discussions with Pakistan as soon as all militants have withdrawn behind the Line of Control. India has also indicated that signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be a high priority. On both counts. India is moving in a direction thats totally consistent with U.S. security interests in South Asia. It would be foolish to put this progress in jeopardy by cutting Indias development assistance. Mr. Chairman. human rights abuses should be taken seriously wherever they occur. India. like most countries in the world. doesnt have a perfect record. But according to the latest State Department report on human rights practices. India is making real progress. The Indian Supreme Court has acknowledged and condemned earlier human rights abuses in Punjab. and the independent National Human Rights Commission is conducting an investigation. The best way to improve human rights in India is to continue an open and frank dialogue. not to cut programs that limit the spread of AIDS. improve access to reproductive health services. and provide basic health care for mothers and children. With some 500 million Indians living below the poverty line. the modest amount of assistance we provide barely scratches the surface when compared to the overall need. But its an important symbol of the relationship between the worlds two largest democracies and it should be continued. I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.",

That to me is a very damaging aspect to have this country. so great and so wonderful in terms of its definition of democracy. to have a segment of our community believe that this occurred to this one gentleman because he was Asian and that the outcry did not come until after he was more or less exonerated. The outcry should have been there. as many of the organizations did. but it was sort of scuffled. Nobody really paid much attention to it. I agree absolutely that we have to call for an investigation. and it cannot be the one that the Attorney General has told the community that she would do. It is simply not adequate. It has to be taken to a different level and a situation where this whole matter can be reviewed. But it is a terrible thing.

The Asian Pacific American community nationwide has been monitoring the Wen Ho Lee case for over a year. The community has been concerned with the public discourse and media stereotypes arising from the case that insinuate all Asian Pacific Americans as disloyal foreigners. With regard to Dr. Lee. the community is wondering whether he has been accorded his due process rights as an American citizen during the investigation and decision making to prosecute him. Since Dr. Lees incarceration in December of 1999. the community has been very concerned about the fact that he has not been granted ball until his trial. One of the questions we have is what are the conditions. if any. must Dr. Lee meet in order for him to be released on bail? As a follow up to our conversation. we wanted to ask specific questions about Dr. Lees incarceration. We understand that Dr. Lee has been charged with mishandling classified data. A concern of the community is that since Dr. Lee has not been charged with espionage then why is he being treated as if he has been charged with espionage? As someone charged with a nonviolent act. the community believes Dr. Lee should be treated like those charged with other nonviolent \"white collar\" offenses. We have heard the following: Dr. Lee is in \"solitary confinement.\" Dr. Lee is \"shackled\" all day. Dr. Lees ankles and wrists are shackled when he is moved within the jail facility. even during his one hour of exercise. and uonemoved during weekly meetings with his family. No collect calls to any outside party are allowed except to his counsel. Kept separate from other prisoners during one hour long exercise. Dr. Lee is only allowed one hour outside of his jail cell for exercise per day. but not always outside under the sunlight. Dr. Lee is not allowed to read newspapers. magazines. books. Dr. Lee is not allowed to watch TV. We would greatly appreciate your response to these points as soon as possible so that we may accurately respond to the inquiries from our community about Dr. Lees confinement. Thank you very much.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my concerns about the unjust treatment and confinement of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. a former Los Alamos scientist. Dr. Wen Ho Lee was arrested by the FBI on December 10. 1999. when a grand jury issued a 59count indictment charging him with stealing nuclear secrets from a classified Los Alamos computer. U.S. District Judge James Parker denied bail for Dr. Lee. citing seven missing computer tapes of nuclear secrets and the possibility that his release could harm U.S. national security. Dr. Lee was held in solitary confinement for the following nine months and shackled whenever he was outside of his cell. Dr. Lees confinement was clearly unnecessary. He had not been convicted of any crime and was considered innocent under the law throughout his confinement. On August 17. 2000. FBI agent Robert Messemer admitted that he gave false testimony against Dr. Lee at his bail hearing the previous December. Furthermore. on September 10. 2000. the Department of Justice announced that Dr. Lee would go free after pleading guilty to just one of the original 59 felony counts against him. All other counts against him were dropped. When the Executive Branch agreed to release him without any conditions. it became apparent that it had never been necessary to confine him. We will never know the reasons why the Federal Government confined Dr. Lee and treated him so harshly. The plea agreement reached by Dr. Lee and the Department of Justice shields the Executive Branch from disclosing information that might have provided an explanation. Dr. Lees unjust confinement and the cruelty of the conditions under which he was confined are a disgrace to the FBI. the Department of Justice and the entire nation. No American citizen should ever be unnecessarily confined by the U.S. Government. I am deeply sorry about the unjust treatment Dr. Lee received. and I urge my colleagues to work diligently to ensure that no other citizen will ever be forced to endure this type of treatment.",

Often we have had bipartisan support. I ask today that the good men on the other side of the aisle come together and support the Robb amendment. We have raced for the cure together. We have done it on a bipartisan basis. Certainly. today we could pass this amendment. I challenge the other party to vote for this amendment because what it will do is absolutely save lives and save misery. There are many things that a woman faces in her life. but one of the most terrible things that she fears is that she will go to visit her doctor and find out from her mammogram and her physician that she has breast cancer. The worst thing after that is that she needs a mastectomy. Make no mistake. a mastectomy is an amputation. and it has all of the horrible. terrible consequences of having an amputation. Therefore. when the woman is told she can come in and only stay a few hoursafter this significant surgery that changes her body. changes the relationships in her family. she is told she is supposed to call a cab and go back home. it only adds to the trauma for her. Well. the Robb amendment. which many of us support. really says that it is the doctor and the patient that decides how long a woman should stay in the hospital after she has had the surgery. Certainly. we should leave this to the doctor and to the patient. An 80 year old is different than a 38 year old. This legislation parallels the DAMATO legislation that had such tremendous support on both sides of the aisle. I say to my colleagues. if we are going to race for the cure. lets race to support this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering managed care reform legislation. I believe that the Democratic version of the Patients Bill of Rights is the right vehicle on which to bring reform to the nation. Our colleague from Virginia. Mr. ROBB. has offered an amendment that highlights an important aspect of managed care that needs to be finetuned. and that is womens access to health care. This amendment would allow a woman to designate her obstetrician/ gynecologist (ob/gyn) as her primary care provider and to seek care from her ob/gyn without needing to get preauthorization from the plan or from her primary care provider. Even though many women consider their ob/ gyn as their regular doctor. a number of plans require women to first see their primary care provider before seeing their ob/gyn. This means that a costly and potentially dangerous level of delay is built into the system for women. This amendment would allow a womans ob/gyn to refer her to other specialists and order tests without jumping through the additional hoop of visiting the general practitioner. This amendment would also address the care a woman receives when undergoing the traumatic surgery of mastectomy. This provision would leave the decision about how long a woman would stay in the hospital following a mastectomy up to the physician and the woman. Some plans have required that this major surgery be done on an outpatient basis. In other instances. women have been sent home shortly after the procedure with tubes still in their bodies and still feeling the effects of anesthesia. This should not be allowed to happen. Plans should not put concern about costs before the wellbeing of women. The Republican bill does not provide women with sufficient access to care. Plans would not be required to allow women to choose their ob/gyn as their primary care provider. In addition. the Republican bill would allow health plans to limit womens direct access to her ob/gyn to routine care which could potentially be defined by a plan as one visit a year. In addition. \"drivethrough mastectomies\" would not be prevented under their bill. Mr. President. the Robb amendment contains commonsense protections women need and deserve.

Her husband happens to practice this particular form of medicine.

The Pennsylvania Legislature is considering a $25.000.000 grant program that mirrors the FLAME Act and will provide similar benefits as my bill.

The law. in accompanying report language. specifically denies the ability of the administration to spend more than 15 percent of the total expenditures in Kosovo. So we have already addressed this issue. The percentage that the gentleman from Ohio is using is going to be confusing because it appears to increase the ability of the United States. I wish the gentleman from Ohio would listen to this because I am responding to his indication. But it appears as if his amendment. although it is not his intent. might even say with the higher percentage factor that we are backing down on our insistence that our administration only spend 15 percent. So I would invite the gentleman from Ohio to read existing law whereby this Congress prohibits the administration from spending more than 15 percent. Under the law. the President must come back to the Congress if indeed they violate that. They came to us in December of 1999. and they certified that the United States contribution was only 14.9 percent. So I share the sentiment of the gentleman from Ohio. I think he is moving in the right direction. but fortunately. the Congress has very responsibly already addressed this issue and the law is the law. We do not need confusing additional law to complicate the issue. The President requested $100 million for assistance in Kosovo. The committee rejected that. and we only included $12 million.

I think the administration should have come to us before they made this commitment. and we should have had this debate before the country got involved. But they did not. I do not see this as an affirmation of legislative authority. I see this as an affirmation of a need to protect thousands of young Americans who are in Kosovo today.

There may be good reasons for keeping them there. I believe there are. But protecting them from the danger of being there is hardly a good reason to keep them there. And that is what they are saying. People say they agree. the Europeans ought to pay more. But this House has consistently refused to do anything to force the Europeans to do it. And they know empty rhetoric when they see it. They are very sophisticated. What this amendment is intending to do. by the way. is not to pull out. This is an amendment that says Europe should begin to pay up. Apparently. there is a lack of confidence in our European allies amongst some of the leadership in the Committee on Appropriations that is greater than there is for us. Because they say. if we condition our staying there on the Europeans doing what General Shelton complains that they are not doing. that will lead to abandonment. Well. if the troops are overexposed and it is costing us too much money. there are two things to do. have the Europeans pay their fair share or withdraw them. We hope it is the former.

I was working on introducing a bill to provide this type of antitrust protection. and I was extremely pleased to see the chairman include this in his amendment. The National Association of Broadcasters had a code of conduct that they abided by until it was abandoned by the broadcasters in 1983. Since then standards which broadcasters find acceptable have deteriorated. Eighty percent of Americans have expressed concern about the increasingly graphic portrayals of sex. violence. vulgarity and programming that sanctions and glorifies criminal. antisocial and degrading behavior. The Hyde amendment will permit the entertainment industry to work collaboratively to develop a set of voluntary programming guidelines. This system worked well for decades. It was not perfect. but it did put the impetus on Hollywood to refrain from exploiting the American people and producing products that are directed toward the prurient interests of our young people. Hollywood has cast aside responsibility in recent years. and it is time that they respect traditional values.

Michael Carneal is currently in jail for killing three students in 1997s school shooting in Paducah. Kentucky.

Ever since the Clinton administration stopped all prosecution of extremely violent and sexual pornography our children and those who prey upon them have had easy access to the most disturbing. mindimpacting material. This amendment seeks to protect the minds of our children by holding people who sell obscene material to children accountable and by evaluating the impact of violent products on our children. H.R. 1501 attempts to protect the majority of our children who make the right choices from those who make the wrong choices by treating juveniles like adults. when they act like adults and commit violent crimes by keeping guns out of the hands of juvenile criminals. and by making the largest community investment in juvenile justice reform in history. 0J 1700 Congress cannot make a perfect world. but we can empower families and communities to protect their children.",

First of all. it is not just about motion pictures. it is not just about television. it is not just about musical recordings. it applies to books. to pamphlets. to magazines. to drawings. to photographs. to sculptures. Secondly. as I mentioned earlier. it seeks to translate the obscenity formula grafted onto depictions of violence and federalize the entire matter. and then claim to provide community standards so that a particular sculpture or movie or picture or book may have one standard and be quite fine for sale to minors in Manhattan. New York. and not in eastern Montana or in Jackson. Mississippi. A law which seeks to federalize the criminal conduct of selling inappropriate depiction of minor children. depictions of violence to minors. and at the same time decentralize community standards all across the country is going to have to fall as vague. impermissibly broad. and setting up an absence of adequate notice to any single person who might be regulated.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently. I asked the Congressional Research Service to provide information on the number and cost of mergers and acquisitions involving pharmaceutical companies over the last 5 years. The total: $375 billion. In the last 6 months alone. Monsanto announced it would pay $23.3 billion to buy Pharmacia and :Upjohn. Glaxo Wellcome has pledged $76 billion to buy SmithKline Beecham. and Pfizer said it would spend $90.27 billion to buy WarnerLambert. I have been concerned about the effect of these megamergers on competition -and prices. And I have been skeptical about claims that the increasing trend of drug companies buying other drug companies boosts research activities. A recent report by CenterWatch. a research entity focused on the pharmaceutical .industry. confirms those fears. According. to its analysis of 22 mergers completed between 1988 and 1999. the number of drugs under development actuallydropped by 34 percent during the first 3 years after the mergers. The median number of projects in developmentfrom preclinical to latestage testingfell from 85 to 56 potential drugs. And. after a slight rise. the number of clinical trials also fell to 9 percent below premergerlevels. I6 a Newark Star Ledger article. Ken Gatz. head of CenterWatch. stated that \"mergers are not meeting certain strategic R&D objectives and may even harm the industrys larger term ability to innovate.\" \ufffd Drug companies argue that they cannot afford to lower prices to senior citizens and other consumers because it will hurt their R&D efforts. Yet. these same drug companies spent $375 billion to buy each other in mergers that have reduced R&D efforts. It is time that we reject these false claims. Congress must act now to expand Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage to all senior citizens and persons with disabilities. And it must use the power of Medicare to negotiate affordable prices. The pharmaceutical industry can certainly afford it. but our senior citizens cannot afford to wait. [From the StarLedger.

The ratepayers. over the last decades. have extended about $11 billion to the Federal Government to ensure that the Federal Government would be financially able to take the waste.

While I think it is appropriate to make interim payments to facilities as accurately as possible. paying these facilities as low as 8085 percent of what HCFA estimates final costs to be seems too low.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am deeply concerned that important efforts to support small businesses are jeopardized by the many unrelated amendments that have been added to H.R. 2614 the Small Business. Health. Tax. and Minimum Wage Act. I ask my colleagues to join me in working to pass important legislation vital to preserve the Certified Development Company Program. the Small Business Innovation Research Program. and the reauthorization of the Small Businesses Administration. As Congress prepares to adjourn. it is irresponsible to prevent action on these important issues. I am very concerned that innocent provisions that support small businesses and job creation are being held hostage in a debate over unrelated issues. H.R. 2614 was introduced as a bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act to make improvements to the certified development company program. This program provides gap financing which is vital to foster entrepreneurship and create economic opportunities. In recent days. however. this bill has been loaded down with numerous provisions that completely overshadow this program and threaten to shatter our chance to authorize these programs before Congress adjourns. I am proud to speak out on behalf of the real intent of H.R. 2614 which would help small businesses succeed. There is an old proverb used in my state of South Dakota which advises. \"Dont put off until tomorrow what can be done today.\" Today. we should strip out the politically charged amendments that have been tacked onto this bill and pass legislation both parties agree is important to our economy. our local communities. and many businesses and families across the country. It is careless not to reauthorize these important programs because of election year politics which bogged down the legislation with unrelated issues. Congress should vote on the genuine issues with regard to small business programs. We must not let certain partisan differences cause us to turn away from our opportunity to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of our country. There are many issues before this body which evoke strong differences of opinion. however. authorizing these important small business programs are not among them. I urge my colleagues to join me in securing the passage of this important legislation and not allow these widely supported initiatives to fall victim to nonrelated amendments thrown together in the closing days of Congress.",

The complexities here are significant. obviously. not simply those that divide some of us here in this Congress on the things we care about. but one of the concerns that I had of course is the impact on small agencies to make sure they were not overrun by a large bureaucratic system. but also the differences between countries and cultures and different systems of law.

Many families decide adoption is the right path for them to build a family and we should do all we can to promote lifeaffirming policies like adoption. As an adoptive father. I believe every child deserves love. shelter. security. and a permanent home yet the orphanages around the world are filled with children seeking loving homes and families. Many Americans choose to adopt a child from another country because they know they can make a difference in a childs life. America is a rich country and our citizens are very generous in opening up their homes to orphans. The Hague Intercountry Adoption Act builds upon the spirit of the thousands of American parents who have adopted their child from another country. I am a proud cosponsor of the Hague Intercountry Adoption Act because I am committed to ensuring intercountry adoption remains a viable option for American families. American families are very altruistic because they spend thousands of dollars and are willing to travel to a foreign country to build a family. Unfortunately. some people took advantage of adoptive parents and legislation was needed. The Hague Intercountry Adoption Act attempts to guarantee the childs safety and fully protects the rights of the adoptive parents and birth parents. In the days ahead. Congress must ensure the process of crafting rules and regulations for the Hague is done in an expeditious manner. Congress must also ensure that the regulatory process is not abused and used in a manner to reward the efforts of those who failed to achieve their policy initiatives through the legislative process. I strongly believe the Central Authority must be fully staffed and have personnel with adoption experience. Inadequate staffing levels and/or lack of staff familiar about adoption policy could lead to a dramatic decline in the number of intercountry adoptions. Today is a momentous day for adoption. This legislation provides hope for orphaned children worldwide and it will improve the lives of countless children and families.",

Through the committee process. however. we were able to reach a compromise between H.R. 2342 and H.R. 2909. Through the efforts of Chairman GILMAN and Ranking Member GEJDENSON the legislation we are considering today takes the best of both bills. and I would like to thank them for their hard work in moving the process forward.

He is to be commended for his role in the process as well. I would like to extend a special thank you to those parents of children adopted from overseas who contacted me with their concerns and for sharing their experiences with me. Their input was critically important. and I appreciate their active interest in this legislation and the process we have gone through. It is an unfortunate reality that there are people willing to exploit the vulnerability of needy children and their prospective parents. The willingness of these families to go through the international adoption process. despite its flaws. is testimony to their character. The passage of this legislation affirms our commitment to creating a framework that better protects children and their families in the future. Despite our different approaches in addressing the problems faced by children and parents in the international adoption process. it is safe to say we all want the same thingto help those who want nothing more than to provide a child with a loving home.

But I have introduced this bill because we need to pay attention as to what has happened in China and throughout the world since we voted for permanent normal trade relations with China. I believe the American public has the right to hear about events and the events in China that followed the mega million dollar propaganda campaign that was waged by U.S. corporations in order to acquire the approval of Congress for PNTR. PNTR. let us remember. is a taxpayer subsidy for corporations. includes. and that is the most important provision for these companies. a taxpayer subsidy in the form of loan guarantees and actual interest guarantees and loan guarantees to companies that are closing their factories in the United States and opening them in China. What we are talking about is American workers being taxed in order to support the transfer of thousands of jobs to lowpaying labor mills in China. That is what PNTR was all about. and it was sold to us as something totally different. It told to us that there would be many benefits of PNTR. Well. the day after the PNTR vote. the media began reporting what the real story behind the corporate lobbying campaign was all about. even though during the debate for PNTR we heard that it was all about selling American products which. of course. is not the case. But after the vote. the truth began to emerge. A May 25 Wall Street Journal article put it very bluntly. Quote. \"even before the first vote was cast by Congress and while the debate in Washington focused on U.S. exports. the multinationals had something very different in mind.\" Quote. \"this is about investment in China. not about exports.\" said an economist for a major U.S. financial firm.

I do think that we have to change the focus of the debate and recognize that we have a choice to make today and every day. and that is whether we are going to fight and negotiate to raise environmental standards. raise international labor standards. or are we simply going to engage in a race to the bottom because that is the way the world is today as we find it. that is the way we will accept the world as we find it. and we will accommodate ourselves.

Since that vote in May. we have learned that several of our assumptions about the meaning of the vote and of Chinas role in the world have proven false. Consider this. The Wall Street Journal ran an article that I want to quote from. The headline was. \"House Vote Primes U.S. to Boost Investments in China.\" The article says that the China deal with the U.S. on trade has less to do with U.S. workers making and exporting goods to the Chinese and more about Chinese workers working in U.S.-owned factories in China for import to the U.S. The Journal quotes a Wall Street economist saying. \"This deal is about investments. not exports.\" Indeed. the same article quotes a Washingtonbased analyst who said: \"U.S. exports will increase. but not at the rate of investment. and the corporate community has been quiet about that. Theyve been able to avoid telling that story.\" I want to read that quote again. This is a Washingtonbased analyst: \"U.S. exports will increase. but not at the rate of investment. and the corporate community has been quiet about that. Theyve been able to avoid telling that story.\" We are going to tell the story here. Since the vote for permanent MFN with China. a company in the Cleveland area which provides jobs for my constituents said it will close in the U.S. in favor of a new factory in China. Mr. Speaker. as a director of the UAW in the Cleveland region wrote to his Senators last week. \"The first casualty of normal trade relations has occurred. . . . It is obvious that Rubbermaids cancellation of the Nestaway contract is not about world competition. it is about naked greed. Nestaways story is about only one of the thousands of small American companies which are confronted with an economic squeeze brought about by unfair trade laws. PNTR for China will be the death knell for many small companies.\"",

The class from Green River represented the state of Wyoming well during the finals. and I wish these \"constitutional experts\" the best of luck as they continue to cultivate their interest in the principles upon which our great country was founded.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to take a moment to recognize some special students from my home state of Wyoming. Green River to be specific. who have been spending a lot of their time studying our Constitution. They got so good at it. in fact. that they entered a national competition here in Washington to test their knowledge against the best of their peers and had a remarkable result. Earlier this month students from around the country came to the nations capital to compete on their understanding of our Constitution and our American Government. The students of Green River High School did very well in that event. In fact. their understanding and grasp of the fundamental principles of our Democracy and the meaning of our Constitution was judged to be among the best of the 50 teams that participated. Programs like the one the students of Green River participated in are vital if we are to ensure that our future leaders have an understanding of the principles of our Constitution and the beliefs and values our Founding Fathers brought to the creation of our government. Such an understanding is an important part of our childrens education for it will help them understand that the rights and freedoms afforded by our Constitution bring with them certain duties and responsibilities - the duties and responsibilities of citizenship. That will help them understand their role as they become our local. state and national leaders and face the challenges of the new millennium. Good work. Green River High School! Led by their teacher. Dennis Johnson. and supported by their State Coordinator. Dick Kean. and their District Coordinator. Matt Strannigan. they did a great job and made Wyoming proud. I would also like to congratulate each member of the team. which includes: Richard Baxter. Natalie Binder. Katharine Bracken. Cameron Kelsey. Sandra Newton. Jacque Owen. Jeremy Pitts. Benjamin Potmesil. Meagan Reese. Rachel Ryckman. Ryan Stewart and Steven Ujvary.e",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing a bill to improve the process used by the United States Postal Service to establish postage rates for nonprofit and other reducedrate mailers. Under the current rate setting procedure. nonprofit postage rates have changed significantly. often rising more than corresponding commercial rates. In fact. in some cases. nonprofit mail rates have increased so much that the nonprofit rates are higher than similar commercial rates. According to the Postal Service. the unpredictable rate changes experienced by nonprofit mailers stem from difficulties the Service has had with gathering accurate cost data for small subclasses of mail. By establishing a structured relationship between nonprofit and commercial postage rates. this legislation would protect all categories of nonprofit mail from unpredictable rate swings in the future. The bill would set nonprofit and classroom Periodical rates at 95 percent of the commercial counterpart rates (excluding the advertising portion). set nonprofit Standard A rates at 60 percent of the commercial Standard A rates. and set Library and Educational Matter rates at 95 percent of the rates for the special subclass of commercial Standard B mail. The Postal Service recently proposed to increase postage rates for all classes of mail. and this proposal is now pending before the Postal Rate Commission. As part of its request. the Postal Service asked for nonprofit postage rates that are premised on the enactment of this. or similar. legislation to change the process for setting nonprofit mail rates. Without this legislation. nonprofit mailers will face potential doubledigit rate hikes. This bill achieves an appropriate balance between nonprofit and commercial postage rates. and provides nonprofit mailers with much needed rate predictability. It is a compromise solution that is supported by the United States Postal Service and several major commercial and nonprofit mailer associations. including: the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers. the National Federation of Nonprofits. the Direct Marketing Association. the Magazine Publishers of America. and the Association of Postal Commerce. I invite my colleagues to support this effort to protect nonprofit mailers by improving the method for establishing nonprofit postage rates. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Little Sandy Watershed Protection Act. I promised Oregonians that my first legislative business when Congress reconvened after the Memorial Day Recess would be the introduction of this bill. Therefore. joined by my friends Senator GORDON SMITH and Congressman EARL BLUMENAUER. I introduce this legislation to make sure that Portland families can go to their kitchen faucets and get a glass of safe and pure drinking water today. tomorrow. and on. into the 21st century. The Bull Run has been the primary source of water for Portland since 1895. The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit. Mount Hood National Forest. was protected by Congressional action in 1904. 1977 and then again. most recently. in 1996 (P.L. 95200. 16. U.S.C. 482b note) because it was recognized as Portlands primary municipal water supply. It still is. Today I propose to finish the job of the Oregon Resources and Conservation Act of 1996. That law. which I worked on with Senator Mark Hatfield. finally provided full protection to the Bull Run watershed. but only provided temporary protection for the adjacent Little Sandy watershed. I promised in 1996 that I would return to finish the job of protecting Portlands drinking water supply and intend to continue to push this legislation until the job is complete. The bill I introduce today expands the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit boundary from approximately 95.382 acres to approximately 98.272 acres by adding the southern portion of the Little Sandy River watershed. an increase of approximately 2.890 acres. The protection this bill offers will not only assure clean drinking water. but also increase the potential for fish recovery. Reclaiming suitable habitat for our regions threatened fish populations must be an allout effort. Through the cooperation of Portland General Electric and the City of Portland. the Little Sandy can be an important part of that effort. My belief is that the children of the 21st century deserve water that is as safe and pure as any that the Oregon pioneers found in the 19th century. This legislation will go a long way toward bringing about that vision.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me begin by saying that I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation aimed at protecting the Little Sandy Watershed for future generations. The Little Sandy lies adjacent to the Bull Run Watershed. which is the primary municipal water supply for the City of Portland. Oregon. The water that filters through these forests and mountainsides to the east of Portland is of the highest quality in the nation and does not require artificial filtration or treatment. The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit was established by congressional action in 1977. creating a management partnership between the USDA Forest Service and the City of Portland for the review of water quality and quantity. Additional protection was given to the Bull Run by the Northwest Forest Plan in 1993. restricting all timber harvests in sensitive areas. Neither of these actions. however. extended a satisfactory level of protection to the nearby Little Sandy Watershed. Population growth and heightened water quality expectations have brought the preservation of the Little Sandy Watershed to the forefront of the publics interest in recent years. The legislation that I have cosponsored would expand the boundary of the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit to include the southern portion of the Little Sandy. This would add nearly 3.000 acres to the Management Unit. including a number of acres currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). I am aware that questions have just arisen as to whether some of this acreage is currently managed by 0 & C lands. If so. there are concerns that 0 & C land would be devalued by a change in management designation. If this is the case. as the bill moves through the legislative process. I will seek the redesignation of other lands outside the preserve in order to maintain the wholeness of 0 & C land and the timber base. By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself.",

A few moderate Republicans could vote against this bill and stop it. Let me bring to them a few facts. Onethird of the tax relief in this bill goes to the 90 percent of Americans who are middle class or of modest means. The next onethird goes to the next 9 percent toward the top. And onethird of the benefits goes to the top 1 percent of the income earners. This is not just an $800 billion tax cut for ten years. In the second 10 years. it is over $3 trillion.

While the pharmaceutical industry. which makes wide campaign contributions. spends more money on lobbying and campaign contributions than any other industry in this country. while they are enjoying recordbreaking profits. millions of people. poor people throughout the world. are dying of AIDS. Meanwhile. the pharmaceutical companies are down in South Africa trying to do away with legislation in the courts. trying to do away with legislation passed by the South African government because the South African government is trying to get inexpensive drugs to deal with the epidemic of AIDS. What this legislation says very clearly is get the State Department off the backs of South Africa when South Africa is operating legally. legally under international law. If the pharmaceutical companies think they are operating illegally. if the U.S. State Department thinks they are operating illegally. go to the World Trade Organization. But the State Department does not want to go to the World Trade Organization. They want to put unilateral action against South Africa. The drug companies want to use their muscle against South Africa. What South Africa is doing is legal. The State Department does not want to challenge them in the World Trade Organization because they will lose. It is a shame and an embarrassment that the government of the United States of America is working with the multibillion dollar drug companies to push around South Africa because that country is trying to do the right thing for its people with AIDS.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. criminals should not profit from illegal acts. That is why I introduced H.R. 1887 last week that will ban illegal. disgusting acts that are occurring nationwide. People around the country are making \"crush videos.\" These videos feature women crushing small animals with their feet while wearing spiked heals. The videos are sold nationwide to people who enjoy this type of socalled \"foot fetish.\" and sellers of the video are making millions of dollars. The acts of animals cruelty featured in the video are illegal under state law. However. according to District Attorney Michael Bradbury of Ventura County. California. it is difficult to prosecute these acts under state animal cruelty laws. First. a District Attorney must identify the individual in the video. This is a difficult task given the fact that most of the time. only the actress legs are shown. Second. it is difficult to prove that the act featured in the video occurred with in the statue of limitations. Third. local animal cruelty laws do not prohibit the production. sale. or possession of the video. There are also no federal laws that could be used to prosecute the individuals. Sick criminals are taking advantage of the loopholes in the local law and the lack of federal law on animal cruelty videos. This is a serious problem. Thousands of these videos are being sold. Thousands of dollars are being made. By not closing these loopholes and allowing this sick behavior. we are encouraging people to profit from violating the state animal cruelty laws This must be stopped! H.R. 1887 will put a stop to this offensive behavior. This legislation is narrowly tailored to prohibit the creation. sale or possession of a depiction of animal cruelty in interstate commerce for commercial gain. H.R. 1887 does not preempt state laws on animal cruelty. Rather. it incorporates the animal cruelty law of the state where the offense occurs. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in pursuing this legislation which will put an end to profiting from these disgusting criminal acts. Please contact WendyWiseman of my staff at 55811 to cosponsor H.R. 1887.",

Saving and strengthening Social Security is one of the highest priorities for me. After people work hard their entire life they should feel confident that they will receive their Social Security benefits. The way I see it. we have to get Washingtons hands out of Social Security once and for all. We need legislation that will permanently prevent Washington from raiding the Social Security surpluses for wasteful spending programs. The simple truth is that the Social Security Trust Fund will go into the red in 14 years unless we act now to strengthen it. Under H.R. 1259. Washington would never be able to touch Social Security dollars again. as 100 percent will be saved for Social Security. The Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act of 1999 will help us guard against attempts to raid the Social Security surpluses for more government spending by toughening budget procedures. This legislation will change the way the budget is presented so Social Security funds cannot be used for other purposes. including how we measure our Federal surplus. Mr. Speaker. having paid into Social Security myself for over 40 years. I will never support hasty reforms that threaten the financial futures of those who have committed a lifetime of earnings to the system. As a father and a grandfather.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduced the Pesticide Registration Harmonization Act of 1999. I am pleased to have Representative RICK HILL of Montana and Representative JOHN BALDACCI of Maine as original cosponsors on this very important legislation for American farmers and ranchers. The premise of this legislation is quite simple. As a Member of Congress representing a borderstate with Canada. I believe that it is essential for American farmers to be on the same level \"playing field\" as their international counterparts. I am hopeful that the Pesticide Harmonization Act of 1999 will begin a much needed dialogue between the United States and Canada on chemical harmonization as we head into the 21st Century. The Pesticide Harmonization Act of 1999 is designed to establish a process under which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could be requested to review registration requests for certain pesticide products. The types of pesticides that would be reviewed are registered for use on a specific crop in Canada and are also registered in the United States but not for use on that specific crop. In addition. the chemical must be needed to respond to critical pest control needs of United States growers which are not otherwise being met: and supported for registration by their manufacturers. If the chemical meets these criteria then the EPA review process would be expedited. The EPA would have 180 days after receiving a request from the registrant for a specific product to either agree to accept the registration package approved by the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) or to explain their reasons for not approving the request. Clearly. there is an inequity in pesticide registrations. particularly for canola. wheat. and barley. between the United States and Canada. In the case of canola. Canada has about 40 pesticides registered while the United States has only seven. American farmers ought to have access to the same. environmentally safe pest control tools that are available to their Canadian counterparts. Mr. Speaker. American farmers are facing 50 year low commodity prices. at the same time costs of production are continuing to rise. The Pesticide Registration Harmonization Act of 1999 is a step in the right direction of leveling the playing field for American producers.",

I regret the Committees failure to follow the recommendations of the Military Personnel Subcommittee to repeal the statutory prohibition on abortions in overseas military hospitals and restore the law to what it was for many years. If enacted. women stationed overseas would be permitted to use their own funds to obtain abortion services. No federal funds would have been used and health care professionals who are opposed to performing abortions as a matter of conscience or moral principle would not be required to do so. This is an issue of fundamental fairness. Servicewomen and military dependents stationed abroad do not expect special treatment. only the right to receive the same legally protected medical services that women in the United States receive. We had the opportunity to finally put a stop to the misguided law that has endangered our servicewomens lives for far too long. It is unfortunate that the full committee did not follow the subcommittees direction. The Department of Defense. the American Public Health Association. the American Medical Womens Association. the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America have all indicated their support for the subcommittees decision. If we are to attract the best and brightest of our nations young people to our Armed Forces we must act to restore this fundamental right. We cannot expect to attain our readiness and recruitment goals when potential soldiers know they will not have the same right to access to health care when they are stationed overseas. It is our responsibility to restore the right of freedom of choice to women serving overseas in our nations Armed Forces. Members of the military and their families already give up many freedoms and risk their lives to defend our country. They should not have to sacrifice their privacy. their health or their basic constitutional rights because of a policy with no valid military purpose.",

I am pleased to support legislation that restores some sanity and common sense to our Nations immigration policy. Many of us in Congress never intended for the 1996 immigration reforms to lead to the senseless deportation of those who have paid for their minor crimes and are now productive members of society. 1 have personally met with many families in my district that are now dealing with the trauma of the unwarranted deportation of a family member. These families will stay in America. but are often reliant on the care and financial support of the person facing deportation. These families may be forced to go on welfare or their children may be put into foster homes. Clearly. our communities are not made safer by breaking up these families. With this legislation. Congress is beginning to address those provisions in the 1996 law that went too far. H.R. 5062 is the first step in the right direction of fixing the 1996 immigration legislation. Under current law. many legal residents can be deported for minor offenses that were not deportable offenses when they pled guilty to them. The bill will bring sensible relief to those who have paid for past infractions and will give people a chance to remain in the country. In addition. people who have already been deported under the retroactive provision of this law will be allowed to apply for readmission to the United States. This will allow families who were previously torn apart to reunite and regain the opportunity of the American Dream. The bill does not fix all of the harsh provisions of the 1996 immigration degislation but it will bring some relief to those who have dealt with the tragedy of a deported family member.",

It actually has many provisions that significantly affect American families. legal immigration and others seeking to enter the United States legally. Among other things. the 1996 law subjectslongtime lawful permanent residents to deportation for minor offenses committed prior to the enactment of the 1996 law. H.R. 5062 is the product of negotiations between Representative BARNEY FRANK. HENRY HYDE and BILL MCCOLLUM: It applies only to eliminating mandatory deportation of legal permanent residents who committed offenses that were not deportable prior to enactment of the 1996 law. Mandatory deportation will not be required for persons who were convicted prior to September 30. 1996. of \"aggravated felonies\" that were not deportable offenses at the time of the conviction. Such persons will be eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. People who have already been deported under the retroactive provisions of this law will be allowed to apply for readmission to this country. thus providing an avenue for the reunification of families that were split apart by the retroactive impact of the 1996 law. A technical provision known as the \"stoptime rule\" also will be eliminated for those offenses committed on or before enactment of the 1996 law. This provision enables persons to take advantage of cancellation of removal. This bill is only a modest billmerely a first step toward the reforms needed to address the injustices of the overly harsh 1996 law. With regard to retroactivity. persons who are deportable under the 1996 law remain deportable. Though they can apply for cancellation of removal. they may be ineligible for other benefits such as naturalization. Moreover. the bill applies only to convictionsrather than offensesthat occurred prior to the 1996 law. More broadly. the harshness of the 1996 immigration law must be mitigated in future bills as seen in Representative JOHN CONYERS H R. 4966 (Fix 96 bill). The 1996 law must be changed to restore judicial review and discretion to the Attorney General and the courts. eliminate mandatory detention. and revoke retroactive enforcement of the 1996 law on a more comprehensive basis.",

This bill will make a number of technical corrections to the Amendments to Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. which was passed and signed into law by the first session of the 106th Congress. These corrections will allow for clarification of the intent and scope of the 1999 legislation and provide this Congress with an opportunity to correct errors. which have been identified in the current copyright law that have been identified. The copyright laws of the United States provide legal rights to exclusive publication. production. sale. or distribution of a literary. musical. or artistic work. which also includes computer software programs. These laws provide security for those are engaged commercial transactions of every description. A few of these forms of commercial transaction are television. and radio programming. newspaper. and magazine publication as well as electronic commercial transactions that involve the commercial exchange of information. It is my hope that the work we do today relating to copyright law will ensure the protection of artists work well into this new century. I would like to thank my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee for their work in bringing this legislation to be considered by the Full House.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleagues. this is a great day for musicians who create their own music and musicians that perform. and so I am pleased to rise in support as a cosponsor of H.R. 5107 because it strikes sound recordings from the definition of work made for hire in section 101 of the Copyright Act. The bill undoes an unfortunate amendment to the Copyright Act made last November which changed the act to treat sound recordings as \"works made for hire.\" Without the benefit of committee hearings or other debate. the change terminated any future interest that artists might have in their sound recordings and turned them over permanently to the record companies. We have since learned that we should never do business this way. After hearing testimony at the subcommittee level. all of the interested parties. I am glad to say. the subcommittee members. the recording artists and the recording industry itself. agreed that the provision was a substantive change in law and should be struck so that the law could be returned to the status quo ante. That is what brings us here today. Returning the law to where it was before November of 1999 will ensure that any and all artists authorship rights are preserved. Fortunately. the recording industry has worked diligently with the recording artists for the past several months to arrive at mutually agreed language. While slightly awkward in its legislative construction. I nevertheless want to compliment both parties in their efforts to reach compromise. Now. the digital era lends to creators great opportunities for marketing their works of authorship and. at the same time. great perils of theft of those works. As we try in other legislative contexts to protect intellectual property rights in an open system of the Internet. we should not be changing the rules of such property rights in the middle of the night without hearings or proper committee consideration. as happened last year when this provision was first inserted. I express my appreciation that we are undoing this unwise change. and I thank all of my colleagues that participated in bringing this measure to the floor and ask all of the Members of the House to give an aye vote on this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to offer comment on H.R. 5107. the Work Made for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000. for consideration. Under 17 United States Code 203. authors of copyrighted works have the right to terminate assignments of their copyrights thirtyfive years after an assignment. Section 203 is designed to ensure that authors. who may have received very little compensation for the initial assignment of their copyrights. get a \"second bite at the apple\" if those copyrights have value after thirtyfive years. Unfortunately. the right to termination cannot be exercised by those creators of copyrighted works that are defined as \"works made for hire.\" under 17 U.S.C. 101. Under Section 101. a work made for hire may be defined as: a work prepared by an employee within the scope of employment. or a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as one of ten. or in the case of statutorily specified categories of works. Statutorily specified work under the condition of a written agreement specifying the work shall be considered made for hire then it is considered under the conditions of section 101. After the enactment of the new copyright law many organizations. legal scholars. and recording artists took strong issue with it. asserting that it constitutes a significant. substantive change in law. However. representatives of record companies and some legal scholars strongly disagreed with this position. and insisted that the new copyright law merely clarified prior law. The core of the disagreement between the opposing sides centers around preexisting categories of works made for hire. and thus the extent to which sound recordings were previously eligible to be works made for hire. This bill only attempts to return the law regarding copyrighted work that was created as \"work made for hire\" to its original state before the passage of the 1999 copyright legislation. It is my hope that in the next Congress we will have an opportunity for hearing and full deliberation in this matter so that artists and commercial interest in copyrighted work can both be served by the copyright laws of our nation.

But today. the underlying bill before us combines the best of two approaches: the independent commission and ShaysMeehan.

But now. with the independent commission having become part of the ShaysMeehan proposal. the bill before us now has an added dimension. The commission created by this legislation will provide a means to address those issues that continue to breed public mistrust in our campaign finance system. Today.

They had reform for individual candidates. but they failed when corporate money. union money. and very wealthy individuals money. could be laundered through party organization committees of both parties and smaller parties. This flow of money was readily welcomed and the parties simply became great Automatic Teller Machines that one can push in at one end and millions of dollars come out at the other end.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker. I want to put this debate into a little perspective. When the United States became independent. when our Constitution was adopted. there were many skeptics who said that our new system of government would not last. a republican form of government. a democratic form of government. There had been many republics and democracies in the past and in antiquity. in Middle Ages. but they had not lasted. They all. every single one of them. degenerated into oligarchies or autocracies. Skeptics said this new democratic republic would not last. either. There have been two greatest tests of our democratic system. In the Civil War. because of slavery. Lincoln quite correctly characterized it as a test of whether a government of the people. by the people. and for the people could survive. Now we face a second great test. the increasing domination of our politics by big money. People are cynical. and rightly so. They believe that their participation. their voices. cannot count against the power of big money. and recent experience says they are right. We all know the power of the HMOs. the pharmaceutical companies. We watched this Congress pass a $50 billion giveaway to big tobacco companies. We gave away. not sold. not rented. gave away a $70 billion spectrum to the broadcasting companies. Why? Because of the power of big money. That power has corrupted both major political parties. and if we do not stop it. if we do not take this step. ShaysMeehan is the first step towards shopping it. when the histories are written. they will say the United States had a good 200-. 250year run with democracy. and then it degenerated into an oligarchy and not a democratic system. We must begin to stop it now. We must pass ShaysMeehan. We must reject the trickery and the conniving of the Republican leadership in putting all these procedural obstructions in its path. If we want democratic government to survive into the next millenium. this is the time to start saying so today.",

Reasonable men and women of this Chamber. friends of mine who come to the floor and argue otherwise. they will argue that when unions or corporations contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money to the parties. that in fact that has no effect whatsoever on the policy that proceeds from this House. I do not believe that. but reasonable people can differ. What is clear. though. is that the fact that there is this question before us undermines public confidence in democracy. and the publics confidence in our institutions of democracy is too important. far too important to act in any way but to err on the side of prudence. Mr. Speaker. the standard for conduct in public office is not simply for public officials to avoid conflicts of interest. It is for us to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest. Clearly. indisputably. the current system creates at least the appearance of conflict of interest. conflicts of interest between what is in the best interest of the American people and what is in the interest of those who donate such large sums to the parties.

We know. those of us who proudly support ShaysMeehan. that we are about to pass a constitutional bill. But let me set forth some facts here. In the 19911992 election cycle. $86 million in soft money was raised and spent by both political parties. By 1996. that number had exploded to $260 million. In next years election cycle. it appears that may reach an unprecedented level of $500 to $750 million. This is a system out of control. This is an example of excess. Control is moving further and further away from people and more and more in the hands of special interests. Those are the facts. The same problem is developing with respect to the sham issue ads. The argument that we are having to debate here on the floor of the House of Representatives is whether people in this country who have special interests before Congress should have a right to anonymous political advertising. These groups on the right and left are so ashamed of their ads. they are unwilling to put their names on it. As a result. the voters are disenfranchised because they are misled. they are deceived. they do not know whose voice they are hearing that is telling them how to vote for a particular candidate.

I urge my colleagues to resist the poison pill amendments and pass the clean ShaysMeehan campaign finance reform bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. oil and gas pipeline accidents happen more often than we might think. Just within the past few weeks. two major pipeline spills have occurred. On February 5. an oil pipeline spilled approximately 70.000 gallons of crude oil into a lake in the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge near Philadelphia. The refuge incorporates the largest freshwater tidal marsh in the State and is habitat to two endangered species. On January 27. approximately 500.000 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline near Winchester. Kentucky. Officials are unsure how much of the oil will make its way into the Kentucky River. the main drinking water source for Lexington and other towns. Thankfully. neither of these spills were ignited. like the spill which occurred in my district last June. The accident in my district resulted in three deaths. millions of dollars in property damage. How many more spills do we need to have before we act to improve our system of pipeline safety? Recently. I introduced H.R. 3558. the Safe Pipelines Act of 2000. My bipartisan bill. which has been cosponsored by the entire Washington State House delegation. will enact much needed reforms to our Federal pipeline regulations. and will give the States a role in pipeline regulation. which they currently lack. Under my bill. pipelines will be required to be inspected both internally and with hydrostatic tests. Pipelines with a history of leaks will be specially targeted for more strenuous testing. All pipeline operators will be tested for qualifications and certified by the Department of Transportation. The results of pipeline tests and inspections will be made available to the public and a nationwide map of all pipeline locations will be placed on the Internet where every citizen can easily access it. All pipeline ruptures and spills of more than 40 gallons will be reported to the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety and States will be able to set up their own pipeline safety programs for interstate pipelines. provided that the States have the resources and expertise necessary to carry out the programs and that State standards are at least as stringent as Federal standards. In addition. the bill requires studies on a variety of technologies that may improve safety such as external leak detection systems and doublewalled pipelines. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this bipartisan legislation.",

What happens when that money is taken away from the seniors in the form of an earnings penalty. it is given back to them very slowly after their 70th birthday. so that their benefits actually increase a little bit in order for them to get some of that money back. And if they live long enough. they get it all back. But the problem with that is that the Government is using their money which they earned. which they are entitled to at the retirement age. which the Congress said is 65 and that is what they are entitled to. So it is wrong. even though they get it back over a long period of time. In the long run. it does not cost anything. In the short run. it does cost something and it is going to cost something. The money is there now. We have walled it off to save Social Security. We have walled it off in the lockbox. which I think most of the Members support. And it certainly passed the House of Representatives with good support from the Democrats as well. but a Republican idea in which we walled it off.

It goes to pay down the debt if it is not being used to reform Social Security or Medicare. It is money that has been paid in by workers for their retirement years. We quit spending it. The direct answer to the question of why was it not done before: in the old days. the Congress spent that money. They spent it as if it were unencumbered tax dollars. They spent it on all kind of problems. In fact. they spent even more than that. and that is what ran up the national debt. That is why we owe so much money. But things are changed around here. We are living within our means. We are paying down the national debt. We are reforming Social Security. We are not taking Americans pensions away. We are allowing the older American workers to keep what they have earned. Social security is an earned right of the American people. It is that simple. That is black letter law. And it is not for any Congress to take away any of that or compromise any of those benefits. It is a contract. a sacred contract. between the Government and the people of this country. the American workers. And this is what has to be preserved. You know what I was thinking when I was sitting here managing a portion of this bill today. I sort of felt the spirit of Claude Pepper coming into this area. A portion of my district down in MiamiDade County was in Claude Peppers. He would have been very proud of this Congress today and what we have been able to accomplish.

I would just say there is another provision that I hope we can move ahead with in terms of fairness. in terms of encouraging individuals to work. and. that is. to increase benefits for individuals that. at age 65. decide to delay taking those Social Security benefits. And so if they wait a year. they should end up with more benefits. It is called delayed retirement credit. A provision of this bill that would make an 8 percent increase in benefits for every year was an amendment that I hoped to incorporate in this bill someplace along. the line. I talked to the White House. the President has agreed to it. the Democrats and Republicans have agreed to it. The actuaries at the Social Security Administration have suggested that it does not cost money because actually it might save money encouraging individuals that want to delay taking Social Security to have an increased benefit later on. to make it actuarially sound. Another point that I think is important in this issue is that widows eventually would have the higher benefit when they become widows.

If you are going to live an average life span. then it is reasonable if you put off taking benefits and continue working. continuing paying the FICA tax to support Social Security. it ends up ultimately being somewhat of an advantage and so moving that 8 percent per year up until you are age 70 is a reasonable step to take.",

He saw the environment being ravaged. pollution rampant. and said we must do something about it. He led the way. He saw poverty and squalor and said someone has to do something about it.

Mr. Speaker. the Congress has lost a true giant of the 20th century last night with the sudden passing of the senior Senator from the State of Rhode Island. the Honorable JOHN CHAFEE. JOHN CHAFEES outstanding dedication to public service began half a century ago when he left Yale University to join the Marines after Pearl Harbor. He was a hero at Guadalcanal. and then he was recalled to active duty when the Korean War broke out and commanded a rifle company on the Korean peninsula during that bloody conflict. He was one of the few members of either chamber of Congress to be a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. This young attorney. JOHN CHAFEE. became active in Republican politics in his home State of Rhode Island. He was elected to Rhode Islands State legislature in 1956 as a young man of 34. He eventually served as the minority leader in that body and was elected in 1962 to the first of three successful 2year terms of governor of his State. Then in 1968. Presidentelect Richard Nixon appointed JOHN CHAFEE to be our Nations Secretary of the Navy. in which position he served meritoriously. Finally. in 1976. JOHN was elected to the first of four terms in our U.S. Senate. In that position. he served his State and Nation in an admirable manner. He was chairman of the Senates environment and public works committee. In that position. he was a constant reminder to all of us in both bodies of the need to protect the ecology of our planet. Much of the farreaching environmental legislation in the last quarter century bears his fingerprints. JOHN CHAFEE is one of the cofounders of the Theodore Roosevelt Fund. which helped remind his fellow Republicans that the most conservationminded of all Presidents. Theodore Roosevelt. was a member of the Grand Old Party: JOHN CHAFEE. having previously announced his plans to retire in the year 2000. we knew we would be soon missing his outstanding leadership. I join with my colleagues in extending our condolences and prayers to JOHNS widow. Virginia. to his family. and to the many who admire JOHN CHAFEES service to our Nation.",

He is a man who believed in what Shakespeare said. \"To nature none more bound.\" He believed in the legacy that we must leave our offspring with regard to nature. I must say I feel like somebody who is bound to JOHN CHAFEE. He was to me a role model. And I do not even think he knew that. But I looked to him as a man who. as has been mentioned. was bipartisan. who was a man of integrity. a man of coalition building. and a man who exemplified great common sense. He cared about the people that he represented in Rhode Island. He cared about the people of the United States. He cared about the vulnerable people. the children. those who needed health care. And he cared about the environment which. if endangered and if violated. might not be restored. So we have heard of the great tributes to him in terms of what he did achieve. But. for me. he was a man that I felt would take legislation and carefully craft it. carefully work with it so it came out as something that we could all agree on. He is a man who exemplified. I think. the roughrider instinct of Theodore Roosevelt. Because he really was a tough rider. He had some difficult skirmishes that he had to contend and transcended all of it. So to the family of Senator JOHN CHAFEE. our condolences. He will live on in love. To all of our colleagues. those from Rhode Island. those from all parts of the country. we will all miss him very deeply. My hope is and my belief is that his inspiration will live on. And so. although he will be lost. he will be with us always. So I thank so much the gentleman from Rhode Island for his great tribute to the man that we all loved.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Congress has lost a true giant of the 20th Century last night with the sudden passing of the Senior Senator from the State of Rhode Island. the Honorable JOHN H. CHAFEE. JOHN CHAFEES outstanding dedication to public service began over a half a century ago when he left Yale University to join the Marine Corps after Pearl Harbor. A hero of Guadalcanal. JOHN CHAFEE was recalled to active duty when the Korean War broke out and commanded a rifle company on the Korean peninsula during that bloody conflict. Accordingly. he was one of the few Members of either Chamber of Congress to be a veteran of both World War II and Korea. As a young attorney. JOHN CHAFEE became active in Republican politics in his home state of Rhode Island. He was elected to Rhode Islands state legislature in 1956 as a young man of 34. He eventually served as the Minority Leader in that body. and was elected in 1962 to the first of three successful two year terms as Governor of his state. In 1968. Presidentelect Nixon appointed JOHN CHAFEE to be our nations Secretary of the Navy in which position he served meritoriously. Finally. in 1976. JOHN was elected to the first of four terms in the U.S. Senate. In that position. he served his state and nation admirably. He was Chairman of the Senates Environment and Public Works Committee. In that position. he was a constant reminder to all of us of the need to protect the ecology of our planet. and much of the farreaching environmental legislation of the last quarter century bears his fingerprints. JOHN CHAFEE was one of the cofounders of the Theodore Roosevelt Fund. which helped remind his fellow Republicans that the most conservationminded of all PresidentsTheodore Rooseveltwas a member of the Grand Old Party. JOHN CHAFEE. having previously announced his plans to retire in the year 2000. we knew we would be missing his outstanding leadership. I join with my colleagues in extending our condolences and prayers to JOHNS widow Virginia and to his family and the many who admired JOHN CHAFEES service to his nation.",

He clearly distinguished the legislative branch of government with service that was bipartisan. common sense. moderate. centrist. and simply was a personal example of integrity and honesty and courage. the like of which some suggest we have too little of around here at this time. In any event. he set the bar very high and it would do well for all of us as we mourn his passing to reflect carefully on his example and embrace it in our own lives to the extent we can. Again. that would be a tall order. Senator CHAFEE in my last visit with him was leading a bipartisan discussion on how we might somehow form a breakthrough in a knotty health policy issue that had divided the parties. divided the Chambers. It was just one example I got to see up close and personal the kind of bipartisan. nonideological. letussolvetheproblem leadership that Senator CHAFEE brought to his work. and clearly the work of the legislative branch was distinguished as a result of his efforts. Tonight. I am leading a special order about Social Security. In the course of our discussion. I want to provide background about the nature of the program. I also want to discuss the debate that is waging at the moment relative to the budget discussions between the two political parties. and I want to focus on really the missing element of what has captured much of the present discussion. and that is the steps we must take to preserve the solvency of the program. to make certain that it is there not just for us but for our children and our grandchildren as well. As will be the course in the course of this hour. as commonly happens during these special orders. I have invited several Members of the Democratic Caucus to join me on the floor this evening. and while many will no longer be available in light of the hour.

First. the openmindedness to participate in any kind of bipartisan plan they might move forward that is talking about actually lengthening the life of the trust fund. The President has advanced a plan that lengthens the life of the trust fund. I think we craft the Presidents longterm plan on the majoritys shortterm funding plan to get us through this year. You could have the beginnings of a bipartisan deal that ultimately is absolutely true to Social Security because it does something about the length of the trust fund. Your comments are just so critically important in terms of establishing a benchmark by which the public can really evaluate whether anything is going on with Social Security that means anything or not. The test is does it lengthen the solvency of the program? Does it preserve the life of the trust fund? And that really is the core of the issues you very well outlined.

I think that what this resolution really gets at is. first of all. proclaiming that what is going on over there is not okay. Mr. Speaker. it is interesting to me that the Chechen foreign minister came out in todays press conference. actually in Prague with Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. and his words were these: \"Moscow is creating a Chechnya. basically around a zone of total destruction in which everything that moves is doomed to death.\" My colleague from New Jersey made comments that pointed out Mr. Brzezinskis comments. that so far. the Clinton administration has been callously passive to this zone of death that is being talked about over in Prague just a few hours ago. What I think is interesting is that this same administration said that what is going on in Kosovo is absolutely unacceptable based on world standards today. and. therefore. we have to do something about it. They led the effort toward $15 billion of taxpayer money being spent over there to do something about it. they led the effort in aircraft carriers and submarines and jets going over there to do something about it. Yet. in this episode. they are very. very quiet. There is just a huge inconsistency there. I think that this resolution gets at that inconsistency. The other thing that this resolution gets at is the fact that with these civilian atrocities. I think that there is breach of the Helsinki agreement. there is breach of the Geneva Convention. there is breach of a number of different international standards that Russia has signed on to. and the result of the signing of those agreements is that it is then permissible for them to get U.S. taxpayer funding indirectly through the IMF. I think the answer has to be a very strong no. As we may remember. last year Russia received $4.5 billion through the IMF. and indirectly. that means Americans are helping to finance these atrocities. So I think there is a giant inconsistency here. The issue needs to be raised. This resolution does so. I thank the chairman for both granting me the time and for leading the efforts on this.",

There is an enormous difference between Kosovo and Chechnya: and the difference between Kosovo and Chechnya is not the difference in the suffering of the innocent civilians. but in the obvious fact that Russia today has a vast reservoir of nuclear weapons. it is still a nuclear superpower. It would be utterly irresponsible on the part of our government not to recognize this difference. We simply cannot ignore or pretend that we are unaware of military realities. We have taken on the regime of Milosevic because this was a dictatorship of most limited military capabilities. No one in his right mind would advocate engaging in military action against a nuclearequipped Russia. What we have to do is what we are doing here and what our administration is doing: denouncing the uncivilized actions of the Russian military. calling for a ceasefire: calling for the Russians to accept Western assistance so that the longsuffering people of Chechnya will be able to get through this winter. We did not start the war in Chechnya. neither did Congress nor this administration.

With respect to Russia. we have a tremendous range of issues on the plate. most importantly the presence of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in Russian possession. It would be utterly irresponsible for our government not to be cognizant of this fact in taking positions on the matter of Chechnya. If my friend will look at the statements of the appropriate officials of our Department of State and the White House on this issue. he will find to his satisfaction that the Chechen outrages have been denounced by our government as they should have been: but at the same time. a different policy is called for visavis Serbia and visavis Russia.",

Therefore. we must increase funding for the research necessary to end this terrible disease. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Environment of the Committee on Commerce and a member of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus. I am committed to achieving that goal. I have endorsed. along with so many others. a proposal to double Federal funding for the National Institutes of Health over 5 years. The budget agreement passed by Congress last year made a sizeable downpayment toward that goal by providing a 15 percent increase in funding for the NIH. I am hopeful that we can continue that promising trend this year. I have heard from many constituents about the lack of sufficient funding for diabetes research. I had the opportunity to share these concerns directly with Dr. Harold Varmus. the NIH Director. in a meeting in my office earlier this year. I was also pleased to secure enactment of new preventative health benefits under Medicare as part of the 1997 balanced budget law. Under these provisions. which were based on legislation which I helped to author. Medicare beneficiaries who are diabetic are reimbursed for outpatient selfmanaging training and supplies. such as blood testing strips.

I represent the 15th Congressional District of Texas. comprised of south Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. With the help of Dr. Maria C. Alen of the Texas Diabetes Council. I am well informed on this issue. as all of my colleagues who have spoken before me. For us. we know all too well the need to find a cure for this lifethreatening disease. It is staggering to realize that nearly 75.000 individuals of the Rio Grande Valley suffer from diabetes. More troubling. it is estimated that over 40 percent of diabetes in Texas are Hispanic. The cost to the Nation is staggering. estimated at $105 billion each year. More than one out of every 10 health care dollars in the United States and about 1 out of every Medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care. The number of Americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years. I believe we can find a cure for diabetes in our lifetime if Congress is willing to provide the necessary funds for the research. By adequately funding the fight. we will continue to make headway in stamping out diabetes once and for all. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to express their support and vote to increase funding to combat diabetes.",

IDEA has brought hope to young persons with disabilities that they too can learn. and that their learning will enable them to become independent and productive citizens and live fulfilling lives. For millions of children with disabilities. IDEA has meant the difference between dependence and independence. between lost potential and productive careers. In 1975. 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers received services. and 1 million children with disabilities were excluded from public school. Now. IDEA serves 5.4 million children with disabilities from birth through age 21. Every state in the nation offers public education and early intervention services for children with disabilities. Today. fewer than 6.000 disabled children are living in institutional settings away from their families. compared to 95.000 children in 1969. We are keeping families together. and reducing the cost to the taxpayers of paying for institutional care. which averages $50.00 a child each year. The number of disabled students completing high school with a diploma or certificates has increased by 10% in the last decade. The number of students with disabilities entering higher education has more than tripled since the implementation of IDEA. Most important. 57% of disabled youth are competitively employed within five years of leaving school today. compared to an employment rate of only 25% for disabled adults who have not benefited from IDEA. These accomplishments do not come without financial costs. It is time for Congress to meet its commitment to help schools provide the services and support that give children with special needs the educational opportunities to pursue their dreams.

I think it is well known that the Governor did not sign a real patients bill of rights. In fact. the one that is now being emulated here in this Congress which has been cited as a Texas bill really was passed without his signature. It came to his desk. and we have a procedure in the State of Texas where if you do not sign it. it becomes law. So in actuality. there are Members in this body. the gentleman from Texas for one and other Members who are not in this body who are now still State legislators who were the moving forces behind the patients bill of rights. But it was never signed by the Governor. And so even as we argued in committee. in the Committee on the Judiciary. in the Committee on Commerce about the patients bill of rights and we cited the Texas bill. it is a Texas bill but it was never signed. One of the reasons that it was not signed. and I cannot read the minds of the leadership at that time of our State. the Governor but certainly there was some argument about special interests who were still opposing it because it did give the right of the aggrieved person. the person who lost a loved one. the right to sue. I just want to say something about that because you do not hear anyone raising their voices about that other than those who are continually denying service. because everyone knows patient and physician. no one who is dealing with health care and the life or death of a loved one is eager to rush to the courtroom. What they are eager to do is rush to the recovery room. because they want their loved one. they want to be well. they want their child to be well. they are not interested in playing out health care in the courtroom.

I think it should be made very clear that the last Patients Bill of Rights. which is in fact almost a replica of what we have in the House for which we have bipartisan support. which was under legislative Democratic leadership in Texas. was a bill he could not bring himself to sign. And rather than fight it by a veto again. realizing that he could not get a sustained veto. he let it languish and it went into law. So this refrain of working with Democrats and Republicans on health care is somewhat. I might say. hypocritical. and the gentleman from Arkansas has hit the nail on the head. I would simply say that a good thing he might be able to do in this time frame is to call this leadership here and ask them to move forward on the Patients Bill of Rights. I yield back to the gentleman.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I think the gentlewoman from Texas makes a very good point. It is time that the Republican leadership in the Congress realizes what the American people want and do something about it. It is past time. Our seniors cannot afford to wait another day for prescription drug coverage. for our hospitals to get the money that they need. and for a Patients Bill of Rights to be passed so that we have the ability for our doctors and patients to make the health care decisions that they are involved in. so that we can hold the insurance companies accountable in the event that they do cause some serious damage or injury to our loved ones. It is unbelievable to me that one more Congress has already just about expired and nothing has happened. I continue to be amazed at this rhetoric that the Republicans put out every day: oh. we are for Patients Bill of Rights. We are for prescription drug benefits for our senior citizens. We are for that 100 percent. The fact is they have been in control of this Congress since 1995 and have done absolutely nothing to move these issues forward. As the gentleman from New Jersey explained a few minutes ago. we have done discharge petitions. We have done everything that we have. every tool that we have available to us has been used by the Democrats to try to get prescription drug coverage and a Patients Bill of Rights and to change the Balanced Budget Act so that our health care providers. particularly in rural America. can stay in business. and yet nothing has happened. This is an abomination for this Congress to be this close to adjournment and still nothing has happened. I yield to the gentleman from Maine.",

We have been doing a lot of surveys and different studies across the country. and then in particular within our districts. by the governmental operations staff to look at the different costs of what it costs in the United States for medicine. what it costs in Canada and what it costs in Mexico. Just recently we have also looked at another study which has been done through the State of Florida. and looked at the prescription drug coverage for Florida seniors. I found it very interesting. which just tells me this issue is getting more difficult because we are getting more seniors who are losing their coverage. and probably a lot because of the pullouts of our HMOmanaged care. managedchoice program. The survey collected during 1999 showed that 41 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries surveyed in Florida reported now that they had no prescription drug coverage. and in 1998 it was 29 percent of surveyed Florida seniors that reported that they did not have. So just 1 year later. we have already seen an increase to 41 percent. That is almost 50 percent of the population of seniors in the State of Florida. It would seem to me. and what I am most saddened about is. that we leave the 106th Congress after debating. after recognizing the problem. still with no prescription drug benefit. no relief in sight. and for why not. I do not have the answer. and I do not know what to tell them at home. It is because they would not have accepted the bill that was passed on this House. They understand that to depend on the very same people who have left them out with managed care and insurance companies. it is unacceptable.",

Blough retired from his family practice in Ohios 5th Congressional District after nearly five decades of distinguished service. Dr. Blough joined the U.S. Air Force following high school. It was while stationed in China that he decided to become a doctor. A bomb blast occurred costing many lives with countless injured. The terrible incident inspired him to spend the rest of his life helping people. Dr. Blough has combined his sound medical skills with his compassionate. personal. and dedicated approach to the practice of medicine for nearly 47 years. One of his patients remarked on his dedication by stating. \"Dr. Blough was on call seven days a week. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. Hes touched the life of everybody in this community for miles around. either themselves or their family member.\" His medical career alone distinguishes him as a most valued citizen. but Dr. Blough has contributed so much more. Dr. Blough has worn many hats throughout his life. Previously. he piloted his own private plane traveling from coast to coast on vacations. He also served as an examiner for the Federal Aviation Administration and as manager for Deshler Airport. The doctor recently retired from 35 years of service as the oncall doctor for Oak Grove Nursing Home. And Dr. Blough will retire soon as coroner of Henry County when his term expires at the end of the year. Dr. Bloughs dedication to his community is second only to his great love for his family. Along with Celia. his loving wife of more than 55 years. he is blessed with three children. Mr. Speaker. I have known of Dr. Bloughs dedication and service that has earned him the highest regard for his character and abilities as a physician. At this time. I would ask my colleagues of the 106th Congress to join me in paying special tribute to Dr. Robert J. Blough. His professionalism and service to his community is an example for all citizens of Ohio and across the country. We thank him. and wish him and his wife.

Wayne Owens. now president of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation. who has taken a leading role in advocating the increased use of desalination plants in order to increase the inadequate water supplies in that region. Entitled. \"Not a Drop to Drink\". the article goes on to make a significant case for desalination. Accordingly. I recommend this article to our colleagues. and commend Wayne Owens for his ongoing efforts to improve the lives of all peoples in the region through economic development projects.

Senators can expect two backtoback votes to begin at approximately 10:30 a.m. It is hoped that further progress can be made on the appropriations process during todays session. and therefore votes can be anticipated throughout the day.

    "speech": "The first paragraph states: In the great tradition of prairie populism. Sen. Paul Wellstone has responded to the current farm [crisis] by calling for a federal moratorium on big agribusiness mergers. As a cry of alarm for farmers. this is useful politics. But as a device to restore commodity prices. it is practically pointless. and as a tool of antitrust policy. it is [an] exceedingly blunt [instrument]. I join with this editorial in saying that Senator WELLSTONES motives are good. but his means are just simply misdirected in this case. Ultimately. no matter the good intentions of those who are behind this amendment. it is the family farmers who will pay the greatest price for hobbling the innovation and competitiveness of small- and mediumsized agribusinesses in such a sweeping way. The consequences of the Wellstone amendment run contrary to the stated objectives of its supporters. It will not spur new competition in the large agribusiness sector. It will not induce higher commodity prices for producers. It would be a vote of no confidence in the ability of the antitrust division to enforce our existing antitrust statutes. So I plead with my colleagues. if they can hear my voice. I ask them to vote no on the Wellstone amendment. This is not the way to help the family farmer. We should trust the marketplace. unless we as a government are prepared to subsidize even more and more aspects of our agriculture in this country. We already do a great deal. We may yet need to do more. But we must not do more in this way. in this Senate. in this time. I yield the floor.",

The amendment simply requires that unspent office funds be used for deficit or debt reduction.

In 1995. a similar amendment was approved on the House floor by an overwhelming margin of 403 to 21. In 1996 and 1997. it was accepted on the floor by the committee chairman. Last year the committee brought the bill to the House floor with this provision already incorporated into the bill. Mr. Chairman. I believe that this amendment will ensure Members of Congress can demonstrate their personal commitment to a balanced budget. This amendment requires any unspent office funds at the end of the year be used for debt. or if a deficit exists. for deficit reduction. It also requires that specific amounts returned by each office be printed annually in been an incentive for Members to do the best they can with taxpayers dollars. to be innovative. just as the private sector continues to be.

Mr. Chairman. our national debt now stands at more than 5.6 trillion dollars. The interest payments on this debt are the governments second highest budget expenditure. One of the best things we can do for our country right now is pay off our debts.

I honestly believe. as the gentleman from Arizona has said. the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is a very fairminded and balanced person. I think that if the committee had been allowed to work out on a bipartisan basis where these cuts were made. we could have come up with a far more equitable distribution than the one that is before us tonight. I would also say that I think the leadership on both sides has an obligation to treat rank and file Members the way they would like to be treated themselves. That has not happened in the way these cuts have been laid out tonight. I would make one other point. If we compare the salaries that are paid to staff persons for rank and file Members of the House versus salaries paid to persons with those same responsibilities in the Senate. Members will see that on average the Senate pays people for those same salaries about 20 percent more for a legislative director or a legislative assistant and for other positions of high responsibility. I think there are severe implications to that differential that do not adequately represent the interests of this body. and I would urge that when these actions are taken. that we remember the context in which they are taken.

Lambertville first grew to prominence as a key stop along the Old York Road. the main route from Philadelphia to New York. in the early 1700s. At the beginning of the 19th century. the building of the Delaware and Raritan Canal helped the town become a leading industrial center for manufacturing. Railroads began to take on much of the canal traffic in the late 1800s. and Lambertville retained its importance as a trade center by serving as the headquarters of the PennsylvaniaBelvidere Railroad. By the turn of the century. more than 3000 factory workers produced such items as wooden wagon wheels. rubber boots. railway cars. bottled beer. and ceramic white ware within the towns borders. Although Lambertvilles factories and mills are closed today. the town continues to thrive. The historic downtown district offers art galleries. antique shops. and a variety of wonderful restaurants. Lambertville retains a colonial charm. with Victorian. Colonial. and Federal styled buildings housing its 4.000 residents. The annual Shad festival in April. a twoday event that marks the arrival of spring and the run of the shad fish upstream to the Delaware River. salutes ongoing efforts to revitalize and maintain the quality of our water. Lambertvilles celebrations of its anniversary will be taking place throughout the summer. In the spring. a documentary on the town will be released. Lambertville. New Jersey represents the best of small town life. As we look for ways to control development and to create livable communities. Lambertville offers a vibrant. positive example.

If you think it is the right thing to do to vote for this amendment. if you think it is the right thing to do to say to China: We already have these trade agreements with you in regard to prison labor conditions and we are just asking you to live up to those agreements before. in fact. we finally go forward with PNTRif you think this is an important human rights issue. if you think we should not be implicated in any way. shape. or form in the functional equivalent of these gulags. if you think this is a labor issue. if you think this is a trade issueit is a very compelling issuethen please dont vote against what you think is right. We cant have Senators being selective on this and voting one way on one amendment. Senators can say: We will not vote for any amendments. period. I have heard that. But now different people are voting for some amendments and not others. I say to my colleagues: Vote for what you think is right. If you think this amendment I have offered is wrong. it is not the right thing to do based upon your sense of justice or right or anything else. then vote against it. Otherwise. please vote for this amendment. Dont make the argument that I am voting against all amendments when. in fact. Senators are obviously going to be voting for some amendments.

He ought to recall that the Senate has already rejected three or four amendments for the same reason. and that is. we want to send a clean bill to the President. The idea that his is being rejected because of certain things is just not the case. There is a notion here that this bill ought to be sent. right or wrong. I happen to think that he is exactly right. There is also the implication that if you do not agree with this amendment. you do not care about these things. That is not true. either. We do separate things. There are seven or eight bills now in place. The Senator says we are not going to tie the Presidents hands and then on the other hand says this is going to force the President to do something. We need to get it clear. I wanted to make the point that there is no evidence that people do not care about these things. They do. indeed. There is a belief that these issues ought to be separated and we ought to deal with PNTR and then deal with the other issue.

Much is at stake here. the effects of this vote may be felt for years to come. I am convinced that amendments at this stage create a procedural problem that could derail passage of this important bill. Adopting any amendments would mean sending this bill to conference. where it could become mired in wrangling over differences of language and content. It is clear to me that we do not have time remaining in this Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. We can allow nothing to interfere with what may be this Congresss most important decision concerning China. I am convinced we must not let our focus be drawn away from the real point in question: pure and simple. this vote is about deciding whether or not the United States wishes to join with the world community in having normal trade relations with China. and whether we are prepared to conduct our dealings with China according to the terms and conditions established by that community under the World Trade Organization framework (WTO). This vote is about protecting U.S. interests in an increasingly competitive global marketplace and about ensuring that American workers. managers. entrepreneurs. and investors do not miss out on the opportunities that are bound to grow as China brings itself further into the modern world. I do not think we further U.S. interests by undermining this nations ability to function effectively in the worlds most important multinational trade organization. or by cutting Americans off from the full benefits of WTO membership. This is what will happen if we pass a bill that does not conform to WTO requirements. or if we are forced to send the bill to conference. and fail to pass a bill. at all. I believe it is in Americas best interests that this body pass a clean. focused bill establishing permanent normal trade relations with China that is the same as the House bill and does not need conferencing.",

However. we want you to know that you are in our thoughts and prayers. Zachary Fisher was truly a remarkable man. who loved life and served as an inspiration to many.

There are so many examples. and although Zach was never looking for the credit or even a pat on the back. we all know the truth.

I would like to take a moment to speak of the man himself. To quote someone wiser than I. \"This was a spacious man who carried a kind of innocence that had no tincture of naivete in it.\" There was nothing narrow or confined. or confining. about Zachary. Horatio Alger could not have written a more dramatic. unbelievable story of a bricklayer who became an immensely successful businessman. who then effectively retired to start an entirely new career in the gracious and generous service of his country. for which he won the Medal of Freedom. our nations highest civilian award. But in the spaciousness of his character we should also remember that he was for his brother. Larry. his best and dearest friend. For us. his nieces and nephews. he was our dearest. kindest. gentlest. beloved uncle. What we need to understand about this mans character and vision was that while it played out on the immense stage of our countrywhether through the Intrepid. The Fisher Houses and the Alzheimers Foundation. to name just a fewit continued without abatement to play out within our family with equal energy and grace. The public praise of this extraordinary human being you already know and will hear again. Know how well deserved it is. But that other dimension of this manour brother. our husband. our uncleis equally monumental. because when he moved onto that much bigger stage. he will still retained his delightful innocence. his vision and his pride in and for our family.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.J. Res. 46 which honors Zachary Fisher as an honorary veteran. His lifetime support of our military and veterans clearly justifies naming him as an honorary veteran. When the United States entered World War II in 1941. Mr. Fisher was told he could not serve in the Armed Forces due to a serious knee injury sustained in a construction accident. Determined to do his part. Mr. Fisher used his expertise in construction to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers build coastal fortifications. His dedication to the Armed Services continued after the war. Over many decades. he lent his full support to the U.S. military and their families. Mr. Fisher established the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Armed Services Foundation to serve as a support agency for both military personnel and their families affected by servicerelated accidents. To date. hundreds of families from all branches of the armed services have benefited from this foundations support. In addition. the Fisher Armed Services Foundation provides educational scholarship funds to Armed Services personnel and their families. Since 1987. more than 700 students have received scholarships of between $500 and $2.500. allowing them to pursue education opportunities which otherwise would not have been possible. Moreover. in 1990. Mr. Fisher established the Fisher House Program. Under this program he dedicated more than $15 million for the construction of temporary homes for the families of military personnel receiving care at major military treatment facilities and VA Medical Centers. The houses provide support for families as they serve as a \"home away from home.\" One of these houses is located in my district at Fort Bliss. The presence of a Fisher House in El Paso. and throughout military bases around the country. help ease the minds of Americas finest and their families during times of illness. Mr. Fisher. as exemplified by these philanthropic efforts on behalf of our Nations veterans and military. established himself as one of our most dedicated patriots. Through these charitable acts. and numerous others in various civic and community efforts. he set a tremendous example for all Americans to follow. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to honor Zachary Fisher by unanimously supporting H.J. Res. 46.",

I was compelled to lend my voice to this for the consternation that I have personally experienced by some of the intimidating tactics that may have resulted from investigations that were occurring in the United States Congress. because this Nation is a blessed nation because of the richness of diversity. but particularly because of the enormous mosaicness of the Asian community from the far reaches of California and Oregon to the far reaches of New York. but particularly in my great State of Texas. We are enriched by the participation of so many Asians who have contributed to this Nation both in terms of their bravery and serving in our various wars. the Korean War. World War II. as well as the various other altercations that we have had on behalf of freedom. and most recently the Vietnam War and. of course. our conflicts in Bosnia and the Kosovo conflict. I want to thank the gentlemen for this resolution. for I would want no one to feel that they are any less an American. Anytime Americans are stereotyped. it is the lowest rung of our ladder. But anytime we work together as one human race. we are climbing to the highest rung of the ladder. I salute the many Asians that I have had the great pleasure of working with in the City of Houston. in the State of Texas. and I would offer to say to them that they stand equal under the sun to all of us and we are better off because of what they have given to this Nation. This resolution is an appropriate one because it makes a statement that there will be no intimidation. no stereotyping. and no rejection of any group of people. I applaud my colleagues and I congratulate them and this resolution should be passed and joined by our colleagues so that all of us can stand as equal citizens welcoming our participation in the political process for a great democracy.

The last one clarifies a long existing ambiguity regarding the application of Section 2 of the Sherman Act to the District of Columbia and the territories. The committee has informally consulted the antitrust enforcement agencies. the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission. and the agencies have indicated they do not object to any of these changes. In response to written questions following the committees November 5. 1997. oversight hearing on the antitrust enforcement agencies. the Department of Justice recommended two of the repeals and the clarification contained in this bill. The other repeal was recommended to the committee by House Legislative Counsel. In addition. the Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association supports the bill. Mr. Speaker. I include their comments for the RECORD at this point.",

However. the Federal Government has consistently fallen far short of this goal. As a result. special education costs continue to rise. and we fall further behind. Currently we fund less than 12 percent of the cost. leaving State and local governments to pick up the rest. Mr. Speaker. this resolution demonstrates Congress commitment to stand behind our promise. It shows that we recognize the impact that special education costs are having on our State and local budgets and that we are committed to providing leadership and resources for our schools and their students. Let me give my colleagues just one example of a city in Maine. Lewiston schools currently receive about $233.000 in special education funding. If we were meeting our 40 percent commitment currently. Lewiston schools would be receiving nearly $1.2 million. a difference of $1 million. Imagine the impact that freeing up $1 million for other educational needs could have on the education of all of Lewistons young people. and then multiply that across every school and every district in the State of Maine. in every school district in the country. As I traveled throughout my district. this is probably the concern I hear most frequently: School budgets are rising and taking property tax rates with them. I am often told that schools have to cut art and music programs. eliminate field trips and cancel extracurricula. I know that this situation is the same throughout the country",

In New Jersey alone there are over 210.000 students in special education programs. According to our Governor. if the Federal Government paid its full 40 percent share last year. the State would have received an additional $300 million to pay for these childrens education. Our States are paying too great of an amount of our governments legal obligation to IDEA with money that otherwise could be spent to hire additional teachers. expand or maintain school facilities. pay for athletics or extracurricular activities.

As most of my colleagues know. federal funding for IDEA has never risen above 12 percent. On average. local school districts currently spend 20 percent of their budgets on special education services. Once the Federal government begins to pay its fair share. local funds will be freed up. allowing local schools to hire and train additional highquality teachers. reduce class size. build and renovate classrooms and invest in technology. In my district. the Duval County School Distnct receives about $7 million. If IDEA were fully funded. this school district would receive over $37 million. an increase of over $30 million.

Throughout the country people will be able to download tax forms. read up on the status of legislation. better understand the Social Security system. But Mr. President. meaningful access to all of the important information depends on what side of the Digital Divide you find yourself. To benefit from websites like firstgov. you must have a computer and understand how to use it. and you must have an Internet connection with speeds fast enough to search databases. view graphics and download documents. As the demand for high speed Internet access grows. numerous companies are responding in areas of dense population. While urban America is quickly gaining high speed access. rural America is being left behind. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological capability is essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of fairness. but it is also an issue of economic survival. To remedy the information gap between urban and rural America. I along with Senator DASCHLE introduced S. 2307. the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act. which gives new authority to the Rural Utilities Service to make low interest loans to companies that are deploying broadband technology to rural America. The Rural Utilities Service has helped before. it can help again. When we were faced with electrifying all of the country. we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When telephone service was only being provided to wellpopulated communities. we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the Rural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. The equitable deployment of broadband services is only the next step in keeping American connected. and our legislation would ensure that. If we fail to act. rural America will be left behind once again. As the economy moves further and further towards online transactions and communications. rural America must be able to participate. They must be able to start their own online business if they so desire and access information about government services efficiently. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to address this problem and to bring meaningful data access to all parts of this country.",

Wellpinit Implemented an innovative program that includes increasing student access to computers and improving students use of the internet and intranet. Wellpinit reconfigured its curriculum. integrating it with a computer program that allows students from both elementary and secondary grades to access an individualized instructional program for any core subject. The computerized curriculum has been highly effective in increasing national test scores. In fact. Wellpinit was named the highest achieving Indian Reservation school based on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Wellpinit has also been selected as one of Americas Top 100 Wired Schools by the editors of Family PC Magazine. Earlier this year. I awarded Quillayute Valley School District one of my -Innovation in Education\" Awards for developing the Washington Virtual Classroom Consortium (WVCC). which links rural schools together via the Internet in order to pool resources and expand learning opportunities for students and staff. Wellpinit has joined the WVCC to further enhance the educational opportunities for all students. Superintendent Reid Reidlinger told me. \"Wellpinit has been a model for other schools.

He is a remarkable scientist. an international authority on radioactive waste management. and the Senior Fellow at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. New Mexico. After his distinguished career. he is retiring in October. His outstanding abilities have been crucial to the success of the worlds first deep geologic repository for radioactive waste. It is highly appropriate that we recognize his contributions to that project and to the nation. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico began receiving defenseprogram radioactive wastes in 1999. The process that led to its opening was long and difficult. requiring the solution of innumerable technical and social problems. Although many people contributed to the solution of those problems. Dr. Wearts role was paramount throughout. He led Sandias technical support for the project from its beginnings in the early 1970s. In the early years his efforts were essential to the exploratory investigations and the final selection of the repository site. He then led the project through the conceptual design of the repository. through the formulation and implementation of the investigations that demonstrated the sites suitability. and through the arduous process of obtaining regulatory approvals. The rigorous scientific basis finally achieved for the repository was due in no small part to Dr. Wearts own scientific expertise and to his unmatched leadership. At least as important as these highly technical contributions was Dr. Wearts ability to instill confidence among the scientific community and the public. His skill in explaining complex issues. his truthfulness in all controversies. and his tireless patience in dealing with questions and frustrations for more than twentyfive yearsall were indispensable contributions to the project. Without the trust Dr. Weart engendered. the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. though scientifically well grounded. might still have failed to obtain scientific. regulatory. and social approval. The permanent disposal of radioactive wastes has proved intractable in many countries. Thanks largely to Wendell Weart. the United States now has an operating repository.

I think it is well known that we are looking for a way to get a vote on the important issue of proliferation. It should not be considered to be a trade issue. It is an issue separate and apart. Many of us believe it is extremely timely because of the trade issue. and that while we need to extend our trade relationship with China. at the same time. we need to demonstrate to them and to the world that they must do something to improve their habits in terms of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Every day. we see in some media outlet a further indication that the Chinese are intent upon continuing their proliferation habits. as long as we support Taiwan and as long as we perceive a national defense system. I hope the objection is not based upon the desire by the Democratic leader to prevent a vote from happening on the issue of Chinas proliferation. Just as the majority leader and the Democratic leader have been working together. so have the staffs been working together across the aisle to try to bridge some of the differences on this bill. We have made changes to the bill to accommodate some of the concerns. This bill will not affect agriculture. this bill will not affect business. except in those narrow circumstances when a business may be dealing directly with a known and determined foreign proliferator. At that point. it is not too high a price to ask our American businesses not to deal with those kinds of companies. That is what this is about.

Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This amendment. which was offered by my colleague. the Senior Senator from Hawaii. Mr. INOUYE. and myself will provide emergency relief to the Hawaii sugarcane industry. Since 1990. the Hawaii sugarcane industry has experienced a dramatic decline in its sugar production. from 55 sugarcane farms operating on approximately 162.000 acres to three sugarcane farms operating on 60.000 acres. Compared to other sugarcane growers in the United States. Hawaii growers are at a disadvantage due to higher transportation costs incurred in shipping raw sugar to California for refining. In addition. Hawaii growers are precluded from participating in certain relief provisions of the 1996 Farm bill. such as the United States Department of Agricultures sugar loan program. which are available to other U.S. sugar growers. Hawaii sugar growers have demonstrated a strong commitment to remain in sugar production. They continue to be on the forefront of sugarcane production and are working to diversify its capabilities by venturing into other agricultural commodities such as fiberboard products. energy products. seed corn. and low caloric sweeteners. Without emergency funds to help Hawaiis sugar industry compensate for extraordinary low prices and high transportation costs. this distressed sector of Hawaiis agricultural industry will cease to exist. This amendment will designate $7.2 million as emergency funding for a grant from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the State of Hawaii. It will provide the necessary relief to this distressed sector of Hawaiis agriculture industry. This provision will provide compensation for extraordinary low prices and high transportation costs incurred by this industry. Again.

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week the Senate passed the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 which included an amendment I sponsored to outlaw the resale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition. including .50 caliber ammunition. to civilians. This amendment requires the Department of Defense to ensure that military surplus armorpiercing ammunition is not sold or transferred to anyone except foreign militaries or law enforcement or other government agencies. Armor piercing ammunition is extremely lethal and is powerful enough to pierce an armored limousine or helicopter. It has no legitimate civilian use. Last year. Congress approved legislation which instituted a oneyear restriction on the civilian sale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition. the amendment approved by the Senate last week would put that temporary restriction into permanent law. Before the oneyear restriction was enacted. under the Conventional Demilitarization Program. a contractor working with the Department of Defense was paid $1 per ton to take possession of its excess armorpiercing ammunition. which it was free to refurbish and resell to the general public. The Department of Defense should not be a party to making this extraordinarily destructive ammunition available to the general public. Once available on the market. this powerful ammunition is subject to virtually no restriction. making it easier for someone to purchase armor piercing ammunition capable of piercing an armored car. than it is to buy a handgun. These loose restrictions make armor piercing ammunition highly popular among terrorists. drug traffickers and violent criminals. An investigation by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that armor piercing .50 caliber ammunition is \"among the most destructive and powerful ammunition available in the United States\" and the \"widespread availability\" of the bullets \"poses a threat to public safety.\" In the year ending in March. 1999. more than 113.000 rounds of military surplus armor piercing .50 caliber ammunition were sold in the United States. The amendment to prohibit the resale of military surplus armor piercing ammunition is a small but important step in keeping our streets safe.",

Tuskegee University of Alabama and Alcorn State of Mississippi. to name just three of them. These universities were granted LandGrant status under the EvansAllen law enacted by Congress in 1890. An amendment accepted in House of Representatives during debate on the Agricultural Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 increases formula funds for research and extension science performed at these universities in a total amount of $6.8 million. There are 18 such historically black universities in America which are part of the entire national landgrant university system. The historically black landgrant universities play a very special and unique role in our nation. Since 1988. the base formula funding provided to our nations historically black colleges has eroded. Funding provided to these institutions through this mechanism has remained flat from the previous fiscal year. Investing in the 1890s LandGrant institutions is a wise investment indeed. Together. our historically black landgrant universities comprise a unique asset with the multicultural depth to enrich the research. extension and education capacity of the nation. Strengthening minority serving institutions and making them equal partners in the LandGrant System are key elements toward improving minority access to USDA programs. Our universities need a significant boost in infrastructure investment to fully participate and compete for research. extension and education funding. The amendment passed by the House of Representatives would increase base (formula) funding and as a result would be a significant step in that direction. I appreciate Senator COCHRANS recognizing the importance of this funding and hope you will give strong consideration during conference to acceding to the amendment passed by the House of Representatives. $6.8 million divided among the 18 historically black institutions is not much. but it does mean a great deal to these institutions and the people they serve through their research and extension programs.",

In numerous appropriations bills and reports. the Committee and the Senate have reiterated the position. consistent with the unanimouslypassed ByrdHagel resolution. that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change and control of greenhouse gases has not been approved by the Senate and must not be implemented by the Administration through the regulatory backdoor. Every year. language to this effect has been included in a growing number of appropriations laws. including the Agriculture Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2000. My question arises because emissions trading is inextricably. and most visibly. linked to the limits envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol. I assume there is no intention in the report language to be inconsistent with our longstanding position on Kyoto and no implied endorsement of emissions trading.

Including mandatory savings. the subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in both BA and outlays. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation totals $64.4 billion in BA and $46.7 billion in outlays. Within this amount. $14.9 billion in BA and $15.0 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending. For discretionary spending in the bill. and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill. the Senatereported bill is $315 million in BA and $6 million in outlays below the subcommittees 302(b) allocation. It is $75 million in BA below and $131 million in outlays above the 2000 level for discretionary spending. and $630 million in BA and $77 million in outlays below the Presidents request for these programs. I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation. I appreciate the committees support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation. I urge adoption of the bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Senate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the RECORD.",

This amendment addresses a very important issue for American consumers. especially for senior citizens who must pay for their medicines out of their own pockets. The same medications sold in the United States are also sold in Canada and other countries. often at substantially lower prices. This amendment has the potential to save American consumers millions of dollars by giving them access to their medicines at these lower prices at their local pharmacies. I am pleased that this amendment has the support of the National Community Pharmacists Association. and I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the NCPA be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on July 10. 2000. one of South Dakotas finest mayors stepped down after two decades of public service. Nancy Ekstrum. former city council member and mayor of the town of Philip for 12 years. provided thoughtful and decisive leadership for her community during a time of considerable change. The first woman to lead Philip. Mayor Ekstrum began her service as mayor facing difficult issues that would be familiar to anyone who lives in a rural community. Poor quality water supplies made treatment expensive and difficult. An aging sewer system needed repair and road projects awaited completion. Meeting these challenges with a shrinking tax base and during a time of hardship for area ranchers required a sense of vision and tenacity. Most of all. it required a mayor who was willing to roll up her sleeves and put her heart and soul into finding creative solutions to difficult problems. Nancy Ekstrum was just that kind of mayor. Under her leadership. the city built longneeded roads and made great strides toward providing its citizens with clean. healthy drinking water. When it became clear that the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System was still several years from reaching the community. Mayor Ekstrum rallied area residents to work with the congressional delegation to find an affordable interim solution to the citys water crisis. It is my hope that this project will be funded this year so that clean water will be Mayor Ekstrums lasting legacy to the city. On a more personal level. I will miss working with Mayor Ekstrum. Her advice on issues facing western South Dakota is always thoughtful and on target. I suspect that I will continue to turn to her long into the future for her thoughts and input as South Dakota faces the challenges of adapting a rural state to a global economy. I look forward to maintaining our strong friendship. In conclusion. I simply would like to extend my congratulations to Mayor Ekstrum on her 23 years of service to her community. I am delighted that she plans to stay involved in education and will continue to make a difference for the youth of Philip. I wish her the best as she enters this new phase of her life.",

I rise today to pay tribute to the Atlanta Braves baseball team for winning their eighth consecutive divisional championship and. once again. finishing the season with the best record in Major League Baseball. While their record may suggest that this championship was won with a great deal of ease. this could not be further from the truth. Before the season began. the Braves and baseball as a whole were shaken by the news that Andreas Galarraga. the AllStar first baseman of the Braves. had been diagnosed with nonhodgkins lymphoma. a form of cancer. Although Galarraga had to sit own the entire 1999 season. he has now fully recovered and everyone is eagerly awaiting his return to the field next year. Despite the loss of Galarraga and several other individuals who had been an integral part of the previous championship teams. the Atlanta Braves never gave up. Through this difficult time. the Braves played to the best of their ability and exceeded everyones expectations. This season the Braves won more games than any other team in baseball which is why. including the worst to first season of 1991. this season may have been the most meaningful of all their recent successes. In this year when each major league team individually celebrated Hank Aaron Daya day devoted to the memory of baseballs all time homerun leader breaking Babe Ruths staggering record of 714 homersthe Atlanta Braves once again rose to the top. Their national following combined with their hard work and perseverance have given the Braves the moniker of \"Americas Team.\" an honor well suited for these champions.e",

    "speech": "Mr. President. October is \"Coop Month.\" and today I would like to stress the importance of cooperatives to the nation and especially to my state of North Dakota. Cooperatives are pure examples of good businesscompanies formed. owned and democratically controlled by the people who use its services and who receive benefits from patronage. Cooperatives are institutions that demonstrate people making their lives better through hard work and their knowledge of the American economic system. In fact. the notion of cooperation is an idealpeople working together to accomplish a task and provide products and services for the public good. It is this basic philosophical idea. which so many find difficult to achieve. that the citizens of my state have been particularly adept at making a reality. North Dakota farmers have been leaders when it comes to improving their economic and social positions through cooperative community enterprise. From the great traditions of early political movements that created cooperative momentumthe American Society of Equity. the Nonpartisan League. and the Farmers Unionan educational base was formed that today still influences the drive for cooperative development. As a result. electricity and telephone service. pasta. sugar. bison and scores of other marketing and service cooperatives cover North Dakota today. Income is distributed. products and services are supplied. and employment and opportunity are spread throughout the state. Cooperatives are formed to protect the way of life for independent producers and provide essential services for rural communities. Member education. onemember. onevote equity in business decisions. and relying on neighbors to form and maintain the institution are all cooperative principles that underpin the success of these ventures. The legendary hardships that have been overcome in my states pioneering history required cooperation among neighbors for everything from food and shelter to aid in farm labor and human companionship. Cooperation and the formation of cooperative enterprise were logical means of ensuring rural survival. We have long known that through organization. we can accomplish any goal. and through cooperation we can work together to benefit all. Therefore. during October. the month designated to recognize the importance of cooperatives. I thank the members of cooperatives for taking the initiative to direct their economic futures and for contributing to the unique economic heritage of North Dakota and this nation.*",

Since his ordination on May 16. 1976. Reverend Jackson has worked to help those less fortunate throughout New York and New Jersey. During his career.

The exhibit. which is located at Wayne State University in my home town of Detroit. MI. is being dedicated on Friday. October 8. 1999. The SS Wayne Victory was a socalled \"Victory Ship.\" one of several hundred ships built during the final two years of World War II to serve as cargo and troop transport vessels. The SS Wayne Victory was named for Wayne University. now known as Wayne State University. Commissioned in 1945. the SS Wayne Victory served in World War II. the Korean conflict and the Vietnam war. Thanks to the efforts of a Wayne State University alumnus. the contributions of the SS Wayne Victory to our armed forces will be celebrated for years to come. Many ships of its kind fell into disuse and were forgotten after their service. Fortunately. Joe Gerson. who grew up in Detroit and graduated from Wayne State University in 1951. located the SS Wayne Victory and negotiated with the federal government for the permanent loan of several artifacts from the ship to the university. These artifacts include the ships bell. engine order telegraph. wheel. furniture. oars. life rings. and name board. Mr. Gerson also generously contributed funds which allowed the university to transport the artifacts to Detroit and to display them in the permanent exhibit being dedicated this Friday. Mr. President. the preservation of artifacts like those from the SS Wayne Victory is critical if we are to continue to learn from history. Thanks to Joe Gerson and Wayne State University. one small. but significant. piece of American military history will be available for people to study in the 21st century. I know my colleagues join me in extending Joe Gerson and Wayne State University our thanks and congratulations for their commitment to the preservation of the memory of the SS Wayne Victorys role in some of the most significant military conflicts in our nations history.*",

Victims of the hurricanes should have the opportunity to use Federal disaster relief in local competitive markets to rebuild their homes and communities.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my friend for yielding me the time and congratulate her on the fine job that she is doing. As my friend from Martinez. California. has just said. this is a bipartisan bill. It is very important. At the beginning of the 106th Congress. we established four priorities that we wanted to address. Number one of those items was to improve public education. We all know that as we look at education in this country. we have a superb postsecondary education system. but at the primary and secondary level. we have some great school districts around the country and some great. great schools. but we also have some very serious problems. So as we look at improving public education. what is it that we must do? We have got to provide a little more flexibility to those school districts so that they can address many of the needs that are out there. Now. we saw the much heralded call for 100.000 additional teachers. That is great. It sounds wonderful. But it seems to me as we look at school districts around the country. there are issues other than simply adding teachers that they want to address. And what H.R. 1995 does is it allows for that flexibility. I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania . the gentleman from California and the others who are working with Democrats to make sure that this is a bipartisan issue. I am also proud of the way that we have structured the rule. It. in fact. has an equal number of amendments from our friends on the Democratic side and an equal number of Republican amendments. I think that with the kind remarks that have been made by Democrats here in support of the committee work. although yesterday afternoon I have to admit there was kind of an interesting debate and it is not unanimous. There are some who frankly want to still have more Federal involvement in the area of education and they want to involve themselves in micromanaging it. We want to provide flexibility. This bill does that. The rule allows for a freeflowing debate. I urge my colleagues to support it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first let me say to my friend from New York that this does not touch title I which is a massive program which I and many others favor. because many States did not in fact pay enough attention to the lower income areas of this country. Some States deliberately wiped out their property tax so that minorities would not have sufficient schools and went to private schools. and because of that the Federal Government stepped in and said those who are in lowincome areas are going to need some help. just like as we had specialneeds kids around this country that led to the development of IDEA. There is no question that there is a role. some role. for the Federal Government in education. The question is. is fundamentally who do we trust the most? This rule gives us the flexibility to debate a number of the different options and to really highlight again today the differences as to how the bulk of education should be run in this country. not the exceptions. We are not abandoning what we are putting into lowincome students or into IDEA. But what we are saying is that rather than say. we know best here on the floor of this House what the school districts in my district in northeast Indiana or anywhere in the country should do. some of them work to lower their class size and some of them rather than getting it down to 18 might want to have 19 in the class size and have better teachers for effectiveness. Others may want and need more teachers in IDEA which is the biggest financial drain in the local school districts because they cannot take care of many of these students that the courts have ordered them and Congress has ordered them to take care of. Each school district has their own funding flexibilities. each State has their own funding flexibilities and priorities they have to work. Who are we to say that they have to go a certain direction? Once again. let me repeat. this bill. while there are nuances in the additional spending proposed in the 100.000 new teachers and other programs. does not touch the basic funding mechanisms of which we have tried to put into lowincome students.",

I also will support the underlying bipartisan bill that emphasizes a reduction in class size and an emphasis on the quality of the teacher standing in front of the classroom. Now. I applaud some on the Republican side for this bipartisan bill because I know that 3 or 4 years ago. -there were some on that side that advocated reducing the Department of Education to rubble and now we are emphasizing in a bipartisan way reducing the class sizes in America and putting emphasis on the quality of the teacher that stands in front of those students. I think this is a bipartisan bill. a DemocraticRepublican bill. for two reasons: It emphasizes the right goals that all American parents and teachers and students agree with. and. that is. generally. in the earliest grades. 1 through 3. that when we have smaller class sizes. 18 or 20. we are more effective in making sure those children get off to the right start and get up to speed in their reading skills. Secondly. the delivery mechanism is right in this bipartisan bill. It does not loosely structure a block grant that you can spend money on anything. It tightly targets the spending for the State and the local school to choose between two things. a reduction in class size or quality teachers. I think that those are both equally important goals and I would encourage my colleagues to support Martinez and support the underlying bipartisan bill.",

Now let me tell my colleagues that the last thing for 40 years on the education feeding chain has been the teacher and the student. I chaired the Subcommittee on Civil Service. In the Department of Education there are 5.000 employees of which 3.000 are located in the city of Washington. and those employees in the Department of Education are earning between 50 and $110.000 on average. Show me a teacher in my district that has that money. The balance of the 2.000 Department of Education employees are located in regional offices. We are saying. put the money. put the power. put the emphasis. We only spend 5 percent of Federal money. the total amount in education comes from the Federal level. We are saying. put that money in the classroom with the students. not in Washington. not with bureaucrats. and empower the teacher. empower the student. and empower the classroom.

They do not question. however. the ability of the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to analyze the content of legislation. I want to read from the Presidents letter on this bill: H.R. 1995 abolishes a dedicated funding stream for class size reduction and replaces it with a block grant that fails to guarantee that any funding will be used for hiring new teachers to reduce class size. Moreover. the block grant could be used simply to replace State or local funding instead of increasing overall investment in our public schools. If the Congress sends me H.R. 1995 in its current form. I will veto it in order to protect our Nations commitment to smaller classes and better schools. There are some speakers who keep insisting that there is nothing wrong with the bill in terms of protecting the reduction in the classroom size initially. but definitely this leaves it wide open. It pushes the Federal priority aside and leaves the decision open for local education officials.

Let me say. when they say in the bill that the highest priority is class size reduction and there is no separate funding for it. they really do not give it a priority. So it leaves it up to the locals to decide where they are going to spend the money. whether they determine that they need it for class size reduction or they need it for teacher training. And I have nothing against either. because I believe that both go hand in hand. one with the other. But we ought to at least do it in a way that says to them. do the class size reduction. get the qualified teachers. show us which way we really need to spend the money before we authorize it being spent. rather than leaving it. Now. I know we always say that locals know best. Well. I wonder. if the locals know best. then why did the Federal Government get involved in this at all? The Federal Government got involved in these programs because locals did not make the decisions that were necessary to take care of the children with disabilities. to take care of bilingual problems. to take care of disadvantaged students. and that is where the Federal programs came up with Title I and other programs.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. crop protection tools are necessary for family farmers to provide a safe and reliable food supply to the consumer and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must use sound science to evaluate and determine which products are dependable and safe. If this is not accomplished. safe and useful crop protection products will be unavailable for use by the family farmer and the quality and affordability of wholesome food supply will be jeopardized. For this reason. I joined several of my colleagues today in introducing the Regulatory Fairness and Openness and Act of 1999. This bipartisan legislation will give EPA the ability to address potential problems with the registration and reregistration processes for crop protection tools during the implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. This bill ensures that the EPA has the capability to adequately evaluate and analyze all available. accessible data and information and to use the best science to determine which crop protection tools will be available for the family farmer. This Act does not change the FOPA standards for pesticide evaluations. it clarifies the processes employed for evaluation in order to allow for full and scientifically correct compliance with the requirements of the FQPA. Without the Regulatory and Openness Act of 1999. many crop protection tools will be eliminated for use by agriculture. putting the farmers in the United States at a competitive disadvantage with foreign imports. These imports do not have to meet the strict regulatory requirements that our farmers must follow. Further. if the EPA eliminates crop protection tools without allowing time for the development of new alternatives. family farmers will lose crops to pest infestations and the consumer will lose the quality and quantity of food available to them. This bill encourages and supports research into expanded information gathering on the use of crop protection tools and research into the development of new alternatives for managing pests in agriculture. I urge my colleagues to support this very important legislation. The Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999 is important not only for agricultural America. but for all Americans. Through complete and thorough risk assessments of crop protection tools using actual and relevant data and sound science. the EPA and family farmers can continue to provide our countrys citizens with the safest. most abundant food supply in the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I commend and thank my colleague. Congressman FRED UPTON. for introducing H.R. 2130. the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid DateRape Drug Prohibition Act. On December 17. 1999. Tom Gugliotta. who plays for the Phoenix Suns. suffered a seizure and was nearly killed after taking a form of furanone dihydron. a generic chemical name for gamma butyrolactone (GBL). In the United States. products containing GBL have been marketed as dietary supplements and the sale of GBL is not regulated in most states. GBL is the primary precursor used in the production of gammahydroxybutric acid (GHB). GHB has predominantly been abused by Americas youth to produce euphoric and hallucinatory states. and for its alleged role as a growth hormone releasing agent to stimulate muscle. Additionally. GHB has been used to assist in the commission of sexual assaults. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has documented over 5.700 overdoses and law enforcement encounters with GHB and 58 GHBrelated deaths. GBL. once absorbed orally. is rapidly converted into GHB in the body and produces the same profile of physiological and behavioral effects as GHB. In 1999. the FDA issued several warnings about products that contain GBL and asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall all products. Unfortunately. products containing GBL remain available for sale over the Internet. H.R. 2130 directs the Attorney General to schedule GHB (together with its salts. isomers. and salts of isomers) as a \"Schedule I drug\". the DEAs most regulated drug category. under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In addition. H.R. 2130 specifically names GBL as a \"List I chemical\". the DEAs most regulated chemical category. Illicit use of many GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a significant and growing law enforcement problem. Importantly. H.R. 2130 will help DEA not only control GHB. but the full range of CSA drug control measures would also apply to GBL. It is imperative that the DEA has necessary tools to control these dangerous substances to further prevent incidents such as Tom Gugliottas seizure. Therefore. I urge an aye vote on H.R. 2130.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2130. and I commend the gentlemen from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Mr. DINGELL. and Mr. STUPAK. as well as our other colleagues mentioned here today. for their work on this legislation. I am a cosponsor of this bill and I am glad we are making this one of our first priorities this session. I look forward to it becoming law very soon. H.R. 2130 will classify gamma hydroxybutyric. or GHB. as a schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. as it is in my home state of Michigan. This action is necessary due to the increased and pernicious use of this drug. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). at least 32 deaths have been associated with GHB since 1990. while over 3.500 overdoses have occurred. Emergency room visits due go GHB increased nationally from 26 in 1992 to 629 in Samantha Reid. one of the young women this bill is named after. was from Michigan. She died one year ago after unknowingly ingesting GHB at a party. She was 15 years old. It is this type of senseless tragedy that H.R. 2130 is meant to address. GHB is odorless and colorless and is easily slipped into a drink without the knowledge of the intended victim. It is generally used as a daterape drug. a crime that affects women between the ages of 16 and 24 more than any other age group. It is estimated that one in four college women have been the victim of daterape. H.R. 2130 directs the Department of Justice to develop model protocols for taking toxicology specimens and victims statements in association with drugs used to commit daterape. This is important because this crime too often goes unreported. A recent study indicates that 84 percent of rape victims knew their attacker. and 57 percent of those were raped on a date. Moreover. GHB is hard to trace. often leaving the body within 24 hours. The DEA will also create a special unit to analyze the growing use of daterape drugs and make recommendations to the Attorney General on how federal funds can best be used to combat this problem. Mr. Speaker. I would again like to commend the work of my colleagues on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.",

S. 1733. the Food Stamp Electronic Benefit Transfer Interoperability and Portability Act. This bill was passed unanimously by the Senate last November. and today the House will act on that bill. The bill provides for a national standard of interoperability and portability for the food stamp program. The bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to set specific standards for States with electronic benefit transfer systems so that food stamp participants can redeem their benefits in neighboring States. Under the food stamp coupon system. participants can redeem benefits in any retail food store. States want to apply this same principle to the EBT system of delivery of food assistance benefits. The gentleman from Virginia . chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the food stamp program. introduced a similar bill last year. I commend the chairman of the subcommittee for his attention to this matter and his work ensuring proper oversight of the food stamp program. The Food Stamp Act already requires that all States issue food stamp benefits under an EBT system by the year 2002. The EBT is a more efficient and effective manner in which to provide food benefits for needy families. S. 1733 requires the USDA. within 7 months of enactment. adopt a uniform national standard of interoperability and portability so that Stateissued EBT cards can be used in other States. The standards are to be based on the standards used by the majority of States. thereby enabling USDA to use flexibility in writing the standards. The bill also provides for exemptions for States if they have entered into EBT contracts using other standards. Also. waivers are provided for States operating smart card food stamp systems rather than debit card systems. as most States do. S. 1733 requires USDA to pay 1 percent of the costs of adopting these standards up to a maximum of $500.000 per year. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1733. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I very much appreciate his kind remarks and for bringing this particular concern to my attention. In the legislation that the House is now considering. there are provisions that have been included to ensure that the two existing Smart Card programs that are currently in place. those being Ohio and Wyoming. will not be forced to make any changes that would result in either new or additional expenses for the States. Ohio and Wyoming can continue using their Smart Cards until the Secretary determines that a practicable technological method is available for interoperability between electronic benefit transfer Smart Card systems and the magnetic stripe card systems that most other States are using. Furthermore. the legislation provides safeguards so that these offline programs are not jeopardized in any way. It is my understanding that both Ohio and Wyoming chose to embrace this Smart Card technology for the delivery of benefits with the blessing and approval of the United States Department of Agriculture. Therefore. Ohio and Wyoming should not be required to change their systems until they are interested in doing so. I wish to ensure my good friend and colleague from Ohio that the legislations waiver section and the provision for specific exemptions for Smart Card systems were incorporated into these initiatives with Ohio and Wyomings interest in mind. As a footnote. I should mention that the technology is not currently available in the marketplace for on- and offline systems to be compatible and interoperable. However. that day is rapidly approaching. In the short term. it is my hope that the Congress will have the opportunity to work toward a national standard for Smart Cards as other States like Ohio and Wyoming begin to consider their own Smart Card projects for domestic feeding programs. unemployment compensation. health care. and other benefits. It is my view that there is much to learn from Ohios leadership and experience in this area.",

Id like to thank Chairman LARRY COMBEST and Chairman BOB GOODLATTE for bringing this bill to the floor today and for their strong leadership on this important issue. Interoperability of food stamp EBT systems makes sense both for recipients and retailers. As USDA moves from paper food coupons to EBT cards. interoperability ensures that recipients will retain the same portability as before. Recipients will be able to access stores nearest to their homes and retailers will be able to serve their customers regardless of state boundaries. In areas of the country near state lines. such as in my Congressional District in Southern Missouri. incompatible EBT systems have been a significant problem for both groups. I am very pleased that the bill before us today will resolve this problem and bring the best technology to the food stamp program. The government and the taxpayer. too. are well served by S. 1733. because it establishes a new mechanism for tracking and policing fraud and abuse in the food stamp program. In my home state of Missouri. the Department of Social Services estimates that an interoperable EBT system would save the federal government as much as $1 million annually in reduced fraud in Missouri alone. One aspect of S. 1733 that I would like to highlight is that it provides 100% federal funding of the costs associated with switching and settling interstate transactions. These costs will not be imposed on other entities. such as retail food stores. states. and food stamp households. This is entirely appropriate because these costs are directly related to administering the program on a nationwide basis. not within a particular state. Again. I would like to reiterate to my colleagues that this is a very sensible piece of legislation that deserves the support of this House. I urge a strong \"Yes\" vote.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today is the first day of \"Back to Health Week.\" a national campaign created to increase awareness of back pain as well as possible causes and prevention. Sponsored by the North American Spine Society. this week is designed to educate Americans about their spine and how they can prevent common back pain. The facts of back pain speak for themselves. Did you know that at some point in their lives. more than 80% of American adults experience back pain? Or. that 1 out of 14 adults will visit a physician this year due to back or neck pain and that back pain is the second most common reason people visit a physician? These statistics demonstrate how important it is to raise awareness about this health problem that affects so many Americans. One Famous American who suffers from back pain is twotime Cy Young Award winner and Major League Baseball pitcher Randy Johnson. After Johnson won the Cy Young in 1995. he was sidelined because of back problems for most of the 1996 season. Johnson captured his second Cy Young last year after surgery to correct a herniated disk and months of physical therapy. Another highlight of \"Back to Health Week\" is an event to distribute information about back pain. \"Back to Health Day\" will be held Thursday April 13th in the Capitol. \"Back to Health Day\" will provide an array of educational materials. including guidelines to a healthy back. exercises to strengthen your back. and how to prevent back pain. In addition. representatives from the North American Spine Society will be on hand to discuss commonly asked questions about back pain. causes. and prevention. I encourage my colleagues to join us for \"Back to Health Day\" as we learn the most effective ways to prevent and alleviate back pain. I commend the North American Spine Society for organizing \"Back to Health Week\" and for their commitment to ensuring Americans learn to keep their backs healthy.",

Because of our nations use of herbicides during the war. tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans have died or live daily with the scars of disease. As any veteran will tell you. the scars of war are not just physical. but also emotional. Too many veterans and their loved ones live each day with the continuing pain of dealing with the loss and the illnesses caused by Agent Orange. Next week. the \"quilts of tears\" will arrive in Washington. DC. This is an important event because the quilts tell many of the stories that need to be told about the devastation this tragedy has exacted on too many lives. Recently. I received a letter from Ms. Jennie R. LeFevre. an Agent Orange widow. who eloquently describes her own experiences as well as the legacy left of broken soldiers and broken families. I believe it captures the essence of the Agent Orange tragedy as well as the costs that our nation continues to pay for a war that ended almost twentyfive years ago. The quilts will arrive on the Mall on April 17 and will be available for viewing near the Vietnam Memorial. They will also be on display on Memorial Day on the banks of the Reflecting Pool.

According to todays Wall Street Journal survey on executive compensation. the average CEO of a pharmaceutical company received $14.9 million in salary. bonus. and stock options in 1999. Rather than maximizing the R&D of new therapies and cures for diseases. they are spending it on pay for their executives. Todays Wall Street Journal article shows what the pharmaceutical industrys real priorities are. The top five highest compensated CEOs of pharmaceutical companies surveyed were: (1) Charles A.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join today with Senator PATRICK MOYNIHANand a number of my House and Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to stop further Medicare cuts in the indirect medical education (IME) program. IME payments are extra payments made to teaching hospitals for the fact that they are training the next generation of doctors. and that the cost of training a young doctorlike any apprenticeship or new person on the jobis more expensive than just dealing with experienced. older workers. The young person requires mentoring. orders more tests. and makes mistakes unless closely supervised. It is natural that a group of young residents in a hospital will reduce a hospitals efficiency and increase its costs. Medicare should help pay for these extra \"indirect\" costs. if we wantas we surely dofuture generations of competent. highly skilled doctors. The Balanced Budget Act took the position that the extra adjustment we pay a hospital per resident should be reduced from 7.7% in FY 1997 to 5.5% in FY 2001. This provision was estimated to save about $6 billion over 5 years and $16 billion over tenin addition to about another $50 billion in hospital cuts in other portions of the BBA. In the Balanced Budget Refinement Act which was enacted last November. we recognized that these cuts were too much. and froze the fiscal year 2000 rate at 6.5%. reduced it to 6.25% in 2001 and then dropped it to 5.5% thereafter. Mr. Speaker. last falls delay and spread out of the cuts is helpfulbut these cuts are still too much The nations teaching hospitals. which do so much to serve the uninsured and poor. and which are the cradle of new clinical research and technical innovation. are hemorrhaging red ink. Our bill stops further scheduled cuts in the IME. freezing the adjustment factor at 6.5% rather than letting it fall to 5.5%. and saving teaching hospitals about billions of dollars that would otherwise be taken from them. I hope this legislation will receive consideration this year. before the cuts resume. and these premier medical institutions are faced with cuts. layoffs. and reduced service that will literally cost us lives in the years to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Oregon for yielding me this time. and I rise in strong support of the pending amendment. Mr. Chairman. I would like to make five points. Number one. the wildlife methods of predator control are ineffective and wasteful. From 1983 to 1993. the amount of money that has been spent on this program has gone up by 71 percent. kills have gone up by 30 percent. and there is no significant reduction in the predator population. Number two. Taxpayers should not be responsible for subsidizing predator control. As my friend from Oregon said when he spoke. not one word in this amendment would in any way impact a ranchers ability to shoot or control livestock on his or her property. All it says is that the taxpayers of this country are not going to subsidize gunning of predators on these ranches out in the West. Thirdly. the Wildlife Services methods for predator control are inhumane. All we have to do is see footage of films of these helicopters and aircraft speeding low across the range with people with guns shooting indiscriminately from one end to the other. It is inhumane and it is dangerous. My colleagues will hear and see the same posters that we have seen for years now. getting a little bit dogeared. of the wolf chasing the little white sheep. They are gruesome pictures. What they do not show are the seven humans who have been killed in aviation accidents associated with gunning these animals down. These individuals ride in these helicopters and aircraft with their rifles shooting from the aircraft. which by the way. is a violation of FAA regulations. I guess the fourth point is that alternative methods of predator control do exist. They do exist. We do not have to support a program where we take taxpayers funds and use them to kill animals in a program that has never really worked. and all it really constitutes in the end is a subsidy to large western ranchers. I urge support of the pending amendment.",

These accusations that the program is inhumane. The accusations that it is not focused and that innocent wildlife are somehow caught in the crossfire. The accusation that because there are more coyotes today. and there are. that it is a direct result of this program? Those who are going to stand up and propose this amendment ought to at least stick to the facts. I have a fact here and a photo to prove how if we do not participate in this program. this inhumane activity will occur. These are several sheep in Oregon that were destroyed earlier on in a brutal way. as my colleagues can see from the photo. by wild coyotes who were roaming this area. This is the kind of inhumaneness that we are trying to stop. It is not only inhumane. it is of great cost to producers and farmers and ranchers around the country. All of those who are standing up with this false rhetoric right now should perhaps consider. as they look at this photograph. about rewriting the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and we failed to protect it.

There is a lot of misinformation about what this amendment does and does not do. And I concede the point to the gentleman. and all of those who are proposing this amendment. that they are opposed to killing of wolves and coyotes and other animals that do great damage to American agriculture. I concede that point. But from the standpoint of what this amendment does. I think it is important to understand. first off. that the Wildlife Services program is a highly specialized organization within the United States Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Wildlife Services uses. uses now. contrary to the previous Speaker. integrated wildlife management techniques and strategies to minimize the negative impacts of wildlife on livestock and crops. human health and safety. property. and threatened and endangered species. E 2000 If this amendment were to pass. the $7 million. the DeFazio amendment would redirect the $10 million in additional funds by prohibiting their use for livestock protection programs. Because of the cooperative nature of this program. a $7 million cut and a redirection of funds actually results in a total loss in the program of $23.7 million. Now. this also will knock out $2 million of the bills appropriated funds to increase wildlife services that will be dealing with the rabies control program and collaborations. The DeFazio amendment would not only cause a loss of $2 million for this important program. but would also cause an additional loss of cooperative money by local sponsors. The funding for these wildlife professionals provides the basis that allows the State to devote funds for permanent personnel to perform all of the duties of animal control. By limiting the duties that wildlife professionals perform. we undermine the entire program. Please oppose this misguided amendment.",

Wildlife Services spends millions of dollars annually to kill more than 100.000 coyotes. foxes. bears. mountain lions. and other predators in the Western United States. Although nonlethal alternatives do exist. Wildlife Services chooses to shoot. poison. trap and even club to death both target and nontarget animals.

Aerial gunning. sodium cyanide poisoning. steeljawed leghold traps and neck snares are all common methods used by Wildlife Services. These techniques have been known to kill pets. as well as endangered and threatened species. Much of the killing is conducted before livestock is released into an area. with the expectation that predators will become a problem. However. killing wildlife to protect livestock is effective only if the individual animals who attack livestock are removed. Targeting the entire population is needlessly cruel. it wastes taxpayer dollars. and it can be counterproductive. With this amendment. the Wildlife Services program could leave intact the research. education. and exchange of new information on wildlife damage management and nonlethal methods. Programs would also be funded to assist with nonlethal predator protection services and in cases to protect human and endangered species lives.

This program is costly. unnecessary. inhumane. dangerous and continues to expand eliminating any landowner incentive to control predators through other more costeffective and humane measures. The predator control program is not costeffective and its funding has increased to almost $10 million annually. Sheep and cattle killed by predators could be replaced at onethird the cost the government spends in trying to control predators. These predatory control methods are dangerous for the animals. but some of the forms of predatory control such as aerial gunning are also high risk to Wildlife Service employees. Since 1996. six employees have been killed in four helicopter and plane crashes. the most recent occurred on Ranchers should be taking care of predator control problems themselves. This amendment would not prevent ranchers and farmers from doing so. Currently. because of the federal subsidy. ranchers are discouraged from using more effective. humane. lesscostly. and nonlethal methods such as guard dogs. electric sound and light devices. or predator exclusion fencing. There is no incentive for ranchers to use these types of control methods because the government is paying to kill the wild animals which attack these farmers livestock.

Over the past 10 years. 31 people have been injured. 7 of them fatally. in Wildlife Services aircraft accidents. Low altitude. low speed flying in remote areas is invariably high risk. To me this seems like a hazardous and costly way to go about predator control. As if that was not enough. Aerial Gunning does not help reduce livestock losses because it does not target offending animals. predators that we know are feeding on livestock. For my colleagues who are not swayed by the disturbing. twisted excesses of the Wildlife Services program. I encourage you to look at the flawed economics behind this program. For every dollar of reported livestock damage. the Wildlife Services spends three dollars in the West to fix the problem.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I strongly support S. 1880. the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000. I urge all of my colleagues to approve this much needed and long overdue legislation. We have before us a bill aimed at one of the most significant challenges in health care research and education. The existence of disparities in all aspects of health care is well documented. Reports published by the Institute of Medicine and in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association are just a few of many that point clearly to the need for quick enactment and implementation of the legislation that is before us today. The Commerce Committees hearing on this subject highlighted the fact that there are massive differences in the frequency. severity. and survivability of many health conditions among different members of our diverse population. Unfortunately. where you live. what you earn. and the color of your skin make a big difference in health care quality and access. Great care has been taken in drafting this legislation so that it responds to the panoply of disparities issues without running afoul of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Indeed. the Department of Justice has concluded that the bill does not trigger strict scrutiny under applicable tests for the validity of laws and programs aimed at addressing inequities that fall. in some cases. along racial and ethnic lines. Disparities occur for a variety of reasons. so it is not surprising that legislation aimed at identifying and eliminating disparities has several facets. First. S. 1880 addresses biomedical issues through the establishment of a National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of Health. Next. this bill directs the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to carry out activities to address disparities in health care quality and access. S. 1880 also addresses quality and access issues through the Public Health Service Acts health professions programs. This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. I wish to take particular note of the fine work of my colleagues. Representatives",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker. in 1997. I commissioned a GAO study to review the PCA and its usefulness. and the report that was submitted confirmed that the Physicians Comparability Allowance is critical. In addition. H.R. 207 has been endorsed. as we have heard. by the American Medical Association. the American Osteopathic Association. the American Academy of Family Physicians. a number of State Medical Societies. as well as a number of our employee unions. In the last several years. I have heard from thousands of Federal physicians across the country who have stated very clearly that. without the PCA. they would have chosen a different career. The permanent PCA extension. coupled with the inclusion of a physicians PCA in his or her average pay for purposes of computing retirement. demonstrates that Congress is serious about maintaining. the quality of care that presently exists within our Federal agencies. The government cannot pay physicians on the same scale as physicians employed in hospitals. HMOs. and universities. But passage of H.R. 207 shows that the government will make every effort to recruit and retain highly trained and wellqualified physicians. I certainly applaud its passage this evening. I do want to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from Florida . the chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Service. his staff director Gary Ewing. as well as the gentleman from Indiana (Chairman BURTON) of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and his staff aid Dan Moll for their support in expediting consideration of the resolution. I also want to thank the gentleman from Maryland . the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Civil Service. the gentleman from California . ranking member of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. for their support. In addition. Ted Newland and Harry Wolf of OPM were very helpful in working with us to recraft this legislation to ensure that there were no inequities written into the bill. I also want to point out the instrumental roles that Dennis Boyd and Richard Granville played in drafting and helping us to pass this legislation. Finally. I have to thank my diligent staff assistance. Jordi Hannum. and Ed Leong of Legislative Counsel for his tireless efforts in advising my staff.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am very happy to be able to rise today in support of my good friend from Maryland. Mrs. MORELLAs bill. that will help improve pay and retirement conditions for physicians employed by the Federal Government. The bill. H.R. 207. corrects a number of problems with the current pay structure for Title 5 physicians. For one. it would permanently extend the Physicians Comparability Allowance (PCA). eliminating the need to reauthorize this language every three years. Additionally. the bill would include the physicians PCA as part of their base. average pay for the purpose of computing their retirement benefits. thus allowing them to boost their retirement contributions. This is not a new. unique benefit for physicians in the federal government. this is simply extending a formula Title 37 and 38 physicians have had for years. H.R. 207 is a bill seeking pay equity for all physicians within the federal government. It is important to note that physicians under Title 5 are the same that are working on cures for cancer. AIDS. and heart disease. protecting the safety of our food and prescription drugs. and providing direct medical care to federal employees. and their dependents. in the State and Defense Departments. It is truly unfortunate that the government cannot pay physicians on the same scale as the private sector. but amending the PCA for Title 5 physicians will provide some compensation to offset the loss in income they have willingly accepted to become public servants. I ask all my colleagues to join the American Medical Association. the American Academy of Family Physicians. and a continually growing list of State medical societies (including my home state of Virginia). in supporting this important legislation. I want to thank the gentlelady from Maryland for her persistence and leadership on this matter. and hope this bill will be supported by this House.",

This legislation would allow the BBG to utilize a uniform visa category for all of its broadcast entities. allow the family members of those serving U.S. interests to integrate into U.S. life. and provide protection through permanent residency to those broadcasters whose lives may be threatened because they provide accurate information about dictatorships and corrupt officials abroad. U.S. international broadcasters continue to reach societies which live under regimes that censor the information available to their citizens. Some. after serving U.S. international broadcasting. are unable to return to their countries of origin for fear of retaliation against themselves or their families. Certain employees.of Radio Free Iraq have been threatened with their lives because of the work they do to empower citizens through the free flow of accurate information. U.S. international broadcasting remains a vital part of our international effort to encourage democracybuilding abroad. Its successes precede and follow the Cold War. For example. the most recent BBG survey showed that RFE/RL was the numberone radio station among Serbians during the recent attempt to topple Slobodan Milosevic. Foreign populations rely on broadcasting sponsored by the U.S. as a lifeline in a crisis.

H.R. 5540 will meet the needs of financially distressed family farmers by giving them a chance to keep their farms. In addition. this legislation will provide much needed bankruptcy judgeships several states including Alabama. California. Delaware. Georgia. Maryland. Michigan. Mississippi. New Jersey. New York. North Carolina. Pennsylvania. South Carolina. Tennessee. and Virginia. While I do support this legislation. I would be remiss if I did not raise the issue that this legislation continuously has been extended because we have not yet brought forth acceptable bankruptcy reform legislation. Although we all agree that H.R. 5540 is necessary to aid our nations farmers who are facing financial distress. we are constantly faced with the task of renewing this legislation instead of making it permanent. And it is well noted that the bankruptcy court system is overwrought with a backlog of cases and too few judges to handle the caseload. Despite the need to pass a bill that addresses important issues such as the needs of our farmers and our children as well as our nations citizens and our bankruptcy courts. the leadership established a stealth process allowing wealthy creditors to severely undermine the goal of protecting the ability of small businesses to get a fresh start. The process questioned the integrity of the legislative process of the House. While conferees were appointed. no conference took place. Instead. a bankruptcy bill conference report was negotiated by a small group of staff working for a handful of Members in a closed door process. although the rules dictate that conference meetings must held in public. The most contentious issues were considered by the Republican leadership. excluding Democrats. This legislation was attached to an unrelated conference report and passed with minimal public scrutiny. Thankfully. the President has threatened a veto of this unjust legislation. With H.R. 5540. we can ensure that for at least the next ten months. the family farmers are given the ability to engage in reorganization efforts. We also will make strides towards curing our nations bankruptcy court system of serious backlog. I urge a \"yes\" vote.",

Chapter 12 bankruptcy. which allows family farmers to reorganize their debts as compared to liquidating their assets. was scheduled to expire last year. but it has been extended through enactment of separate legislation. This Member would thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan for introducing H.R. 5540. In addition. this Member would like to express his appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee from Illinois . and the distinguished ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee from Michigan for their efforts in expediting this measure to the House floor today. Chapter 12 bankruptcy has been a viable option for family farmers nationwide. It has allowed family farmers to reorganize their assets in a manner which balances the interests of creditors and the future success of the involved farmer. If Chapter 12 bankruptcy provisions are not extended for family farmers. this will have a drastic impact on an agricultural sector already reeling from low commodity prices. Not only will many family farmers have to end their operations. but also land values will likely plunge downward. Such a decrease in land values will affect both the ability of family farmers to earn a living and the manner in which banks. making agricultural loans. conduct their lending activities. This Member has received many contacts from his constituents regarding the extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy because of the serious situation now being faced by our nations farm familiesalthough the U.S. economy is generally healthy. it is clear that agricultural sector is hurting. The gravity of this situation for family farmers nationwide makes it imperative that Chapter 12 bankruptcy is extended. Moreover. it is this Members hope that Chapter 12 bankruptcy is extended permanently as provided in the conference report of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. which passed the House by a vote of 237174. with this Members support. on October 26. 2000. Unfortunately. the Senate has yet to pass this conference report.

As a ranking member of the old House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. Herb was a forceful advocate for a strong U.S. merchant fleet and its role in our national security and economic livelihood. Generations of Virginians will long appreciate his work to promote economic development throughout our State. both as a Member of Congress and as a member of the Virginia State Senate. I happened to host the congressional luncheon we had for the congressional delegation last week. last Thursday. Herb was the first one there.

Our Nation has lost a respected legislator and a stalwart defender of the men and women of our Armed Forces. During Herbs time in the Congress. he devoted his full time and energy to addressing the needs of the United States military. Without exception. his actions always reflected his sense of duty to the United States and to our Armed Forces. When I became Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. one of the first acts on my part was to ask Herb to chair the Subcommittee on Military Readiness. and also a panel concerning our sea power. Under his leadership. the Subcommittee on Military Readiness has addressed countless difficult issues. including the declining state of the United States military readiness. One of his most enduring efforts as chairman of that subcommittee was a series of field hearings he held throughout the world on military readiness that he chaired in an effort to personally evaluate readiness problems throughout the force. He went to the source of our problems and got it firsthand and brought it back to us and to our military and the Pentagon. Thanks largely to his efforts. the administration and the senior Pentagon leadership finally admitted to significant readiness problems in 1998. We owe a lot to Herb for doing that.

But he was one of those who I would consider one of the real gentleman of the Congress. He got along with both sides of the aisle. He worked with all people. He was gentle in his approach. He was my kind of a gentleman in the Congress. He was a statesman. I learned to love him a great deal and appreciate the work he has done and his commitment and loyalty to America and the principles that we stand for. He will be sorely missed. I was shocked yesterday to find that he was scheduled to be involved in an event that I was sponsoring only to find that he was taken to the hospital and later died. I want to pay tribute to him as a gentleman. a man of conviction. as a great American. and one that I love dearly.",

Herbert Bateman is one of those colleagues that I had great pleasure to serve with. He was. in the modern sense of the word. a patriot. He took great pride in representing the people of the First Congressional District of Virginia. So much profound historical importance. so many important personalities came from that part of Virginia that our friend Herb never tired of citing the examples for us to live up to as a result of the heritage of the District that he represented. It is true. as mentioned by the gentleman from Virginia that. in fact. Herbert Bateman was a very active. a very involved Member of the delegation that met with the North Atlantic Assembly. now called the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He represented the House very well in that capacity. as I am sure he did in all of his activities. especially the Committee on Armed Services. which was very important to Herb. very important to his District. I admired Herb Bateman for many. many reasons. but among them is the fact that he would. after examining an issue. be true to his commitments. Herb could be the only person voting for an issue if he felt that was the right way to vote. When one says integrity. when one says conviction. with respect to Herb Bateman. that is not an exaggeration. He provided great service to his District. He provided an example for all of us to live up to in the course of our service here in the U.S. House of Representatives. We will miss greatly Herb Bateman. I wish he had had a chance to enjoy his retirement which was upcoming. I know he thought he spent his time well here. and so did all of us.",

We have all seen him in our caucus and on this very floor.

He was a man. a Representative who I think. in the truest sense of that word. represented his people extremely well here in this body. He paid attention to the needs of his people back home. He knew their problems. He worked their problems. He tended to his peoples business here in a most efficient way. He truly was a representative of his people. l] 1815 Then on national issues. Herb was one of the Houses experts on military matters. of course a very forceful advocate for a strong national defense in the Committee on Armed Services and on the floor of this body. and indeed. as the gentleman from Nebraska has said. in places like the NATO Council and the international bodies that he attended overseas. representing this House and representing our country in a most effective and heartfelt way. There is no more reasonable person than Herb Bateman. There can also be a Herb Bateman that could let you know exactly how he felt from the tip of his toes all the way up.

But in the period of time that we are living today. where terrorism is actually a threat to our everyday life. I cannot imagine that we would apply to a court in order to find out how we can keep some of these bums out of our country or to keep them from destroying our property and our lives. I take this war on drugs pretty seriously. We have lost lives not only to drug addiction but to our prison system. There is no question in my mind that most Americans believe if we wanted to stop this that we can but that big dollars prevent us from doing it. We go all over the world telling other countries that they really are not going after their drug traffickers. they will not extradite. they will not put them in jail. they will not do anything. Now is the time for us to do something. Now is the time to bring the best minds that we have in the United States. those who have the constitutional mandate to protect the American citizens. Obviously. the President has overlooked this legislation. the Judiciary has overlooked the legislation. and they feel that we stand on sound constitutional ground. But the whole idea that we cannot protect ourselves against those people who use our system. who infringe upon our rights to bring this poison into the United States. who threaten our national security. who have 2 million people locked up. at least over half of them for drugrelated crimes. it seems to me that we are yielding to legal questions rather than questions that in times of war we find answers to. So I think this is a giant step forward. And if there are problems with it. I hope they come back to this House and to the Congress so that we can deal with it.

I want to make a point about this bill. and that is that it deals with foreign drug kingpins who are killing and poisoning our kids. The bottom line is it deals with the worst of the worst. It deals with people who have already been indicted in our court system but probably have never come here and never will come here for trial. It deals with freezing their assets. choking their ability to get the rewards of money and property out of the drug dealings they have been doing. And. yes. it does provide a support level for an already existing and already courttested process whereby under national security guidelines. the President of the United States may designate these foreign drug kingpins as people whose property will be frozen and who cannot have financial dealings and business transactions in the United States. It is perfectly constitutional. it is perfectly appropriate and the Administrative Procedures Act once they are designated does govern the process itself in the seizure of property and the disposition of it. Fifteen thousand of our fellow citizens died last year from illegal drug overdoses. Hundreds of thousands of American families had to cope with the challenges posed by addictions to their loved ones. It seems to me that it is long overdue that we have a bill like this. Sadly. we have discovered in this Congress that we are not insulated from the efforts of the kingpins to buy influence and corrupt our political institutions. Their narcolobbyists were paid well to try to shape and gut this bill through this process. Well. they have not succeeded. fortunately. An overwhelming vote of this House in favor of this bill. H.R. 3164. will send the kingpins an unmistakable message: We do not fear their power. we cannot be bought. and we will not rest until they are jailed and their organizations disrupted.",

I have received conflicting information regarding the Postal Services intentions. It was my understanding initially that the provision in the bill giving the Postal Service free rent for 20 years was justified because butfor the free rent. the Postal Service had no intention of staying downtown. On October 29. however. we learned that Postal Service had always intended on keeping a presence in downtown Terre Haute. just not in the Federal building in question. As the gentleman from Texas. Mr. TURNER. has rightly pointed out. it doesnt seem necessary to give free rent to the Postal Service. This is especially true if it intended on paying rent in another building. This point has significant ramifications. The fact that the Postal Service must receive space rentfree detracts from the building. In fact. it may be the reason that GSA has to date been apparently unable to find a viable alternative. Mr. Speaker. I am not going to vote against this bill. However.

I would like to also quote from the testimony of the General Accounting Office at the subcommittees August 14 meeting. which I think summed it up very well. \"When it comes to deceptive mail. which includes sweepstakes and other kinds of mail material.\" quote. \"consumers problems appear substantial.\" We are all concerned.

Whereas under Article I. Section 8 of the Constitution. the Congress has power and responsibility with regard to foreign commerce and the conduct of international trade negotiations. Whereas the House of Representatives is deeply concerned that. in connection with the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle. Washington. and the multilateral trade negotiations expected to follow. a few countries are seeking to circumvent the agreed list of negotiation topics and reopen debate over the WTOs antidumping and antisubsidy rules. Whereas strong antidumping and antisubsidy rules are a cornerstone of the liberal trade policy of the United States and are essential to the health of the manufacturing and farm sectors of the United States. Whereas it has long been and remains the policy of the United States to support its antidumping and antisubsidy laws and to defend those laws in international negotiations. Whereas the current absence of official negotiating objectives on the statute books must not be allowed to undermine the Congress constitutional role in charting the direction of United States trade policy. Whereas under present circumstances. launching a negotiation that includes antidumping and antisubsidy issues would affect the rights of the House and the integrity of its proceedings. Whereas opening these rules to renegotiation could only lead to weakening them. which would in turn lead to even greater abuse of the worlds open markets. particularly that of the United States. Whereas. conversely. avoiding another divisive fight over these rules is the best way to promote progress on the other. far more important issues facing the WTO members. and Whereas it is. therefore. essential that negotiations on these antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened under the auspices of the WTO or otherwise: Now. therefore. be it resolved. That the House of Representatives calls upon the President: (1) not to participate in any international negotiation in which antidumping or antisubsidy rules are part of the negotiating agenda. (2) to refrain from submitting for congressional approval agreements that require changes to the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws and enforcement policies of the United States. and (3) to enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty laws vigorously in all pending and future cases.",

Despite this strong public support. it has unfortunately become necessary for the Members of this body to once again send a message to the Republican leadership that Americans want the freedom to choose their health care providers. They want to have treatment decisions made by physicians and not insurance company bureaucrats. They want health insurance companies held responsible for the physical injuries they cause. Mr. Speaker. I urge the Republican leadership to stop stalling this critical managed care reform legislation.",

Despite all the great prosperity and despite all the millionaires that have been made in the hightech industry. one industry that has been left behind is agriculture. We need to reach out to Americas farmers. Less than 2 percent of the population now feeds 100 percent of America. plus a great percentage of the whole world. We need to make sure that our farm families are not left behind. How can they grow oats in Millen. Georgia. and compete against the foreign market that is subsidizing their farmer 30 percent in another country? They cannot do that. And yet we let our farmers get beat to death by foreign farmers whose governments subsidize them. We need to try to close that. We need to help balance things. We need to have tough trade negotiations when we are negotiating multinational trade agreements. So these are things that we have worked on. We are going to continue to work on. I believe that it is important for Democrats and Republicans to put aside partisan politics and. despite the hot air that is coming out of the cold State of New Hampshire. do what is best for America and do it here in Washington.

If I could just add one thing before we conclude. one of the things that I found in the 2 months that we had the recess and we were back in our districts and I had a lot of forums on health care on seniors or just in general with my constituents in the various towns that I represent. we are living in very good economic times and the economy is good and generally most people are doing fairly well. but there is a tremendous frustration that the Government does not work. And it is I think. for whatever reason. Congress seems to be the main focus of that. the notion that somehow all we do down here is talk and we never get anything done. The reason I was so frustrated today when I heard some of the arguments from the Republican side is because I know that this issue. the Patients Bill of Rights issue. the HMO reform issue. is something that we can get done. Because the public wants it done. And we had Republicans join us on this Patients Bill of Rights. and I know that the President will sign it. So I do not want this to be another issue that is important that falls by the wayside because the Congress and the President could not get their act together. If there is anything that we can pass this year. this is the issue. And I think we just have an obligation to our constituents to show that. on something so important as this. that we can actually accomplish something and not just sit here and argue back and forth.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. joined by several colleagues. today I wrote Secretary of Defense William Cohen asking for an objective analysis of the \"Antibodies to Squalene in Gulf War Syndrome.\" an article that has just been published in the February 2000 issue of Experimental and Molecular Pathology. This peerreviewed article found antisqualene antibodies in a very high percentage of sick Gulf Warera veterans. As a biomarker for the disease process involved in Gulf War illnesses. the blood tests cited in the study could provide a vital diagnostic tool. We hope this will quickly lead to improved medical treatments for many who are suffering. Many who have heard about this issue are anxious to understand the ramifications. especially those veterans and their families whose lives sadly have been directly affected. We certainly acknowledge the need for further research. However. that should not preclude a vigorous examination of the immediate benefits this study may provide doctors treating those who suffer from Gulf War illnesses. The Housepassed version of the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Appropriations Bill included report language instructing the Department of Defense to develop and/or validate the assay to test for the presence of squalene antibodies. This action was taken in response to DOD unwillingness to cooperate with the March 1999 General Accounting Office recommendation. It reflected my firm belief that the integrity of the assay was the first step in finding answers. Now that this study has been peerreviewed and published. we need to take the next step and build on established science. An internal review by the same individuals within DOD who were unwilling to cooperate for months does not constitute the kind of science that those who sacrificed for this Nation deserve. Given the published article. it seems prudent to use the assay if it could help sick Gulf War veterans. At this critical juncture. my colleagues and myself fervently hope that Secretary Cohen agrees. We must stay the course and find the answers that will bring effective medical treatments for those who suffer from Gulf War illnesses. Let me assure my colleagues. Mr. Speaker. I intend to do so.",

The gentleman from California was alluding to some of the comparisons of the two bills of President Clintons and the House Republican bill. and I would just like to continue that. if I could. for a moment. The Presidents marriage penalty plan would give relief of $45 billion over 10 years. Our legislation would give relief of $182 billion. about four times more. in tax relief over those same 10 years. The Presidents plan doubles the standard deduction over 10 years. Our plan doubles the standard deduction by next year. within one year as opposed to 10. The Presidents plan does not expand the 15 percent income bracket. The Republican plan starts expanding 15 percent income bracket in 2003. The Presidents plan provides up to $210 in tax relief per couple per year. Our plan provides up to not $210 but $1.400 in tax relief per couple. The Presidents plan would help only nonitemizers. So those people who owned a home. who are itemizing. would not be affected by the tax relief. Our plan would help families who itemize deductions. homeowners and nonitemizers. The Presidents plan would help 9 million American couples. The Republican plan would help up to 28 million American couples. So. again. I think the comparison is there. I do want to commend the President for at least becoming involved. for recognizing that there is a problem. I just feel that the Presidents plan does not go nearly far enough. We need to erase this horrible tax on American couples. and we need to work to do it completely. At this time I would like to recognize again my friend. the gentleman from Pennsylvania .",

What are we telling them? Are we really encouraging them. to say if they are not married and they live together. they are not going to pay this? Is this the message we want to send them? It certainly is not. Mr. Speaker. tonight we have laid out the reasons why the marriage tax penalty must be reformed. This tax unfairly penalizes married couples. particularly those with low to average incomes. Providing marriage tax relief could result in up to $1.400 in savings per family currently affected by this tax. I say that this is something we need to do. Last year Congress passed marriage penalty relief. Regrettably. President Clinton chose to veto our tax relief bill. Mr. Speaker. we are offering it again. We will be hearing it in committee. marking it up. H.R. 6 tomorrow. We are urging President Clinton to do the right thing.

Over the past year. however. we have made significant progress in intense bilateral talks between the United States and India. India has expressed readiness to cooperate in developing a multilateral agreement to halt production of fissile materials and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We need to be encouraging this sort of progress. The Burton amendment could stop it cold. India has made significant progress in liberalizing her economy and increasing trade and investment. The momentum created by these reforms would also be impeded by passage of the Burton amendment. United States businesses are Indias number one overseas investor. Some 107 Fortune 500 countries are currently invested in India. and United States high tech firms see India as one of the worlds most important developing markets.

When the Indian ambassador was in my office. they were planning to give $25 million to Iraq in violation of the U.N. embargo. Does not anybody care about that? Do we want them to support and work with Saddam Hussein? They said they are planning to work with him in developing oil fields in southern Iraq. Saddam Hussein has not changed. He is a terror to that entire region. He is a blot on the world. India says they want to help them. and we are not going to send a signal? Let alone the human rights violations. Mr. Chairman.

A very similar amendment to make the same type of point was defeated in 1997 by a vote of 82 to 342 in this House. and I would hope that this amendment would be defeated by a similarly wide margin. The reason I feel this way and so strongly is because it is our national security interest for the United States to have a strong relationship with India. We do not need to be showing the kind of vote that a vote for this amendment would do right now when we are having the best relationships we have ever had with India in the entire history of the two countries. at a time when India is sharing a common fight with us against terrorism. terrorism spawned by radical Islamists in that region of the world which do terrorist acts. not only in India. but all over the world. and particularly against our interests in many parts and maybe against us ourselves. at a time when China is a growing presence that we are not quite sure of and India provides a democratic ballast in that part of the world. at a time when India has just rebuffed the Pakistani Incursion across the line of control in Kashmir and. under very extreme pressure of invasion. did the right thing and limited itself in restraint and. in the end. prevailed. I think this is a time to reward India. not to attack it. I personally have spoken with the Indian ambassador within the past week. and I am very aware that the activity level involving the question of the aid to Iraq is fully within the United Nations parameters. There is nothing involved about human rights that has not been hashed over before. The reality is. yes. there are human rights violations. but the reality is our State Department says it is improving. and it says so in its most current report.",

While human rights abuses have been uncovered in India. it is important to note the significant progress that India has made in resolving human rights problems. As noted in the State Departments human rights report on India. India is addressing its human rights problems because it is a democracy. as noted. the worlds largest. Although the country has confronted many challenges since gaining independence in 1947. it has stayed true to its founding principles. For 50 years. India has been striving to build a civil society. to institutionalize democratic values of free expression and religion. and to find strength in the diversity of its land and its people. despite such things as outside insurgence in Kashmir. I do not see why we would want to jeopardize this humanitarian aid.

Mr. Chairman. the previous speaker talked about Indias minister of oil and gas. and he said that India was only going to allow that loan if the U.N. said that it was all right. The fact of the matter is Indias minister of oil and gas. and I am quoting him now. acknowledged the grant would violate U.N. sanctions but said his country would never allow a friend like Iran to suffer. So the intent of India was very clear. They were going to violate the embargo. They were going to violate the U.N. sanctions.

Yet despite the rejection of hardliners in the last election. the leaders of Iran are still on the wrong track. At a time when the U.S. has sought to improve relations with the Iranian people. the government of Iran must reciprocate and respect fundamental human rights and act as responsible member of the world community. When travesties such as this trial continue. it should concern all of us as to our policy towards Iran.

Mr. Chairman. thirteen Iranian Jews were arbitrarily arrested in March. 1999. and are about to be sentenced and condemned by the Iranian Revolutionary Court for crimes they did not commit. Now is not the time to send Iran symbolic victories. Not while the Iranian Court prepares to sentence the thirteen Iranian Jews who are on trial for their religious beliefs. not for anything they have done wrong. As my colleagues have pointed out. this sham trial was orchestrated by the Iranian government which refused to allow members of the Jewish community. diplomats. or human rights activists to be present in the courtroom and observe the trial. This sham trial undermines the progress we have been anticipating as a result of the recent Iranian electionswhich raised our hopes and led to our lifting of sanctions on carpets. caviar. nuts. and dried fruits. Now is not the time to go further. We must not reward Iran for persecuting religious minorities including Jews. Bahais and Christians. We must not reward the Iranian government for being the worlds leading sponsor of terrorism. We must not reward them for doing everything in their power to destroy the Middle East peace process.

These thirteen rabbis. teachers. students and other citizens were arbitrarily arrested in March of last year and held for seventy days without any charges filed against them. In June of 1999. Iran charged them with spying for Israel and the United States. Finally. in April of this year. the trial of these thirteen Jews began. However. what is currently taking place in Iran is not what any American would recognize as a trial. The judge is acting not only as the judge but also as the prosecutor. The accused were not allowed access to any attorney. courtappointed or otherwise. until just hours before their trial started. Finally. access to the courtroom has been denied to the press. human rights workers and most importantly. to the families of the accused. The Iranian government has a long history of mistreatment of several of its minorities including the Bahais. Sunni Muslims. Christians and Jews. More than half the Jews in Iran have fled the country since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. due to the intense religious persecution. Numerous written and unwritten laws exist in Iran limiting the activities of all minorities. Forbidding Iranians to visit Israel and denying the Bahais access to higher education. government employment and pensions are just two examples of the discrimination which is commonplace throughout Iran. I am extremely concerned that the Iranian government is treating the thirteen Jews currently being tried with the same disregard for human rights and due process that it has treated so many minorities in the past. Our administration and the international community must do all it can to see that this does not continue.

Bovine tuberculosis. which was thought to be eradicated in our country but is now spreading in Michigan. imposing heavy costs on that States dairy and cattle industries. E 1430 Plum pox. a disease of peaches and plums and cherries and other stone fruits normally found only in Europe and Asia first detected in Pennsylvania last year and now threatening fruit growers in that State and likely to spread. Mediterranean fruit flies which appear only sporadically in our country but when they do they cause great damage. and should that infestation reach the southern United States. we would experience disastrous losses to fruit and vegetable industries.

I know firsthand how important it is to have someone of Bill Littles caliber at the helm. He is a lowkey taskmaster who works quietly and effectively to ensure necessary assignments are accomplished. Eleven years ago. Camarillo suffered a $25 million loss to bad investments. Its budget was bleeding. The employee pension fund was bare. Then the city hired Bill Little. Today. the city of 62.500 is thriving. In 1987. the city brought in $2.5 million in sales taxes. In 1998 it took in $6.3 million. thanks in large part to the upscale outlet mall and other retail endeavors Bill Little brought to Camarillo. Its credit rating has rebounded. It has money to spend to better the community. Although Camarillo has long been in the center of the urbanized stretch of Ventura County. meeting planners previously bypassed it for \"more suitable\" locales. Today. Camarillo is recognized as a fine place to bring the east and west together. Under Bill Littles guidance. it has also become a center for hightech firms. Only a person with the rare gifts of both vision and ability could have made it happen. After tightening the citys belt and making it solvent. Bill Little led the way toward rebuilding the citys infrastructure. including a new water treatment plant and police station. Streets were widened. three interchanges off the Ventura Freeway were added. and the county was persuaded to build a new fire station in the city. Those improvements made the city much more attractive to commerce. and commerce has responded enthusiastically. Bill Little is also largely responsible for bringing Ventura Countys first fouryear university to Camarillo. a facility that will improve the educational and job opportunities for Ventura County residents for decades to come. Bill and wife Mary will remain in Camarillo after he retires. enjoying the community he raised up from near catastrophe. The city owes Bill Little a debt of gratitude. but hes not one for such sentiments. He says he was just doing his job. but he did it quite well.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in strong and stringent support of H.R. 764. the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act (CAPE Act). Victims of child abuse often suffer in silence and alone. and this legislation will help shine light on those who take advantage of our Nations most vulnerable. In the State of Michigan. every four minutes a child is reported abused or neglected. Statistics indicate that children who suffer the indignity of child abuse are far more likely to demonstrate future deviant behavior along the very same lines they suffered. Other Michigan statistics show that every 31 minutes a baby is born to a teenage mother. and every two days a child or youth is killed by a gun. How many of these additional statistics are directly related to prior child abuse? By expanding the allowable uses of grant funds provided through law enforcement grants for child abuse prevention. States will have greater flexibility in crafting solutions to the problem. The measure allows grant money to be used for abused children to testify in court through closed circuit television instead of in person. It will also help social workers. child protective workers. and law enforcement officers gain access to criminal records and court documents necessary to safeguard the future placement of children currently in abusive situations. This bill also provides an additional $10 million. increasing the total to $20 million for child protective services workers. training court appointed special advocates and child advocacy centers. These child advocacy centers will provide a centralized facility that unites all child examination and treatment services in one place. No longer will it be necessary to go from location to location in order to meet the needs of abused children. Child abuse represents a present and future threat to the well being of our society. Through affirmative and prospective steps like the one we are taking today. we could minimize this threat. I support H.R. 764 because it is time we in Congress enact legislation that addresses future problems. H.R. 764 does this. and should serve as a precedent for future bipartisan cooperation in Congress to meet the present and future needs of the Nation.",

Pfizer medicines were heavily relied upon by Union Forces during the Civil War. and its ability to massproduce penicillin in 1944 saved many lives on the front lines of Europe during World War II. During the era that followed World War II. Pfizer continued in its search for effective antibiotics. Soon. Pfizer began opening plants worldwide and was on its way to developing into an international powerhouse. Today. Pfizer products are available in 150 countries. In the 1970s. Pfizer began to devote much of its resources to research and development. making longterm investments that would pay off years later. Those investments not only benefited the company. but also the millions of people around the world who have relied on Pfizer drugs to treat a variety of conditions. From the first Pfizer innovation to the highperformance medicines of today. throughout its 150 years Pfizer has been driven by pioneerspeople who were willing to take risks to make the advances that made history.

I am especially proud to join in paying tribute to her. Emily Cole earned a BA and M.Ed from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos. Ms. Cole was the first in her family to earn a college degree. Education has always been a major part of her life. She has worked as a teacher in several elementary schools in Texas. as the associate director of the Teacher Corps at the University of Houston. and as an assistant principal and principal in Houston public schools. Ms. Cole has spent her career working tirelessly on behalf of all children. She has always promoted what was best for school children. never forgetting that their best interest was her driving force. During her tenure at Jefferson Davis High School. Emily Cole has made many improvements. The number of seniors receiving scholarships has increased. TAAS scores have risen. the dropout rate has decreased and the number of graduates has grown. In addition. Ms. Cole has used Project GRAD (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) to increase the number of collegebound students at Jefferson Davis High School. Project GRAD was started 10 years ago by Jim Ketelsen. former Tenneco chief executive officer. as a scholarship program. It now provides a comprehensive collegepreparatory curriculum to students beginning in the elementary grades. Before the program was started at Jefferson Davis High School. only 20 graduates per year went to college. In 1998. 110 Davis graduates enrolled in college. American historian and writer Henry Adams once stated that \"a teacher affects eternity. he can never tell when his influence stops.\" For Emily Cole. the lives she has touched over her many years in the education field will ensure that her influence carries on far into the future.

It is designed to help working families. The amendment increases the mandatory spending by $5 billion over 5 years. The offset comes from a reduction of the $800 billion tax bill by that amount. This amendment also asserts in nonbinding language that if child care tax credits are expanded in future legislation. that they would be for stayathome parents as well as working parents. and that there would be a tax refundability so the poorer families would be able to take advantage of it. The reason why this amendment on this concurrent resolution is so important is that if we do not provide additionally to the child care needs in the budget resolution. then there is no other opportunity for us to do it in the 106th Congress. So this modest amount over 5 years. given the huge waiting lists that exist. the difficulty that working families have in meeting these costs. and providing that incentive as well for stayathome parents so they can get the benefit of it.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment will put the Senate on record in two important areas. The first is that. notwithstanding assumptions to the contrary. the Antitrust Division needs and should have adequate resources to enable it to meet its statutory requirements. including those related to reviewing and investigating increasingly numerous and complex mergers. The second. is that Congress needs to review and pursue adjustments to the HartScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. This second point. Mr. President. is an important one and one whose time is long overdue. The threshold values in this Act which trigger the requirement for businesses to file premerger notifications with government antitrust enforcers have not been changed. even for inflation. since 197623 years ago. The overall purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Antitrust Divisions resources are focused on matters and transactions most deserving of the Divisions attention. and to remove unnecessary regulatory and financial burdens on small businesses. Mr. President. few would disagree that it is important to adequately fund the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. They are charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the antitrust laws. including review of corporate mergers. in order to ensure that the consumer benefits from lower prices and better goods that come with vigorous competition in the marketplace. The interests of consumers must prevail over the political interests of some companies. At our oversight hearing of the Justice Department several weeks ago. I asked Attorney General Reno whether she would work with us to review the value thresholds of the HartScottRodino. It is my belief that adjustments to the value thresholds of HartScottRodino are needed. They are needed to ensure that the Departments merger reviews take into account inflation and the true economic impact of mergers in todays economynot in the economy of 1976. The Attorney General. and the Federal Trade Commission have pledged to work with us. and I look forward with working with the Administration to come up with a rational proposal that is a winwin for both the Department and small business. Mr. President. let me just add that this amendment is not about one company. or one issue. It is about providing rational relief for some small businesses and supporting the enforcement of our laws.",

Mr. Chairman. I oppose this emergency supplemental bill in its current form. I emphatically disagree with the offsets proposed by the committee. Before I address the troubling offsets included in this bill. let me comment on the nature of emergency supplemental appropriations. quote. unquote. Emergency supplemental appropriations are by definition. and again. Mr. Chairman. I quote: discretionary appropriations that the President designates as emergency requirements and which are similarly designated by Congress in legislation subsequently enacted into law. We anticipated the situation in which we now find ourselves and made provisions for it. Any spending designated as an emergency bill will result in discretionary spending caps being increased to accommodate the additional spending. That is in our rules. We now are facing a serious situation which requires immediate action for American farmers who are encountering dire financial straits. and victims of natural disasters in Central America. These circumstances clearly fall in the category of needs that are urgent and immediate. unanticipated and essential: in other words. emergency requirements that deserve prompt action. without offsets. American farmers. Mr. Chairman. are dealing with serious challenges that threaten their very existence. Not since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s have farmers faced such severe economic difficulties. Forecasts for continuing low commodity prices in 1999 have significantly increased the demand for Department of Agriculture farm loans. as many farmers are being turned away from their normal sources of financing. The funding requested by the President is essential to finance the roughly $1.1 billion needed for spring planting. Of equal importance. Mr. Chairman. is providing the necessary assistance to the victims of hurricanes Mitch and Georges. Mitch has already been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of the Western Hemisphere. causing over 9.000 deaths. Even before Mitch hit Central America. nearly one half of all Nicaraguans and Hondurans existed on a dollar a day or less. In the wake of Mitchs devastation it will be years before they can regain that level of poverty. This Congress needs to act expediently. quickly. decisively to provide relief for these victims.

I sit on the Committee on Armed Services which is charged with providing for our Nations security. and from where I sit these offsets are bad for our national security. Last week. the House passed the bill to commit us to deploy a national missile defense system. Such a system is designed to defend against a limited ballistic missile attack. meaning a handful of missiles. from. at most. a North Korea or Iran. That national missile defense system would cost somewhere between $18 billion and $28 billion. Last week. we committed $18 billion to $28 billion. or said we would commit that amount. to a narrow response to a limited threat. This week. this bill cuts $150 million from a program designed to prevent excess Russian plutonium from ending up in the hands of terrorists. Mr. Chairman. what are we doing here?

This bill also cuts funds to promote economic stability overseas and raise the standard of living in poorer countries. Our national security depends on our economic security. We do our prosperity a disservice by cutting vital funding from multilateral development banks. food aid. Russia and Eastern Europe. Congress must not reject a cheap. wise and effective first line of defense against terrorism and nuclear weapons when just last week we chose to move ahead to a more expensive and technologically dubious line of defense. I would just go back. I know it has been mentioned before but the Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson has said since the Department of Energy has already negotiated an agreement to purchase uranium from Russia for $325 million. the entire cut. this entire $150 million. would have to come from the $250 million appropriated to dispose of Russian plutonium.

S. 1898. is the Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000. also known as Jeannas Act. which passed the other body by unanimous consent on October 25 of this year. Every year thousands of violent felons are moved from prison to prison on our Nations highways. Many of these criminals are transported by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. However. as the number of criminals in State prisons continues to rise. many States now rely heavily on private prisoner transportation companies to move prisoners from State to State. Because there is no uniform set of standards and procedures for these prisoner transport companies to follow. the results are sometimes disastrous when prisoners escape. A major reason for escapes from prisoner transport companies is the lack of approved standards for the private transport of dangerous prisoners. Anyone with a vehicle and a drivers license can engage in this business and with very little accountability when things go wrong. S. 1898 seeks to increase public safety by requiring the Attorney General to establish minimum standards and requirements for companies engaging in the business of transporting violent offenders. S. 1898 provides that any person who violates the regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General shall be liable for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $10.000 for each violation and shall make restitution to the government for the money expended to apprehend any prisoner who escapes. Mr. Speaker. it is absolutely essential that we put in place minimum standards for the transport of prisoners by private transport companies. S. 1898 will do that. I certainly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I might add that this is probably the final bill. I would assume it will be. of this Congress that comes forward that the Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary produces here on the House floor. It is also the final one that I think I will get to offer as a Member of this body. I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia",

The report. entitled \"Measuring Up 2000.\" found New Jersey is among the countrys best places to live for families that have collegebound students in their household. One reason is that New Jerseys elementary and secondary education rates are among the top in the Nation which is what prepares our collegebound students. In fact. New Jersey students have a 92 percent high school graduation rate and high SAT and advance placement scores. Fiftyfour percent of high school freshmen enrolled in college after completion of high school and 39 percent of 18- to 24yearolds enrolled in college. New Jerseys institutions of higher learning also achieved high scores in categories such as preparation. participation. benefits. and affordability.

One of those dark clouds is American energy policy. which for the last 8 years has been. in effect. an antienergy policy. thwarting domestic energy supplies and driving up costs with needless regulations. As winter sets in. natural gas and crude oil prices are at record levels and it is the American worker who must shoulder these increases. As Governor Bush points out. we need to unite across party lines and work together for the American people. Formulating a new domestic energy policy is a perfect place to start. Together we can ensure that new energy technologies receive proper R&D funding. We can reduce our overreliance on foreign oil through environmentally sound domestic production. We can reduce pollution without resorting to flawed emissions trading schemes. and we can combine forces to see that clean coal. natural gas. nuclear. and hydro continue to provide the reliable and safe energy that drives the U.S. economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the election mess in Florida and the closeness of the election throughout the Nation has cemented the fact that we must reform the electoral college. Today. I have introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to provide two middleoftheroad options. Neither will totally scrap the system. yet both will allow the voters more of a voice in electing the President. The first resolution. or the proportional plan. will change the electoral college system by awarding electoral votes in each State based on the percentage of the popular vote gained by each ticket in that State. For instance. if one candidate got 60 percent of the popular vote in a State. he would get 60 percent of the electoral votes of that State and the other candidate getting 40 percent would get 40 percent of the votes in that State. The second bill. or the district plan. will award one electoral vote to the candidate who wins in each congressional district in the country with the additional two electoral votes of each State awarded to the winner of the popular vote in each State. This plan is already in place in Maine and Nebraska. and several State legislatures are going to be considering adopting it. It just does not seem right. as we have the current situation in Florida. where all the electoral votes of that State hinge on a few hundred votes either way. So I offer these two proposals as a way to begin the discussion and further this debate. There is a place for tradition in our country and a place for reform. and I think these proposals offer an equitable balance between the two.",

It opened the eyes across the country to the tragedies that occur when guns are allowed into childrens hands. Nearly 6 months and numerous deaths since Columbine. the Republican leadership of this House still has taken no action to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. It should not take a Columbine or Jonesboro or a Los Angeles day care center shooting to get Congress to do the right thing. to enact commonsense gun safety measures. Daily double digit death counts of children because of guns ought to be enough to spur us to act. Sadly. nearly 6 months since Columbine. nothing has been done. The Republican leadership that tried to water down and kill gun safety legislation at the bidding of the NRA earlier this year seems to be on the NRA payroll still. The House and Senate are supposed to be working toward a compromise on juvenile justice legislation. but only one meeting has been held in the past 2 months. and it was only a symbolic gathering. It is time for action. We need a strong bill that will keep firearms out of the hands of those who should not have them. At the very least. the final bill must include the Senatepassed gun safety measures and exclude the kind of poison pills that Republican leaders recently have used to try to block essential efforts such as campaign finance reform and a patients bill of rights. Childrens lives are much too important for such games. Just this week. families in Connecticut were given another chilling reminder of the need to keep children and guns apart.

So it seems to me that. in the question of 24 hours. if somehow we have that good of record in terms of ATF and FBI and local law enforcement going after these individuals now that have committed two felonies. that there is some advantage in coming to some kind of an agreement that is reasonable to help assure that we close this loophole at gun shows and simply do not let it go on for partisan reasons.",

I have to remind the gentleman that one of the problems with the initiatives we passed in the House was that it opened a gaping loophole which most law enforcement opposed. The limitation of 24 hours would not protect or provide opportunity for law enforcement to check gun shows that fall usually on Saturdays and Sundays. It does not give them the 3day or 72 hours that was needed to close the loopholes that would allow the Mack truck. and I do not want to put anything on truckers. of criminals to drive through it. get their guns. and commit 10 felonies. not just two felonies.

I guess the best evidence that I would present is the Boston gun safety tracing program that even the opponents of gun safety measures in the conference committee brought up the Boston program and said that is a model. Let us just enforce those laws that are on the books. The reality is that there are States. and Massachusetts is one of them. that are taking the initiative to go beyond what the Federal has. They have not waited for the Congress to act. Because if they waited for the Congress to act. under the Massachusetts gun safety laws. we would not have been able to institute the gun safety measures in Boston where guns that are used in the commission of a crime are being traced and those tracing those guns have enabled them to pull in more arrests. to reduce violence in Boston. to reduce violence in any of the jurisdictions where they have undertaken these gun safety projects. But we need to provide the tools for law enforcement to take those models across the country where they have worked to learn from those areas of the country where we have all actually been able to reduce violence with guns and use those procedures and use those law enforcement techniques across the country. One of the things we want to see in this bill passed is the resources to implement the tools of those areas where they are working so effectively. I heard members of the conference committee on both sides of the aisle talking about the areas of the country where gun safety measures have worked with law enforcement working with the schools and working with prosecutors. working with the U.S. Attorneys Office and the FBI. And I would suggest that that effort in Boston. a national model where violence with handguns and violence with guns have dramatically been reduced as a result of it. that is all we need to look at. The fact is. Massachusetts has enacted gun safety legislation that Federal law enforcement officers have been able to use to make that program so effective. So I think that if we look at those national models. then it is clear to see that we have an enormous opportunity to reduce gun violence measures simply by giving law enforcement the tools that they need.",

It is unfortunate we use the term \"gun control.\" This is simply common sense attempts to do what rational people would want done in the context of what has become a crisis situation in our schools and in our communities. But what this legislation that has been suggested does not do is terribly important to emphasize. It does not prevent anyone from using rifles. It does not make it illegal to own handguns. It does not confiscate or require the registration of handguns. It does only three relatively marginal things. It says if they are at gun shows. then they ought to have the same requirements as retail gun shop owners in selling handguns. That makes sense. have the same requirements. Why make it so much easier for people at a gun show? Why should we be importing large magazine clips? That does not make a lot of sense. They are not for the purpose of hunting. They are for the purpose of killing. and they are the weapons of choice for drug dealers. And then why not have child safety locks? We do not let children drive automobiles. We require them to know what they are doing. We ought to make it difficult for children to be able to have access to guns. It seems to me these are marginal things. and they are suggested in the light of a critical situation. Canada and other civilized countries have about a dozen deaths from firearms in a year. We have over 20.000. That is too many. Look at the differences. It is not that people hunt less in Canada. They hunt more.

And one program under this Act is the Transitional Living Project for ages 16 to 21. children who cannot safely live at home. I share the enthusiasm of the gentleman from Delaware for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Center has trained at least 42 law enforcement officers in Pennsylvania on how best to handle missing childrens cases. a service available to law enforcement officers across the country. Additionally. on its web site and through other avenues. the Center provides actual photographs of missing children along with age progression computerized images of the missing children. Currently. the Centers web site includes a photograph and computerized image of 51 missing children from Pennsylvania. I must commend the Center on its extraordinary success rate in finding missing children. Another key provision of the legislation will address an issue that has weighed heavily on our minds over the past few months. In a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Early Childhood. Youth and Families last week. we heard firsthand testimony from students who have been the victims of violent acts in their schools. We heard loud and clear the fear in their voices and their concerns about future violence in their schools. But we still have no clear answers to the core casual factors of school violence. This legislation includes a study to be performed by the National Academy of Science which will explore the causes of school violence.

I commend the sponsors of the House and Senate resolution. the gentleman from Delaware and the distinguished senator from Utah . for their diligence in bringing it to the Congress. As a parent. few things can be more painful than the uncertainty and anxiety that arises when a child becomes missing. The void of not having a loved one present. plus the fear and anxiety of what that loved one may be undergoing. are cruel hardships that no one should ever have to endure. Although this measure focuses primarily upon the domestic aspect of this problem and improves the way our Government addresses the problems that may be associated with missing or exploited children. I want to highlight an issue that I have become increasingly involved with. the problem of internationally abducted children. In an interdependent world. we are finding American citizens often marrying and having children with foreign nationals and a corresponding increase in the number of children that are taken to or illegally retained in another country. This measure highlights the excellent work of our National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I join in commending that organization and add my voice to those who feel that the role of NCMEC should be straightened in the cases of international parental abductions. Our citizens deserve an able advocate for their rights as parents. and I am confident that NCMEC is the appropriate organization to serve this vital function. There are efforts underway in some parts of our Government to curtail NCMECs role in assisting our citizens recover their illegally abducted or wrongfully retained children from other countries. I urge that all supporters of this measure exercise their vigilance to make certain that does not occur. Our citizens who are victims of child abduction deserve to have an organization such as the NCMEC to support them. I thank the gentleman from Delaware for his courtesy in yielding. and I urge our colleagues to fully approve S. 249 on behalf of our missing. exploited and runaway children. E] 1045",

Polly Klaas was taken from her home at knife point during a slumber party while her mother slept in the next room. Richard Allen Davis. the brutal kidnapper. was later stopped by police in a nearby community. The officers did not know that there was a suspect being sought at that moment. so unfortunately they let him go. Could Polly have been saved if a more sophisticated computer system had been in place allowing different police jurisdictions to communicate? Well never know. What I do know is thatthanks to a COPS grant recently awarded to the Sonoma County Police Consortiumsuch a computer system will soon be in place. This $6.2 million grant will permit the agencies in my district to upgrade dispatch systems. connect mobile police units. and increase the efficiency in filing incident reports. This is just one important step in improving our safely net for children. I am forever heartbroken that we were not able to save Polly. but I know that the best way we can honor Polly and other missing children is by doing our utmost to prevent such atrocities from happening to another child. another family. another community.

Today I would like to focus on one specific facet of this Act. the authorization of Congressional support for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Since 1984. the Center has proven to be an invaluable resource for state and local governments who struggle each day to recover missing children and to prevent the exploitation of children. Through its tollfree hotline. its training programs for state and local professionals. and its coordination of recovery programs. the Center is a focal point mobilizing citizens and communities in the pursuit of safety for all of Americas children. The convergence of public and private resources in pursuit of this common goal has resulted in the recovery of more than 40.000 children--40.000 children who could have been lost without the contributions of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Center is particularly important to South Florida because one of its affiliated programs. the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center. was established by Congress in 1996 in memory of my constituent. Jimmy Ryce. the son of Don and Claudine Ryce. In 1995. at 9 years of age. Jimmy was abducted and brutally murdered while walking home from school. The Ryce Center. a joint project of the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Justice Departments Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. trains Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs in the most uptodate methods of searching for missing children. The Ryce Center promotes swift. effective investigative response to missing and exploited children cases. provides comprehensive training in case investigations. ensures the consistent and meaningful use of reporting systems. and promotes the use of important national resources to assist in these cases. The Ryce Center is an invaluable resource to law enforcement officials throughout the country. and in just a few short years has made enormous strides in changing the way America deals with cases of missing and exploited children.

Unfortunately. Mr. Gongadzes disappearance takes place in an increasingly unhealthy media environment. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists. his disappearance follows several suspect or inconclusive investigations into the suspicious deaths of several Ukrainian journalists over the last few years and the beatings of two journalists following their articles about official corruption this year. This disappearance has occurred within an environment which has made it increasingly difficult for professional journalists to operate. including harassment by tax police. criminal libel prosecutions. the denial of access to statecontrolled newsprint and printing presses. and phone calls to editors suggesting that they censure certain stories. Such an atmosphere clearly has a chilling effect on press freedom. Mr. Speaker. I am encouraged that the Verkhovna Radathe Ukraines parliamenthas formed a special ad hoc committee to investigate Mr. Gongadzes disappearance. I am also hopeful that the Ukraines Ministry of Intemal Affairs and other law enforcement agencies will conduct a serious. vigorous investigation to solve the case of this missing journalist. As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission and as someone who has a longstanding interest in the Ukraine. I am deeply disappointed that the Ukraines relatively positive human rights record has been tarnished by an environment not conducive to the development of a free media. I remain hopeful that the Ukrainian authorities will make every effort to reverse this situation.",

I wish to extend my sincere congratulations on their progress. Since its founding 89 years ago. the Republic of China on Taiwan has attained many remarkable achievements. Their progress ought to be recognized by the United States and emulated by the entire world community. For instance. Taiwans economy is robust. In June of this year. exports and imports grew nearly 25 percent from the previous year. This growth is due in large part to Taiwans embrace of the new economy. specifically information and high technologies. Not only has Taiwan experienced strong economic growth. but Taiwan is also a democracy in the truest sense of the word. Taiwan upholds the freedoms we. as Americans. hold dear. including free elections. free media. and free expression. Mr. Speaker. Taiwan is truly a model of success for many countries in the world.

Volunteer Fire Department for 23 years and Assistant Chief for 10 of those. David gave the ultimate gift of life to save that of another. David. along with other members of the Idalou and Lorenzo Volunteer Fire Departments. arrived at the scene of a onevehicle rollover to find the driver trapped beneath a water truck. In an effort to free the driver. Assistant Chief Butler helped set up air bags to lift the truck off the pavement. Once the bags were inflated. he operated the controls to raise the truck. and the man was soon freed from the wreckage and transported to a local hospital. As firefighters were loading their equipment for the return home. David collapsed never to regain consciousness.

Many veterans have trouble getting to and from VA hospitals. The legislation that I am introducing today would create a coin commemorating Executive Order 5398. signed by President Herbert Hoover on July 21. 1930. which established the Veterans Administration. The proceeds from the sale of this coin would fund a transportation program for veterans. provided by the Disabled American Veterans. This program provides a muchneeded service to our nations veterans. The DAV provides transportation services to veterans to and from VA hospitals. Considering the fact that many veterans live far away from VA hospitals and are disabled. the lack of transportation can be a very serious impediment to adequate health care. In my home state of Washington. the Veterans Administration hospital in Seattle serves the entire Pacific Northwest. Many of the patients who rely upon the care provided by the VA have severe disabilities that prevent them from easily accessing the clinic. Public transportation serves those veterans that live in the Metropolitan area. but for the thousands of veterans without access to public transportation. the DAV steps in to provide door to door services. This essential program is truly the missing link for veterans health care. The DAV has recognized this need by creating the transportation program. This program has been very successful so far. But it only operates in a few select areas and serves only a handful of veterans. This program should be available to all veterans. but the DAV simply cannot afford to fund a project of that magnitude. This bill would create the funds necessary to expand this program.

The column is by Dr. Harold Varmus. a distinguished Nobel Laureate and former director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who is now president of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York City. Dr. Varmus point is that Congress needs to be investing adequately in science spending across the board. not just at NIH. Improvements in medicine rest on advancements in a wide variety of fields. we cant improve health in this country by focusing exclusively on NIH. This is advice we would be wise to heed. The federal research portfolio has become too skewed toward medical research. We need to address that imbalance not by reducing funding for NIH but by increasing funding for the other federal research agencies. That would be a wise investment in this time of surplus. Im pleased to say that Congress is beginning to take steps in that direction. I know. for example. that the appropriations bill my good friend and neighbor Congressman JIM WALSH has put together includes a substantial increase for the National Science Foundation (NSF). But we need to make a comprehensive. consistent commitment to funding the entire federal science portfolio more generously. I look forward to working with my colleagues to accomplish just that.

The BornAlive Infants Protection Act of 2000. which is designed to ensure that all infants who are born alive are treated as persons for purposes of federal law. passed the House with 385 votes. It has long been accepted legal principle that infants who are born alive are persons and are entitled to the full protection of the law. In fact. many states have statutes that. with some variations. explicitly enshrine this principle as a matter of state law. and some federal courts have recognized the principle in interpreting federal laws. But recent changes in the legal and cultural landscape appear to have brought this wellsettled principle into question. Babies whose lungs are insufficiently developed to permit sustained survival are often spontaneously delivered alive. and they may live for hours or days. Others are born alive following deliveries induced for medical reasons. or following attempted abortions. Enactment of H.R. 4292 is necessary to ensure that all infants who are born alive are treated as legal persons for purposes of federal law. H.R. 4292 is proposed to codify (for federal law purposes only) the traditional definition of \"born alive\" that is already found in the laws of most states: complete expulsion from the mother. accompanied by heartbeat. respiratory. and/or voluntary movements.

That is an important first step we must take prior to adding additional requirements to an already overwhelmed agency. What this entire debate has shown us is that we must do a better job of providing the INS and Customs with additional personnel to man the portsofentry.

As you all know. we have been grasping for a solution to the Section 110 problem for several years now. And now. through months of hard work and negotiations. I am pleased to lend my full support to this bipartisan solution to this vexing problem. This legislation will amend Section 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act in two ways. First. this bill will create a database to integrate and centralize the information that is already collected about aliens entering and leaving the United States. This solution will impose no new information collection requirements. Second. the bill establishes a task force that will issue findings and recommendations on enhancing data collection. The task force will also study and make recommendations on how to improve congestion at border points and facilitate border crossings. This task force will be made up of representatives of the public sector including agencies with interests in trade. tourism. transportation. immigration. law enforcement. national security and the environment. The task force will also include private sector representatives from affected industries. Section 110. as written in the 1996 Immigration Reform law. would have had a devastating impact on the economies of border communities. By requiring a record of every person entering and leaving the US. border crossings would have been effectively shut down. The lengthy delays that are already experienced at border crossings would have been increased to a near stand still. This legislation today. accomplishes the laudable goal for section 110. without effecting border traffic. Tracking aliens in the United States is something we need to facilitate. This bill will do that. I am thrilled that we have come to this important compromise.

This law ensures that homeowners have the right to cancel their Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) on their home mortgages once the homeowner attains a certain level of equity in the home (usually 22%. but in some cases 20%). Provisions included in this legislation were also included in H.R. 1776 which was approved by the House. with my support. on This legislation clarifies that PMI cancellation rights for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMS) are based on the amortization schedule that is currently in affect. This will ensure that consumers get full benefit of any adjustments that have been made based upon recent calculations. In addition. this legislation ensures that balloon mortgages are also treated as ARMs so that consumers will receive the full benefit of any interest changes that are favorable to them. This bill ensures that consumers with a \"good payment history\" have the right to cancel their PMI. In the past. there has been some confusion about what this term means. This legislation would make technical corrections so there is less ambiguity about this term. This measure includes a proviso that clarifies that these PMI cancellation rights only apply to mortgages originated after the 1998 laws enactment date. Finally. this bill ensures that consumers can cancel their PMI after the cancellation date as long as they have paid all of their PMI charges. The original law did not provide their consumer protection provision. As a result. consumers had only one opportunity to cancel their PMI. I strongly urge my colleague to support this corrective legislation that will protect consumers and improve the Homeowners Protection Act.",

H.R. 791 authorizes a study be completed for a potential addition to the National Trails System. Specifically. this bill would study the designation of the route the British took in their invasion of Maryland and Washington. the District of Columbia. and the route of the American defense during the War of 1812. The proposed trail would stretch through six Maryland counties. Washington. D.C.. and the City of Baltimore. where the trail would ultimately lead to Fort McHenry. Fort McHenry. of course. is where. on September 14. 1814. American forces bravely turned back the British invasion of Baltimore and was the event which sparked Francis Scott Key to pen our national anthem. The designation of this route as a National Historic Trail would serve as a reminder of the importance of the concept of liberty and give long overdue recognition to the patriots who preserved this liberty for future generations of America. Mr. Chairman. we have all workeUd hard on this bill and addressed the concerns of both the minority and the administration. This is a good bill. and we have bipartisan support on this bill. It is supported by the National Park Service. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 791. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time. l 1445",

Mr. Chairman. under the National Trails System Act. any route proposed for designation as a national historic trail must be studied to determine the suitability and feasibility of such a designation. H.R. 791 would authorize such a study of the route taken by British troops during the invasion of the United States during the War of 1812. The route crosses nine counties in Maryland and passes through the cities of both Washington and Baltimore. There is no doubt many of the sites along this proposed site are significant in American history. Not only did British forces lay siege to the U.S. Capitol and eventually burn it down. but it was during the ultimate American victory of Fort McHenry that a local attorney named Francis Scott Key penned what is now our national anthem. A study of these sites for a national historic trail can only serve to deepen our knowledge of the importance of these events in our history. During our committees consideration of this measure. an amendment was adopted ensuring that this new study will be carefully coordinated with several ongoing studies with which there could be some overlap. Such coordination will improve the final result of each of these products. This is a bipartisan bill where both sides have worked closely to have this bill passed. and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 791. as amended. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

It was also noted that NPS already administers several entire national park units that are historically tied to World War II veterans. However. we learned at the hearing that there is general agreement to provide some sort of recognition to veterans at a more suitable location. known as Miller Field. within the Gateway National Recreation Area.

Gordon has committed his summers to helping Dr. Laura de Ghetaldi with her orphaned fawn and injured deer rehabilitation program south of Boulder. This has not always been an easy task. He has bottle fed injured deer. tracked down poachers who have shot rereleased deer. and he has grieved when some of the deer died after valiant attempts to save their lives. Such was the case this year when a black bear mauled and killed all of the fawns and adult deer in the rehabilitation program. In addition to his rehabilitation work. Gordon has participated in the Boulder County Junior Ranger Program committing long hours to repairing and building trailheads. He also volunteers in the surgical unit and the Foster Program at the Humane Society of Boulder County. On top of his volunteerism. Gordon is a solid student at Fairview High School where he competes on the track and crosscountry teams.

She was born October 10. 1898. the second of seven children born to Gertrude and Charles Skeete. She came to the United States in 1922 and soon after met and married K. Claude Mitchell. They had two children. both of whom have enjoyed professional success. Mrs. Mitchell acquired from her grandmother a recognition that a good education is a necessity. She and her siblings were all educated and her children continued that fine tradition here in the United States. Her son Claude. Jr. received his MSW from City University and her daughter Joan is active in the Alumnae chapter of Delta Sigma Theta. After her husband died. she raised her children while working at New York Cornell Hospital as a dietitian assistant. At her family birthday party in October of last year. family members came from as far away as Barbados. Canada. Massachusetts and Virginia as well as the tristate area to celebrate her centenary. One nephew from Barbados. who is Consul to Sweden. brought her a gold heart as a symbol of the kind heartedness she showed him and others of the family. Another. a Dean at Howard University. served as emcee. Mrs. Mitchell still is a member of St. Ambrose Episcopal Church. She epitomizes what immigrants have done for America. Giving all and raising children who. with every generation. contribute still more. We are fortunate that she came to us and I congratulate her on this special birthday.",

We hear that they simply do not care about the issues at all. except those narrow issues that affect them personally. With so many repeating this view. I am pleased to highlight the efforts of young people in Illinois 10th District that contradict this stereotype. I recently received a package of letters from David Hirsch. a teacher in the Deerfield High School English Department. His sophomore English class had used the issues in my annual constituent survey for a policy debate unit. and as part of this unit. each student wrote a letter to me detailing their opinions on some of these issues. The 56 letters that I received from these young constituents were not only impressive in that they were wellthought out and wellwritten. but equally impressive in the genuine concern that these young men and women showed for issues ranging from the protection of the Earth from pollution to the protection of children from guns. These students also expressed concern about people in other nations. and our relationships with other countries like Russia and Iraq. Clearly. these young people are interested in more than just their personal agendas. Sophomores. they may be. but they are hardly sophomoric. If I may. Mr. Speaker. Id like to enter into the record the names of these students to recognize their efforts. They are: Josh Baker. Katherine Bolton. Jon Chester. Greg Cole. Jenny Eck. Julie Fiocchi. Jay Gustafson. Lexi Hayes. Janna Hoffman. Sari Hirsch. Bridgette Jung. Sandi Kaplan. Nancy Keene. Chris Krakowski. Stephanie Laouras. Kerry Lee. Elliott Levy. Elaine London. Andrew Mast. Steve Meisinger.

I rise today to introduce legislation which provides much needed tax relief to working Americans who travel extensively for a living and are subject to the hours of service limitations of the Department of Transportation. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included a provision which phased in over ten years an increase in the deductibility of business meal expenses from 50 percent to 80 percent for these individuals. However. that phase in is simply too long. My legislation is very straightforward. It will accelerate the timetable and make the 80 percent deduction effective for tax years beginning after December 31. 1999. Like current law. the acceleration is applicable to individuals subject to Department of Transportation hours of service limitations. This measure is important because the Federal government requires thousands of workers to spend many nights away from home. As a result. these individuals spend funds on meals that would otherwise not be expended. These expenses are not made on elaborate. expensive business meals. These purchases are more typically made at roadside facilities when travelers must stop for the night in order to comply with Federal regulations. However. the consistency of these required purchases ensure even frugal meal purchases add up to significant amounts annually. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in the effort to provide a modest tax reduction for the working men and women of this country who travel the highways for a living.",

May 21. 1999. the Gary NAACP will hold its 36th Annual Life Membership Banquet and Scholarship Dinner at the St. Timothy Community Church in Gary. Indiana. This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity. and others like it. go directly to the organizations needed programs and advocacy efforts. In addition. the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the activities. accomplishments. and accolades of the local and national chapters of the NAACP on an annual basis. The featured speaker at this gala event will be South Carolinas Congressman James E. Clyburn. Representative Clyburn represents the 6th Congressional District of South Carolina and was first elected to Congress in November of 1992. He currently serves as the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and is a Life Member of the NAACP. This year the Gary NAACP will honor five outstanding leaders for their efforts to further equality in society. Joining more than five hundred outstanding civil. community. and religious leaders of the region. the following distinguished individuals will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP: Louise Lee. Foster Stephens. and Father Pat Gaza of Gary. Indiana. James Sudlek of Hammond. Indiana. and Joyce Washington of Calumet City. Illinois. The Gary NAACP was organized in 1915 by a group of residents that felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of AfricanAmericans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization. of which the Gary branch is a member. focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and jobrelated settings. Like the national organization. the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice. discrimination. and unfair treatment in our society. Mr. Speaker. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Louise Lee. Foster Stephens. James Sudlek.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today for the purpose of introducing the Stalking Prevention and Victim Protection Act of 1999. This legislation addresses a problem of increasing prevalence in our nation. While stalking is perhaps most popularly regarded as a crime only to be dealt with by celebrities with bodyguards and fortresslike estates. this is simply not the case. According to statistics released by the Justice Department. over 1.000.000 women and 370.000 men are victimized by stalkers every year. These estimates greatly exceed previous estimates. and clearly indicate a need for legislative redress. For this reason. I am reintroducing legislation that will provide greater protection to stalking victims. This legislation builds on an important antistalking law enacted in 1996. The Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act. which was introduced by my colleague Congressman Royce. marked a significant stride in the effort to stop and prevent stalking. as it established for the first time federal penalties for interstate stalking. My bill seeks to enhance the ability of law enforcement to arrest and prosecute stalkers by broadening the definition of stalking to include interstate communications such as mail and email. Furthermore. by criminalizing \"threatening behavior\" as opposed to \"the demonstration of specific threats.\" this bill closes a loophole commonly used by accused stalkers to avoid conviction. The bill also include bail restrictions and enhanced sentencing provisions for repeatoffenders. along with the requirement that a mandatory protection order be issued for the victim. Ive seen firsthand the horrible effects wrought on the lives of innocent people by stalkers. Ive met people who face each day with an overwhelming fear for their safety. people whose spirits have been worn down by a undaunted menace. Congress must do more to protect these people. and I see this legislation as an important step in that direction. I certainly hope that my colleagues will agree with me.",

From physical assault to health care fraud and telemarketing scams. which cost Americans approximately $40 billion per year. our seniors are being abused physically and financially. Such abuses take place intentionally. but also in the form of neglect. For example. seniors in nursing homes often fail to receive the care and medications they needan alarming occurrence considering that some experts estimate that over 40 percent of seniors will need some form of nursing care.

It takes a twopronged approachprevention and punishmentto crimes against seniors. including health care fraud. injury. telemarketing scams. nursing home neglect. In addressing prevention. the bill directs the Attorney General to conduct a study of what crimes are committed. what the risk factors are. and what strategies can prevent future occurrences. From that information. we can create real solutions to this everincreasing problem. The bill also directs the Sentencing Commission to determine whether enhanced punishments would deter such crimes from recurring. We are facing a crisis in this countrya crisis of abuse and neglect of Americas seniors. With this legislation. we can work in a bipartisan manner with our colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure that they are not taken advantage of anymore.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. first let me thank and congratulate my distinguished colleague. the senior Senator from New York. for his leadership throughout the years on this most important domestic program. Social Security. There is no program of greater importance and interest to the American people than Social Security. The distinguished Senator. Mr. MOYNIHAN. as I said. throughout his career has played a critical role in the development. the preserving. and the strengthening of this important program. I thank him and congratulate him. As Senator MOYNIHAN pointed out. the Senate is now turning to the vote to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. an important step in preparing Social Security for the 21st century. This repeal is good for seniors. it is good for America. and it is good government. As we have heard. the Social Security earnings limit was enacted 65 years ago to encourage older persons to retire during the Great Depression. But today. with Americans living longer. and the tightest labor market in 30 years. this rule is not only outdated. but it harms both our senior citizens and the economy. Repealing the earnings limit will help improve the retirement security of seniors by giving them the choice to work longer and to save more. Abolishing the earnings limit will allow us to protect the Nations economic gains of the past 17 years by encouraging our Nations most experienced workers to continue working. not only for today but into the future. Finally. repealing the earnings limit is just plain good government. It will save the Social Security Administration money and reduce very common. frustrating mistakes in calculating benefits. So let me say. I urge each Senator to support this bill. I am happy to yield the remaining time to the distinguished assistant leader of the majority.",

As a result. retirees would see their FICA tax reduced from 7.65 percent of their paycheck to 6.885 percent. Because taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned. this tax reduction would benefit all income levels of retirees. including those who choose to work parttime. RARE II would provide individuals who have reached the full retirement age with a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the lesser of the amount of income tax owed or the earned income of the individual. This provision would effectively reward older Americans who continue to earn and to pay taxes after reaching retirement age. Mr. President. in closing. I want to reiterate my strong support for the underlying bill being discussed today. The elimination of the Social Security earnings test would be a huge step toward ending the disincentives for seniors to work if they choose. But I hope this is only a first step in adjusting policy governing seniors in the workplace. Other changes contained in the RARE bills. which I have described. as well as the repeal of the Clinton Administrations 1993 tax on Social Security benefits. would reaffirm the importance of seniors in our society. The health of our economy and even our national strength will increasingly depend on retaining the services of productive seniors. We should begin constructing these policies now. Thank you.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased the Senate is taking action on the H.R. 5. the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 2000. This legislation eliminates the earnings test for Social Security recipients between the full retirement age (currently 65) and age 69. The measure will be retroactive to January 1. 2000. I have long supported changing the Social Security earnings test. which the amount of income recipients may earn before their benefits are reduced. Under current law. recipients aged 65 through 69 can earn up to $17.000 per year without penalty. But beyond that. benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings. This year. approximately 800.000 seniors will lose benefits. Repealing the earnings test will allow older Americans who have skills and expertise to continue working and making a contribution to society and to our economy. I am concerned about the Social Security earnings test and realize the difficulties that many older Americans experience because of it. For many seniors. working beyond the age of 65 is necessary just to make ends meet. Changing the earnings limit will allow them to earn extra income without losing hardearned Social Security benefits. They have spent a lifetime working for these benefits and they should get them. whether they choose to continue to work or not. I have supported past legislation to raise the earnings test limit. Today. I fully support this legislation to eliminate the earnings test for all individuals who have reached full retirement age. This bill is especially important to North Dakota because we have one of the highest rates of seniors receiving Social Security benefits. I am also pleased because this bill is fiscally responsible. In the long term. it will not have any financial impact on our Social Security trust fund. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. for too many years I have worked in support of repealing the unfair Annual Earnings Test on Social Security. Incredibly. working seniors currently forfeit one dollar of Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn over the earnings limit of $17.000. If an American spends a lifetime paying into the Social Security system with the guarantee that he or she will get their money when he or she turns 62 or 65 years old. no one should be able to take those benefits away simply because the beneficiary wants to keep working. Why should the federal government be discouraging those seniors who want to keep on working from doing so? As our country faces increasing demands for labor. we can ill afford to deprive ourselves of the skills and experience Americas seniors have to offer. The federal government shouldnt be in the position of discouraging anyone from working: seniors should be allowed to make their own decisions. Over the past few weeks. I have listened to and read the comments of numerous Washington state seniors who lose a portion of their hardearned Social Security benefits simply because they do not wish to retire or stop working. I have been listening to these same comments for many years. and I can honestly say that today it looks as if common sense will finally prevail and a solution will pass the House and the Senate. Importantly. President Clinton recently changed his position on this issue and now says he will sign this legislation to abolish the Earnings Test. I will cast my vote for abolishing this unfair tax. Repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test is a victory for seniors and every generation of Americans.",

This is a change I have advocated for many years. So I am very pleased we are taking this important step. This legislation. H.R. 5. is an important step for a number of reasons. First. it is simply the right thing to do. There should not be a penalty for working. Second. we are now facing and will continue to face tight labor markets. In my State of Iowa. this is an acute problem in some areas. By eliminating the earnings penalty. experienced workers who were discouraged from continuing in or rejoining the work force will have a new incentive to work. The emergence of the Internet and home computers offers tremendous opportunities for seniors to work at home. Marrying these new job opportunities with a repeal of the earnings penalty will become even more important as the Baby Boomers retire. Third. a large number of older Americans need the income. Over half of todays workers have no pension plans outside of Social Security. They are going to need additional sources of income to maintain their standard of living. Some critics have expressed concern that this change would have a negative budgetary impact. I believe that by attracting more Americans back into the work force. either on a fulltime or parttime basis. it will strengthen Social Security and the federal budget. And I believe they will add to the productivity of our nation. I am pleased that the Senate has been able to come together on a strong bipartisan basis to pass this bill.

It is my understanding that this year in the Northeast corridor there is a potential threat associated with high electric prices as a consequence of the likelihood that. indeed. some of the oilfired plants are going to have to be put on line to meet peak demand.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I appreciate the majority leaders effort to try to move this legislation along. This bill. the bankruptcy bill. passed the Senate with more than 80 votes. Whether or not we get unanimous consent is not relevant. What is relevant is that we get these two pieces of legislation successfully completed in a timely manner. If we are not able to get unanimous consent. I intend to support finding a way to assure that we do go to conference both on the bankruptcy bill and the minimum wage. I am hopeful we can instruct the conferees with regard to minimum wage. It would be my hope. at least. that the Senate could express itself in regard to the issue on minimum wage prior to the time we go to conference. But if we could accommodate that request. that we have at least an opportunity to express ourselves on the conference itself. then I would certainly be supportive of moving on a motion to proceed to two conferencesone on bankruptcy and one on minimum wage. The distinguished Senator from Vermont. and others. Senator TORRICELLI. Senator DURBIN. and others. have done an extraordinary job in getting us to this point. We have a much better bill. a stronger bill. in the Senate on bankruptcy than we do in the House. I hope we can take what we have been able to accomplish in the Senate and bring our House colleagues to the realization that that is the kind of legislation that will be signed into law. On the minimum wage. the House version. at least in terms of the 2year approach. is the one the President said he will support. It enjoys strong support in the Senate as well. We are concerned about the size and magnitude of the tax provisions. If we could target those. we would be in good shape on that as well. I understand the majority leaders interest in moving this. We want to be supportive in that regard: most of us do. I am hopeful we can accomplish it through a unanimous consent request.",

The message of the President is as follows: To the Senate of the United States: With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the Convention (No. 182) Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. adopted by the International Labor Conference at its 87th Session in Geneva on June 17. 1999. I transmit herewith a certified copy of that Convention. I transmit also for the Senates information a certified copy of a recommendation (No. 190) on the same subject. adopted by the International Labor Conference on the same date. which amplifies some of the Conventions provisions. No action is called for on the recommendation. The report of the Department of State. with a letter from the Secretary of Labor. concerning the Convention is enclosed. As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of Labor. current United States law and practice satisfy the requirements of Convention No. 182. Ratification of this Convention. therefore. should not require the United States to alter in any way its law or practice in this field. In the interest of clarifying the domestic application of the Convention. my Administration proposes that two understandings accompany U.S. ratification. The proposed understandings are as follows: -The United States understands that Article 3(d) of Convention 182 does not encompass situations in which children are employed by a parent or by a person standing in the place of a parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person. -The United States understands that the term \"basic education\" in Article 7 of Convention 182 means primary education plus one year: eight or nine years of schooling. based on curriculum and not age. These understandings would have no effect on our international obligations under Convention No. 182. Convention No. 182 represents a true breakthrough for the children of the world. Ratification of this instrument will enhance the ability of the United States to provide global leadership in the effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. I recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO Convention No.",

Now. the tax bill is going to give this worker $136 a year. The worker already is not able to pay his or her bills. buy longterm care insurance. pay the house mortgage and get the kids to college. So I suggest that it is very disingenuous to gratuitously say to that worker. go ahead and save 160 bucks a month. we will give you $136 a year towards it.

They have said to the owners of small businesses and the owners of family farms. \"Die baby. Die in the next 10 years. and you can give the farm away to your kids tax free. But if you live. it goes right back up. and we sock you for a big inheritance tax.\" They change the rules to make funny speeches. We argued here sometime ago about a 60 percent rule. screaming that only the irresponsible people in this House would vote to raise taxes and they needed a supermajority. Well. with this bill they are going to raise taxes. and they have had to waive their own rules.

As Chairman Greenspan said. let the surpluses run. pay down the debt. or let the deficits grow again. The Republicans are back at it. letting the deficits grow again. And even if the budget assumptions are correct. and those assumptions are wrong. there would be no money left to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. The chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means has a Social Security plan that would use the same trillion dollars that he is using for the tax cut. Look. the choice in 8 or 9 or 10 years would be this. Continue the tax cuts that are in this bill and explode the deficit or let the tax cuts expire and that would be the biggest tax increase in American history. $175 billion a year. if we let this bill be sunsetted. The Republicans like to talk about the biggest American tax increase in history in 1993. $275 billion over 5 years. This would be. under their plan. if there is a sunset. a $175 billion tax increase in a year. Lastly. this bill is grossly unfair. If the Republicans shed any tears here. they are crocodile tears for middle and lowincome taxpayers. Here is what Deloitte & Touche says: A couple with an annual income of $50.000 with 2 children would get a tax cut of $265. a couple with $200.000 would get a tax cut of $2.720. and. look. the millionaire would receive a tax cut of $9.861 compared to the family of $50.000. $265.

H.R. 3456 is very similar to H.R. 1761. which was considered under suspension of the rules and agreed to by voice vote on August 2. It makes significant improvements in the ability of the Copyright Act to deter copyright infringement by amending it to increase the statutory penalties for infringement. Copyright piracy. Mr. Speaker. is flourishing in the world. With the advanced technologies available and the fact that many computer users are either ignorant of the copyright laws or simply believe that they will not be caught or punished. the piracy trend will continue. One way to combat this problem is to increase the statutory penalties for copyright infringement so that they will be an effective deterrent to this conduct. Another significant aspect of H.R. 3456 addresses a problem on regarding the difficulty of prosecuting crimes against intellectual property. It instructs that within 120 days on enactment of this act or within 120 days after there is a sufficient number of voting members to constitute a quorum. the United States Sentencing Commission shall promulgate emergency guideline amendments to implement the sentencing mandate in the No Electronic Theft. popularly known as the NET Act. which became law in the 105th Congress. It is vital that the United States recognizes intellectual property rights and provides strong protection and enforcement against violation of those rights. This legislation. Mr. Speaker. makes significant and necessary improvements to the Copyright Act.

I rise in strong support of this resolution which was introduced by my colleague on the Committee on International Relations and chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights the gentleman from New Jersey and congratulate him on his good work. Most Americans. and. for that matter. most Members of Congress probably had not heard of Falun Gong until last summer when the Chinese dictatorship banned and started throwing thousands of people in jail for practicing it. It is hardly surprising people that Chinese is systematically arresting. torturing and even killing its own citizens for wanting to practice their faith. which is what Falun Gong is. This is the same gang of dictators. after all. that persecutes Christians. Muslims and Buddhists and winks at forced abortions. But even though this latest purge is completely in character. it is a perfect illustration why we need to radically alter our relations with that dictatorship. Because when Beijing decided to make practicing Falun Gong a capital offense. which is exactly what the rubberstamp Chinese congress did before the visit to Beijing of our trade representative Charlene Barshefsky. we are seeing that life in the Peoples Republic is not much different from 10 years ago when the Peoples Liberation Army turned its tanks and machine guns on the people in Tiananmen Square who wanted nothing less than the very same political liberty that lets us stand here tonight and debate this resolution. As I speak there are thousands of men and women in China who are being beaten and killed for choosing to believe in ideals we take for granted in this country. whether it is our faith in God. our right to vote or simply wanting to belong to Falun Gong. As we consider. Mr. Speaker. permanent NTR next year to China. let us remember what the Communist Chinese are doing to the Falun Gong. Mr. Speaker. further reserving the right to object.

For the last 18 years. John ran the computers and books for the Colorado Republican Party. In his time at the party. he was a pioneer of the mailing list.

With this advancement. those who John served were able to do targeted mailings. therefore better contacting constituents and ultimately. better serving the people. There may not be a Colorado Republican in legislative or statewide office today who wasnt helped by a mailing list generated by John. Amazingly. John managed to serve five very different Republican chairman. In addition. he once served as Boulder County GOP chairman. Although his professional accomplishments will long be remembered and admired. most who knew him well will remember John Dorrenbacher. above all else. as someone who loved his country and had a deep faith in our democracy.

Im introducing this legislation. because these survivors deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the Pension Offset currently allows. They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work. not penalized for it. Many workers affected by this Offset policy are women. or clerical workers and bus drivers who are currently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These are people who worked hard as federal employees. school teachers. or firefighters. Frankly. I would repeal this policy all together. But. I realize that budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise. I hope we can agree that retirees who work hard should not have this offset applied until their combined monthly benefit exceeds $1.200. In the few cases where retirees might have their benefits reduced by this policy change. my legislation will calculate their pension offset by the current method. I also have a provision in this legislation to index the minimum amount of $1.200 to inflation so retirees will see their minimum benefits increase as the cost of living increases. I believe that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane. legislative technicalities. Thats why Im introducing this bill today. Representative WILLIAM JEFFERSON of Louisiana has introduced similar legislation in the House. I look forward to working with him to modify the harsh Pension Offset rule. If the federal government is going to force government workeis and retirees in Maryland and across the country to give up a portion of their spousal benefits. the retirees should at least receive a fair portion of their benefits.

    "speech": "designated pilot examiner. In May 1996. FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings. except his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case. it would appear that FAA found no real reason to pursue an \"emergency\" revocation. I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the NTSB. but I believe a reasonable person would conclude that in the Ted Stewart case the Board. believes as I do. that there is an abuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA. This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989. emergency cases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more than doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1.107 enforcement cases. Of those. 66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995. the NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases. of those 160 were emergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice. At my request. the General Accounting Office (GAO) did a study of emergency revocation actions taken by the FAA between 1990 and 1997. The most troubling result of the GAO study is that during time frame studied. 50 percent of the emergency renovations were issued four months to two years after the violation occurred. In only 4% of the cases was the emergency revocation issued within ten days or less of the actual violation. In fact. the median time lapse between the violation and the emergency order was a little over four months (132 days).

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill along with my colleague Senator INHOFE. which makes a technical correction to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill will end a frivolous lawsuit. clarify the intent of Congress and allow our State regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency to focus on protecting underground drinking water. This bill clarifies the Safe Drinking Water Act by exempting hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection. Hydraulic fracturing is a process used in the production of coalbed methane. This process uses high pressure water. carbon dioxide and sand to create microscopic fractures in coal seams to release and extract methane. oil and gas. Most states in which hydraulic fracturing is used. including my own state of Alabama. have in place regulations to ensure hydraulic fracturing continues to be a technique used in a safe manner. This technique has been used safely by coalbed methane. oil and gas producers for over fifteen years and has never been attributed to causing even a single case of contamination to an underground drinking water source. On May 3rd of 1994. the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation (LEAF) submitted a Petition for Promulgation of a Rule to withdraw the EPAs approval for the state of Alabamas Underground Injection Control (UIC) program. LEAF cited a case in Alabama of alleged drinking well contamination to justify its lawsuit. The EPA carefully reviewed this petition and on May 5th of 1995 the Administrator of the EPA. Carol Browner wrote to LEAF and stated \"based on that review. I have determined that Alabamas implementation of the UIC program is consistent with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act\". Administrator Browner continued \"There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of underground sources of drinking water\". I ask unanimous consent that a complete copy of the text of that letter be inserted into the RECORD.",

    "speech": "This single case in Alabama which initiated the LEAF lawsuit was investigated by three regulatory agencies. the State Oil and Gas Board of Alabama. the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. None of the three regulatory agencies could find any contamination attributable to hydraulic fracturing activities or levels of any contaminate exceeding Safe Drinking Water Act standards. In fact. a nationwide search for cases of contamination attributed to hydraulic fracturing was conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ground Water Protection Council. Not a single case of contamination was discovered. As a result of the baseless lawsuit brought by the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation. the EPA has begun the process of stripping away the authority of the State of Alabama to implement its Underground Injection Control program. Both the EPA and the state of Alabama must now spend precious resources. which could otherwise be used to address real drinking water problems. to establish federal regulations for a technique which poses no environmental threat. The impact of this action will undoubtably be felt by the people in Alabama and across the nation who are threatened by and in many cases. experiencing the effects of ground water contamination as regulating agencies waste their resources to address this nonproblem.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today as an original cosponsor of the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999. I commend my colleague. Senator CRAIG. for bringing forward this important measure and am pleased to offer it my support. The National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999 will establish guidelines for public and local. State. and federal government involvement in the designation and planning of national monuments. Currently. under the 1906 Antiquities Act. the President has the authority to proclaim a national monument and determine its composition and scope without any prior or subsequent public involvement. Although this authority has rarely been invoked since the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. which mandates public comment periods prior to federal land management actions. the recent exercise of this authority by the current Administration has called attention to the need to revise the Antiquities Act. These proposed amendments to the Antiquities Act reflect the contemporary recognition that public involvement in federal land management decisions is both proper and beneficial. This measure. beyond requiring the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to include the public and the different levels of government in the decision to designate and form national monuments. also directs the Secretaries to research and make available information about the land to be designated. Factors such as the mineral values present and identification of existing rights held on federal lands within the area to be designated have an obvious bearing on the decision of whether designation is appropriate and. if it is. how it should be structured. An understanding of these factors should be a part of an inclusive decisionmaking process and. hence. it is appropriate to require that they be explored and publicly shared prior to the designation of a national monument. The strongest protection. however. that the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999 provides for public oversight of national monument designation is the requirement that any recommendation of the President for declaration of land as a national monument shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress. By subjecting proposals for monument designations to congressional approval. this Act ensures that when national monuments are established they are truly supported. both nationally and by local communities. This Act provides an important level of protection for public involvement in land use issues and I am pleased to offer it my support. By Mr. DURBIN:",

I rise today to introduce legislation that will help ensure that American soldiers are using American made products. \"Buy American\" laws guarantee that our nations military has access to a reliable domestic supply of uniforms. coats. and other apparel. This critical national security requirement has allowed U.S. garment manufacturers to consistently provide our armed forces with highquality. durable clothing products made to exact military specifications. Last year. I was deeply troubled to learn that an Inspector General audit found that 59 percent of government contracts at 12 military organizations failed to include the appropriate clause to implement Buy America laws. The results of this audit indicates a high likelihood that there have been widespread violations of these laws throughout the military. In response to these findings. I have introduced legislation directing the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct an audit of fiscal year 1998 procurements of military clothing by four installations of the Army. Navy. Air Force. and Marine Corps. These audits will help determine whether contracting officers are complying with the law when they procure military clothing and related items.

The continuing epidemic of gun violence involving children demands action by Congress. The School tragedies in Arkansas. Pennsylvania. Oregon. Kentucky. and Mississippi in the last year are still very much in the nations mind and on the nations conscience. We deplore the senseless injury and loss of life. the families torn apart. and the communities in fear. Sadly and tragically. the horrific shootings of last year do not tell the whole story. The fact is: We are losing 13 children every day in this country to gunshot wounds. Think about that13 children die every single day because of guns. We must do moremuch moreto prevent this senseless loss of childrens lives. We require aspirin bottles to be childproof. We know how to make handguns childproof tooand it is long past time we did so. The legislation we propose today is an important step in meeting our responsibility for the safety of children. We can take common sense. reasonable steps to keep children safer from gun violence by developing and using cuttingedge technology and by educating families and communities about preventing gun violence involving children. This legislation will help all of us to deal more responsibly with this festering crisis. Under this proposal. gun owners must take responsibility for securing their guns. so that children cannot use them. Gun dealers must be more vigilant in not selling guns and ammunition to children. Childproof safety locks must be used. Other child safety features for guns must be developed. America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real gunsand it is a national disgrace. Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more effectively from guns. and to achieve greater responsibility by parents. gun manufacturers and gun dealers. This legislation calls for such stepsand it deserves to be enacted this year by this Congress.

Since Chinas entrance into the WTO will be the most significant U.S.-China negotiation in the next several years. the contentious U.S.-China issues should be moving toward resolution before the conclusion of any agreement. Unfortunately. that is not currently the case. Most relevant to the WTO process is the exploding USChina trade deficit. In 1998. it reached a record $56.9 billion dollars. In fact. U.S. export to both Singapore ($15.6 billion) and Holland ($19 billion) were greater than exports to China ($14.2 billion). At the beginning of the decade. the deficit was a problematic but manageable $12.5 billion. Conversely. our large trading partners (the Europeans and Japan) have managed to maintain a relative trade balance with there Chinese counterparts. In fact. all of Chinas trade surplus is accounted for by the enormous imbalance with the United States. Moreover. the continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations. espionage and possible technology transfers suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter the WTO. Recently. the State Department released its annual human rights report concluding that the situation in China has degraded significantly over the past year. Additionally. we remain troubled by the allegations regarding the possible illegal transfer of technology to China. as well as lingering questions over Chinese espionage and involvement in U.S. elections. Any trade agreement with China would be premature before these issues are resolved. Although none of these concerns are new. the Administrations efforts to resolve these issues have been unfortunately unsuccessful. Regrettably. in fact. the pace of the China WTO negotiations appears to have increased. As a result. we believe that this legislation is both appropriate and timely. Congress must review any agreement. and all of the surrounding negotiations to ensure that it reflects traditional American values while protecting American interest.* By Mr. MURKOWSKI:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to oppose the Commerce. Justice. State appropriations rule and the bill. While there are many reasons to do so. I am especially disappointed in the committees decision to eliminate totally the funding for the Advanced Technology Program known as ATP. This means that not only is there no money for new research awards. but the research currently being supported will be terminated. In other words. current research contracts. current commitments. will not be kept. And who gets hurt by this cut? The hundreds of small businesses involved with ATP projects. Fiftyfive percent of all ATP projects are led by small businesses. and they participate in 70 percent of all of the ATP projects. In fact. small businesses receive about half of all ATP funding. and because Federal funds are limited to know more than 50 percent of the research projects cost. small businesses will be on the hook for the investment dollars. They have committed to the research. Also hurt are more than 100 universities that take part in this important project. including several in Michigan that are very involved in precompetitive research and technology efforts. This bill will terminate 240 research projects in 30 States representing a private sector investment of $931.5 million in private research dollars to create jobs. This is matched by $926.4 million in Federal funds. In other words. this shortsighted bill wastes almost $2 billion in publicprivate investment that will lead to real jobs for Americans. This bill is shortsighted at best. We know if we want to keep our strong economy going. we must continue to create cuttingedge technologies for the future. In Michigan we are doing that. and I would rise today to ask for a \"no\" vote on the rule and on the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. listening to these excuses this morning from our Republican colleagues. I cannot help but think how far this great Republican revolution has sagged. My colleagues claimed they wanted to change everything. and yet they justify this mornings adventure in fiscal responsibility on the grounds that we ought to keep doing things the same old way it has been done in the past. Last year. this Congress managed to pack in billions of dollars of pork into a weighty bill. weighing in at 40 pounds to be exact. something called the Omnibus Spending bill. Some of us called it the \"Octopus Spending\" bill. because of the strange reach of its long tentacles. Labeling projects as \"emergencies\" that did not have any genuine emergency associated with them at all was done for the sole purpose of avoiding the limitations of the Balanced Budget Act. Again this spring. billions of dollars of projects that did not have anything to do with Kosovo were given that very valued appellation \"emergency\" as a way of increasing defense spending while pretending to comply with the Balanced Budget Act. Apparently. getting away with such charades only whetted the appetites of those who come to this floor and preach fiscal restraint and then proceed to engage in this kind of gamesmanship. In this bill. they designate almost $5 billion for the 2000 Census. That is the same \"emergency\" that our Founding Fathers required us to do every decade in the United States Constitution. It is the same \"emergency\" that we have had every 10 years since the year 1790. This is not an emergency. it is just another example of Republicans cooking the books. Republicans say they want to get all of this money out of Washington with an irresponsible tax cut. Apparently. they just want protection from themselves. They really cry out. keep us from taking more money from Social Security for purposes that have nothing to do with Social Security at all. That is what they are doing this morning to pay for their phony \"emergency.\" Websters dictionary defines an \"emergency\" as \"an unforeseen combination of circumstances.\" Certainly. the census is not that. but the second definition is applicable. It is \"an urgent need for assistance or relief.\" That is what America needs relief from this kind of Republican fiscal irresponsibility. It is urgent. It is an emergency in that context.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to just take a moment. because as many in the House know. I have been. along with a number of my colleagues. fighting a battle against corporate welfare. Corporate welfare is defined as those governmental programs that cost the taxpayers more than the benefits they derive from the subsidies. The fact is that we have a breakthrough today in corporate welfare. and we need to celebrate the victories that we have. The chairman of the committee. the gentleman from Kentucky should receive large praise for his elimination of the advanced technology program. That is a program where government uses taxpayers dollars to pick winners and losers without any relationship at all to the marketplace. It is not the job in a free market system for the government to engage in the picking of winners and losers. particularly when the picking of winners and losers results in a bigger cost to the taxpayer than the benefit it brings to society. No one should be confused about what this term \"corporate welfare\" is all about. Many of my friends on the other side do not like the notion of tax cuts. Frankly. lowering the corporate tax burden works to the benefit of job creation. The creation and extension of making permanent the research and development tax credit is a system that will allow businesses to have the incentives to do the research that they should do for themselves that exists in the real world. Legal reform. a system that would set businesses free from the entanglements of lawsuits that in many cases make no rhyme nor reason to the kind of justice system that we all hope for. or simple regulatory reform that my friend. the gentleman from Indiana",

It gets more law enforcement officers on our streets. It reduces crime. It involves a minimum. of administrative expense and delay and a maximum amount of crime prevention. The only reason I can think of that they oppose the COPS program is that they did not think of it first. Through COPS. we have added in my home area of Travis County. Texas. the equivalent of almost 300 new law enforcement officers in our neighborhoods and on our roads. Chief Knee. Chief Buesing. and Sheriff Frazer who are outstanding local law enforcement officers. Through the COPS program. we say to them and to crime fighters across America. \"keep up the good work.\" We provide them the additional tools that they need to provide law enforcement that is highly visible and extremely effective. Some of these new officers in my hometown are helping to prevent school violence. some are addressing domestic violence. Some are combatting drugs and gang violence. Together. they are not only making our community safer. they are making all of us feel safer in our community. This week. I expect further announcements of the Troops to COPS program that permits some of our veterans who have gained skills in the military and need jobs the opportunity to transition into law enforcement. an excellent program. Yet. our Republican colleagues come forward today in this bill and propose to slash the COPS program by a billion dollars. I would say that. with this bill. the Republicans are not only cooking the books in a fiscally irresponsible manner. but neither set of the budget books that they use contain the priority for law enforcement that I think American families have a right to demand.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. timeliness is critical to the census. The Census Bureau needs full funding on October 1st. Delay will irrevocably degrade the accuracy of the count. A lot of work has been done to make the census better than previous ones. I know the problems of 1990. I went through the process with a number of us here. and I do not want to see them repeated again. Without timely funding. the advertisements for the awareness campaign will not be aired when people will hear them. they will be aired at 3 in the morning when nobody is listening. That is what happened during 1990 when we missed 8.4 million people and doublecounted another 4.4 million. The Bureau needs to screen and hire and train hundreds of thousands of workers for its 520 offices and 12 regional centers. Without timely funding. staffing and operations of those offices will be delayed. and that will compromise the quality and the accuracy of the census. Without timely funding. the work of local governments in developing the critical address lists will be crippled. If those address lists are not complete. we will miss large numbers of people and vital information that is needed for addressing national and local policies. We simply cannot afford to do that again. There is an enormous part of this census that depends on the accurate and timely execution of the work. That is why timely funding is so important. Let me just add one final note. There appears to be a misunderstanding about the 2000 census plan. There will not be two censuses. there will be one. starting with the direct count using the mail and the followup visits. two operations for which the Bureau has prepared since its first unveiling of its 2000 plan in 1996. Next there will be a large 300.000 household quality check survey to account for people missed and to eliminate double counting. The need to visit all unresponsive households and the addition of several field canvassing activities. unfortunately. are the most costly. labor intensive. and timeconsuming aspects of the census. That is why it is important that it be done on time. It is one census with one count using both direct and statistical methods.

I dont believe a single Member would stand in the way of providing all the resources necessary to bring our men and women home safely. Other emergency spending might be something as esoteric as the Y2K crisiswhether we are going to be able to respond quickly enough so the Government computers will be in line and not cause any problem to provide services.

Members have discovered that all they need to do is declare an \"emergency.\" whether one exists or not. and they are free from the budget caps. from the very spending discipline that has been central to our economic success over the course of the last 3 or 4 years.

Now. under those circumstances. Mr. President. that seems to me to be eminently reasonable. If there is a true emergency. wont 60 votes be available?

But this amendment would limit the use of future surpluses to debt reduction or tax breaks exclusivelyonly. So I have to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle the following question. Why is it OK to set aside the surplus to create a new special interest tax loophole but not OK to use the surplus for an increase in military pay? Why is it OK to set aside the surplus to give more tax breaks to the well off but not OK to use the surplus to hire more teachers and reduce class size? Mr. President. this amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It is not about saving Social Security or Medicare.

Why. then. did the debt go up $120 billion for our children and grandchildren to repay if we had a surplus? The American public should know this. If they want to know if we have a surplus. we will have a surplus the first time the actual debt goes down. And we will not have a surplus until the American people hear that. So if anybody says we have a surplus. people should ask them at the same time. does that mean a surplus with the debt rising or a surplus with the debt going down. Because the only way we can measure if we have a surplus is if the debt goes down. We can see in 1997 we had a small deficit. but the debt rose significantly. In 1998 we claimed. politicians. a $69 billion surplus: right? What happened to the debt? It rose from $5.330 trillion $5.445 trillion. another $115 billion increase in the national debt. Yet the politicians in Washington said we had a surplus. We did not have a surplus. It is totally dishonest to speak of a surplus. We had more money coming in than we paid out. but we borrowed all that plus the 44 trust funds that the gentleman from Minnesota talked about. the airport trust fund that we pay $2 each way on every ticket: the inland water trust fund. We took money from all those trust funds. plus Social Security. to run the government. and we have not been honest in the accounting of it.

My friend from Texas said we adopted a similar provision in the tax proposal offered by the Republicans a year or so ago. Thats not true. It was not refundable and would not have benefited lowerincome families. There is a significant difference. Refundability is important because as it stands now the tax break we are talking about is not terribly meaningful for families earning less than $20$25.000. Refundability is the only way to help people in that income level. I mentioned earlier that I was listening to a woman today who Was saying how happy she was that she found child care for one of her two children for $100 a week. That is $5.200 a year. She makes. according to her. about $25.000 or $30.000 a year. That is a quarter of her gross income going to care for one child. Without refundability. the current tax credit really doesnt mean much to her. It is simply inequitable to deny her a tax credit that families at higher incomes with the same type of child care expenses enjoy. If we can find the time. as we have for a day and a half. to debate a bill that would assist 43.000 or 44.000 people. cant we carve out a place in a $750 billion tax break for 8 million working people in this country who are trying to raise their children under very difficult circumstances.

The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international and domestic investment.

Under this Treaty. the Parties also agree to customary international law standards for expropriation. The Treaty includes detailed provisions regarding the computation and payment of prompt. adequate. and effective compensation for expropriation. free transfer of funds related to investments. freedom of investments from specified performance requirements. fair. equitable. and mostfavorednation treatment. and the investors freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I join my colleagues from the Senate Small Business Committee. Chairman KIT BOND and Ranking Member JOHN KERRY. in support of increased involvement of womenowned small businesses in the Federal procurement process. I have had the opportunity to speak with many women business leaders in Michigan on this matter. and the general opinion is that there are certain doors that are closed to women business owners. In a field hearing I held in Michigan last summer on Issues to women in business. I found that many times women business owners face the same problems as men in the private sector. However. when looking at the representation of women in terms of federal procurement dollars. the difference is striking. Six years after posting a modest fivepercent goal of Federal procurement dollars for womenowned small businesses. Federal departments and agencies have fallen far short. Last year. only 2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all Federal prime contracts went to women business owners. This shortfall is staggering when taking into account that womenowned small businesses are the fastest growing segment of the business community in the United States. In fact. by the year 2010. womenowned small businesses are expected to make up more than onehalf of all businesses in the United States. As a result of this striking information. I introduced an amendment to last years Women Business Centers Sustainability Act that called for a GAO report studying the trends. barriers and possible solutions to this deficiency. I am proud to report that this report stands to be completed by the end of the year. However. this alone will not provide Federal procurement opportunities for womenowned small businesses. The administration must become actively involved in demanding Federal departments and agencies accomplish the fivepercent procurement goal. Mr. President. I have been advocating this issues for quite some time now. My colleagues and I in the Senate Small Business Committee have consistently supported efforts empowering the spirit of entrepreneurship in American women. In my view. these actions must be adopted and enforced on all levels of government. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in encouraging the President to hold the heads of the Federal departments and agencies accountable to ensure that the five percent goal is achieved during this fiscal year.",

Senator KERRY. and others in support of a Senate resolution urging the President to adopt a policy to ensure that the 5percent Federal procurement goal for womenowned small businesses is met. In 1994. Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. establishing a Governmentwide goal for small businesses owned and controlled by women. This act allows for no less than five percent of the total dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards for each year. Over the past few years. we have witnessed the growth of womenowned businesses. including federal contracts. Over the past ten weve seen thousands of women entrepreneurs start or expand their own businesses. It is important we realize that womenowned businesses are the fastest growing segment of the business community in the United States. In fact. in the next ten years. it is expected that womenowned businesses will make up more than onehalf of all businesses in the United States. This week has been designated as Small Business Week. therefore it is only fitting that the Senate should pass this resolution to symbolize the Senates concern that the Federal departments and agencies have not made adequate effort in meeting the five percent goal established in 1994 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. I fully support this Senate resolution and urge Federal agencies to make a concerted effort to meet this 5percent goal.",

This suit is the plaintiffs second challenge to Georgias current election laws.

As such. it falls appropriately within the Senate Legal Counsels statutory responsibility to represent Members of the Senate in civil actions in which they are sued in their official capacity.

It is imperative that we continue to foster the growth of small businesses in America by reducing and eliminating many of the burdensome regulations the Federal government imposes on them. such as those put out by OSHA that cost small business millions of dollars each year. Congress should also heed the calls of businessmen and women throughout the Nation and eliminate the death tax. which would allow more small businesses to be passed on from one generation to another. and continue to pass laws allowing small businesses to increase retirement benefits for themselves and their employees. Earlier this year. the House passed four small business bills to reduce paperwork requirements and limit liability. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation. I hope my colleagues will join me this week in thanking Americas small businesses for their efforts In making America the leader in the worlds economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in 1981. while the Nation celebrated the 200th anniversary of the British surrender at Yorktown. President Reagan joked that \"our enemy is no longer Red Coats. but red ink.\" For 40 long years. this country sank deeper and deeper into debt. Congress seemed addicted to spending money on every project imaginable. But never during the 8 years of Reagans presidency did the Congress ever send him a balanced budget. not once. Never during the Carter. Ford. or Nixon administrations did the Democratic Congress ever send the President a balanced budget. nor during the Bush administration. The same was true the first 2 years that President Clinton enjoyed oneparty rule in this town. no balanced budget. The Constitution clearly states that only Congress can appropriate money for spending. Within 3 years of taking over Congress. the Republicans not only balanced the budget but also began paying down the debt. For decades. the other side had the chance to balance the budget but never did. The Republican Congress did it. and now we are reaping the rewards.",

I will vote for permanent trade with China because it benefits America. We do not want to support the status quo with China. Just Friday. the European Union negotiated a new agreement with China where they will get certain benefits to get into those markets in China. Under this agreement. America does not open its markets one bit more to China. but we pry open markets for telecommunications. agriculture. manufacturing. and across the board. Our policy. Mr. Speaker. should be to pry open and penetrate those markets so that we export products. not jobs.",

So it is no great surprise that there is a 102yearold temporary tax law on the books which became obsolete less than a year after it became law. That is right. the SpanishAmerican War tax. which charges Americans a 3percent excise tax on their phone line usage. was passed by Congress in 1898 to pay for the SpanishAmerican War. Well. the war is over. folks. but the tax is still with us. It is hurting 94 percent of Americans who use phone lines either for personal or business use. Why has it not changed? It has not changed because of the insatiable appetite of Government for every single tax dollar it can get its hands on. This is wrong. Congress needs to disconnect the American people from the outdated SpanishAmerican War tax.",

I am going to tell my colleagues about Cecilie Finkelstein. a victim of international parental child abduction who I have spoken with about the effects that this crime has on the abducted child. During our discussions. Cecilie expressed to me that parental abduction can and often does cause tremendous harm to the children involved. In her case. she lived on the run for 14 years. living in three countries and 34 States. Her father forced her to assume many identities to hide and alienate her from her mother. Cecilie learned the truth from a family friend. She now has a relationship with her mother but expressed to me the devastating effects that abduction has on the child victims. At an event I held in March. Cecilie. on behalf of herself and all abducted children. appealed to Congress to do everything in its power to discourage international parental child abduction by taking action to motivate foreign countries to comply with the spirit and the intent of the Hague Treaty on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

Mr. Speaker. let me say at the outset that I very much appreciate the cooperation of the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from North Carolina and their staffs for working with us to shape this legislation. I am satisfied that the boundary changes authorized in this bill are legitimate technical corrections which will resolve the past mapping errors and boundary discrepancies. and I urge the passage of this legislation. The Coastal Barrier Resources System is critical to the longterm protection of the Nations coastal resources. and we must remain vigilant to protect it from unwarranted encroachment. All this bill would do is substitute a final series of revised maps to replace an earlier series already approved by the House when it passed H.R. 1431 on September 21. This bill would authorize the final agreed upon maps. Let me say from the start. I very much appreciate the cooperation of Mr. SAXTON and his staff in working with the minority in shaping this legislation. I am satisfied that the boundary changes authorized in this bill are legitimate technical corrections which would resolve past mapping errors and boundary discrepancies. Moreover. we have been assured by both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service that these new boundaries accurately depict the boundaries of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Hopefully this will eliminate any future confusion regarding this matter. We also have made sure that none of the coastal barrier units labeled as L03 have been changed in any way to reduce their spatial areas. And importantly. we have also added approximately 2.300 acres of additional coastal barrier lands to the \"otherwise protected area\" labeled as NC03P. I want to thank Mr. SAXTON and the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. JONES. for agreeing to this addition. Experience has made me necessarily cautious when it comes to modifying any coastal barrier boundary. But in this case. I believe we have gotten it right.

Basically. there is a version that has already passed the House 35771. but to expedite it in the Senate. we are pursuing it in this fashion. Export promotion programs. like OPIC and TDA. provide crucial support for American businesses in the global marketplace. U.S. exports of goods and services are estimated to support more than 12 million domestic jobs. Each $1 billion in U.S. goods and services supports approximately 13.000 jobs. This is a reality in my home State of New Jersey. as well as throughout the country. OPIC has had a positive net income for every year of operation. which reserves now total more than $3 billion. Last year it earned a profit of $139 million and contributes over $204 million in net negative budget authority. So at a time when Congress is striving to adhere to the constraints of a balanced budget. OPIC stands a part of a revenue earning program. It also complements our efforts across the globe to open up markets. I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Illinois . my colleague. for his efforts to work with our office to achieve an agreement that ensures OPIC will continue to provide services to American investors overseas. I also want to thank the gentleman from New York (Chairman GILMAN). the distinguished chairman of the committee. for his commitment to work with myself and the gentleman from Connecticut on an International Trade Administration reauthorization bill at the beginning of the next session of the 106th Congress.

The temporary reauthorization extension for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation expires today. Its time to finally get this legislation to the President. The House version of H.R. 1993 is subject to a hold in the other body for reasons that have nothing to do with the substance of the legislation. Passage of H.R. 3381 now by the House is one way to seek quick action on a four year authorization for OPIC in case the House adjourns for the year prior to the Senate. There are some changes. The most important are provisions dealing with the International Trade Administration were removed because of jurisdictional concerns with the Senate Banking Committee. But it is important to remember what the new bill retainsfour year OPIC reauthorization. success fee language on the Trade and Development Agency. and streamlining the efforts of the 19 federal agencies involved in export promotion. All of these provisions will help America increase U.S. exports and eliminate government waste. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3381.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. on April 12. 2000. I testified in the subcommittee chaired by the gentleman from Illinois with a group representing the bipartisan Congressional Womens Caucus about a problem that affects women slightly more than men but has become a major national health problem across the entire population for children and for men and women of every age group and background. Alarming increases in overweight and obesity increasingly have become a major American health problem. More than 50 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. Surgeon General David Satcher says that overweight and obesity are major contributors to many preventable diseases and causes of death. including cardiovascular diseases. stroke. high blood pressure. high cholesterol. Type II diabetes. arthritis. gallbladder disease. asthma. and some cancers. including breast. endometrial. prostate. and colon cancers. The incidence of overweight and obesity is the worst in our history. Obesity trends are particularly serious among the youngest Americans. Almost 25 percent of young people ages 6 to 17 are overweight. and the percentage who are seriously overweight has doubled in the last 30 years. The responsibility of lifestyle for this troubling trend. especially fast food and lack of exercise. is very clear. I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman PORTER) for including $125 million in this Labor. HHS appropriations bill that will allow the Centers for Disease Control to begin a more aggressive national effort against overweight and obesity. I want to especially thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman PORTER) for his support of the bill I introduced. the Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise Act. building on the work his subcommittee has already done in making grants to the CDC. I am also pleased that the CDC supports my bill. As the gentleman knows. Mr. Chairman. the LIFE bill authorizes the CDC to address overweight. obesity. and sedentary lifestyles in three ways: by training health professionals to recognize the signs of obesity and to recommend prevention activities and several other ways.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. I know how strongly the gentleman from New Hampshire feels about the importance of the IDEA program. and I share those feelings. But in order to increase IDEA State grants by over $1 billion dollars. it would cut Job Corps $42 million. health professions $69 million. Ryan White $65 million. abstinence education $10 million. CDC by $130 million. SAMSHA by $60 million. mental health by $15 million. Impact Aid by $78 million. the Teacher Empowerment Act by $450 million. charter schools by $30 million. Indian education by $30 million. Gallaudet University by $3 million. vocational ed by $22 million. and Howard University by $7 million. Now. Mr. Chairman. the reason these programs are funded above the budget request or above last years level in the bill is that these programs are doing a good job of meeting the needs of people. We have increased funding for IDEA at a very. very fast rate. It has been a high priority for us. We have added $2.7 billion of new funding to IDEA during our tenure. and we have brought the additional per pupil percentage costs to serve disabled children up to 13 percent. It was at 9 percent in 1995. Other Federal funding brings it to 18 percent. We have put this particular account. IDEA. at a very. very high priority. We have added a $500 million to the bill already. We would like to. and hope that in some time in the course of the process of considering this bill in conference with the Senate and in negotiation with the White House. we can add more. At this time. I think that the cuts that would be made in very important programs would be very severe and would not serve the interests of the persons served by those programs at all well. These are needed monies in every case. For that reason. while I respect the gentlemans concern about IDEA. I believe that this amendment should not be adopted.",

The whole purpose of the Teacher Empowerment Act is to get quality teachers in the classroom so that. as a matter of fact. we do not keep increasing the number of young people who get placed into a special needs class. Charter schools. They are working. and they are working to make sure that we do not increase the number of children who end up in a special needs program. Job Corps. Last chance for these young people. And let me tell my colleagues. if we do not succeed on that last chance. the cost of taking care of those people will even be far greater than the cost of meeting special needs. Impact Aid.

We do not even yet have the block grant put into law and already this amendment is trying to cut it by $450 million. Then it cuts Indian education. It even cuts $3 million out of Gallaudet. the school for the blind. And there are some other cuts. So. Mr. Chairman. I would point out that even the people who are the beneficiaries of this amendment are asking that it not be passed. The Council for Exceptional Children. that is the group that lobbies for funding for special education is saying. \"Do we want the money? Yes. But do we want it at the expense of cutting these other educational programs? No. we do not.\" PTA is saying the same thing. Our local school administrators are saying the same thing. I do not blame the gentleman for offering this amendment. because he has a legitimate heartfelt concern. But what this amendment demonstrates is what we have been trying to say all year on this side of the aisle. It demonstrates there is simply not enough funding in this bill for education of all kinds and for health care and for job training. Sooner or later the majority will recognize that. Sooner or later it is going to have to change this equation so that we get a better deal for middleclass taxpayers. and. at the same time. sooner or later we will put back not only the money for special education but the additional money we need for Pell Grants. for Title I. and the list goes on and on. It. unfortunately. is going to take longer than it ought. But. meanwhile. we should not complicate it by passing this amendment. So I regretfully urge its rejection.",

I strongly agree that every child deserves the opportunity to benefit from a public education and is able to reach his or her fullest potential. In addition. I recognize the tremendous cost of this endeavor. If our schools are truly to serve all students. the federal government must increase IDEA funding. During my years in Congress. I have worked tirelessly to support increases in special education funding. I continue to support increasing funding for special education. and would like to see us funding it at $7 billion this year. But there is a right way. and a wrong way to go about this. The right way is to increase overall funding for education so that. in this time of extraordinary budget surpluses. we are meeting the needs of all students. The wrong way is what is proposed in this amendmentrobbing Peter to pay Paul. This amendment takes money from other equally worthy programs in order to pay for IDEA. Simply shifting money around doesnt solve the problem. The Labor HHS Education bill is woefully underfunded. Why? Not because our nation cannot afford to invest in education. But because our Republican colleagues want to give large tax breaks to their wealthy friends. The result is that good programs are pitted against one another. forced to compete for artificially scarce resources. This is no way to govern. I am committed to moving ahead with fully funding the Federal governments promised 40% of IDEA expenses. But I will not do so at the expense of other equally worthy programs. As the Labor HHS Education bill goes to conference. I will be urging my colleagues in the House to accept the far more generous funding levels of the Senate bill. and to direct some of those additional resources toward special education. So I urge my colleagues to increase funding for IDEA. but to do it the right way. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.",

We started out to deal with this bill this morning to try to provide Federal funding for education and health and job training programs.

Their tax bill tomorrow will effectively eliminate the estate tax. In some cases that may be justified. But the way they brought it to the floor means that there will be some people who strike it rich. make huge amounts of money and are never taxed once on any of that money. while working people are taxed on every dollar they earn in the workplace every day. The eventual revenue lost to the treasury will be about $50 billion a year that will go into the pockets of Mr. Money Bags in this society.

Last year. of the 60.000 people on organ transplant waiting lists. only 20.000 received needed transplants. As the number of patients waiting for organ transplants expands each year. clearly we must redouble our efforts to increase organ donations. In my State of Louisiana. organ and tissue donations are increasing. in large part thanks to a new and innovative computerized database that shares information on donated organs with members of the medical community and their patients. For instance. in 1999. 900 organs were donated in Louisiana. coming close to matching the nearly 1.200 Louisianans awaiting transplants. I think this represents real progress. and I am proud that my State is leading the way. However. I do remain very concerned that this administrations answer to the growing shortage across the country of organs is to attempt to federalize the organ allocation system and allow HHS bureaucrats to override medical decisions by local organ transplant groups. I believe it would be terrible to undercut the successful efforts of local organ procurement groups. Instead of dictating organ allocation policies. we should lend our voice to increasing organ donations nationwide and support this type of resolution. as we are on the floor today.",

Every family hopes that if one of its members becomes seriously ill. medical science will be able to provide a miracle and restore their loved one to a healthy and rewarding life. Medical science has been able to do exactly that over the past decade for hundreds of thousands of families with loved ones suffering from diseases and injuries that affect the heart. kidney. pancreas. lungs. liver or tissue. Transplantation of organs and tissues has become one of the most remarkable success stories in medicine. now giving tens of thousands of desperately ill Americans each year a new chance at life. But sadly. this medical miracle is not yet available to all in need. Waiting lists are growing more rapidly than the number of organs and tissues being donated. There are more than 70.000 individuals awaiting organ transplants at any given moment. and despite the fact that almost everyone is a potential donor. more than 10 people each day die because of a shortage of donor organs. Last year over 1.500 men. women and children from Maryland were on waiting lists hoping for an organ to become availablean increase of 108 over the previous year. Many of these Maryland residents have been waiting for years. And the wait is growing longer. Every two hours. one of the more than 60.000 Americans now on waiting lists dies for lack of an available organ. Even when individuals have indicated a desire to be a donor. statistics show that those wishes go unfulfilled more than half of the time. Two important points must be made: The final decision on whether or not to donate organs and tissue is always made by surviving family members. Checking the organ donation box on a drivers license doe not guarantee organ and tissue donation. Individuals should discuss the importance of donation with their families nowin a non crisis atmosphereso if the question ever arises. all members of the family will remember having made the decision to give the gift of life. Madam Speaker. this resolution encourages all Americans to learn about the importance of organ. tissue. bone marrow. and blood donation and to discuss such donation with their families and friends.

It also urges the President to promote activities to demonstrate public support for organ. tissue. bone marrow and blood donation. As Chairman of the Health and Environment Subcommittee. I have worked to identify ways to increase the supply of organs available for transplantation. Last year. I introduced H.R. 2418. legislation to reauthorize the National Organ Transplant Act. which includes provisions to promote organ donation. My Subcommittees review of these issues has highlighted statistics that are deeply disturbing. This year. approximately 20.000 people will receive organ transplantsbut 40.000 will not. In the last decade alone. the waiting list for transplants grew by over 300 percent. Much of this increase is due to improvements in medical treatments for transplant patients. However. the gap between organ supply and demand remains enormous. Two years ago. my Subcommittee held a joint hearing with the Senate Labor Committee to review our nations system for organ allocation. and more specifically. the changes proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Despite strong differences of opinion. all of the witnesses recognized the severe shortage of organs for transplantation. At a hearing in April 1999. my Subcommittee focused on ways to increase the supply of organs for transplantation. including what the federal government can do to improve this situation. Witnesses emphasized that many successful programs to encourage organ donation have been developed at the state level. and we should supportnot underminethese ongoing initiatives. This is literally a matter of life and death for tens of thousands of Americans each year. Given the enormity of these issues. we have an obligation to work together to address these concerns on a bipartisan basis. I was pleased to join my Florida colleague. Mrs. THURMAN. as a cosponsor of this resolution. and I applaud her commitment to this cause. Clearly. the solution to this complicated problem is not entirely legislative.

Unfortunately. it is estimated that the actual incidence of abuse and neglect may be 3 times greater than the number reported. In fact. we know that more than 3 children die each day as a result of parental mistreatment. Child abuse may take many forms: it can be physical. emotional. sexual or as a result of neglect. I know. because Ive been there. Many of you know that I personally experienced the horrors of domestic violence in my youth. Fortunately for me. my mother. and my siblings. we were able to escape that horrible situation and make a better life for ourselves. Sadly. for millions of children in America that is just not the case. That is why H. Con. Res. 76 is so important. H. Con. Res. 76 expresses the sense of this Congress that all Americans must share in the responsibility of helping fight child abuse. More than that. it emphasizes the need for the faith community. nonprofit organizations and volunteers across America to mobilize their resources in combating child abuse. Organizations. such as the Safe Haven Foundation in Indianapolis. are key in developing programs and providing shelters to the victims of domestic violence. That is why I am proud to have helped secure $500.000 in funds to the Safe Haven Foundation. so that it may continue its important efforts against domestic violence. Child abusers can come from any socioeconomic. religious. or ethnic background. and since the signs of abuse are varied. we all need to work together in identifying cases of child abuse.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I come before you today to proclaim that today. February 14. 2000. is \"Child Heart Awareness Day.\" More than 32.000 American babies are born each year with cardiovascular defects. which translates to 1 out of every 115 to 150 births. To put these numbers in perspective. 1 in every 8001.000 babies is born with Downs Syndrome. Congenital heart defects make up 42 percent of all birth defects. making Congenital Heart Disease the most common birth defect. The American Heart Association estimates that there are approximately 1 million people living with heart defects in the United States today. Today. I join all children and their families who are affected by congenital heart defects. in focusing public attention on this disease as we look toward the future in finding a cure. Prior to 1960. most children with heart defects died within the first year of life. In the subsequent decades of the 60s. 70s. and 80s. research produced by skilled surgeons and cardiologists led to a variety of different interventions. which allowed the vast majority of infants with heart defects to survive. However. these medical procedures place an enormous burden on the families of children born with congenital heart defects. In addition. many of these children who survive infancy still face a life of dependency on medications. medical procedures and openheart surgeries. I recently introduced legislation to lessen the impact of these huge medical bills on American families. H.R. 3325. the \"Melissa Froelich Medicaid Congenital Heart Defect Waiver Act of 1999.\" would permit a State waiver authority to provide medical assistance in cases of congenital heart defects. I introduced this important legislation after learning of the plight of fouryearold Melissa Froelich. who has undergone multiple surgeries and procedures. including four reconstructive heart surgeries. since her birth in 1996. As we continue to look for ways to cure this birth defect. I hope that the increased public attention on this widespread problem will help begin to ease some of the burdens families of children with congenital heart defects face.",

Reviewing regional medical variations for breastsparing surgerybasically for breast cancer todayI dont want to categorize this too much because the indications change a little bit. In a lumpectomytaking out the lump itself and radiating because it is the least disfiguringthe outcome is equally good as doing a mastectomy and taking off the whole breast. In my trainingnot that long ago. 25 yearsthe only treatment was mastectomy. As we learned more and more and radiation therapy became more powerful. we began to understand there are synergies in doing surgical operations and radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We didnt have to remove or disfigure the whole breast. The new therapy ended up being better for the patient but was not generally accepted medically. That sort of variation is shown in this chart. In this chart. the very dark areas use lumpectomy versus mastectomy. Comparing the two. the high ratio of around 20 to 50 percent. versus going down to the light colors on the chart where this procedure is not used very much. there is tremendous variation. The different patterns of color on the chart demonstrate that a procedure generally accepted in one part of the country may be very different in another part of the country. For example. in South Dakota. using this ratio of lumpectomy versus mastectomy. the ratio is only 1.4 percent. In Paterson. NJ. the generally accepted medical standards in that community go up almost fortyfold to 37.8 percentthe relative use of one procedure. an older procedure. versus a newer procedure. Which of those are generally accepted medical standards? That shows the definition itself has such huge variation that we have to be very careful when putting it into Federal statute. We will come back to that because it is a fundamentally important issue. Medicine is practiced differently around the country. Therefore. the words \"generally accepted medical standards\" have huge variations. We have to be careful what we write into law.

I think this is \"in consultation with the patient.\" No. they do not have in their bill \"in consultation with the patient.\" I suggest \"in consultation with the patient\" should be part of their amendment. We would put in \"in consultation with the patient\" to be \"medically necessary and appropriate.\" instead of using their words \"generally accepted medical standards.\" which has such huge variation. Why not use the better terminology. \"medically necessary and appropriate\"? Use the same indications. Mastectomy is what we will propose. what they propose. Lumpectomy is what we propose. what they will propose. Lymph node dissection. we will use that language. But \"generally accepted medical standards\" is dangerous. We ought to use such words as \"medically necessary and appropriate.\" Then we are not locked into the variation where there is a fortyfold difference in mastectomies versus lumpectomy. which shows the importance of being very careful before placing Federal definitions of what is \"medically necessary and appropriate\" in Federal law.",

They dont want to go through gatekeepers to have to get to their obstetrician or gynecologist. That relationship is very special and very important when we are talking about womens health and womens diseases. In the KennedyRobb amendment. the language is that the plan or insurer shall permit such an individual who is a female to designate a participating physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as the individuals primary care provider. It is true that in our underlying bill we dont say the plan has to say that all obstetricians and gynecologists are primary care providers. That is exactly right. The reasons for that are manyfold. Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. Robert Yelverton. chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Primary Care Committee. stated: The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to remain as specialists rather than act as primary care physicians. He attributes this to the high standards that health plans have for primary care physicians. saying: None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians under most of the plans. and most OB/GYNs would have to go back to school for a year or more to do so. You can argue whether that is good or bad. but it shows that automatically taking specialists and making them primary care physicians and putting it in Federal statute is a little bit like taking BILL FRIST. heart and lung transplant surgeon. and saying: You ought to take care of all of the primary care of anybody who walks into your office.",

November 13. marks the 59th anniversary of the founding of the National Federation of the Blind. An historic plaque will be placed at the original meeting place in WilkesBarre. Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon. and I am proud to have been asked to participate in this historic celebration. In November of 1940. the first nationwide selfadvisory group of persons with disabilities was founded at a meeting in the Reddington Hotel in WilkesBarre. Pennsylvania. At that time. the future for most blind people was bleak and employment often meant sheltered workshops for pennies an hour. With few educational opportunities available. the blind came together to organize. Elected to lead the fledgling group was Dr. Jacobus tenBroek. a young blind lawyer who would go on to become a prominent professor of constitutional law. This small group of people dedicated to the advancement of those with disabilities began a trend of advocacy for all people with physical and mental challenges. Mr. Speaker. today the National Federation of the Blind is the largest organization of its kind in America. Every state has a chapter. as do many communities across the nation. Several thousand activists attend the Federations annual national convention. The Federation provides scholarships. discrimination assistance. newsletters. and legislative consultation. It supports and assists in the development of new technology to improve the lives of the visually impaired. The Federation champions civil rights for the blind and often intercedes when parents face interference from social service agencies who attempt to remove their children from their homes. Currently. the Federation is attempting to establish sound case law regarding custody rights of visually impaired parents.

Recently. a nationwide survey conducted by the Department of Justices Bureau of Justice Statistics found that American Indians are victimized by violent crime at two times the rate of the general population. The staggering poverty. unemployment and violent crime statistics of many Indian communities is a contrast to other communities that are experiencing strong economic health. low unemployment. and decreasing crime rates in other parts of America. Mr. Speaker. equal access to justice is important to all Americans. As a past U.S. Assistant District Attorney and the former Attorney General for the State of New Mexico. I had numerous opportunities to work with tribal court judges. tribal court administrators and tribal court personnel. I became aware of the work of such Indian legal services programs of the Legal Services Corporation as Indian Pueblo Legal Services in New Mexico. and DNA Peoples Legal Services on the Navajo Reservation. These tribal judges and Indian Legal Services program attorneys deal with many of the same kinds of cases that make up state dockets: traffic. domestic violence. child welfare and assault. to name a few. But often these court personnel and legal representatives face staggering caseloads and are only able to draw upon limited resources such as the availability of law books. computers. personnel. or staff training. The legislation I introduce today would do three important things. It would authorize the Attorney General to award grants from within existing programs at the Department of Justice.

Honoring the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country should always be a priority. Unfortunately. some Vietnam veteran service and sacrifice is still not being fully recognized because they can not have their names placed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall. The wall is open to some veterans who died after the conflict. but the criteria for eligibility does not include many veterans whose postwar deaths were a direct result of such factors as Agent Orange and post traumatic stress syndrome. H.R. 3293 will address this issue by authorizing the creation of a plaque to honor them.

If people could run their own communities. their own schools and their own lives. I think we would have a much better society. It is interesting. while this administration rushes out after the Littleton tragedy to pass more gun control laws. they have completely ignored the fact that last year there were only 8 prosecutions for possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone. and only 8 prosecutions for possession of a handgun or ammunition by a juvenile. and 6 prosecutions for the transfer of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile.

The point I was intending to get to here is this: That waving that $1 trillion surplus figure around to the American people really does send the green light. it sends the go signal to all of the lobbyists. all of the special interests. and even to many Members of this very Congress that. start smiling. it is time to spend again. We have money laying around. We really do not have huge piles of cash laying around Washington. D.C. There are lots of games and lots of manipulations that go into bragging about the size of this debt. There is no question that over the past few years. since the Republicans have taken over the control of Congress. we have slowed the rate of growth in Federal budgeting. We have done so to the extent that we have allowed the economy to catch up with us. But we do not have the trillions and trillions of dollars laying around Washington. D.C. to begin to start celebrating and spending.",

I have had one new car in my life. and I have never owned a new boat. so I really do not know the feeling. but I know it is a lot more fun to buy maybe a new TV or a new stereo than it is to buy a new drier or to get a new set of tires for your car. In politics it is the same way. it is far more glamorous and sexy to go out and create a new government arts program or a new program for some special interest group that is going to help a limited number of people but it is going to sound real good to all. and we rush out and do that rather than pay down the debt. With a $5.4 trillion debt. I strongly urge. and I know the gentleman has been fighting for it. that we include not just debt service but debt payment in every budget that we have. We should have. and last year our colleague. Mark Neumann. advocated I think it was a 25year budget debt paydown that would have paid off the national debt I think by the year 2025. or maybe even sooner than that. That should be the center of the debate. not what are we going to do with this new money. That debt right now. we do pay interest on it. and that interest I think is something like I believe $500 per person. so a family of four pays about $2.000 a year in taxes servicing the national debt. That is $2.000 a year that could be used for college tuition. for groceries. for a vacation. for a couple of months of house payments. That money is absolutely gone to the bondholders. It does not buy better education. better health care. better national security. it is just gone.",

    "speech": "People in Washington like to take the credit for the strong economy and take credit for balancing the budget. and we deserve some credit. I think. As I mentioned. we did slow the rate of growth in Federal budgeting over the last 6 years. That has allowed the economy to catch up. But the American people are the ones that really deserve the credit. We can help in a number of ways. There are many people here in Washington who believe that we were wrong to cut taxes over the last couple of years. We reduced the capital gains tax. we reduced inheritance taxes. we managed to provide a $500 per child tax credit. There are an assortment of other taxes that we managed to knock down just a little bit. We have not repealed them or pulled back the overall tax rate nearly as much as we can and perhaps should. But those people who criticized us for trying to reduce the tax burden and provide tax relief are also wrong. because what we found was that by leaving more cash back home in the hands and pockets of those people who earn it. we have inspired those individuals to become more productive with their own capital. with their own wealth. They have created more jobs. They have made wiser investments. It is. in fact. that heightened level of economic activity that is saving the country today. That Is the reason we balanced the budget. That is the reason the President believes that. if those American people continue to do the same things. make the same wise investments. perform strong economically as they have been. over the next 15 years. that there will be the surplus. But it really means for us. I think. that we need to find more ways to ease the burden on American families and American business owners and people who are creating wealth and continue to shrink this government. Those are the assumptions the President has built into his numbers. but I do not believe that he has the commitment that the gentleman from Georgia and I do and the rest of the Republican majority to actually stick to those budget caps and actually see the surplus grow.",

Actually. he has three wooden legs. He says. what is the story about this pig. He says. oh. that pig is a magic pig. It has really done a lot. He said. one time the family was burning. the House was burning. and that pig ran in and pulled us all out of bed and saved the entire family. Another time. my son was drowning. that pig dove in the lake. swam out there and picked him up and kept him from drowning and pulled him back from shore. On another occasion. my little girl was in an automobile accident. and the car was burning. and the pig leaped through the window and pulled her out and saved her. The guy from the city said. well. that is amazing. That is a remarkable pig. But tell me. what about the bandages. He said. well. it is obvious. You do not eat a pig like that all at once. That is what the government is doing to the American entrepreneur. the American small business person. and the hardworking taxpayer in general. just grinding them down. Some statistics that I wanted to say. the Census Bureau says that the average household now pays $9.445 in Federal income taxes. which is twice as much as it was in 1985. The typical American family pays more in taxes than we spend on food. clothing. housing. and transportation combined. It is very similar to the story.

The day of May thirteenth 1998 will forever be a day of mourning for the Traverse City community. a tragic day that will leave an indelible change on the fabric of life in Traverse City. Sergeant Finch lost his life in the line of duty. protecting a community that he loved. His dedication and pride is a testament to the extremely difficult and admirable role that police officers play in this country. Sergeant Finch protected us proudly with the shield of the Traverse City Police Department. and we will be forever thankful. Sergeant Finch lived the life of hero. before becoming a Traverse City Police Officer. Dennis served proudly in the United States Marine Corps in Vietnam. Dennis distinguished himself as a soldier. and was a decorated combat veteran. In his thirty years of service to the Traverse City Police Department. Sergeant Finch was the Departments most seniored Sergeant. He was a command officer in both the Investigative Services Division and the Patrol Division for twentyfour years. During this difficult time. my thoughts and prayers go out to Sergeant Finchs family. friends and all police officers who risk their lives every day in this country. Thank you and God bless.*",

Throughout Chief Moniers 28 year career with the Goffstown Police Department. he has continuously demonstrated all that is honorable about law enforcement and public service. His professional and personal life have been characterized by excellence. leadership and service to others. The resume he has compiled is extraordinary. To no ones surprise. he graduated magna cum laude from St. Anselm College. After joining the police department. Chief Monier rose through its ranks. serving as Patrol Officer. Director of the Juvenile Division. Sergeant and Lieutenant before being appointed Chief on July 1. 1984. In addition. he is past President of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police and served 9 years on the Council of New Hampshire Police Standards & Training. He is also a member of the New England Association of Chiefs of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a welldeserved honor. Chief Monier was selected to the 1996 Centennial Summer Olympics security team in Atlanta. His service to others goes beyond law enforcement. Even while growing up. this quality was apparent. At Goffstown High School. for example. he served as President of the Junior Class and President of the National Honor Society. This leadership continues to this day. Chief Monier is a past President and member of the Goffstown Chapter of Rotary International and a founding member of Crispins House. a nonprofit organization designed to assist atrisk youths and families. He has also been assistant coach for the Goffstown Youth Basketball League. In his spare time. Chief Monier coauthored \"Crime of the Century.\" a fascinating account of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Although following his example may be difficult to do. it is my hope that everyone will see the Chief as a role model. Finally. I consider Steve Monier a true friend and someone whose advice and support I deeply value. I expect that I can continue to call on his wisdom. I wish him the very best as he moves onto the next challenge in his life. He will undoubtedly approach this phase with the same level of commitment and dedication that has marked his entire career. With this thought in mind. I wish to say thank you. Chief Monier.9",

This substitute shows that supporting good fiscal policy does not have to mean excluding lowwage workers. the poor. communities of color and African Americans. This budget increases domestic spending by 50 percent and spends 25 percent less on defense by cutting waste. fraud and abuse. Let me highlight what we have proposed in the areas of housing and also in order to end the HIV/AIDS crisis abroad. First. the Congressional Black Caucus addresses these issues by investing $1 billion more for section 8 housing. $100 million more for the community development block grant program. and $350 million more for the HOME program. We also invest over $1 billion over 5 years to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS in countries hardest hit in subSaharan Africa and the Caribbean. It funds H.R. 3519. the World Bank AIDS Marshal Trust Fund Plan. And we passed that last week out of the House Banking Committee. I stand in strong support for the CBC alternative. Mr. Chairman.

We have a very wealthy Nation now. We have a greater degree of power disparity between the United States militarily and the rest of the world than we have ever seen in our history. What this budget does is to make a sensible. prudent reduction in the amount of money spent on the military so that we can deal with the real threats to Americas security to the problems of health. poverty. inadequate education. We have a real deadlock in this country right now. We have people telling us that we ought to participate more enthusiastically in the international economy for the World Trade Organizations and elsewhere. As long as grave disparities persist within this country. as long as lowerincome people. people working at the low end of the skill level feel threatened by it. we are not going to be able to go forward.

The gentleman from Iowa talked about the importance of setting aside $40 billion. not just to cover prescription drug benefits but to improve and strengthen the Medicare system as well. We have heard about the investments that we think are important to make in education and in defense and in basic science. and. of course. the tax relief that is in this budget. to make the Tax Code more fair and to reduce taxes for all Americans. And. unfortunately. that is one of the real shortcomings of the alternative being offered here. not only does it not lower taxes. it increases taxes. and that is just the wrong direction to take the country. Let us. in fact. look where we have come over the past few years. even while cutting taxes. Under this Republican Congress. we have seen the public debt begin to decrease. We are actually making payments against the debt held by the public. reducing that debt and increasing Americas financial security. We can see clearly the red. increases in debt year after year under a Democrat Congress. The tide was turned in 1998. Shortly after we had a Republican Congress. clearly the amount of debt was lower and lower in 1996. 1997. And what has happened over the past 4 years? What a turn around. In 1998. we paid down over $50 billion in debt: 1999 paid down over $80 billion in debt. and in fact. with this Republican budget that is here on the floor today. we will reduce the debt held by the public $450 billion over just 4 years. It gets even better. because over the next 5 years we will pay down a trillion dollars in public debt. reducing the public debt. keeping interest rates low. even while making the Tax Code more fair. eliminating death tax provisions. giving health insurance deductibility for those that are selfemployed.

This tax increase results in the fact that next year the President would increase taxes $10 billion: we would cut taxes $10 billion. Finally. over 5 years. the President has a net tax cut of $5 billion. We have over $200 billion of tax relief. The reason we have that is we want a marriage penalty tax elimination.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the only budget that has been submitted that will help the conscience of the American people. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) substitute budget for FY 2001. Included in the CBC budget is an allocation for $150 million in support of lupus research and the delivery of lupus services. These funds will help to expand and intensify the research efforts of the NIH to diagnose. treat. and eventually cure lupus. Lupus attacks the immune system. A patients immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances and the patients own cells. As a result. the patients immune system makes antibodies which end up attacking the patients immune system. This can result in debilitating pain and fatigue. making it difficult for lupus victims to maintain employment and lead normal lives. Lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early. Thousands of women with lupus die each year. Lupus afflicts women nine times more than it does men. and has its most significant impact on women during the childbearing years. About 1.4 million Americans have some form of Lupusone out of every 185 Americans. As estimated 1 in 250 African American women between the ages of 15 and 65 develop lupus. Perhaps the most discouraging aspect of lupus for sufferers and family members is the fact that there is no cure. Lupus is devastating not only to the victim. but to family members as well. Research. treatment. education and financial support are essential so that we can help victims and their families cope until we are able to conquer this terrible disease. I urge my colleagues to join us in providing this essential support for persons suffering from lupus and vote in favor of the CBC budget.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the substitute budget. I rise to support the alternative budget resolution presented by the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). In particular. the CBCs alternative is significant for the funding allocated in the International Affairs portion of the budget resolution. Between the fiscal years 2001 and 2005. the CBC budget resolution would allocate $43 billion more to International Affairs compared to the Republican budget resolution. This would provide essential funding to institutions such as the African Development Bank. the African Development Fund. the Child Survival and Disease Fund. and the Peace Corps. This additional funding is critical particularly to ensure full funding for debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries. Today. I am introducing the Limpopo River Debt Relief and Reconstruction Act to provide assistance to Mozambique and other countries of southern Africa that have been devastated by recent floods. The Limpopo River Debt Relief and Reconstruction Act would completely cancel the debts owed by these countries to the United States and provide assistance for the repair and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure in these countries. Limpopo River Debt Relief and Reconstruction funding is essential to enable Mozambique and other southern African countries to provide for the needs of their people. repair their damaged infrastructure and rebuild their economies. Debt relief is desperately needed by many other heavily indebted poor countries as well. The governments of these countries have been forced to make drastic cuts in basic services such as health and education in order to make payments on their debts. Nigeria. for example. is a deeply impoverished country that would receive tremendous benefits from debt relief. Nigerias per capita income is only $300 per year and the country spends no more than $5 per person per year on health services. Without debt relief. Nigerias fragile democracy is in danger of collapse. Debt cancellation will give Nigeria a fresh start and a sound basis for a democratic future. For these and many other important reasons. I urge my colleagues to support the Congressional Black Caucuses alternative budget.",

Perry Hall is a thriving. suburban community of 40.000 residents located 10 miles northeast of Baltimore City. It was founded in 1775 by Harry Dorsey Gough. who purchased a 1.000acre estate called The Adventure. He renamed it Perry Hall after his familys home near Birmingham. England. On that site he built a mansion that became known for magnificent gardens and distinctive architecture. In the years during and after the Civil War. German and Irish families began to settle in the community surrounding the mansion. These families worked hard and developed a thriving dairy and nursery industry. In 1875. Eli Slifer and William Meredith bought the \"Perry Hall\" property. divided it and sold lots to immigrant families. who then began raising \"stoop crops\" such as celery and carrots. Perry Hall began its transformation from rural hamlet to suburban community in the years following World War II. Brick bungalows were built for returning GIs and their brides. New schools were built to serve their growing families and the first shopping center arrived in 1961. In 1981. the transformation was completed with construction of White Marsh Mall. While the farms and forests of Perry Hall have been replaced by housing developments. shopping centers and new businesses. the most important part of Perry Hall still remains: its friendliness and warmth. This year. Perry Hall has celebrated its 225th year with a series of events. picnics and concerts. The Perry Hall Improvement Association will cap off this anniversary year with the Millennium Ball on Nov. 3. 2000. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing congratulations to all who live in Perry Hall. Maryland. and in wishing them the best on this historic anniversary.",

I have introduced legislation to include benign brain tumors in the data collection of cancer registries. This data will directly help the entire medical system including public health agencies. scientific research labs. health system public policy groups and of course the brain tumor groups. The medical system organizations use cancer data in funding decisions. investigations. research. and care facilities. I am pleased to announce the introduction of the Benign Brain Tumor Cancer Registries Amendment Act. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death for children and the third leading cause of cancer death in young adults ages 1534. The greatest increase in brain tumors has been among people 75 years of age or older. Only 37 percent of males and 52 percent of females survive five years following the diagnosis of a primary benign or malignant brain tumor. Each year. approximately 100.000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary or metastatic brain tumor. Nationwide. the incidence of brain tumors has increased by 25 percent since 1975 and the reasons for this increase are unknown. For many types of tumors. the distinction between benign and malignant is significant. For tumors of the brain. this distinction is not as clear. A tumor. whether malignant or benign. is a collection of cells that grow as rapidly as malignant tumors. however based on location and size. even benign brain tumors can be life threatening. Benign brain tumors account for almost 40 percent of all brain tumors. Not including these tumors in the cancer registry. underestimates the incidence of brain tumors in the general population. Roughly half of all brain tumors are benign. All brain tumors. both cancerous and benign. are potentially lifethreatening.

Kiki. a Drug Enforcement Administration agent. had been in Mexico for 41/2 years on the trail of Mexicos marijuana and cocaine barons. He was due to be reassigned in three weeks. having come dangerously close to unlocking a multibilliondollar drug pipeline. which he suspected extended in the highest reaches of the Mexican army. police and government. As Kiki was about to get into the cab of his truck. five men appeared and shoved him into a car. threw a jacket over Kikis head and sped away. Kiki Camarenas body was found 1 month later in a shallow grave 70 miles from Michoachan. Mexico. He had been tortured. beaten and brutally murdered. This week. Oct. 2331. we celebrate Red Ribbon Week. Red Ribbon Week is a time to commemorate the death of Kiki Camarena and for communities to come together to reinforce a drugfree message. The red ribbon. which I am wearing. has become a symbol to eliminate the demand for drugs. and the National Family Partnerships Red Ribbon Campaign is designed to create community awareness concerning drugs. alcohol. and tobacco. It is estimated that 80 million people participate annually in Red Ribbon Week. In order for the Red Ribbon Week message to be effective in communities. it must be recognized and reinforced across as many sectors of the community as possiblechools. businesses. parents. churches. law enforcement. doctors. government. social service organizations. etc. Red Ribbon Week provides an important opportunity for everyone in the community to use their unique skills and talents to deliver a drugfree message. All of us want to make our communities healthier. safer and drug free for our children to grow up in. During this week may we join together and remember those officials like Kiki Camarena who have given their lives in order to fight the war on drugs. And may we mobilize our communities to prevent problem behaviors before they start. so that we help create a brighter. healthier and drugfree future for our children and for the 21st century.",

With next years 35th anniversary of Head Start we will all have an opportunity to join together to promote the continued quality. comprehensiveness. and accountability of the program which has given it the staying power to improve the lives of lowincome children and families. The program also has an impact on child development and day care services. the expansion of state and local activities for children. the range and quality of services offered to young children and their families. and the design of training programs for those who staff such programs. Outreach and training activities also assist parents in increasing their parenting skills and knowledge of child development. With the bipartisan reauthorization of the program in 1998. we embarked upon a new era for Head Start. Increased professional development. research into the longterm benefits of the program. outcome measures and program accountability. and an expansion of Early Head Start were but a few of the changes in the law. Progress is already being made. In the days ahead. Congress will likely be considering legislation to provide a significant part of the resources needed to make good on the promise of last years reauthorization.

They propose large tax cuts that clearly jeopardize our ability to meet our obligations under Social Security. and at the end of the day they have not extended the life of Social Security even one day. The President has submitted a plan that Democrats support that would extend the Social Security system by at least 16 years.

D.C.. to empower bureaucrats at the expense of American people. and to establish these gigantic bureaucracies that provide rewards for themselves politically at election time. but which are very. very different from the traditions that we have established in America over the 223 years since Independence Hall.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. reclaiming my time. the functional leverage that the Federal Government utilizes in many of these programs is something the gentleman from California referred to. or I guess the phrase he used earlier. and can be described in the following way: the Federal Government describes these programs as voluntary. If a school district or a State or an individual school wants to use the Federal funds that are set aside for a particular program. then they have to comply with the rules. But if they do not want the rules. they do not have to take the money. Now the fallacy of that is the origin of the money. because the money is confiscated from taxpayers back in the gentlemans home State and my home State of Colorado. We just have to visualize this. If we had to draw it out on a flowchart and look at it on an organizational chart or a map. the Federal Government taxes the income of the American people back home in our home States. That money comes back here to the Federal Government. It comes to us as policy makers in a budget in an appropriations process. We approve that money for the Federal Government. for the Clinton administration. That fund has grown over the years. They take that money. which rightfully belongs to the people. back home in our States and say. \"if you want it back. then you have to accept these rules. But you do not have to get the money back.\"",

So that really is the fallacy that I think many on the liberal side of the aisle. the Democrat side. fail to see. and that is. this money does not belong to the government. It did not originate here in Washington. D.C. We are talking about the hardearned cash of the American people who work hard every day to make ends meet. to put food on their table. to put a roof over their head. to raise their children in a country that they believe to be an honorable and noble place in all the world. That is who owns that money. That is where it comes from. The people in Washington take it from them and give it back and suggest that we are going to give it back with strings attached. and it just does not work. We are for moving authority out of Washington. D.C.. empowering States which have the rightful constitutional authority. by the way. to manage public schools and to establish school districts. I come to this microphone all the time and defy my Democrat friends on the other side of the aisle to show any reference in the Constitution to the Federal Governments authority to manage local schools. I submit it is not there. Not a single one has ever been able to come to these microphones and show where the Constitution specifically enumerates authority to this Congress to manage local schools.

It is an interesting thing that we often do not get a chance to consider too often here on the floor except for perhaps in these special orders. but in the Declaration of Independence. it was laid out very differently than the rest of the world had experienced up until that time. where we held certain truths to be selfevident. that we are all created equal and that we are all endowed by God with certain inalienable rights. This is different than what the people of England had known. and it is different than. frankly. anywhere in Europe had ever acknowledged or any other great political civilization up to that time.

We promised local school districts in the State. we did not.

But rather than Washington coming in and saying they can only use the money for teachers. they wanted to say they can use the money for teachers or they can use the money for their special ed program. And we had a fairly spirited debate here on the floor of the House with one group saying hiring teachers is exactly what they should do with that money and they should not be able to use it for anything else. Luckily. we prevailed today in saying they have the flexibility of using it for teachers or using it for special ed so that the local school district can make that decision. I would think that local administrators. a local school board with parental involvement. is better equipped to make that very basic decision: Are we going to take this money and use it for addressing some of the needs in our special ed program or are we going to use it to reduce class size? Let the people at the local level decide. We won a skirmish in that process of moving the money and the decisionmaking back to the local level. but there are many here who believe that we know best what needs to go on in the local school districts. I have this litany that says we have a group of people here in Washington who believe that Washington ought to build our schools. hire our teachers. develop the curriculum. test our kids. buy technology. teach them about the arts. teach them about sex. teach them about drugs. feed them lunch. feed them breakfast. provide them with an afterschool snack and have midnight basketball.

This tells us everything we need to know about who Mickey was and why his death has touched the lives of so many people. Among the many messages of sympathy that the Mendoza family have received. I read one that I would like to share with my colleagues. This letter was written by Anthony Maneri. Mickeys classmate at Saddle Brook Middle School. \"Mickey was a great pal.

Outside the group of ecstatic. enlightened and freedomloving patriots from within the archipelagos more than 7.000 islands. very few people were even remotely aware of the implications of the summer days events of June 12. 1898. A century later. we have come to recognize the significance of the proclamation read from a balcony in Kawit. Cavite. 101 years ago. This manifesto. closely resembling the document our forefathers signed in 1776. has come to symbolize a peoples aspiration. desire and capacity to stand their ground. take control and chart their own destiny. On June 12. 1898. the Filipino people boldly declared that the desire to be a free republic is not a uniquely Western concept. The day General Emilio Aguinaldo first unfurled the Filipino flag amidst the inspiring strains of the Philippine National Anthem signalled the birth of the first republic in Asia. an event witnessed by jubilant Filipinos and curious foreign observers alike. For the first time. a political system dedicated to the ideals of democracy and popular representative government was instituted in a part of the world that. until that day. had automatically been associated with tyranny and despotism. Although shortlived. this declaration is testament to a freedomloving nations devotion to the ideals of liberty and democracy. The events of June 12. 1898. rejected oppression and foreign domination. It has served as an inspiration to other peoples suffering from colonialism. The people of Guam share deep cultural and historical ties with the Philippines. The islands population includes a large number of Filipino immigrants. Over the years. as in numerous other locales. they have integrated themselves with the island community and made themselves a vital force in the development and growth of Guam. I am honored to join the Filipino people in the commemoration and celebration of their history. I extend my congratulations to them on the 101st anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence.",

Mr. President. every time we turn around it seems that we hear about how strong our nations economy is right nowand how Americas workers are daily facing newfound employment opportunities. We are in a period of almost unprecedented prosperity and sustained economic growth. And the bill we are voting on today is a direct consequence of that growth. It wasnt long ago that benefits such as stock options were available only to the upper levels of management. Companies are now offering stock options as a way not only to attract. but to retain quality employees at all levels. This is a way of providing fairness to our nations workersthe ones who manage the daily insandouts of the business. the ones who have quite literally built todays economy. S. 2323 will clarify that providing stock options will not be counted toward overtime pay for hourly employees. The vitality of our economy is a tribute to the hard work and creativity of these workers. Accordingly. it is unacceptable that the Fair Labor Standards Act would be interpreted in a manner that would effectively preclude the offering of this valuable benefit to hourly employees who form the backbone of American business. The Fair Labor Standards Act already exempts some employee benefits such as discretionary bonuses. health insurance. and retirement savings plans from overtime calculations. We do this to encourage employers to provide these critically needed benefits and incentives for their employeesstock options should be no different. We should not hinder the ability of our nations workers to participate in the economic success of the companies they are helping to building. If employers choose to offer profitsharing options. they should not be penalized when calculating overtime wages. Mr. President. I support this critical clarification of the Fair Labor Standards Act and I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. Thank you. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to support Senator MCCONNELLS stock options legislation. S. 2323. and commend him for his hard work on this issue. This legislation allows companies who currently offer nonsalaried employees a stock options program to continue to incentivize their work force without the threat of sanctions of the U.S. Department of Labor. This is an easy one to support. The United States is unique in the world with regard to how our stock options and the wealth generated in our companies are shared with those who significantly participate in their creation. As in most of the rest of the world. it used to be that only our top executives received stock options from their companies. Today. many high tech companies offer stock options to all of their employees. from the clerk to the CEO. Particularly with regard to an individuals retirement needs. stock options are a tremendous financial opportunity for all workers and their families. We must do everything in our power to preserve these positive wealth- and risksharing developments in our economy. Employees at every level should be allowed to reap the rewards of the success of their company. All throughout the United States. it has become common place for employees to quit their job and go to work for progressive companies who allow them to share in the wealth that their corporations generate. I hear repeatedly from industrial companies whose compensation structure is often very different. that they are losing their most talented and valuable employees to these new. often hightech. corporations. And Mr. President. that kind of competition for employees benefits all Americans and its a positive development. The Department of Labors illconsidered advisory opinion. threatened this development. and would have resulted in the cessation of often generous stock option plans for nonmanagerial and nonprofessional employees in many of Americas most progressive corporations. It is critical that we recognize the importance of these wealthand risksharing developments to the health of the American economy and carefully weigh each new regulation. interpretation. and law before we rashly risk the financial health and wellbeing of the hardworking families who have everything to do with the level of productivity our economy enjoys.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote in favor of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. S. 2323. Stock options have traditionally been distributed only to highly salaried executives. used as an incentive to promote hard work on behalf of the company. As a companys bottom line improves due in part to the executives efforts. the value of the companys stock increases. eventually rewarding the executive when he or she ultimately exercises the option and later sells the stock. I have long maintained that stock options ought be provided to all types of employeewhether hourly or salaried. management or clericaand not just the top brass. That is why I introduced the Ending the Double Standards for Stock Options Act last Congress. which would have encouraged corporations to adopt plans in which a minimum of 50% of all options would go to nonmanagement employees. After all. a companys success depends on the efforts of more than just its executives. I am hopeful that the Worker Economic Opportunity Act will encourage the growth of broadbased employee stock option plans in corporate America. The Act excludes stock options from overtime pay calculations for hourly employees. Current law also excludes benefits like discretionary bonuses. employerprovided health insurance. and retirement benefits from overtime pay rates. But current law doesnt address stock options. Last year. the Department of Labor indicated that. without action by Congress. companies would likely have to include the value of stock options when figuring an hourly employees overtime pay rate. Corporate America has argued that the administrative and financial burdens associated with such inclusion. given a huge number of different employees having different amounts of options with different exercise dates and strike prices. outweigh the benefits of having a broadbased stock option plan. This legislation is not inconsistent with my proposal to require the reporting of stock options as an expense on a companys financial statements. a key part of the Ending the Double Standards for Stock Options Act. Therefore. I support the Worker Economic Opportunity Act to remove a potential barrier to workers participation in the prosperous American economy they helped create.",

In fact. it is $69 billion over 5 years. and the budget we passed last week is $150 billion over 5 years. So this is not even half. We do hope to give tax relief to other people in our country. We want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We want to let seniors work if they are between 65 and 70 and not be penalized for it. and that bill has already been passed. We want small business tax cuts to make it easier for our small businesses to create the jobs that keep our economy thriving. We would like to give education tax cuts. Under the leadership of Senator COVERDELL. we passed education tax cuts that would help people give their children the education enhancements that would increase their education quality. All of these things fit within the $150 billion tax relief in the budget that we passed last week. I think this is quite responsible and I think it is long overdue. We are talking about a tax correction as much as anything. because it is outrageous to talk about people who are single. working. they get married and they dont get salary increases. but all of a sudden they owe $1.000 more in taxes.

If these socalled bonuses that the Senator refers to are primarily given to the oneincome earner couple where a mother stays home and is not working-. they receive some benefit from that. I think the bonus is not sufficient to make up for the fact that one of them stays at home. Also. one of the most pernicious parts of this billthe Senator from Texas has talked about this previouslyis that we are attempting in America today to break through the glass ceiling to have women move forward and achieve equal income in America. That is happening to a record degree. But under the present Tax Code. the more equal the marriage partners are in income. the more tax penalty falls on them. In a way. as a practical matter. it seems to fall against working women in a way that you would not expect it to. and it is something we would not want to see happen. We have unanimous agreement that the marriage tax penalty is a matter that ought not to continue. This legislation deals directly and squarely with that. It doubles the standard deduction. It doubles the brackets for married couples. which is the simplest and best way to achieve that. It will give hardearned relief to married couples. We had the spectacle reported of the witness who testified in the House committee that each year he and his wife would divorce before the end of the year. file separately. get the lower tax rate. and then remarry at the beginning of the next year.

I think it is important for us in trying to engage in this dialogue with the American people for them to understand that we want to see taxes go down just as much as anyone else in this body. But we want it to happen in a way that is good for the sustained. longterm growth of this country. and paying down the debt is a part of that. and we need to make that a priority. I want to thank the gentleman from California for leading in this hour. It has been very informative to hear an individual with his background in accounting and finance talk about the details of the tax proposals that have been before this House in the last 10 days. I commend him for his leadership on these issues. I know the gentlewoman from North Carolina joins me as we all try to move forward together and try to accomplish things that will bring us a better future for all of our children and our grandchildren.",

The Congressional Budget Office assumed that $595 billion would be cut in discretionary spending. The new claim is that there is going to be $1 trillion cut. and that by cutting discretionary spending by $1 trillion instead of by $595 billion. we are going to have extra money that we can turn around and spend on discretionary accounts. Mr. President. that doesnt add up in my mind. I believe discretionary accounts are important. I believe education has to be at the top of that list. I do not see where we can expect to find the money to maintain current levels of effort on education if we vote for this very large tax cut. That is why the size of the tax cut should be reduced so that education programs will not have to be cut. How much time remains?",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. BINGAMAN. This is a very important amendment that he has offered. Certainly. as we are talking about what the future of our country is going to be. we should be looking at what we are doing to invest in our young children today so they can be economically viable when they graduate from high school and college 15. 20 years from now. making sure that we have the money there for the Head Start Program. Pell grants. early childhood education. These are important investments in our children. and if we follow through on a massive tax cut at this time. as the Senator from New Mexico has said. in the future we will not have the money to make sure that our kids get the kind of education they need to be viable members of our community. This is a very important amendment. As we come to the end of this debate about what we are going to do to invest in our future. lets remember that if we put in place a tax cut such as this. we will harm our young children. we will harm Social Security and Medicare and critical programs for women in this country to make sure they dont live in poverty. We will not be able to pay off our debt. a very important issue that is facing us. which we have not left ourselves room for with a massive tax cut of this size. Most critically. we will not be able to do what we have a responsibility to do. not only as Senators but as parents and as adults in this country. to make sure that those who follow us have the skills they need to make sure this country continues to run well in the future. Investment in Pell grants and in early childhood education. and investment in education. class size reduction. and training of our teachers will make a difference for the future. We have a responsibility to do that. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his work on education. and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the Chair.",

I thank the Senator from Texas for her outstanding work correcting a pernicious discrimination against the most valuable institution in our society. the family. I thank the chairman for his sensitivity to this important issue. for placing in this bill procedures to remedy the marriage penalty. The marriage penalty simply is an anomaly. It is a strangeness in the tax structure that has evolved. that penalizes people for being married. It puts them into higher tax brackets when they get married than when they were single. When people get married. they start paying a tax penalty. That is something we should stop. The Senator from Texas and the chairman of this committee have agreed that we should stop it. And we should. as a matter of fact. according to the amendment of the Senator from Texas. of which I am an original cosponsor along with Senator BROWNBACK. accelerate the time at which we begin to stop this very serious fault with the tax system. America should not penalize the family. It should not make it harder for people to have families. It should not make it financially more difficult for two people to be married and live together than unmarried and live together. That is a simple fact. It is because the family is the best department of social services. the best department of education. it is the best place in which individuals are enriched to learn individual responsibility and the values and character our culture needs to survive. I am very pleased to be a part of this tax measure which will say about Americas families that we cherish them rather than punish them and it is time for all of us to join together and eliminate the marriage tax penalty.",

    "speech": "Actually. Mr. President. I want to add my support for the amendment put forward by Senator HUTCHISON. It builds on the basic objectives of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. particularly objectives of helping families bring greater equity to the Tax Code. One very important provision of the tax relief package we have proposed is the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. There is strong bipartisan agreement that this penalty is not only unfair but that it is counterproductive in a way that discourages couples from marrying. When I introduced the Taxpayer Refund Act 2 days ago. I introduced Robert and Dianne. a hypothetical couple who had fallen in love and wanted to marry. I explained how. as individuals. they would not be considered wealthy. how Robert worked as a foreman in an auto plant and Dianne worked as a nurse. I then explained how. as a married couple with a combined income. they would be considered well off and how they would end up paying the Government $1.500 more in taxes than they would if they remained single. The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 does away with the marriage tax penalty. It completely eliminates the penalty for Robert and Dianne and for any other couples who choose to marry. What I like about the amendment introduced by our distinguished colleague from Texas. Senator HUTCHISON. is that under her plan the tax relief is expedited. This is done at a price. The change does require the delay of other provisions that provide relief for the taxpayer. I regret that. But we do think it is desirable to provide marriage relief as early as possible. Therefore. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

I hope that sends a strong signal across this country that today is a day to celebrate. We should be celebrating the institution of marriage and support that institution rather than tax it. For many years now we have taxed it. Clearly. if there is a policy in Government that stands it is if you want less of something. tax it. if you want more of something. subsidize it. We have been taxing marriage. and marriage has fallen off in this country 43 percent over the last 30 years. That is a terrible situation for an institution that is so central. I note to my colleagues. we all frequently talk about family values. Thomas. from Hilliard. OH. writes in about this point on the marriage penalty and the notion of family values: No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start. I could not have put it better. I am delighted it appears that this amendment is going to be agreed to. I hope we can get it to the Presidents desk and that the President will be supportive of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. I hope as well we could go further in the future and enact income splitting. that we could provide for a couple to split their income. This would be even more supportive of this fundamental institution in our culture. in our Nation. of marriage. I hope we can take that step on into the future. I am delighted to have the chairmans support in this. I urge all my colleagues in the name of family values. vote for this amendment. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.",

It is my pleasure to honor all of those in the East Grand Rapids family for their commitment and dedication which resulted in being named a 1999 New American High School by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award recognizes schools where all students are expected to meet challenging academic standards and acquire the communication. problem solving. computer and technical skills necessary to pursue careers and higher education. To even be considered as a New American High School there are many hurdles that a school must successfully pass. Applicants must supply members of a steering committee with documentation that they have undertaken standardsbased. locally driven reform efforts that positively affect key indicators of school improvement and student success. Among the documentation items they must present are proof of increases in student achievement. increases in student enrollment at postsecondary institutions. increases in student attendance. and reductions in student dropout rates. East Grand Rapids is a model school when it comes to challenges and performance High expectations are set for all students because of the high motivation level of the student body. The numbers speak for themselves. Based on statistics from the 1998 school year. approximately 94% of East Grand Rapids students enrolled in colleges or universities. The school registered a dropout rate of less than 1% and an attendance rate of 97%. Academic test scores are also the highest in the state of Michigan in mathematics. reading. and writing. Mr. Speaker. I am delighted to take this opportunity to highlight the positive happenings at East Grand Rapids High School under the leadership of Superintendent Dr. James Morse and Principal Patrick Cwayna. It takes a lot of pride. sacrifice. and teamwork to qualify for this prestigious award. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in saluting everyone involved in helping East Grand Rapids achieve this remarkable honor. I also wish continued academic and overall success for everyone associated with this school.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce a House Concurrent Resolution calling for Congress to dedicate a portion of the budget surplus to fulfill the moral and legal responsibilities of the United States by ensuring proper payment and management of all federally held tribal trust fund accounts and individual Indian money accounts. Since 1820. the United States has held monies in trust for American Indians. At first for Indian Tribes and later for individual Indians as well. Funds mostly derived from the lease or sale of trust lands and other resource assets including timber stumpage. royalties from oil. gas and coal development. and agriculture fees are added to these trust fund accounts. Currently. the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). which is charged with maintaining the accounts. controls approximately 390.000 individual Indian money accounts (IIM). and 1.500 tribal accounts. Each year over $1 billion passes through these accounts. The historical and legal record demonstrates that the U.S. government has failed miserably at its fiduciary responsibility to manage these accounts. Horror stories include years of royalty checks being stuffed in desk drawers instead of deposited. and piles of documents thrown away. destroyed or lost. Reams of reports by Congressional investigators. spanning several Administrations. document the often careless and incompetent manner in which these accounts have been managed. Beginning in 1991 Congress funded BIA to reconcile the accounts but after 5 years and $21 million we were told that volumes of documentation of transactions and investments simply no longer exist. As far back as the Reagan administration. the Indian Trust Funds were listed as one of the top federal financial liabilities. Currently. a class action suit of Individual Indian Money (IIM) account holders is pending in federal court and the BIA is working to ensure that similar accounting problems do not occur in the future. In the meantime. I am deeply concerned that Congress is paying inadequate attention to the very substantial financial debt the federal government owes to Native American account holders. In particular. in making sweeping decisions about allocation of the budget",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Ukrainian famine of 193233 stands as one of the most tragic events of this century. Millions of Ukrainian men. women and children starved to death in one of the cruelest acts of inhumanity ever recorded. The rich and productive soil of Ukraine once fed the world. Ukraine was known then as the breadbasket of Europe. It was inconceivable that in 1932 peasants would be forced to scavenge in harvested fields for food and that their diets would be reduced to nothing but potatoes. beets and pumpkins. Instead of planting seeds for the next crop. peasant were reduced to feeding those seeds to their children. As a result. little grain was harvested for the next crop. and the situation grew worse. Peasants began leaving Ukraine. trying to search for food in Russia and other neighboring territories. but they were turned back. Soon. millions began to starve to death. As many as ten million people may have died in this famine. Thats fully onequarter of the people in rural Ukraine. The Kremlin was starving the people of Ukraine to death because Josef Stalin and the Soviet dictators wanted to avoid mass resistance to collectivization. So they killed the peasantsslowly. deliberately and diabolically through mass starvation. The West did little at the time to put an end to the manmade famine.

I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues to honor Congressman de la Garza. my predecessor. Many of my colleagues here in this Chamber had the pleasure and privilege of working with him during his long tenure and especially as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. Naming the Pharr. Texas. border station after the Honorable Mr. de la Garza is important to our district because it honors his role in service as international ambassador for American agriculture. an industry which thrived during Kikas tenure in the House. Agriculture is a strong element of our economy. and it only seems fitting to honor the man who did so much in this area. H.R. 1901 is indeed a tribute to a man who dedicated his life to public service and is known throughout all of Texas and the Nation simply as \"Kika.\" Kika made a dignified institution all the more distinguished with his vision. his keen insight. and his devotion to his constituents and to his country. No one deserves this honor more. I urge my fellow Members to join me in passing this measure to say. Thank you. Kika: we are indebted to you for your decades of outstanding work on behalf of the residents of the 15th congressional district of Texas and to the Nation.",

Mr. Chairman. the Lake Pontchartrain Basin is the largest estuary in the Gulf Coast region and one of the largest estuaries in the United States. However. due to urbanization. increased population growth. and intensive land uses. many water bodies in this watershed do not meet their designated uses. The sources of pollution in the Basin include inadequate sewage systems or septic tanks systems. combined sanitary and storm water sewer overflows. as well as urban and agricultural runoff. State and local agencies are working cooperatively with private organizations on restoration efforts. However. they cannot do it alone. H.R. 2957. introduced by our committee colleague. the gentleman from Louisiana . and the gentleman from Louisiana . supports these State and local efforts. First. the bill identifies the Lake Pontchartrain Basin as an estuary of national significance and adds this estuary to the list of estuaries in section 320 of the Clean Water Act that are to be given priority consideration for the National Estuaries Program. Under the National Estuaries Program. EPA will convene a management conference for the Lake Ponchartrain Basin with representation by appropriate local and State organizations. The purpose of the management conference is to help these local and State organizations come up with a plan for basin restoration that recommends activities and projects. In addition. H.R. 2957 creates a Lake Ponchartrain basin restoration program within EPA modeled after the Long Island Sound program. This program will help coordinate ongoing voluntary efforts to reduce pollution and restore the ecological health of the basin. and will provide financial assistance to help fund the activities and projects recommended by the management conference. Finally. H.R. 2957 authorizes $100 million to provide continued Federal assistance to the project to prevent inflow and infiltration in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish. Completing this project. which is an integral part of basin restoration efforts. will require a total investment of over $300 million. most of which will be provided from State and local sources of funding.

This legislation. as amended by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. would create a priority for the inclusion of the Lake Ponchartrain Basin into the EPAs National Estuary Program. By including the basin into the NEP. the administrator would be authorized to begin development of a comprehensive conservation management plan for the basin in order to promote its longterm ecological protection. In addition. this legislation would establish a new program office within EPA aimed at restoring the ecological health of the basin and coordinating the development of its CCMP. This new program office would provide administrative and technical assistance to a management conference convened for the protection of the basin. This office would also be responsible for coordinating any grant. research and planning programs authorized under this act. including grants for public education projects consistent with any management plan. Because the drainage basin for the Lake Ponchartrain watershed extends across much of southern Louisiana and Mississippi. it is the intent of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that any management conference appointed to develop a CCMP for the basin include appropriate representatives from the States of Louisiana and Mississippi. In addition. in order to ensure that the surrounding communities are fully informed. the bill requires the newlyestablished program office to collect and make available to the public information on the environmental health of the basin. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 2957 authorizes the basin restoration program at $5 million per year for 5 years. In addition. the bill authorizes $100 million for inflow and infiltration projects that are currently under construction in New Orleans.

It is important that Congress lead by example and support policies and programs that contribute to the health. safety and economic security of our communities. One simple step we can take today is to support this resolution and the event that it will enable. On May 10th. Earth Force will hold their annual Bike Rodeo on the Capitol Grounds. This event is the culmination of a nation wide cycling education project. Children from all of our districts were asked to devise safe bicycling routes through their communities and share their proposals with their peers. To commemorate their efforts Earth Force holds the bike rodeo to promote youth civic involvement and teach children about safe biking techniques. This is a fun event with an important message. In 1998. 350.000 children 14 and under were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicyclerelated injuries. Collisions with motor vehicles account for 90 percent of all bicycle related deaths and 10 percent of all nonfatal injuries. Bike safety education will go a long way to preventing these unnecessary fatalities and significantly enhance the livability of our communities. This event is the perfect way to celebrate May as National Bike Safety Month.

He was rewarded for that when he was elected by his fellow Senators to be the Secretary of the Senate Republican Conference. I know something about that because he beat me. I could not have lost to a better man. He had his little mannerisms. He could put you in a box. put a cap on you. do a lot of things. But his quiet demeanor and lack of fuss in tackling whatever tasks were assigned to him belied his effectiveness. He served President Bush as Director of the Peace Corps. He was a man of peace. He served as leader of the Republican Party in the Georgia Senate for 15 years. from 1974 to 1989. skillfully guiding that body through some difficult but rewarding years. His leadership really surfaced when he came to the Senate. We have talked about him being a stalwart on national defense and on taxes. but I think he had his best vision and his best grasp of this business in reforming public education because he always referred back to his vision for the next generation. The next generation was always on his mind. As a proponent of equal educational opportunities. he introduced sweeping education and tax reform bills.

After years of declining military budgets. this Defense Appropriations bill does the right thing by putting more of our resources toward our Armed Forces. While I strongly support the overall bill. I would like to make note of one serious omissionthe cut in funding for the Discoverer II or DII program. I know that Senator STEVENS and the Defense Appropriations staff fought hard for the DII program. but that they ran up against an entrenched opposition from the other side. Discoverer II is a key element in assessing the utility. feasibility. and affordability of Space Based Radar (SBR). SBR will provide all weather. 24 hour. 7day a week global surveillance coverage. The Department of Defense has stated that SBR will satisfy many unfilled requirements. such as Long Range Endurance Reconnaissance. Surveillance and Target Acquisition. Improved Ground Moving Target Indicator Tasking. Processing. Exploitation and Dissemination Interoperability. and provide simultaneous access to multiple theaters worldwide. The program not only had the wide support of many Members of Congress. but also from the Secretary of the Air Force. the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office. the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. Technology. and Logistics. the CINC of US Space Command. the CINC of US Central Command. and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. While I cannot understand the reasoning for such opposition. I do want to thank Senator STEVENS and his staff for fighting for this program and only hope that we can revive this important program in the future. The capabilities it will provide are too important to let it go quietly in the night. As the Chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee on the Armed Service Committee. as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. and as a member of the Commission on the National Reconnaissance Office.

Founded sixtysix years ago at the initiative of a group of Japanese students who were concerned about deteriorating U.S.-Japan relations. the monthlong Conference has since convened on fiftytwo annual occasions. alternating between the two countries. This year. the Conference will open on July 21st at Tokai Universitys Honolulu campus. then move on to the University of North Carolina. Washington. DC. and New York City. and will conclude at the Reischauser Institute for Japanese Studies at Harvard University on August 21st. The sixtytwo delegates. half from each country and. representing some thirtyfour university campuses. will address such topics as: business practices. environmental issues. philosophy and religion. historical perspectives. and third world policies. against the thematic backdrop of Developing New Approaches to Promote Social Change.\" JASC is completely designed and implemented by students. Delegates elect Japanese and American Executive Committees at the conclusion of each Conference who manage. plan. and select delegates for the next years event. Many alumni of the conference have gone on to distinguish themselves in the business. academic. and governmental arenas of their respective societies. Most notable among them is Kiichi Miyazawa. former Prime Minister and current Finance Minister of Japan. who participated in the 1939 and 1940 Conferences. and Henry Kissinger. former U.S. Secretary of State. who participated in the 1951 Conference. A common denominator among the highly diverse delegate community is a deep interest in knowing more about the U.S. and Japan. which can lead to careers relevant to the bilateral relationship. Thirty intense days of travel and dialogue with each other foster better understanding and trust between the cultures. and. more importantly. friendships that endure for decades. As one delegate observed. \"JASC is not a destination. it is a journey that does not conclude.\"o",

Hall will retire after 48 years of service to the Bethesda Baptist Church in Saginaw. Reverend Halls history of pubic service is truly deserving of recognition. After serving his country in the Navy during World War II. he received his Bachelor of Theology from the Chicago Baptist Institute in 1950. He then moved to Saginaw. Michigan and organized the Bethesda Baptist Church in 1952. where he has ministered there for nearly five decades. In 1990. he furthered his studies in Theology by earning his Doctor of Divinity from Urban Bible College in Detroit. In addition to his career in the ministry. Rev. Hall has dedicated himself to civic leadership through his work with many community organizations. From civil rights activist to County Commissioner. he has won many hats in his long public career. but all of them have shown a true dedication to his community. For the last 48 years. Rev. Hall has served with integrity and compassion. Rev. Halls departure from Bethesda Baptist Church will certainly mark a new chapter in his life. I can only hope it is as successful as this previous one. Though I am sure he will remain active in his many church and community activities. I hope that he will be able to spend more time with his wife. Marie. and their children and grandchildren. I am pleased to join his family. congregation. and friends in offering my thanks for all he has done. Mr. President. Reverend Nick Hall. Jr. can take pride in his long and honorable career to Bethesda Baptist Church. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Rev. Halls commitment to his community and religion. and in wishing him well in his retirement..",

These two acts. along with Floyds countless other efforts to help urban communities. illustrates his commitment as a true public servant. Since his retirement. Floyd has continued his service to the public. He is currently the Pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens and has led a movement to increase churchbased nonprofit activity in communities.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me that one of the basic purposes of government is to preserve the cultural fabric of the Nation. Since 1966. one way this Nation has tried to accomplish that goal is through the National Historic Preservation Act. The bill before us reauthorizes that act through 2000 at its present level of $150 million a year. It is a tribute to the program that it has achieved the success it has despite the fact that it has seldom received more than $40 million a year in appropriations. State historic preservation agencies have used these Federal funds to attract three times that amount in State and private investment. The bill also reaffirms the Nations commitment to the use of historic properties by Federal agencies. It also provides an authorization by which the Interior Department may administer grants to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. This does not mean we are putting the trust back on the public payroll. Instead. it will allow Interior to respond quickly to emergency situations such as hurricanes or flooding. There were some things left undone in this bill. While we retained the exemptions for the Capitol. the Supreme Court building. and the White House from historic preservation law. we were unable to agree on language that aimed at making the Architect of the Capitol more responsive to local preservation concerns. This was largely due to the fact that the architect is not a government agency. I believe this is an issue that needs to be revisited in the future. We have gotten a lot of mileage out of the Defense Departments record in historic preservation. particularly at some old cavalry posts out West. If these facilities can honor their heritage and yet serve an evolving role In todays warfighting. I fail to see why the homes of the three branches of government need special treatment. This bill is already 3 years overdue. and we must move ahead. In conclusion. this is the bill that makes no sweeping changes. only incremental changes to what has become a mature and successful program. It works and for those reasons. I move the bill and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The Los Angeles County sanitation districts urgently need funds to replace a sewer line beneath the Santa Clara River in my district. Following the El Nino storms in the winter of 1998. the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared Los Angeles County a disaster area. While the sewer lines have not yet leaked. stormrelated erosion in the river bed did cause significant damage to the lines. Further erosions may very well cause the rupture of the lines releasing up to 8 million gallons of raw sewage per day into the Santa Clara River and eventually the Pacific Ocean. To permanently solve this problem. the sanitation districts have proposed a sound. onetime engineering solution that involves moving the pipelines deeper underground. This proposal is the best solution. both from an engineering standpoint and from an environmental standpoint as well. Unfortunately. both FEMA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service disagree on the manner to solve this problem. leaving it up to Congress to fill the void and protect both the residents and the environment of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. I appreciate the work of the chairman to date on this legislation and look forward to working with him to obtain a solution to this issue as the legislation moves along in the legislative process.",

As we all know. we have been discussing very important benefits to veterans last night and today. benefits with regard to education. particularly with regard to health care. but perhaps one of the most critical and important benefits to veterans is that that is given to their family and the honor that they give to those veterans at the time of their burial. We all in this chamber have heard many different stories about the lack of an honor guard at a veterans funeral when requested. We have heard stories about sometimes they do not show up. Other times we have heard stories where they are actually leaving before the funeral party actually comes to the burial site. I think it is a disaster and a catastrophe that veterans. after having served and provided us with great service for many. many years. that unfortunately we do not sometimes provide the necessary honor guard at their burial. So I ask that we include this sense of Congress at the end of the bill. The ranking member and the subcommittee chairman have talked to me about it. and we have crafted language.

Mr. Chairman. it has come to my attention that HUD recently issued a notice of funding availability. NOFA. for the Resident Opportunities and Selfsufficiency program. This program contains a component for service coordinator grants. For those of you not familiar with service coordinators. they help elderly and disabled residents in public housing get the unique services they require. The program is cost effective and the residents of public housing love the program. as do the housing authorities. Because of its success. Congress has agreed in the last funding cycle to provide sufficient funds to renew all existing service coordinator programs. Unfortunately. the recent NOFA contains several troubling provisions that seem to defy congressional intent and jeopardize the ability of many public housing authorities to obtain renewal of their service coordinator funding. Specifically. one provision provides public housing authorities to have to spend 75 percent of their award by August. even though the PHAs only received notice of the grant in April. As a practical matter. it is impossible for any PHA to expend 75 percent of their funds by the first of August. but under the NOFA they must have done so in order to qualify for renewal spending for next year. Another provision of the NOFA states that the funds will be provided on a firstcomefirstservedbasis. This provision implies that there are insufficient funds to pay for renewals. Congress has been assured repeatedly by HUD that funds are sufficient to pay for renewal. Therefore. the provision is unnecessary. After being apprised of congressional concerns. HUD has agreed to make changes to the NOFA. In fact. HUD has assured me that an amended NOFA will be published in the Federal Register in the near future. I appreciate the alacrity with which HUD has acted on this matter and want to assure public housing residents that this program will be fully funded this year and next. I know the gentleman from West Virginia shares my opinion that service coordinators are vitally important and would turn to him for a comment on this issue.",

If funding is not available. my veterans will suffer the consequences. And now. at the end of the fiscal year. I am faced with a choice of voting for a $1.7 billion increase in funding or voting against funding in the hopes that $3 billion will be added. The smaller figure is insufficient. but a step in the right direction. I intend to vote for this bill. but I am disappointed that we are not able to amend this bill so that I could vote for adequate funding for veterans. Our veterans have served our country well. They dont deserve to go through the annual budget process with the uncertainty that exists.

We have to stop cheating our veterans. I will encourage the President to submit a better budget next year. And as I did this year.

It is my view that the VA. Congress. community health leaders. and veterans service organizations must do even more to ensure that veterans have access to the testing and treatment they deserve. Today. nearly four million Americans have HCV. But the infection rate among veterans is as much as six times higher than in the general population according to the American Liver Foundation. Recent testing efforts within the VA indicate that nationally 810 percent of veterans are HCV positive and in some urban areas it is double that rate. Alarming as these numbers are. the situation in the Hispanic community is especially serious. In our community. the infection rate approaches six percent among those in their late forties and early fifties and I am concerned that among Hispanic veterans the rate could be even higher. I am particularly concerned that we are seeing the beginning of what will be a steadily increasing number of Vietnam era veterans who test positive for this disease. Nearly one million Hispanic Americans are veterans of military service. several hundred thousand of whom served during the Vietnam era. Unfortunately. HCV is a silent killer. The disease progresses slowly without symptoms in a majority of patients for two decades or more. Patients with chronic NCV have significantly lower healthrelated quality of life than healthy individuals. But let there be no mistake about the serious nature of this disease. Untreated. HCV leads to liver failure. cancer. and death. It is now the leading cause of liver transplantationa procedure that costs upwards of $250.000 if an organ is even available for the patient. I would like to have seen more funds directed toward veterans healthcare and I strongly urge the VA to take all necessary steps to ensure that at the local level. every veteran who needs testing and treatment for HCV is able to get it. I applaud the efforts of veterans service organizations and local community health leaders to inform the atrisk members of our communities about the dangers of HCV. I look forward to working with each of these groups in the effort to halt the spread of this epidemic.",

It seems to me it is only keeping CRA abreast of the developments that are taking place with respect to financial modernization. because heretofore banks could not reach out and dothey did some of those activities within the bank of a very limited nature that had been permitted either by regulation or by court opinion but which were highly controversial and contested. and one of the things this bill is intended to do is to resolve those questions in terms of the structure of the financial services industry.

Otherwise. it seems to me. over time. you will erode CRA. as institutions begin to shift their assets out from under the banking activity into the securities and the insurance activities.

We have already seen it. What we are going to see are consolidations and mergers with other aspects of the financial services communityinsurance and securities. And if you say that CRA has no reference or application to those applications. in effect you are relegating CRA to the dustbin of history: by and large. it is no longer as relevant as it is currently.

Conceding that there are small banks who really pay attention to their community. it is obvious that there are also small banks which are not doing that. In fact. the Madison Wisconsin Capital Times. in an editorial a couple of years ago. said: Many rural banks establish a very different pattern than reinvesting in their communities where local lending takes a lower priority than making more assured investment like Federal Government securities. Thus. such banks drain local resources of the very localities that support them. making it much harder for local citizens to get credit. I do not gainsay the examples that the Senator cited.

You have to expect that these bankers are going to have to put the money to some use. if there is nobody out there asking for the loan. The question I have for the Senator is. how many of those loans have been asked for and then denied? The story I haveand I dont have this information in front of meis that he said it is awfully hard to loan money to my community when there is no request for loans. What do I do. let the money sit in the safe overnight? No. he has to invest it. maybe in some of these other government or other financial institutions or financial mechanisms. I think there are two sides of that story. It is not that these banks are turning down loans. In many cases. in these small communities in rural parts of the country. there is no demand for these loans. The bank is a good. safe place to keep it. but not always to be able to use the banks facilities.",

You do not have to have a Ph.D. in mathematics to figure out. if you have done 16.380 exams on these small. rural banks. and only three of them have been in substantial noncompliance. you are spending a tremendous amount of their money to find a very. very small number of bad actorsin fact. three onehundredths of 1 percent. What is even more astounding is that all of these little banks combined make up only 2.8 percent of the capital of the banking system. They are getting 44 percent of the examinations.

Flag Day was established to ensure that each year on that day we recall our nations proud history and its role as a symbol of freedom and democracy to our citizens and to people around the world fighting for justice. I was much surprised to discover that this editorial. written with great wisdom and eloquence. was penned by Elizabeth McGarr. an intern at the Dallas Morning News in her first week with the newspaper. America is a diverse and culturally rich country. but as Elizabeth points out in her editorial. we are all able to unite around the flag and celebrate our commitment to the ideals embodied in the Declaration of Independence: life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Students in this program are learning skills that are highly important in the working world and will give them a leg up on the competition as they enter the workforce. This program has made a tremendous impact on the schools learning environment and also gives students an incentive to stay in school. Fifteen years ago. the faculty at Walla Walla High School wanted to create a program in which students would gain practical knowledge to supplement what is learned in the traditional classroom setting. The Career and Technical Education Program. created with the help of grant money. gives students the opportunity to gain technical skills along with the schools curriculum. For example. students enrolled in anatomy or physiology class can put their knowledge to work by taking Sports Medicine where they learn about treating sports injuries. CPR and other first aid skills. In addition. technology labs have been interwoven into the curriculum to teach robotics. flight simulation. and bridge analysis to enhance math and physics classes. Through this programs. students can see a direct link between their work in the classroom to a potential job. Gerald Cummins. Director of Career and Technical Education. says the Career and Technical Education Program has drastically improved the college bound population in Walla Walla over the last fifteen years. \"Fifteen years ago. there were barely any kids continuing on to the college level. Now most kids are achieving college credits through our program before even being accepted into college.\" The faculty at Walla Walla High School also has established strong communication between parents. the school and community members. giving students a sense of support that will encourage them to continue in their academic pursuits. Much credit should be given to the vision of the Walla Walla School Board and staff who have worked to ensure high standards of teaching. They have found new ways to improve upon their curriculum and provided excellent opportunities for each student to expand his or her horizons.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to pay tribute to Moorpark High School. which. for the second consecutive year. will represent Ventura County in the Academic Decathlon California state finals on March 12. These 16 students are representative of the best and brightest our country has to offer. I say that without exaggeration. Moorpark High Schools A Team is rated secondbest in the countryquite a feat for a relatively small high school. And their coaches. head coach Larry Jones and assistant coach Michelle Bergman. are examples of what is right in our educational system today Their dedication is to be applauded. Moorpark High School fielded two teams to compete in the Ventura County Academic Decathlon against the best and brightest from other country high schools on Feb. 6. At the end of the day. Moorpark Highs two teams bested all the rest. coming in first and second. Now they are readying themselves to take on last years state championEl Camino High School. which is the only school rated higher than Moorpark in the nation. Unfortunately. because of contest rules. only Moorparks A team will be able to compete in the state contest. even though the B team is rated higher than many of the other contestants. But rather than dwell on the unfortunate. the B team members are rallying their A team peers. These teenagers are taking nothing for granted. For several weeks. the academic achievers have been studying at school until 10 p.m.. then hitting a coffee shop or a students home to study some more. The fine students representing the A team are: Valerie Lake. Mitul Patel. Ari Shaw. Arturo Barragan. Alexandra Dove. Rebecca Wershba. John Ellis and Nick Lange. The B team is represented by Shanna Gibbs. Tiffany Chou. Jennifer Lawrence. Shaun Berry. Tara Hernandez. James Marlier. Charles Pomerantz and Jason Sweitzer. On a personal note. let me add that Ari Shaw served as an intern in my office last year. The time he spent here apparently was positive: He won a gold medal during the contest for a speech on his experiences. Mr. Speaker. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon Teams for their achievements to date. and in wishing the A team great success in the state championships.",

Each year our Government spends billions of taxpayer dollars on things which are ineffective and simply unnecessary. I have heard many stories from Federal employees about the pressure to spend all of the money they have been appropriated for a given fiscal year. Agency administrators know that if they have a surplus at the end of the fiscal year. it is likely that their budgets will be cut the following year. That is why I have decided to introduce legislation to address this problem. This bill will allow Government agencies to keep half of any unspent administrative funds. This money can then be used to pay for employee bonuses. The remaining half would be returned to the Treasury for the purpose of reducing the national debt. My bill rewards fiscal responsibility by giving employees a direct benefit for saving taxpayer dollars. At the same time. it will address one of the biggest problems facing our countrythe national debt. I think this is an important step toward restoring the financial security of our Nation.",

Most people would agree that it is impossible to treat an ailment when you do not know what the ailment is. But that is exactly what OSHA is doing.

That is why the National Academy of Sciences has agreed to study the issue of repetitive stress injuries and any possible link they may have to the workplace. Once this panel of experts concludes its studiesthen. and only thenwill the Federal Government be able to fully examine this issue.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to explain why I joined 89 of my colleagues from both parties in voting against the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act. But first. let me say that I did not vote against this bill because I oppose the noble function that the Peace Corps serves. I have the utmost respect for this program. and for the people who choose to give two years of their lives to help others. Furthermore. I recognize the successes the Peace Corps has had in helping impoverished. struggling communities gain a foothold in the modern world. I voted against passage of the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act because I dont believe that authorizing a substantial increase in funds for this program is the best use of federal money at this point. This bill will increase funding for the Peace Corps from $241 million this year to $365 million in 2003. an increase of 51 percent. Because I recognize the value of the Peace Corps. I would have voted for a measure that reauthorizes the Peace Corps at the existing funding level. or at a level that provides for a small increase to account for inflation. I believe that a major increase in funding for a program such as the Peace Corps is unwise at a time when the federal government continues to cut Medicare funding for rural hospitals and patients and the U.S. Forest Service is unable to protect our nations federal forests from catastrophic wildfires and destructive beetle infestations. While the additional Peace Corps authorization is small. relative to other outlays by the federal government. we must be careful to prioritize our spending to direct it toward those programs that benefit Americans who need assistance Many Members of Congress. as well as the President. have committed themselves to saving Social Security and Medicare. These efforts will require substantial investments. and we must be prudent with our spending now so we can fulfill our obligation to current and future retirees.

I would like to honor this individual who. for so many years. has exemplified the notion of public service and civic duty. Now retired from the Colorado House of Representatives. it is clear that Representative Entzs dynamic leadership in the Colorado General Assembly will be greatly missed and difficult to replace. Elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1982a seat he would hold until 1998. Representative Entz rose quickly to positions of great influence within the House. In 1989. Representative Entz was named Chairman of the House Local Government committee which he would chair until 1994. While serving in the General Assembly. Representative Entz was best known for his tireless work on natural resource. agricultural and local government issues. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to work closely with him on many of these and other issues.

It has been statistically proven and exhaustively mentioned in this Chamber that children learn better in smaller classes. It has also been proven that children need access to technology and other resources to be successful. One way to do that is to build areas that are reflective of these technological developments and trends--new schools. I respect the fact that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree that new schools are an important key to education. It is unfortunate that those same people have spent 4 years blocking all significant school modernization initiatives. The Archer proposal would only give limited assistance to schools and targets the districts that need this assistance the least. We have all heard the stories of classes being held in spaces not intended as classrooms. Students are being taught in trailers. gyms. lunchrooms. and closets. Statistics show there is a national school infrastructure backlog of needed repair totaling $112 billion. We now know that nearly onethird of all schools are in need of extensive repair or replacement As this need for school repair continues to mount so does the pressure on our students to succeed and compete with their peers internationally. To level the playing field we must provide our students with the tools of success. They need computers with access to the Internet. smaller classes. welltrained teachers. and modern schools. We should never again hear tales of learning in closets or trailers in parking lots. We have the opportunity in this Congress to help our future. Mr. Speaker.

Every major health care organization supports the DingellNorwood bill. every single one. bar none.

I am particularly concerned about one provision of this bill. the exemption for liability claims when mental health is damaged. I personally had the experience of working with a patient who was suicidal.

We think that the cost to the bipartisan managed care bill will be very small. and that that is part of the reason why Members should support it. Why is that? The critics of our bill have said that it is going to result in a lot of lawsuits. but if we look at a study that was recently done by Coopers & Lybrand for the Kaiser Family Foundation. where they compared group health plans that do not have a liability shield to those that do. the incidence of lawsuits was in the range of from .3 to 1.4 cases per 100.000 enrollees. and they showed that the legal costs for those group health plans that are not shielded was from 3 to 13 cents per month per employee. That is a small price to pay for somebody who is spending thousands of dollars for their HMO coverage to be sure that that health plan then will not cut the corners too tight in the pursuit of profits that could result in harm or injury. when under current ERISA law they are shielded from that liability. Under the plain meaning limits of our bill. the provisions. as looked at by a leading ERISA law firm in the country. have shown that we do exempt employers. It is the plain meaning of our bill. That is part of the reason why the gentleman from Oklahoma and the gentleman from Arizona put in about 5 or 6 extra pages that are very circular that in the end. basically. in my opinion. and we will go into that in more detail. shield the employer. or rather. shield the health plans. just like the problem we are trying to correct.

Real health care saves lives by making clinical trials available to patients. not just cancer patients. but to patients that are suffering from many diseases. Real health care is a clean NorwoodDingell bill. The reason is. the first lesson I learned in nursing school was the patient always comes first. I hope we remember that when we vote today. One other thing that I would just like to bring up very rapidly. 5 years ago. when I was an average citizen and had my health care insurance. I could not sue my HMO.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. it is as a professional health care advocate that I rise in support of the GossCoburnShadeggGreenwoodThomas substitute amendment. This amendment provides patients with vital protections that the NorwoodDingell bill does not. such as shorter external appeal times. network adequacy standards. access to ambulance services. guaranteed pathology services. and a prohibition on plans labeling FDA approved drugs and devices as \"experimental.\" This amendment ensures patients get the care they need when they need it. It leaves medical decisions up to doctors. not insurers. and not lawyers. It allows doctors to treat their patients and prevents insurers from making medical necessity decisions. Insurers will be held accountable for wrongful actions. and patients. if injured. can go to court to sue for damages. This substitute amendment also broadens the appeals process a patient may use by allowing binding arbitration as an alternative option to court. Arbitration will provide those patients who choose to select it the opportunity to appeal medical coverage decisions and to hold health insurers financially accountable for wrongful decisions in a nonthreatening forum with the same protections as court. but without the cost and time consumption.",

In Texas. we passed patient protection legislation. It is working. There is no reason to conclude that we will run to the courthouse or that there has been a rush of litigation. This House rejected the Boehner substitute because it allows insurance companies to avoid accountability. But equally damaging is to allow insurance companies to avoid medical malpractice laws of our 50 States by creating an exclusive preemptive Federal cause of action that is nothing more than the insurance company protection act of 1999. The Coburn substitute blatantly tips the scales of justice in favor of the insurance companies. It privatizes justice by giving a private panel the authority to make judicial findings that are binding on the Federal court. Giving private entities the power to make findings that bind the Federal court is unprecedented in American law. and this provision should be rejected. This substitute gives legal protection from liability to insurance companies enjoyed by no other group except foreign diplomats. We must protect patients. We must preserve accountability. We must preserve States rights and reject the Coburn substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as we have heard from a number of our doctors today on both sides of this issue. I want to give my colleagues the perspective of an attorney who practiced law representing health care providers in malpractice cases. I am somewhat confused because I have seen firsthand how unrestricted litigation against doctors and hospitals have caused the cost of medical care to rise dramatically. It caused doctors to practice defensive medicine. It caused premiums to go up and to see the cost of this service. the tests. and all of that to go up to where it is almost unaffordable. Yet. here. we are today talking about trying to do the same thing to health care organizations. Why do we want to do that? I have studied these bills. and I have come to a conclusion that there is a need for accountability for managed care. We have to hold them accountable. but we can do so in a fashion that does not chase people out of the health care industry. does not raise the expenses. does not cause more people to become uninsured. That is done in the ShadeggCoburn bill. It is a balanced. reasoned. measured approach which holds our HMOs accountable for good care and. on the other hand. does not run people out. does not make it too expensive that we have got more uninsureds on the rolls.",

NorwoodDingell will not override protections already provided by State laws. States such as Texas. New York. Michigan. Iowa all across this great country. NorwoodDingell is a commonsense local approach to these problems. If an insurer makes a decision. the insurer is responsible for that decision.

That was his premise. because ERISA preempts all State law. and our bill said not otherwise preempted. He said that is the flaw in our logic. The problem is he is wrong about that. ERISA does preempt all benefits claims. but it does not preempt quality of care claims. That is precisely what the Texas Legislature took advantage of.

While each new exploration into space remains a marvel of scientific ingenuity and the creative spirit. this mission is a truly special one. As we mark the 30th Anniversary of the greatest triumph of the American space program--mankinds first footsteps on the moonwe can see how far we have come. This latest shuttle mission deployed the most sophisticated Xray observatory ever built and will give us even greater opportunities to observe areas of the universe about which we still know very little. such as the remnants of exploded stars. Still more special. however. is that this 118 hour and 50 minute mission was the first commanded by a woman. Colonel Collins has four degrees in science and mathematics and spent three years teaching mathematics at the U.S. Air Force Academy. making her something of an anomaly in a society where so few of our young girls go on to science and mathematics course work in their secondary and postsecondary education. While much progress has been made over the past few years. there is still a disparity in the number of girls who go on to take advanced mathematics and science classes in high school and college. Similarly. women are less likely to pursue a science or mathematics degree in college or related career. This disparity is not caused by lack of achievement. as earlier science and math proficiency gaps between young boys and girls have narrowed and virtually disappeared. According to a recent National Science Foundation study on womens entry into science and engineering fields. one possible reason is the lack of female teacher role models in secondary schools. Colonel Collins may not be a high school teacher. but she is certainly a fine role model for aspiring engineers. astronauts. and mathematicians. In fact. both girls and boys can look up to her as an example of where science and mathematics can take us. I commend Colonel Collins for her pioneering role in Americas space program and her crew for a job welldone.",

NASA and for the women of our country. She has persevered in a way that most of us can only dream of. Mr. Speaker. we all can remember the awe that we felt as children as we watched John Glenn.

Collins rarely ever missed an episode of Star Trek or Lost in Space according to her family. Along with her father. Col. Collins would watch the gliders soaring over Elmira hoping one day she too could fly. Eileen Collins dared to dream and her dreams became our dreams.

If Congress enacts the proposal suggested by my colleague from Massachusetts. that would allow no recovery of economic damages in tort cases. Purchaser B in the example would be able to sue for economic losses under the Y2K legislation while purchaser A would not. There is no justification for such a result. In effect. the net result of the Y2K bill would be to expand liability in Y2K cases. Indeed. it would create an incentive for plaintiffs lawyers to look for any Y2K problem and then make that the predicate for legislation. exactly the opposite of the policy aim of the legislation. In the faulty wire case. you only get economic damages and you have to apply State law. Under the Y2K legislation as proposed by my colleague from Massachusetts. you are expanding this. We are not trying to expand law here. we are trying to at least follow a similar pattern. So there is a fundamental difference: the defective wire in one case. the defective Y2K problem in the other. You end up with completely different results and encourage. of course. groping around. looking for Y2K issues. rather than defective wire which may be the cause of the problem. I dont think that is the intent of our colleagues who are generally supportive of the very proposal we have before the Senate. That does expand existing law.",

They have sold it to a small businessman. There is a Y2K problem and the small business is put out of business. They have lost millions of dollars over the course of several months. What we determine. when the investigation is done. is that what caused the problem is a chip. a computer chip that was sold by a manufacturer with whom this purchaser never had any interaction. Or it was some program that was loaded onto the computer. And the plaintiff never had any relation with the software manufacturer. Of course they would not. they bought the computer at a computer store from some computer salesman. Under the provisions of this bill. the person who was actually responsible. that is the manufacturer of the computer chip or software that was not Y2K compliantyou cannot recover against that responsible person for economic losses under the express provisions of this paragraph in Section 12. In fact. the Senator and I both know in reality that is what is most likely to happen. What most people are going to confront when they have a Y2K problem is some very isolated. discrete part of their computer system that caused the problem. It is not going to be the entire system. My point being there is no contract between the purchaser and that responsible party. that party in my example who is acting irresponsibly. What you are doing in this bill is you are absolutely cutting off the right of this innocent businessman to recover anything more than what he has lost. what he has lost out of his pocket. what he has lost as a result of not being able to make sales.

It is based on the same amendment I offered on the product liability bill in another Congress which twice passed the House by overwhelming bipartisan votes. Currently. my amendment responds to a couple of problems. It is inordinately difficult for United States citizens and businesses to bring legal actions against foreign defendants to obtain compensation for harm inside the United States. We correct it with this motion to recommit. We respond to the problem. first. by creating a nationwide context test whenever a foreign defendant is sued in Federal court if it knew or reasonably should have known that its conduct would cause harm in this country. This type test has repeatedly been upheld by the Federal courts and is a part of the law in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The second thing the amendment would do is provide for worldwide service of process. Presently. a major problem with service is that each of our States requires different and varying methods of process. Uniform worldwide service of process will fix this problem and is consistent with other Federal laws. including the Clayton Act and securities laws. permitting service wherever the defendant may be found. Third. my amendment ensures that the foreign persons are subject to the same rules of discovery as our own citizens and corporations when they are sued for wrongdoing. This is a particular problem in the context of Y2K litigation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s. the percentage of foreignmade computer components and U.S. computers was as high as 65 percent. The most recent information supplied by the Commerce Department predicts Asian computer suppliers have now announced their intentions to wrest control away from U.S. rivals and pose a challenge in highperformance computer systems and PCs. If they succeed. the very least we can do is make sure they are subject to the rules of our legal system. So. with a record trade deficit last year of $165 billion. a deficit last month of $20 billion. our Nation can no longer afford to favor foreign defendants in court.

This motion to instruct conferees is important because it reflects our need to act now and to provide full funding of $621 million in disaster assistance for Central America. Already 6 months have passed since Hurricane Mitch. Every day that we delay is another day of suffering for our neighbors in Honduras. Nicaragua. El Salvador. and Guatemala. During my recent visit to the area with President Clinton. I saw firsthand the terrible. terrible devastation. Entire roads and villages were literally washed away. Millions of people were merely surviving. lacking adequate shelter. food. and water. Their livelihoods have been completely destroyed. and they are suffering from inadequate health care. The situation is growing worse. and I can tell my colleagues that our failure to act is simply inexcusable. Mr. Speaker. we must act now to stop the partisan wrangling and push forward this assistance. Conditions there remain bleak. and. with the upcoming rainy season. things will only get dramatically worse. The $621 million in the supplemental will allow for the critical repair and reconstruction of roads. bridges. and schools. Moreover. critical health care and prevention resources will. hopefully. avert a looming epidemic of diseases such as malaria. cholera. dengue fever. and other killer diseases. Finally. this aid will begin the process of resurrecting the agriculture economies of these nations. providing hope and restoration of these peoples lives and an orderliness in their countries. This is a matter of humanitarian assistance that should not be held up by political posturing. Our Nation can and should take decisive action immediately to alleviate the misery that is now occurring in Central America. This is simply the right thing to do. and it is long overdue for action from this House. I ask this House to send a strong message that help is on the way and that help will provide and eliminate the suffering in Central America. Mr. Speaker.

He is the leader of a movement known as the Democracy Movement. It is a peaceful movement that advocates change. democratic change. in Cuba. And they have two vessels. and on December 10 they were heading south. and. pursuant to an executive order issued by the President. the Coast Guard boarded the vessel. It is known. it is called. The Human Rights. and it was the day that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was being commemorated. the anniversary of it. the 50th anniversary. in fact. of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And the Coast Guard boarded it and found some documents that referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. and since that day dissidents within Cuba had announced that they were going to attempt to demonstrate peacefully in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights. This vessel. The Human Rights. was boarded by the Coast Guard and confiscated. and to this date the Clinton administration refuses to give it back. Mr. Speaker. it is really unconscionable. More than even unfortunate. it is unconscionable. So I asked the administration to note the hunger strike by Ramon Saul Sanchez to return The Human Rights vessel that was confiscated. as I say. for the crime. in quotes. of being found on the high seas with documents in support of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. and here is the official communication of the Department of Treasury. The Coast Guard received information: this is to Mr. Sanchez. that you planned to disembark in Cuba. received information. by the way. from the Castro government. and that you planned to join a demonstration in support of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the boarding it was determined that there was sufficient evidence indicating that the vessel was intending to enter Cuban waters. and a decision was made to seize the vessel. By the way. the evidence that the Clinton administration says existed with regard to intent to enter Cuban waters was finding documents that contained the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That is happening in this country at this time because of this administration. It is shameful. and it is time to release the vessel The Human Rights.",

I have served as both a city police officer and a Michigan State police trooper for approximately 12 years. When I was elected to the Michigan Legislature in 1988. I authored legislation to bring community policing to Michigan. I have always advocated bringing police officers and citizens together. coming together. working together to solve neighborhood and community problems.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. along with my colleagues. Representatives DAVIS and MORELLA. I am pleased to introduce the Federal Employees Overtime Pay Limitation Amendments Act of 1999. The overtime cap for federal managers and supervisors has not changed for thirty years. Under current law. their overtime pay is limited to that given to a General Schedule level 10 step 1 employee. As the result. managers and supervisors. the majority of whom rank above that level. earn less on overtime than they do for work performed during the regular .work week. When this issue was raised at a civil service reform hearing last year. the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) testified that the cap was unfair and warranted looking into. My response was. \"When are you going to look into it.\" Like the rest of us. federal managers and supervisors only have their kids and families for a certain amount of time. They deserve to be fairly compensated so that they can adequately provide for their loved ones. They want to send their kids to college. they want to give them violin lessons. they want to move into a new house. and if we wait 10 to 15 years. then they have missed out on a whole lot of life. Representatives DAVIS and MORELLA. and I kept the pressure on OPM until it drafted overtime legislation to address this issue. It is this legislation that I am pleased to introduce today. The legislation would change existing law so that no federal employee would receive less than his or her hourly rate of pay for overtime work. Please join me by cosponsoring this legislation for federal managers and supervisors and their families.",

I applaud the gentleman from Minnesota for his effort and his work addressing a very legitimate problem of Americans getting ripped off by drug manufacturers every time they visit their local pharmacy. Undoubtedly. something is needed to rectify the injustice that has resulted in Americans paying more for FDAapproved products made in FDAapproved facilities than citizens of any other country in the world. I have here two bottles. Both of them are Claritin. made by Schering Corporation. One of them is sold in North Dakota for $219 for 100 tablets. The same 100 tablets in Canada is $61. It is one of the safest drugs ever made by man. It is unbelievable how safe this product is. Yet. the American people get ripped off. pay four times what they ought to have to pay for this product just because of the laws of the country that protect the prescription drug manufacturers in this country. The gentleman from Minnesota has approached this legislation with noble intentions and placed much effort into passing it. While I support his efforts. Congress should take a much more comprehensive approach in dealing with this situation. Under the Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act. the burden is on the importer to demonstrate that an imported drug is safe. effective. and approved by the FDA. That product was originally made in an FDAapproved facility. As long as FDA approval information is not required to follow drugs sold abroad. importation by anyone other than the manufacturer will be next to impossible. There is also a great need to revisit a provision in the Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act that protects American pharmaceutical companies at the expense of the consumers. This provision makes it illegal for anyone other than the manufacturer to reimport into the U.S. prescription medicine made by an American pharmaceutical manufacturer. Mr. Speaker.

But in yesterdays Wall Street Journal. the Wall Street Journal reported that the average cost of a prescription rose almost 10 percent in 1999. Now. for those aged 70 and up. costs for prescriptions rose by 15 percent. Tell me. our senior citizens who are on fixed incomes. where are they going to get the extra 15 percent? From their heating bill? From their food? From the cost of their air conditioner? Where? And yet the drug companies are making massive profits off of the American consumer. Prilosec here for instance. $109 here. But in Mexico. it is $17.64 for the same prescription. Something is dreadfully wrong. The Canadian Government yesterday released a study showing that the Canadian consumers pay 56 percent less than Americans for patented medications. Now. our drug companies are well supported by the American taxpayer. According to a 1993 report by the Office of Technology. in addition to general research and training support. there are 13 programs specifically targeted to fund pharmaceutical research and development. That same report noted. of all U.S. industries. innovation within the pharmaceutical industry is the most dependent upon academic research and the Federal funds that support it. Translate that to the taxpayers dollars that already support it. In fact. in 1997. Merck and Pfizer devoted only 11.2 percent of their revenue to research and development. Pfizer and Merck devoted 11.2 percent to research and development. while marketing costs consumed 30 percent. And that includes all the television ads that we are seeing now. So generally across the board for the drug companies. research and development is about 20 percent. marketing about 20 to 30 percent. but manufacturing is 5 to 25 percent. That is the level that other countries draw when they negotiate these contracts with American drug manufacturers. Mr. Speaker. I highly support the bill offered by the gentleman from Minnesota.",

We have a rule that presents an obstacle course of poison pills designed to drag the bill down. Virtually all of the amendments that have been allowed by the Committee on Rules are hostile. in many cases unrelated. amendments. For example. the Coburn amendment is an antichoice amendment that would prevent doctors from making referrals for abortionrelated services for victims of rape and incest. The Cox amendment is an insult to the collective bargaining idea and would constitute the firstever Federal righttowork mandate on the States. Neither of these amendments have anything to do with the underlying bill. of course. and the Committee on Rules have waived all points of order to leave these poison bills intact. We know the game. It is to split 220 cosponsors of a very important and fine bill. And so my solution that I propose to my colleagues tonight is that since we have been gamed. I am going to oppose the previous question on the adoption of the rule and ask the Members to support me in opposition to the previous question so that I can offer an amendment that would remove the Cox amendment and also make in order the amendment submitted by the gentleman from Pennsylvania to the Committee on Rules. This would allow us to have a clean debate on the underlying legislation. free of the poison pill amendments. And my amendment is supported by NARAL. the ProChoice Caucus. the AFLCIO. and AFSCME. So a vote to defeat the previous question may well be the only chance Members have in this Congress to vote for the right of health care professionals to collectively bargain on behalf of their patients.

I think I need to spend a couple of minutes talking about why this bill should pass. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Iowa controls the health care of 98 percent of the hospitals and 90 percent of the doctors. One insurance company controls the access and health costs of 60 percent of insured Oregonians. Market competition in Texas is all but gone. Twentyfour competing companies have compressed into four megamanaged care companies. Sixty percent of the Pittsburgh market is controlled by one plan. More than 50 percent of the Philadelphia market is controlled by one plan. Each plan has maintained its dominance by virtue of an agreement not to compete in each others territory. One insurance company dictates health care in over half of Washington State. Since I came to Congress and closed my practice in 1994. there have been 275 mergers and acquisitions of health plans. There are now seven managed health care plans and Blues control the cost and access of the majority of people in this country. What does that mean? That means if one is a provider. a doctor. and that HMO controls 50 or 60 percent of their patients and they present a contract and say take it or leave it. and that doctor has a child in college. they are making mortgage payments. how do they turn them down when they have a contract clause that says medical necessity means the shortest. least expensive or least intense level of care as defined by us? Or maybe they say like this Blue Cross/Blue Shield contract of Iowa. where the health plan shifts responsibility to physicians for the health plans breaches of confidentiality that they release any liability for disclosure made by the company. Or how about the gag clauses that companies want providers to sign on to? A lot of providers just do not have a choice.

But unfortunately. the legislation that we had in the Committee on the Judiciary. I would say to the gentleman from Michigan . with all the good work that we did. is not here today. Frankly. we have the complete opposite picture from what we wanted to bring to the floor of the House. First of all. about a year ago. doctors at the AMA convention indicated they wanted to organize. they wanted to have the opportunity to be stronger and negotiate on behalf of their patients. Minority doctors in particular have been shut out from HMOs and so innercity physician many times cannot serve the patient needs of their base. Frankly. I think we have a responsibility to put this bill forward. But the Committee on Rules. the Republican Committee on Rules knew what they were doing when they added the Coburn amendment and the Cox amendment to prevent something the bill doesnt do anyhowforce a physician to join a union. That is not in the Billplain and simple. The Supreme Court just 48 hours ago just indicated to this Congress that the right to an abortion is the law of this Nation however the Coburn brings up unnecessary antichoice provisions. Why we have this legislation in this way in order to undermine the very good bill offered by the gentleman from California . of which I am a cosponsor. I do not know. Mr. Speaker. I support the ranking members proposal that we defeat the previous question and allow a redrafting of this rule to eliminate the Cox amendment and to offer the Greenwood amendment. to get on with the business that health care providers need to serve the people of Americas health needs.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the rule. It is an imperfect rule. but this bill needs to be brought to the floor. H.R. 1304 is the only bill that I have seen in the last 3 years. probably in the last 30 years. that would move us in a proper direction for health care in this country. For 30 years now we have moved in the direction. not toward socialized medicine. we do not have socialized medicine. we have a mess. We have a monster we created called \"medical management.\" But we have moved toward corporate medicine. Who are the greatest opponents of H.R. 1304? The HMOs and the insurance companies. All we are asking for here is a little bit of return of freedom to the physician. that is. for the right of the physician to freedom of contract. to associate. We are giving no special powers. no special privileges. Trying to balance just to a small degree the artificial power given to the corporations who now run medicine. who mismanage medicine. who destroyed the doctorpatient relationship. Mr. Speaker. this has given me a small bit of hope. I am thankful the leadership was willing to bring this bill to the floor tonight. We should go through. get the rule passed. and vote on this. This is the only thing that has offered any hope to preserve and to restore the doctorpatient relationship. We need this desperately. We do not need to support the special corporate interests who get the money. The patient does not get the care. The doctors are unhappy. The hospitals are unhappy. And who lobbies against this? Corporate interests. This is total destruction of the doctorpatient relationship. All we want to ask for is the freedom to associate and the freedom to contract. If they do not want to become a union. doctors do not have to. They had the power to become unions in the 19th century. but under ethical conditions they did not. Nobody tells doctors that they have to. if we remove this obstacle.",

I congratulate my colleagues on the Committee on Rules for doing the best they could with a difficult situation. But I say to you. Mr. Speaker. you can put lipstick on a pig. but it is still a pig. We have problems in our health care system. and I think all of us know it. There are ways to address these problems. such as the Patients Bill of Rights that we are working on in conference today. There are other things that we can do. But this. I would argue. will destroy our health care system. What protection are we giving our Nations patients when we take away their health insurance because of increasing costs? What other group of Americans have we ever exempted from our antitrust laws that were created over 100 years ago to stop the big steel trusts. to stop the big oil trusts? We put those antitrust laws in place to prevent consumers from being harmed. What we are doing here is we are exempting one group of Americans in our health care system. one group of Americans to go out and to negotiate on whose behalf? Come on. they will be negotiating on their own behalf. That is why the Congressional Budget Office and others have talked about the tremendous increase in cost that will result if this bill is passed. So. Mr. Speaker. let us quit kidding ourselves. This is a bad solution to a problem that does exist. There are better solutions. Let us defeat the rule. send this bill back to committee and go home and visit with our constituents over the next week.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise reluctantly in support of the rule. I regret that the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania was not placed in order. He should have the right to bring his amendment to the floor and have it fully debated. I am very much opposed to the Coburn amendment. The Coburn amendment is a transparent and deceptive attempt to politicize the debate on the underlying bill. The Coburn amendment is not just an antichoice amendment. which I believe would be defeated in this House. would be definitely defeated in the Senate. and vetoed by the President. it is unconstitutional according to the court decision yesterday. But its real role in this debate is to bring down the rule so that this body does not have a chance to debate and vote for and hopefully pass the very thoughtful Quality Health Care Coalition Act of the gentleman from California . The bill of the gentleman from California deserves to be debated on this floor. therefore. I support this resolution. The bill is a very creative attempt to empower doctors to make medical decisions for their patients. This bill has been before this Congress for 3 years. It has over 220 cosponsors. There have been hearings on it. markups. The committee voted favorably by a vote of 26 to 2. Time and time again. this leadership has brought bills before this body on which there have been no hearings. no committee. and no amendments allowed. This time. the gentleman from Oklahoma and this body have played by the rules. and we deserve a vote on his bill before this House. My colleagues do not have to support the bill. If they do not like the bill. then do not vote for it. But to be fair to our colleague. let us pass this rule and allow a vote on his bill. If we do not vote for this bill. this rule. it will not get to the floor for a vote. Patients. doctors. and the health care system are depending on it. Let us bring the Campbell bill to the floor and fully debate it fairly.",

We need to pass this rule tonight because it is the only way that we are going to get a chance to vote on this bill. Now. this is surely a controversial issue. Should doctors be able to bargain collectively on an equal footing with the insurance companies. I happen to think they should. An earlier Speaker said we have never exempted anybody else from antitrust laws. But the truth of the matter is we did. When we passed McCarranFerguson. we gave special provisions to the insurance industry that they use today. Now. we have been debating HMO reform for over 2 years. Everybody says doctors. not bureaucrats. doctors. not adjusters. but doctors ought to be making medical decisions that impact their patients. Well. tonight. here is my colleagues chance to empower doctors to be making those kind of medical decisions. But the only way we are going to do this is to pass this rule. Now. if my colleagues oppose the amendments. defeat the amendments. Let the House work its will.

I rise in strong support of the Campbell bill and. accordingly. in strong support of motion to defeat the previous question by the gentleman from Michigan . The gentleman from Michigan would allow us to avoid this outrageously rigged rule that is designed certainly to scuttle the Campbell bill. The Campbell bill is desperately needed. We have a situation where doctors are put into a very unfair situation. unable to negotiate on a level playing field with the large HMOs and managed care companies. The Campbell bill will stop the arbitrary. unfair. onesided contracts that the managed care companies are offering to doctors. I listened intently to the gentleman from Iowa a few minutes ago. He got one fact wrong. He said that the largest managed care company in Philadelphia is controlling 50 percent of the market. They are actually controlling 62 percent of the market. growing every day. That large managed care company recently offered orthopedic surgeons in the Philadelphia area a 40 percent pay cut. That kind of arbitrary activity is unacceptable. The Campbell bill will allow collective bargaining and allow doctors a level playing field. not just to improve their fee agreements. but to avoid the kinds of changes in their medical practices that managed care companies often demand. They want to impose gag rules on doctors so they cannot discuss their treatment options. They want to discourage appropriate referrals. Companies want frequently to block appropriate tests and delay care. They want to grant financial rewards to doctors for not giving care. Those things must be stopped. They can be stopped through appropriate negotiations. But first we must pass the Conyers motion to defeat the previous question. Mr. Speaker. I urge a yes vote on that motion.",

Mr. Speaker. who are cosponsors of the legislation of the gentleman from California . and a commitment was made that we would move ahead with this bill. I know that there are some people who are not ecstatic with the way that this rule has been structured. But the fact of the matter is we have done what we could to move this legislation forward. So it sounds like we are going to have a vote on the previous question that the gentleman from Michigan will be pursuing. I hope very much that we will defeat the previous question and move ahead and pass this rule. We have a responsibility to move legislation. The Speaker has said that he hopes very much that Members will vote in support of this rule so that we can move the package forward. Arguments have been made on both sides of the aisle by a number of our colleagues that if one is a supporter of this rule. do not stand behind the procedure and cast a no vote on the rule. because this is the opportunity that we have to move ahead with this legislation. So I would also say to Members on both sides regardless of ones position on the issue. even if one is not a supporter of the legislation of the gentleman from California . Let us have a debate on the measure and then allow the House to work its will.
