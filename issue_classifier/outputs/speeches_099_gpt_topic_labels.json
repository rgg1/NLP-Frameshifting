    "speech": "Mr. President. as chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle Eastern and South Asian Affairs. I would like to extend the warm greeting of the U.S. Senate to the Honorable Habib Bourguiba. President of the Republic cf Tunisia. on his upcoming visit to the United States. I hope his visit will continue a longstanding friendship between our two countries. as well as encourage further constructive economic and political ties. Mr. Bourguiba is the George Washington of Tunisia. he led the struggle for independence for over 20 years. In 1955 when he and the new Constitution Party lead their nation to independence. Mr. Bourguiba drafted the Tunisian Construction which has become the foundation of one of Africas strongest democracies. Fittingly. in 1957. Mr. Bourguiba was elected the first President of the new Republic of Tunisia. Under President Bourguibas wise and energetic leadership. Tunisia has developed a flourishing multiparty political system and a dynamic democratIc process based on parliamentary representation. President Bourguiba demonstrated an early commitment to education with the understanding that this was the foundation of a strong democracy. As a result. he set up a national school system and currently invests onethird of Tunisias budget in education. Ie was the first Arab leader to give women the right to vote. As another example of this progressive leadership. President Bourgulba. as early as 1965. called for peaceful coexistence between the Arabs and Israela bold and courageous step for a primarily Muslim nation. Truly. President Bourguiba has proved to be both a devoted leader and a staunch defender of democratic ideals. It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous pleasure to welcome on behalf of the entire U.S. Senate a leader as distinguished as Habib Bourguiba. President of the Republic of Tunisia.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this resolution recognizes the pause for the Pledge of Allegiance as part of the celebration of National Flag Day. The resolution is identical to Senate Joint Resolution 55 that was passed by the Senate in the last Congress with 28 cosponsors. The other body was unable to complete action on Senate Joint Resolution 55 before the 98th Congress adjourned. I am pleased that the House has now passed this resolution and hope that the Senate will concur. This year President Reagan will take part in National Flag Day ceremonies to be held at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. This brings national recognition to the efforts of volunteers from the National Flag Day Committee and will kick off the national celebration that takes place starting with Flag Day and ends on the Fourth of July. Since these volunteers started the campaign to make the pause for the Pledge of Allegiance part of Flag Day. the concept has caught the imagination of Americans all over the country and the world. The sponsors estimate that millions of people have learned of the idea through the media and Government. business. and service organizations. These dedicated volunteers see the saying of the 31 words of the Pledge of Allegiance as a reaffirmation of our national spirit. Their efforts. and those of Americans everywhere who have participated. deserve recognition. The Continential Congress. on June 14. 1777. adopted an official banner by spelling out broad specifications for a national flag. After many years of local flag ceremonies. Congress in 1949 officially designated June 14 as National Flag Day. Flag Day observations before and after the 1949 congressional action have traditionally centered around the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. written by James B. Upham and Francis Bellamy in 1892. Other ceremonies have included flagraising ceremonies. the singing of the National Anthem. and parades. Since 1952. the StarSpangled Banner Flag House Association in Baltimore has been the official sponsor of Flag Week. Its headquarters is the house where Mary Young Pickersgill sewed the flag that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814 and inspired Francis Scott Key to write the National Anthem. The National Flag Day Committee is now the chief sponsor of Flag Day activities. Passage of this resolution would officially recognize the pause for the Pledge of Allegiance and pay tribute to the patriotic efforts of the National Flag Day Committee.",

No one in Congress knows more about the issue of employee stock ownership plans [ESOPs] than Senator LONG. and his advocacy has enormously increased public awareness of their value to workers and companies alike. His leadership will be deeply missed when he leaves the Senate. but his vision will guide those of us who share it for years to come. I have long believed that ESOPs are an important and innovative way to improve industrial relations and strengthen business performance. I have been tremendously impressed with the experience in West Virginia of Weirton Steelthe largest employeeowned company in the country. Four years ago. this plant was slated to close down. eliminating more than 7.000 jobs and thoroughly ravaging the economy of the surrounding area. The workers and residents of Weirton were determined to prevent this catastrophe and. as Governor. I was privileged to work with them. The key to saving the mill was the establishment of an ESOP. which enabled the workers to buy the plant. Now. instead of an idle facility. Weirton boasts one of the only profitable steel companies in the country. Recently. the company was able to distribute $20 millionabout one third of its 1985 profitsto the more than 8.000 workers covered by its ESOP. In an industry suffering from massive cutbacks in production and steady losses of employment. Weirtons success is truly stunning.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I strongly support the employee stock ownership concept for Americans and as it relates to American foreign policy. Last fall I spoke at length in this Chamber on the virtues of ESOPs and the importance of American export of the ESOP concept. Thanks to the Presidential Task Force on Project Economic Justice we are establishing a comprehensive strategy and policy framework for encouraging the use of the employee stock ownership plan and other expanded ownership vehicles within Central America and the Carribean Basin. This effort involves a growing awareness that both peace and freedom result from justice. and that a just free enterprise system is the only truly effective answer to the false promise of Marxism. In order to deal with the causes. and not just the symptoms. of economic justice. we must connect workers to property and power. we must promote a free enterprise version of economic justice. And. in particular. we must encourage selfhelp and worker ownership for the people of Central America and the Carribean. A principal aim of expanding capital ownership in the region is to develop a broadened political constituency among workers in support of private enterprise as the best means to accelerate economic development and political selfdetermination. A new constituency must be created for free enterprise and against collective and state ownership of industry and agriculture. Popular political support for free. private enterprise is essential not only to secure political stability and democratic processes. but to increase economic productivity and local capital formation. The ESOP concept is an effective tool that the United States can export in support of the free enterprise version of economic justice. Finally. it is a privilege to note again that the primary champion of employee stock ownership in Congress is my venerable colleague. Senator RUSSELL LONG. To Senator LONG belongs much of the credit for the promise and popularity of the ESOP concept. His constant and creative leadership will be a continuing inspiration.*",

The conflict is between the apparent inequity that he described between someone who rents and someone who owns a home. and the desire to keep the home almost inviolate in thinking through this tax reform bill. this debate we had on the floor a couple days ago when there was an attempt to modify the provision on the refinancing of a home so that you could only use the proceeds for any refinancing for a homerelated addition. improvements. or for medical or education. The problem that you run into there is the problem of the family who is lower middle income. who has no stocks. no bonds. no financial assets and whose only equity is in a home. It was felt by the committee and I think by the Senate during the debate that that family ought to have the right if it chooses in a moment of emergency to refinance. use the proceeds in any way that they choose. and continue to get the tax deduction for the interest. For example. one of the hypothetical circumstances was a mother and a father who have a son or a daughter who is trying to buy their first home and who cannot make the down payment. The family then refinances. ups their mortgage from maybe $60.000 to $70.000. gives $10.000 to their son or daughter. It was felt that to come into that familys personal affairs as it relates to their home and ability to refinance and say. \"No. you cant do that. we in the Federal Government limit it only to specific kinds of uses of that additional cash from the refinancing\" was not really a proper way to go. In fact. one Senator characterized the home as \"the home is your castle\" and this is a kind of imposition and violation of my right to do whatever I want with my home.",

And in the battle between those two conflicting objectives. the result was that you deny consumer interest deductions but you do not deny the right of a family to refinance for whatever circumstances they choose. whether it be to finance the downpayment on a childs home or problems with their parents in need for cash or small business crisis or whatever.

In order to have the deductibility of consumer interest it would cost $28 billion over the 5year period. What is the result of that? The result of that would be rates would have to be increased. and so we made a decision. The decision was we would not allow the deductibility of consumer interest. Was it totally fair?

In other words. there has been a 70percent reduction since 1981 in EDA funds. I think we recognize that there is a problem of adequate funding for a lot of things that have been very worthwhile. EDA is a program that provides seed money In communities that want to develop industrial parks. to provide perhaps a highway or water or a sewer to reach out to Industrial park development areas. I do not question but what there have been some real gliches over a period of time. but just because the Ford Motor Co. spent $250 million on the Edsel and it was a failure did not mean that the Ford Motor Co. abandoned new product development. Just because in the Defense Department we have had some rather grievous programs that have not been very productive does not mean that we abandon the Defense Department. I think the key to this is to make EDA work effectively and that is an administrative responsibility. But as a policy matter. the development of Jobs. the development of the ability to ccmpete in the world marketplace. I think requires a helping hand in some instances from the Federal Government. It is a matter of national policy. So I say to the Members that are deciding whether or not to vote to delete the funding for EDA. you have to determine whether it has been effective in your districts in promoting industrial development and jobs. whether you think that this is a responsibility of the Federal Government to provide the necessary seed money in the future.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last summer I introduced S. 1223 to build a Korean War Memorial to those who so courageously served more than three decades ago in Korea. Since that time. I have received literally dozens of letters and phone calls from Korean veterans and their families expressing appreciation for introducing this legislation. The comments have been both heartwarming and heartbreaking. but all have shown that those men and women who served deserve the fullest honor and recognition their country can bestow upon them. Recently. I received a copy of an article by Norman R. Zehr which appeared In the Mines magazine. a publication of the Colorado School of Mines Alumni Association. To quote a brief portion. Mr. Zehr states: Frankly I think that all of those men and women who did not come back from Korea as I did. alive and well. deserve such a memorial. But for me. the only memorial I need. if any is deserved at all. Is to see Korea today as a thriving economy with a reasonable amount of freedom for its people. I agree with Mr. Zehr. Today. Koreans can look at the future with hope and the assurance that they have control over their own lives. This would not be the case if Americans had not been willing to join them and to make sacrificesand some 54.000 made the ultimate sacrificeso that Koreans could be free today. A memorial to those who served and those who died in Korea will continue to show the world that America stands for freedom. and we will fight to preserve It. I ask that Mr. Zehrs remarks be printed in the RECORD. and I urge my colleagues to read them carefully. The remarks follow:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. one trade problem that has captured the attention of Congress and the public is import fraud. While the entry of counterfeit goods is a serious problem. importers are particularly creative in those sectors subject to import restraint programs. like textiles and steel. Recently this problem has grown in magnitude and has begun to attract media attention. Both the Wall Street Journal and Jack Anderson recently devoted space to it. What is clear from 71059 0G725 (Pt. 2) both these articlesbeyond the seriousness of the issueis the inadequacy of Customs Service resources to combat it. I have spoken with Commissioner von Raab about import fraud on a number of occasions. and I applaud his efforts to focus the Services resources on it. Unfortunately. there are not enough resources. Congress has attempted each year to provide more funds and personnel. partly because of the realization that aggressive enforcement will produce a net revenue gain. I hope that any cuts in the Customs Services budget mandated by GrammRudman will not cripple its enforcement effort and end up costing us revenue. Beyond the revenue aspect. Mr. President. there are significant trade policy concerns. Steel and textiles are severely importimpacted sectors in our economy. Adjustment is taking placeand will continue to occur. but it should occur in the context of the free market system. not in the context of dumping and subsidies or foreign barriers to our products. To ignore these distortions of the free market is to allow others to export their unemployment to our shores. to pass on to our workers the consequences of their failure to make hard but necessary decisions about their own economies. That does us no good. and it does them no good. Finally. this is an integrity issue. Put very simply. we have rules. and they ought to be followed. While we may question the wisdom of the policies that put those rules in place. not to enforce them vigorously is to jeopardize the entire network of our customs laws and the integrity of our international economic policy. We have the alternative of changing the laws through regular democratic processes. not through condoning their selective violation. Mr. President. I ask that the recent Wall Street Journal article on this subject be printed in the RECORD.",

Senator HATCH. to set aside the week of May 11. 1986. as \"National Science Week.\" I was pleased to have supported a successful effort last year for this purpose. and my hope is that Congress again will call the attention of our Nation to the importance of science for all of America. in the past. in the present. and in the future. What we have gained from science throughout history is immeasurable. Scientific contributions can be traced farther back than 400 B.C.. when Hippocrates taught that diseases have natural. rather than supernatural. causes. Since that time. we have seen the likes of Aristotle. Copernicus. Galileo. Newton. and Einstein. The genlous of these and other scientific pioneers enabled us. in 1969. to put Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon. Despite great scientific advances in the past. however. todays knowledge will seem elementary to us in the year 2000. just as Hippocrates teachings seem limited to us today. It is necessary. therefore. that we support \"National Science Week\" as an inspiration to look to the future to technologies that make this country strong and prosperous. And when we look to the future. we must bear in mind the pioneers of tomorrowour children. We must equip our children with scientific information to enhance their understanding of the complexities with which we live. We need programs that stimulate student interest in science and mathematics. which is vital for continued U.S. technological strength and development. Last year. \"National Science Week\" was a great success. More than 1.000 local. State. and national groups participated in a variety of science and math activities and workshops. The National Science Foundation joined with four U.S. corporations in promoting this celebration: Dupont. IBM. Eastman Kodak. and General Electric. I am pleased that NSP again this year will help coordinate grassroots involvement and support. \"National Science Week\" is a good way for Congress to help Americas youth understand the everchanging high tech world in which we live.

Thus. it gives me great pleasure to announce today that two Rhode Island filmmakersand the Rhode Island Committee for the Humanitieshave been accorded this honor. The Motion Picture Academy has nominated Mr. Michael Crowley of Cranston and Mr. James Wolpaw of Providence for their documentary \"Keats and His Nightingale: A Blind Date.\" The film was sponsored by the Rhode Island Council of Teachers of English. and was funded through a Federal grant to the Rhode Island Committee for the Humanities [RICH]. \"Blind Date\" looks at Keats poemand at poetry itselfthrough the eyes of ordinary denizens of the modern world: A hockey fan. for instance. or a hospital employee. The work will be one of five films vying for the title of best documentary short subject on the evening of March 24. This is not the first time that \"Blind Date\" has been honored with a major international award. In early December. it won a Golden Eagle Certificatethe highest award given by the Council on International NonTheatrical Events [CINE]. Recipient films are considered to be among the very best American cinematography. and represent the United States in major film festivals throughout the world. In a rare \"first\" for the Academy. RICH. which produced the film. was also nominated for an award. making it the first time a State humanities council has ever received this distinction. The nomination adds another item to RICHs long list of accolades. which include two special merit awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Only four State councils have been so recognized on two separate occasions. In the words of the Endowment. \"RICH does everything and does it well.\" Mr. President. this spate of honors attests to the exceptional quality of the work being done by the Rhode Island Committee for the Humanities. and by the talented artists it supports. I Join with all Rhode Islanders in offering congratulations to Mr. Wolpaw. Mr. Crowley. and to RICH for these welldeserved laurelsand gratitude for keeping the arts in our lives.*",

My family and I join the more than 54 million other Americans who fish each year. Its both relaxing and envigorating. especially when the day is bountiful. Sport fishing is a family activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. from young children to senior citizens. The Nations fishing community also consists of a cadre of professionals that harvest the oceans bounties for public consumption. The demand for fishing goods and services generates employment for roughly 600.000 individuals. and the fishing industry directly employs an additional 300.000. supplying seafood worth an estimated $2.4 billion in direct sales. On the whole. sport fishermen and women generate annually over $25 billion in economic activity. Americas fishing industry has celebrated this special week for 8 years. This sport enhances respect for the environment. as a source of exercise. it improves the quality of life. and it provides a ready source of healthy. proteinrich food for public consumption. It is fitting and proper. therefore. that the President formally recognize the importance of fishing to the citizenry of the United States by proclaiming June 2 through 8. 1986. as \"National Fishing Week.\"",

John Kennedy once described the most powerful force in the world as \"mans enternal desire to be free.\" Nowhere is that more apparent than in the Baltic Republic of Lithuania. where brave men and women continue a 46year struggle for freedom from Communist domination. Lithuania declared its independence on February 16. 1918. after nearly a century of occupation by Czarist Russia. Its freedom came to a tragic end 22 years later. when more than 300.000 Soviet troops marched in under the protection of the NaziSoviet alliance. A puppet government was installed and more than 30.000 Lithuanian patriots were deported to Siberian labor camps. Since that time. the Lithuanian people have watched as the Soviet Union has stripped them of their human rights and attempted to erase their cultural and religious heritage. In Lithuania itself. any public celebration of national independence is considered a criminal offense. But defenders of liberty around the world still observe Lithuanian Independence Day and look forward to a future when Lithuanians can once again celebrate openly in their native land. Mr. President. Lithuanian independence lives on in the hearts of the brave Lithuanian people and in free nations everywhere that sympathize with their fate.

Senate Joint Resolution 272 designates March 21. 1986. as Afghanistan Day. March 21 is the traditional New Years Day celebration in Afghanistan. For the past 6 years. unfortunately. each March 21 has been only a bleak reminder that Soviet armies continue to inflict brutal atrocities on this small nation of only 15 million people. While the world sits idly by. millions of Afghans continue to be brutalized and terrorized. For 5 years. the United States. the worlds freest nation felt it could not publicly support Afghan efforts to fight the Soviet Armed Forces. Since last year. however. the United States has improved significantly its policy on Afghanistan. For the first time since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. the United States will provide overt humanitarian aid to the Afghan freedom fighters. the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen have precluded the mighty Soviet armies from controlling the countryside of this strategically located nation. The fierce resolve of these freedom fighters has survived every major Soviet offensive for 6 years. Moscow has committed 120.000 troops and has sustained thousands of casualties each year to keep its control of Kabul and a handful of other major cities. The Soviet Union is no closer to conquering Afghanistan today than it was in December of 1979. Although the Soviet armies have not defeated the Afghan resistance. the Afghan peoplethe innocent civiliansare clearly the losers. Over onequarter of the prewar population has fled to Pakistan or Iran. Another million have died as a result of the war. Afghanistans infrastructure is destroyed and. as a direct result of Moscows scorched earth policy. Afghanistan can no longer feed itself. This resolution is an important reminder to the Mujahideen and to the Afghan people that the United States is fully behind their courageous struggle. With our support and with the support of other democracies. it is my hope that the Soviet Union will recognize the futile nature of its partial occupation of Afghanistan and will withdraw from this wartorn nation.

The council is the State professional organization for 8.000 social studies and social science teachers in Michigan. It is very fitting that we pause this week to appreciate the importance of our social studies and social science teachers and their role in introducing students to the peoples. cultures. and ideas of the world. This is a fundamental part of education. one which helps us participate in what has truly become a worldwide society. Modern communications and highspeed travel bring people from different parts of the globe together for many purposes. including trade. exchanges of information and for negotiating understanding where countries have differences of opinion or procedures. Understanding the concerns and interests of people from other nations is vital to these and many other activities. The social studies also help to improve our quality of life here at home. Learning about how other people live and think is essential for encouraging harmony and understanding among the diverse groups of people that make up our communities. our State. and our country. Of particular importance is the role of social studies teachers in educating current and future citizens of this country about their government and the governments of other nations. Participation in our Government through voting and other expressions of opinion is both a right and a responsibility. one that is best exercised with knowledge about the history of this Nation and its Government. Teachers can instill an interest in this process and encourage students to learn about and participate in their Government. Our Nation is faced with challenges that will require careful thought and effort from people with many backgrounds and different types of training. The more we understand about each other. the better we will all be able to work together to meet these challenges to improve the world for those that will follow us. All teachers. and especially those who teach social studies and social science. play a very fundamental part in this educational process.*",

But I voted for its final passage with grave concerns over some provisions adopted on the floor. As reported by 12 different House committees last month. the original version of this bill was a tough. well thoughtout attack on drugs. It was crafted with Democrats and Republicans working together to achieve these common goals: stop the flow of drugs into this country. educate our young to the dangers of drug abuse. impose tough mandatory sentences on drug dealers. and assist local law enforcement officials in their frontline battle against drugs. Those were the goals. and they were admirably met in the original version of this bill. It is unfortunate. however. that in the rush to pass this legislation Members in several instances lost sight of these basic goals. In the rush to appear \"tough\" on drugs. this body approved several amendments of questionable constitutionality. amendments which run roughshod over certain civil liberties. and adopted an amendment which would divert the Armed Forces from their mission of defense to that of policemen. These amendments were very serious proposals. not to be taken lightly. or passed with only 10 minutes of debate. I opposed many of them and hope they will be deleted from the bill by the Senate or in the House/Senate Conference Committee.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I introduce legislation aimed at preventing an existing problem with Congress from becoming much worse. That problem is the growing tendency to circumvent budgetary controls on new Federal domestic spending by enacting national policy mandates and then requiring State and local governments to pick up the tab. This tendency is not associated with any one political party or any particular ideological persuasion. Conservatives sometimes support imposing mandates on States and localities as a roundabout way to return domestic responsibilities from Washington. Liberals on occasion see unfunded mandates as the only available avenue for pursuing desirable social objectives. Both in Congress and within the administration. such efforts are often rationalized by comparison of the Federal budget deficit to the relatively sound fiscal condition of States and localities. Of course. virtually all State and local governments are required by constitution or statute to approve and maintain balanced budgets. and it hardly seems fair to penalize them for succeeding where we have so far failed. The legislation I introduce today would not flatly prohibit the imposition of new costs on State and local governments. but it would ensure that such actions are not taken without due analysis and debate of the consequences. How many Members were aware that our fiscal year 1986 budget reconciliation bill imposed massive new costs on our constituents back home through mandatory extension of Medicare coverage to new State and local employees? This initiative and many others of the same nature may well be sound Federal policy. My point is that it is fiscally irresponsible to impose such new costs without careful analysis. and a guaranteed opportunity to assess and debate the impact on our constituents as State and local taxpayers.

The store developed an educational program entitled. \"Safety Starts With Me\" designed to help young children distinguish the potential dangers associated with child abduction. \"Safety Starts With Me\" is a 40minute presentation attended by children grades K4 during school assemblies. Hosted by a local magician in the role of the \"Mayor of MainStreet.\" the show addresses the issues of strangers and how to avoid abduction. Through magic. games and role playing the emcee creates an atmosphere of fun used to instill confidence rather than fear while teaching children to deal with dangerous situations effectively. Through a series of entertaining skits the program focuses on three specific situations in which children may encounter strangers. These include car strangers. telephone strangers. and doorbell strangers. The end of the show serves to reinforce the three magic words which can be applied in all dangerous or fearful situations. The phrase \"Say No. Run. Tell Someone.\" is repeated in order to reemphasize its importance for the childrens safety. In light of the increasing awareness surrounding the tragedy of child abduction.

In 1938. the devoted congregation initiated construction of the St. George Orthodox Church at its initial location in the north end of Flint. For the next 30 years St. George served as the center of orthodox worship for Flints Arab American community. Its current building. a recipient of the Society of American Architects gold medal. was erected in 1971 to meet the needs of a parish which had grown from 25 to over 150 families. Through its 50 years in existence. the St. George Orthodox Church has faithfully served its parishioners and the community in a very unselfish and admirable manner. preserving both its rich Arab culture and orthodox tradition of worship. Mr. Speaker. the St. George Orthodox Church continues to represent a warm and friendly home for community ethnic activities and as a cathedral of worship where the spiritual needs of parishioners are fulfilled in the traditional orthodox Christian faith. Under the spiritual leadership of its current rector. Rev. Father Basil Kalekas. St. George continues its fine record of providing Christian leadership and a base for ethnic tradition within the community. It is indeed a great honor for me to pay tribute to the esteemed church on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.",

William Rehnquist is superbly qualified for this most important position by virtue of his character. his temperament. his intelligence and competence. and his sound legal judgment. As we are all acutely aware. the decision to confirm a Chief Justice is one to be taken with the greatest care and with reference to as much information and knowledge about the nominee as possible. In the case of Justice Rehnquist. this task has been relatively simple. The President. the Senate. and the American people have at hand 15 years of judicial opinions by Justice Rehnquist and a large amount of additional evidence relating to his years of public service and private law practice before he joined the Court. Whether or not one agrees with his legal judgments throughout the years. it is difficult to disagree with the unanimous opinion of the American Bar Association committee that his legal analysis and writing ability are of the \"highest quality\" and that he meets. in general. \"the highest standards of professional competence. judicial temperament. and integrity.\" In short. I believe that President Reagan made a truly outstanding selection. Still. as one would expect on a question of this magnitude. there is opposition to the nomination. The opposition. as I see it. rests on allegations that attack both Justice Rehnquists integrity and his fitness to render decisions in civil rights cases. Justice Rehnquists integrity is called into question on two counts. The first relates to his work for the Republican Party during the 1960s in Phoenix. The second challenges his decision not to recuse himself in 1972 from participating in the case of Laird versus Tatum. Let me comment briefly on each of these.",

Confirmation of this nomination will provide the American judicial system the benefit of Mr. Scalias intellectual prowess and legal expertise. By way of background. Judge Scalias education included an intense curriculum in the classics. Those familiar with the judges work up to this point have attributed this historical and philosopical background as being instrumental in his perspective viewpoints and decisions. It is also apparent. Mr. President. that this nominees fine judicial and legal performance is a simple and accurate reflection of his intelligence and determined conviction. Mr. Scalia graduated as valedictorian from both Xavier High School and Georgetown University. and went on to earn magna cum laude honors from Harvard Law School. Such a record of high scholastic achievement is indicative of dedication and aptitudetwo necessary traits for a Supreme Court Justice. Subsequent to his schooling. Mr. Scalia spent a number of successful years in the private sector. including teaching positions at both the Universities of Chicago and Virginia. The judge began his public service career in 1971. with an appointment by the Nixon administration to the position of general counsel in the Office of Telecommunications Policy. The distinguished Mr. Scalia also served as Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States. among other noteworthy positions. before his 1982 swearing in as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsa court considered by many as second only in importance to the Supreme Court. Moreover. Mr. President. Judge Scalias judicial record reflects his conviction that the role of the courts is limiteda role of restraint. Judge Scalia adheres to a commonsense interpretation of the Constitution. understanding that it protects certain basic rightsno more. no less. This is a philosophy with which I concur. In closing Mr. President. let me simply state that I support Antonin Scalias nomination. confident in the knowledge that he will bring to this position the same energy. proficiency. and knowledge that he has demonstrated over the last 20 years.

But I fear that the package that is about to be laid before us is defective in one critical aspectnamely. its failure to reduce the deficit sufficiently to avoid acrosstheboard spending cuts that will otherwise be required under the GrammRudmanHollings Act. I have fought as tenaciously and consistently as any member of the Senate to eliminate the Federal budget deficit. But I do not want to see acrosstheboard spending reductions implemented. They do not reflect this bodys considered will. and they are not. I believe. generally favored among our constituents in general. It is our task to ensure that these acrosstheboard spending cuts are avoided. by enacting budget measures sufficient to reach the deficit goal without triggering these reductions. Unfortunately. the bill that stands before us today will not meet this requirement. As it stands. it clearly does not yield enough deficit reduction to permit us to avoid the acrosstheboard spending reduction of GrammRudmanHollings.

As my colleagues are aware. the Senate/administration deficit reduction plan as released in midApril proposed cuts in the Rural Electrification Administration [REA] Program which were based on two very shocking assumptions. First. it was assumed that direct loans. guaranteed loans. and rural telephone loans would be phased out over 8 years. Second. it was assumed that direct loan interest rates would be increased at a rate equal to the Treasurys cost of borrowing plus 11/a percent. In essence. it was assumed that the REA Program would be phased out and eliminatedthat the lights would be turned out in rural America. I informed my colleagues. Budget Director Stockman. and Agriculture Secretary Block early on that these assumptions were totally unacceptable to me and that I would actively oppose and vote against any proposal which proposed to phase out REA. Since that time. I have been meeting almost daily with Senator DOLE. Senator DOMENICI. and Budget Director Stockman to try to develop an acceptable compromise. Additionally. I have met with Mr. Bob Bergland. executive vice president of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association [NRECA] and other NRECA staff in order to develop a package which is fair to rural electrification and rural America. The package we have before us today is fair to rural electrification. It addresses the concerns I raised. those raised by the over 80.000 rural electric cocperative members in my home State of South Dakota. and the 25 million customers of rural electric cooperatives nationwide. The REA provisions in the Dole substitute are acceptable to NRECA. Specifically. these provisions call for a rescission of $550 million of loan authority in fiscal year 1985. a $550 million reduction in loan levels from the baseline in fiscal year 1986. a $600 million reduction in loan levels from the baseline in fiscal year 1987. and $650 million reduction in loan levels from the baseline in fiscal year 1988. Additionally. I would like to gain the assurance of the talented Budget Committee chairman. Senator DOMENICI. on a few points. Am I correct to state that the budget savings reflected in the Dole amendment are arrived at by assuming a reduction in loan levels. not by proposing a phase out of direct. guaranteed. and rural telephone lending?",

Currently. price support program levels are set by Congress in farm legislation. and the programs are carried out with the use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds. The borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation is replenished. as needed. by subsequent appropriations that restore net realized losses on support operations and related programs. Commodity price support loan programs are a marketing tool for producers and serve to protect farmers against unreasonably low commodity prices. During times of severe shortages and subject to statutory resale provisions. the Commodity Credit Corporation releases commodities it has acquired. which keeps consumer prices from increasing sharply. Under section 5 of the budget resolution as reported. it would not have been in order. during fiscal years 1986 and 1987. for either House of Congress to consider any bill. resolution. or amendment authorizing new direct loan obligations or new loan guarantee commitments unless the legislation also provided that that authority to make or guarantee loans would have been effective only to the extent. and in such amounts. as were contained in appropriation acts. This provision would. if implemented. seriously impair the essential operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation since it is impossible to anticipate the demands that will be placed on CCC.",

In 1982. in fact I offered an amendment on the initiative of Senators HELMS and HUDDLESTON to exempt CCC from this provision. I therefore can assure my distinguished friend that the substitute resolution we are offering here today modifies section 5 as originally reported out of the committee in exactly the same fashion as Congress has done in past years. Specifically. the amendment provides that the provisions of section 5 shall not be applicable to agricultural price support and related programs of the type in operation on January 1. 1985. that are funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. It is clear that this special treatment is justified because of the uniqueness of the Commodity Credit Corporation programs. However. this modification does not mean that CCC can spend unlimited amounts. Any increase in the borrowing authority of CCC is already subject to the appropriation process and. under this amendment. Congress will continue to control the expenditures of CCC.

While I think it is probable the amendment is going to be defeated. my gesture will be to vote for the amendment. I agree completely with Senator STAFFORD that the fundamental problem is pay and we have to face up to it. It is very interesting. if you look at Japan. two things stand out: One is engineers and teachers receive almost the same pay. You look at what engineers and teachers receive in this country. and it is dramatically different. The second thing that stands out in Japanand I say this with great regret and I say it with all due respect to a lot of very fine teachersin Japan. the average person going into teaching scores above average on testing. those in college. In the United States. those going into teaching today score appreciably below average. And that second point is one of the reasons. frankly. I am going to vote for the amendment of my colleague from New Mexico. If this gets into conference. if it should be adopted. I think we would pare down the amount. But one of the points that this bill makes Is that it gives an incentive to States to have precertification requirements for teachers. It is one of the areas we have to move ahead on. We have to say for teachers. just as we say for doctors and lawyers and engineers. \"Before you can be considered for training for a teacher. you have to meet certain standards..\" I think it is a move in the right direction. And though I have great respect for my colleague from Vermont and I understand the reason he takes the position that he does.

They do their jobs in conditions which are often deplorable. with resources which are often inadequate and for salaries which are too often below par.

Given the current projectionswhich suggest that we may have a teacher shortage of over a million people by the 1990swe certainly need to do something to encourage people to enter the profession. This fellowship program will not solve the problem of teacher shortages. it may not statistically improve the quality of education in the United States. but it will make a statement about the seriousness with which the Senate sees those problems. It will make a statement about our commitment to deal with them. Mr. President. I know there are financial constraints on our ability to do what we want to do to improve the educational system in the United States.

I would be happy. through this colloquy. to strengthen the awareness of the Senators concern by stating that it would be my intention within that constraint that reason and responsibility be applied. based on how large the benefit payment is to an individual in judging between zero and 25 percent as an amount.",

It has passed virtually unscathed in the form that it left the committee and. as I have stated here on the floor many times. I think it is a very excellent solution to a very difficult problem. It is largely a Western problem. but it is a Western problem involving billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of electric consumers. I think we resolved that in a way consistent with the national interest or. to be more precise. the public interest and those very words \"public interest\" are used as the principal measure of determining who gets the power from a hydroelectric dam when the license expires. I think the key. the centerpiece of this legislation. is a very carefully drawn. fair. workable matrix of rules that settle who gets the power or gives a test by which you can measure who should get the power on the expiration of one of these hydroelectric licenses. I also thank and commend the committee staff members who have worked so long and hard on this billGary Elisworth. Russ Brown.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was prepared to offer amendments to S. 426 to require FERC licensees to conform to State water law. My amendments would have provided that prospective water power projects must obtain water rights under State law before obtaining a FERC license. that FERC cannot authorize exercise of eminent domain powers to obtain water rights. and that FERC license terms cannot be inconsistent with terms of the State water use authorization. I believe that section 27 of the original Federal Power Act articulated Congress intent not to preempt State water law. Instead. under the Supreme Courts current interpretation of the law. FERC is only required to consider State resource plans and the recommendations of appropriate State agencies when evaluating license applications. With the recent proliferation of applications for FERC licenses. there is growing concern about how new water projects could affect State resource plans and existing water rights. My amendments would require FERC licensees to obtain water rights under State laws and State procedures. and would prevent situations where FERC licensees might deprive a rancher or other water user. either upstream or downstream. of his established water rights. For example. under current law FERC could grant a license to site a project on a river which has been fully adjudicated among current users. The FERC license would upset the State adjudication. and the licensee could force a rancher or other water user to sell his water right. In addition. it is unclear how interstate compacts and compacts with Indian tribes could be affected by FERC licensing decisions. based on Supreme Court interpretations of current law. it appears that a FERC licensing decision could affect such compact agreements. These possibilities are critically important to many States. tribes. and individual water users. they raise serious questions about States rights and the appropriate role of FERC. and I think they warrant immediate investigations. I am aware. Mr. President. of the controversial nature of these amendments. This is a complicated area of law. I have discussed my proposals with the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee. and he has agreed to hold a hearing on this matter during this Congress so that the committee can consider the proper role of State water law in FERC licensing procedures.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Electric Consumers Protection Act presents problems for municipal and rural electric cooperative consumers in Pennsylvania. I support S. 426. but I do so with some wariness about the future effect of its passage. I am concerned that the alteration of the relicensing preference may provide the impetus for the elimination of all preferencing. especially as it. applies to the marketing of hydroelectric power under various statutes. This would not be in the best interests of Pennsylvanias electric consumers. Since 1966. for instance. Pennsylvanias rural electric cooperatives have benefited from lowcost hydroelectic power generated by the Power Authority of New York under the Federal license granted to it in the Niagara Redevelopment Act. drafted among others by Pennsylvania Senator Joe Clark. That license provides that a percentage of the power generated at the project must be sold to outofState preference customers. Since 1966. this lowcost power has saved rural electric cooperative members $175 million over what they would otherwise have had to pay for power. This arrangement serves as a fine example of the preference clause in action. granting the public customer the first right of refusal. I also have reservations about the anticompetitive aspects of this legislation. In a circumstance similar to this one. under the Atomic Energy Act. municipalities have a right to bring their antitrust concerns to the attention of the Federal Government. For this reason. I am today cosponsoring Senator METZENBAUMS amendment. which will provide for a review of the anticompetitive effects of an investorowned utilitys assumption of a hydroelectric license. The impact of this legislation on the preference clause and the competitiveness of hydroelectric relicensing are two issues which will continue to command my attention. I am hopeful that my colleagues will share my concern. and I look forward to working with them to ensure that the interests of electric consumers continue to be protected.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. S. 426. the Electric Consumers Protection Act. clarifies Federal regulation of hydroelectric development. It also strengthens protection of fish and wildlife resources which can be adversely affected by hydroelectric development. I believe that these are valid reasons for passing this bill. Last Friday. however. the Senate passed an amendment. with virtually no debate. which undermined one of the important improvements in the bill. Section 10 of the committee bill established a new requirement that power production facilities at new hydroelectric dams meet terms and conditions established by fish and wildlife agencies if they are to receive financial benefits under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. Section 10. then. would eliminate Federal incentives which have been resulting in an adverse impact on our Nations rivers and the important fish and wildlife resources which utilize these rivers for habitat. The Senate voted last Friday. however. to exempt projects from the requirement to comply with fish and wildlife agency conditions to protect fish and wildlife when an application for a hydroelectric facility had been filed prior to April 11. 1986. This amendment. which grandfathered numerous projects from the new section 10 requirement. significantly weakens the environmental protections contained in the bill. I understand that both Senators EVANS and HATFIELD have received assurances from Senator MCCLURE. chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. that he will work to narrow the scope of the grandfather provision during the conference committee deliberations on this bill.

The amendment makes clear that a wheeling application may be filed prior to termination or modification of an existing rate schedule at. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERCI and that wheeling under this section becomes effective at the time of the termination or modification of the rate schedule. The amendment permits FERC to issue a wheeling order which would become effective at the time of the modification or termination of a rate schedule.

Mr. Speaker. at this time I think it is relevant for me to bring attention to the Members of the House of a letter to the editor of the New York Times from our friend and colleague. the gentleman from Texas . which was published today expressing his outrage over the summary disallowance and disenfranchisement of some 5.000 voters in Indiana in the McCloskeyMcIntyre election. Mr. LELAND is supporting the American way by taking the position that all votes should be counted. That is the position of this House. It should be continued. Mr. Speaker. I submit the letter from the gentleman from Texas as follows: [From the New York Times. Mar. 21. 1985]",

The figures would have to be presented in a format consistent with the budget data for other Government agencies. and projections would have to be made in each budget for the two subsequent fiscal years as well. My bill is based on the findings of a study on \"The Budgetary Status of the Federal Reserve System.\" which was prepared for the Joint Economic Committee by the Congressional Budget Office.

This Tuesday. one of my freshman colleagues said he voted to seat Mr. McIntyre because of two principlesone man one vote and \"that the people of Indiana should choose their Representative.\" Mr. Speaker. these principles are not only fine ideals which we should follow in any election. but these principles are the law as required by the U.S. Constitution. For many years. people who resided in my congressional district in south Texas were denied this voting right by such obstacles as a poll tax and literacy tests. All of us know too well the history of disenfranchisement that led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We also know that following the November 6 contest in Indiana. election officials in different jurisdictions used different standards for determining which ballots were valid. Mr. Speaker. the disenfranchisement of Indiana voters should not be taken lightly. Therefore. it is easy for me to support the Panetta task force guidelines as the fairest possible solution. At the same time. neither Mr. McCloskey nor Mr. McIntyre should be conditionally seated. The principles of one man one vote requires as much. the Constitution of the United States requires no less.

I wish to respond to the remarks of the gentleman from California earlier. by stating that the gentlemans remarks I am sure are sincere in every way and I do not question the gentlemans sincerity nor his integrity nor his feeling on this matter. The gentleman ignores three essential facts: First. there has not yet been a credible counting of the Indiana ballots. second. the certificate of election was issued in a manner inconsistent with Indiana law. and third. the actions of the House on this matter follow precedents dating back to 1860. First. there has not yet been a full counting of the ballots under a single set of rules. The 418vote \"victory\" claimed by the Republicans is based on a recount procedure that threw out 5.000 voteseven though the intentions of thcse voters were clear. The problem wis that separate recount boards in the 15 counties of the Eighth District used their own individual standards to judge the validity of the ballots. Recently the Indiana House voted90 to 8to repeal the antiquated election laws. which allowed this to happen in the first place. Second. the admitted failure of the Indiana secretary of state to follow State law in issuing the certificate of election resulted in the wrong candidate being certified. Instead of certifying the winner of the certified vote count on election nightFrank McCloskeythe Republican secretary of state waited for more than a month for a recount. When he finally did issue the certificate. it went to the Republican Richard McIntyre. based on partial recount totals. which gave McIntyre a momentary lead of 34 votes. Finally. there is not a Member of Congress who is not concerned when 500.000 citizens go unrepresented here. However. a majority of us firmly believes that the precedents of the Housewhich date back to 1860. and which we are following in this caseare far more responsible than seating a man who may not have been elected. If House Democrats had wanted to be partisan. we would have seated McCloskey on January 3. Even though we had the votes. we did not do it. Instead. we are trying to do what is rightand for our side that means seating the man who was elected by a majority of the voters.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I will try to respond as quickly as possible to the gentlemans points. One. a credible counting is based upon the gentlemans vision of how the counts ought to take place. Of course the majority individual does not like a count which showed on election night that Rick McIntyre won it. and on a recount he won. So apparently a credible count depends upon who wins. I think if the State of Indiana. under its election law. certified that it was an appropriate count. that the gentlemans problem is with the State of Indiana. and I think he has evidenced that by the systematic trashing of the character of the secretary of state of Indiana. assuming that he does not know the law. I would tell the gentleman that he is flat out wrong in terms of Indiana law and how it operates in terms of what he is supposed to do. In addition. when you talk about precedent. there is no precedent to do what we have done. and I would direct my statement now to the gentleman from Texas. and I appreciate his concerns about the question of voting rights and people able to vote. But let me ask you this: Dont you think that if there was no Federal contested elections dispute and that if the problem stated by the majority leader on the floor was that there was a difficulty in Gibson County as to whether it was a partial recount or whether it was a canvassing for an arithmetical error. that the first thing that this body should have done was to examine the Gibson County case. If in fact we could not clarify it at that. level. we would then move to an examination of Indiana law. And if the gentleman had said that there was an inconsistent application of Indiana law then what we ought to have done is to have applied Indiana law uniformly. The House task force could have examined Indiana law. taken it and ap plied it uniformly. and only then throw out Indiana law.",

And. in fact. under a court order. there was a requirement to correct the count from Gibson County. that the statement certified by Gibson County was proven to be arithmetically wrong. they added two precincts together. there was a recanvassing under court order. those numbers were changed. there was agreement that Gibson County then provided the corrected total to the secretary of state. It was then the official certified count from Gibson County. included with the other 15 counties in the Congressional Eight District. and that produced the certification. The gentleman simply takes a statement in the law of Indiana and ignored the case action surrounding the Eighth Congressional District and the requirements that Gibson County be reexamined. the numbers correctly added.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recent new accounts remind us once again that we must remain ever vigilant to guard against exports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil for which Congress has not given its consent. One such news account in the Journal of Commerce begins as follows: \"A California oil company believes it has found a way to export Alaskan oil to Japan and other Asian nations: refine it and then ship it.\" This company proposes to circumvent the existing law banning the export of Alaskan North Slope oil by building a refinery in Alaska to process 100.000 barrels a day of North Slope crude solely for export. Those who seek to exploit this loophole would be foolish to assume that Members of Congress concerned about this Nations energy policy will merely sit back and allow this to happen. Although the economic impact of allowing 100.000 barrels per day of exports might seem to be limited. they would be uniformly negative. A report submitted earlier this year to the Congress. entitled \"National Consequences of Exporting Alaskan North Slope Crude Oil.\" predicts that such exports would cause 7.0008.000 job losses. net revenue losses of $115 million for Statesprincipally on the west coastother than Alaska. reduced Federal receipts of $762 million. and deterioration in the U.S. current account of at least $712 million over the next 3 years. Who would gain? The State of Alaska. of course. as well as those who will share in the construction of the proposed refinery. Im sure my colleagues saw the reports this weekend indicating that by Christmas the State of Alaska will provide each of its citizens with $556 from the States oil supported permanent fund. This represents a 25percent increase over last years payment. Now. for the further benefit of the State. we are being asked to impose costs on the rest of the country. With the United States becoming increasingly dependent on foreign suppliers of crude oil. exports of 100.000 barrels per day cannot conceivably be considered in the national interest. I hope the Congress will correct this loophole in our export laws as part of its continuing effort to help develop a rational energy policy that serves the interests of the entire Nation.",

Taiwan had been exploited to feed the Japanese war effort. By the time the Chinese took over Taiwan. rice production had sunk to 45 percent of its peak production. Electric power as well as sugar production were both drastically down from their peak capacities. The Republic of China Government quickly introduced land reform. built schools. roads. and factories. As a result. the standard of living rose steadily. For instance. the GNP was 400 million U.S. dollars in 1952 but it went up to $57.26 billion by the end of 1984. Even more significantly. the gap between the rich and the poor has been steadily narrowing from the early 1950s. Today what we see in Taiwan is a growing middle class who believe totally in economic and industrial growth. Taiwans economic and social successes were due to the efforts of the master builder of Taiwan: The late President Chiang Kaishek. whose 100th birthday will be on October 31. 1986. On tis occasion.

Even though the United States no longer has official ties with Taiwan. the unofficial relationship is ongoing and getting stronger every day due to the tireless efforts of Dr. Fredrick Chien. Taiwans top representative in Washington. DC. Dr. Chien and his colleagues have shown the utmost cooperation with our Trade Representatives office in the latest round of trade discussions. I am pleased to note that Taiwans 12th special procurement mission is currently in the United States. and in fact in Washington. DC. tonight. purchasing soybeans. maize. and other commodities in different States. No one should ever doubt Taiwans sincerity and desire to cooperate with us. It is my belief that we must abide by the Taiwan Relations Act and sell to Taiwan whatever defensive weapons they need. The Communist threat against them is real. and no one should be so naive to take the Communists peaceful offer as gospel truth. I wish my Taiwanese friends the best of luck. I admire their courage. their independence. and their industriousness. I am sure they will continue to prosper under the capable leadership of President Chiang Chingkuo.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is indeed a great honor for me to join my colleagues in congratulating the people of Taiwan on the occasion of the centennial birthday of their distinguished leader Chiang Kaishek. The late President Chiang did much to unite China for the first time in 1928 and to sow the seeds of democracy in Taiwan. which flourish today in the free. prosperous country that it has become. He was a statesman who warned the United States many times of the treachery of the U.S.S.R. and of the other Communist countries and he was also nationalist. who placed the interests of his people and his nation above everything else. Chiang Kaishek helped make Taiwan what it is today. And. so it is with pleasure that I join my distinguished colleagues and the people of Taiwan in commemorating their late Presidents 100th birthday.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the free people on Taiwan will commemorate the 100th birthday of their former national leader. President Chiang Kaishek on October 31. From 1950 to 1975. Chiang Kaishek was President of the Republic and DirectorGeneral of the Kuomintang. On April 5. 1975. he died after a long illness. Even though his death had been expected. it was nevertheless a shock to the Chinese people on Taiwan. They greeted his death with a spontaneous outpouring of grief. Two million of them paid their respect as he lay in state. What Chiang Kaishek gave his people was confidence in themselves and their ability to face reverses. In fact. Chiang Kaishek told .his people not to be afraid when the Republic of China withdrew from the United Nations in 1971. So when the United States withdrew its diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China in 1979. the Chinese people on Taiwan were ready. They did not panic. They worked even harder in gaining more friends abroad and in promoting their economic growth at home. I am pleased to say that the unofficial relationship between the Republic of China and the United States has been improving steadily. I trust that the Republic of China will continue to be politically stable and economically strong. and that as our relationship continues we may achieve resolution of outstanding issues between us. particularly that of trade reciprocity.",

This bill was introduced at the request of the University of Minnesota Medical School. However. I assume it will benefit other medical schools and institutions as well. Cyclosporine is an FDAapproved immunosuppressive agent which is used in research conducted to improve organ transplantation techniques. The drug. to my knowledge. is manufactured by only one company in Switzerland. Even though the column I tariff is low at 1.5 percent currently. the tariff combined with a customs broker fee can make the price of entry very high for a research facility with scarce resources. Often. an experimental drug will be donated to a research facility. yet that facility will still have to pay for the drug through the tariff and broker fee. My bill would enable the users of this drug to enter the drug themselves to avoid unwanted expenses and delays. The column II duty would not be changed.",

It is only a fraction of the nearly $1.5 million in aid that was intended for humanitarian assistance to the Contras. that in fact has wound up being paid to the Honduran Army.

Since the existence of the House Judiciary Committee. initial consideration of impeachment. as far as I know. has always been full committee business.

All direct appeals are over. Yet the matter of impeaching a convicted and imprisoned Federal judge who disgraces the judiciary every day and whose salary costs taxpayers nearly $215 a day has been referred to a subcommittee. No one expects this matter to reach full committee before the July 4th recess. Since I have already drafted an article of impeachment. why do we need 6 wee-.s to draft articles of impeachment?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in 1874. as today. the United States was on a floating dollar standard. and a great debate was going on whether the resumption of a gold standard would have any merit. One of the participants of the debate. Senator John P. Jones. had this to say on the floor of the U.S. Senate on April 1. 1874: Does this Congress mean now to leave entirely out of view and discard forever a standard of value? Did any country ever accumulate wealth and achieve greatness or attain a high civilization without such a standard? And what but gold can be that standard? What other thing on earth possesses requisite qualities? Gold is the articulation of commerce. It is the most potent agent of civilization. It is gold that has lifted the nations out of barbarism. So exact a measure is it of human effort. that when it is exclusively used as money it teaches the very habit of honesty. It neither deals in nor tolerates false pretense. It keeps its promise to rich and poor alike. Thanks to the efforts of men like Senator Jones. Congress decided to resume the gold standard. The country went on to greatness and became the worlds leading creditor. In 1971 we discarded our standard of value. and by 1986 the country became the worlds leading debtor. in fulfillment of the word of the Gospel: \"The man who has will be given more. and the man who has not will forfeit even what he thinks he has.\" (Luke. 8:18.)",

I want to commend Senator PAcKwoon for worldng with those of us who have been concerned about these flaws to eliminate the most serious ones. The credit. as it would be altered by this amendment. will provide needed tax incentives for construction and preservation of lowincome housing. I remain concerned that certain limitations on an investors ability to use the credit. however. are not addressed by this amendment. I hope they will be addressed in the conference. In particular. the limitation of the credit to no more than $6.750 per year will make the credit much less attractive to investors. Moreover. investors with incomes over $150.000 a year will be unable to use the credit at all because of the \"passive loss\" limitations contained in the Finance Committee bill. This is a serious problem because it is precisely these investors who are most likely to invest in lowincome housing. which offers none of the cashflow or appreciation of other investments. I urge the conferees to revise these limitations on the credit in order to ensure that the credit will be effective in achieving its purposes. I also share Senator PACKWOODS view and the view of the other Senators who have spoken that the conferees should allow some transition relief to previous investors in lowincome housing. These investors supplied urgently needed capital for lowincome housing as a result of the specific encouragement of our tax policy. The tax benefits that were given to them by prior law were meant to substitute for the lack of cashflow and lack of immediate appreciation inherent in lowincome housing. Both the House and the Senate have continued the tax preferences given to lowincome housing. very wisely. in my Judgment. It would thus be extremely unfair to penalize these investors by disallowing their expected tax benefits for Investments that they made several years ago. I support Senator PACKWOODS view that the conferees should allow some substantial transition relief for these investors.*",

We think we have provided a realistic way to prevent it. We do not think it has any negative economic impact. but we do think it is realistic. We added one thing to the bill in the course of the discussion. We said the President should send his budget to us using the same basic implementing tools and assumptions. He will have to tell us what his budget looks like based upon the fiscal year 1987 windfall being moved into the next year as we described it. We think that provides some continuity and we hope the conferees will retain this amendment to the substantive budget law of the land as they move through the conference on taxes.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that the seven interstate compacts are before the Senate today. In 1980. the Congress declared that the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste is a State responsibility. To meet this responsibility safely and efficiently. the States must develop regional plans. I am gratified that 37 State legislatures have responded by enacting enabling legislation for seven interstate compacts. These seven compacts represent an important step in moving toward regional disposal of these wastes. In consenting to these compacts. the Congress gives its go ahead to the implementation of regional disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste. Having ratified the northeast compact. New Jersey has taken an essential step in assuring its access to the existing sites for lowlevel radioactive waste generated within New Jersey. This compact provides the framework for implementing siting plans and for establishing a new facility. Two concerns were raised. however. by New Jersey during the consideration of the northeast compact: shallow land burial and institutional control. In addition. the question of judicial review is addressed in a colloquy by several Senators. Mr. President. a provision in the lowlevel radioactive waste policy amendments act. legislation which establishes the institutional framework within which the compacts will operate. requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide the technical guidance needed to develop and license new facilities by alternative disposal methods. This provision. that I authored. ensures that In meeting performance objectives. attention is paid to the careful balance of the combination of institutional control and engineered factors. Each of these seven interstate compacts contains similar provisions for policy and purpose. In addition. they provide for the regional disposal of their own lowlevel radioactive waste. but vary in many other aspects. I commend my colleagues for developing consent language that respects the individual State needs and. yet reinforces the underlying Federal policy of the amended act. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this consent legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this legislation is very important to all States including Michigan who must do something to properly dispose of the lowlevel radioactive waste generated within their borders. It is important to all of us that this waste be properly disposed of. At the present time. this Nation has only three commercial waste disposal sites and no new disposal facilities are expected to open before the early 1990s. Consequently. the Governors of those States have threatened to close the sites to any outoftheregion waste after January 1. 1986a deadline set in the 1980 LowLevel Radioactive Waste Policy Act for regional compacts to take care of their own waste. That presents a very real problem to States like Michigan. whose lowlevel waste generation is large enough to cause interim storage problems. Therefore. it is my assessment that States like Michigan cannot afford to take the risk of those three facilities being closed and I would not stand in the way of passage of this legislation. which gives nonsited States an extended period of time In which to open their own disposal sites. I do. however. have strong reservations about a provision which makes the State liable for all waste generated within its borders. if it is not able to dispose of all its waste by 1996. I understand the basis for this provision. which is to provide an additional incentive to States to properly dispose of their waste. However. I feel this measure is too drastic and could cause severe waste management problems for the States. I am concerned that it may be impossible for States which generate significant amounts of lowlevel radioactive waste to dispose of all of the waste generated within its borders by that date due to circumstances beyond their control. such as litigation. I believe that consideration should be given to States who cannot meet that deadline if they have made every effort to meet the milestones and the process set forth in that law and flexibility should be exercised on this provision. although it is my hope no States will be unable to meet this deadline. Mr. President. I will follow the progress of the formation of the regional compacts very closely to make sure that we have not set unreasonable milestones in the bill.",

Without clear action by the Congress. the Governors of the three States that have been disposing of all of our commercial lowlevel nuclear wastes have threatened to shut down the disposal sites in their States. I cannot say that I blame them. In 1980. when Congress passed the LowLevel Waste Policy Act. we thought that by now new disposal capacity would be available. such has proved not to be the case. The citizens of South Carolina. Nevada. and Washington deserve to know that a firm schedule is in place by which others will share the burden. At the same time. the rest of the Nation deserves to know that the existing sites will continue to accept these byproducts of both nuclear power and nuclear medicine until new sites are opened. Mr. President. as a member of the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am pleased to report that this complex bill meets those conflicting needs very well. New Yorkers will continue to light some of their lights with nuclear electricityand their doctors will continue to use lifesaving laboratory tests that depend on the use of radioactive materials. So will the citizens of South Carolinaand they will be able to watch New York. and the rest of the Nation. make their own arrangements to dispose of their own lowlevel radioactive wastes.

Although the Commonwealth has taken strides toward arranging a compact with neighboring States. it has not been able to finalize an agreement. Acting responsibly and in good faith.

Because so many States are in a similar situation. the Nation will face a certain environmental crisis beginning In the new year without congressional approval of a transition period.

Just 13 months ago. we briefly considered the convention in the final days of the 98th Congress. with the prospects for ratification greatly enhanced by President Reagans strong endorsement in his September 1984 address to the Bnai Brith International Conference. Faced with the reality of a filibuster at the end of the last Congress. the Senate suspended consideration of the convention and in its stead adopted a resolution expressing support for the principles contained in the Genocide Convention. and pledging expeditious action in the first session of this Congress. That resolution. Senate Joint Resolution 478. passed this body by a vote of 87 to 2. and represented a commitment on the part of the Senate to at long last get this treaty to the Senate early enough in a session to give it a favorable chance of passage. I regret that we have not kept the commitment embodied in Senate Joint Resolution 478. The Genocide Convention arose from the ashes of the Holocaust. and there could be no more fitting way for the United States to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camps than by ratifying this treaty in 1985. In the words of Elie Wiesel. the Genocide Convention. when ratified. would become \"not only an act of justice. but above all. a solemn and noble act of remembering.\" I sincerely hopeand I know that many. many of my colleagues are of the same mindthat the convention will be made the first item of business when we return in January.

We have a tax policy which is encouraging their support. We have not taken any country. we have taken these classifications. I think it makes sense. I think more importantly. what my amendment does is encourage U.S. business to stop economically supporting countries mentioned in this amendment. It will do it by making them pay taxes now. they or their subsidiaries in those countries and will deny them any tax credits or shelter from these taxes. I think that is important. If we continue that deferral that is contained in the underlying amendment. that is not the case. What we are saying is. we are not going to encourage new companies to come in. New companies. for the most part. are not going to go into Libya in any event. new corporations are not going to go into Iran in any event. new compaies are not going into Angola in any event. So I find it to be that an amendment in terms of \"foreign\" sounds good. but substantively. if anything. it will encourage the redeployment of additional assets in that country. Because now the oil companies doing business in Libya. if they take their money out. no longer get their foreign tax credit. will continue to plow back moneys in Libya.

If we are really serious about getting tough with terrorists. we have to strike at terrorism in every conceivable legitimate way. and this surely includes denying terrorists indirect tax subsidies. We are not taking away the right of companies to operate in these countries. where it is legal to do so. If a company wants to operate legally in one of those countries. it can. We are sayng. however. that the American taxpayer will no longer be forced to support these company operations whose foreign taxes are used to spread terrorism around the world. It is only reasonable to require our tax policy to conform with our foreign policy of antiterrorism. Mr. President. I am going to follow the same procedure that the Senator from New York suggested. I find no trouble with that. because we are looking at longterm tax policy here and having that tax policy parallel our foreign policy. That foreign policy today is that we are going to combat terrorism wherever we find it around the world. and our tax policy does not conform with that today. However.

It was not a fair and equitable tax.

The judgment of the Finance Committee may have been wrong. I dont know.

Had we eliminated the deduction of the personal property tax. it would have raised about $1 billion. but about half of that. about $500 million. was taxes on mobile homes. Technically those do not count as real estate but people live in them. They count them as homes.

I speak with honor and pride today that I am a Member of this Hotse which is considering the conferenc report on H.R. 1460. the AntiApartheid Act. which I have cosponsored. My regret is that the Congress did not adopt this legislation last year. Although the House adopted a similar bill. the Senate did not do so. If the Congress had taken a stand. perhaps lives in South Africa would have been saved. Perhaps we would not be witnessing the dire situation which exists in South Africa today. In speaking in favor of the legislation when the House debated it in June. I said that we must realize the longterm implications of our present relationship with South Africa. I said that most people agree that the walls of apartheid will be torn down. and that most people agree that the longer the walls remain standing. the more violent will be the means to bring them down. We are now witnessing that violence. We must not delay another day in taking a stand for our Government against the evil of apartheid. The legislation which we have before us today clearly demonstrates our distaste for apartheid. It takes important steps to end our countrys financial support for the South African system. In the legislation: We end bank loans to South Africa. we prohibit the importation of South African gold coins. we prohibit the sale of computer equipment to South Africa nd we seek to end new investment by American companies in South Africa unless there is significant change in the apartheid system. Some say that this legislation is not enough. That we must end all American Investment in South Africa. That is true. We can continue to work toward that goal. and if no progress occurs implement such a policy. But the legislation which we have before us today is an excellent start. It ends our countrys misguided policy of \"constructive engagement\" and in its place makes clear that we have no tolerance for the immoral system of apartheid. I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. I am honored to vote to bring freedom and justfce to all of the people of South Africa.",

I want to commend those Members on both sides of the aisle of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Banking Committee for an outstanding job of bringing about a bipartisan program for Justice in South Africa.

Why should we do that today?

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to respond briefly to my good friend from Illinois. He refers to the $100 million that is in the socalled unallotted funds of the Appropriations Committee. The Senator is correct. But under the Budget Act of 1974. only the committee itself has been designated with the authority to allocate those funds under the 302(b) program. That is No. 1. No. 2. there are major differences between the House and the Senate appropriation actions that have thus far occurred. There will have to be adjustments made between the levels of spending on many programs. and worthy programs that I know are high priority to the Senator from Illinois. as well as to myself. So that $100 million in effect will have to be utilized in making those adjustments between the House levels and Senate levels. in order to stay within the levels of a bill that would be signed by the President. So I want the Senator to understand that we do not have that $100 million back there sort of in a pot waiting to either not be spent or to throw it out at some lesser worthy program. and to also indicate that it is more than merely a technicality that I at this point feel constrained to raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act as amended in that the amendment provides budget authority in excess of the committees 302(b) allocation under the fiscal year 1987 concurrent resolution on the budget. and is not in order.",

This amendment replaces $24 million that has been taken from the Fulbright fund and restores it to fiscal year 1986 levels. It restores the $800.000 that has been taken from Soviet studies. In Soviet studies. we have had what everybody acknowledges to be a major deficiency. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. LUGAR. very appropriately has asked that we appropriate money in that area and we have. for the last couple of years. been doing that. Under this appropriation bill that would be cut $800.000. Senators who have visited anywhere in the world have run into people in other governments who have a feeling of kinship not only toward the United States but to the whole process of a free democracy at work. and I have experienced it. Many of us have experienced it. This does not increase the total appropriation. We take it from the building fund which has some money that clearly can be used for this purpose. I think this is a very rational amendment. I might add that my colleagues. Senator PELL. Senator MOYNIHAN. and Senator MATSUNAGA are cosponsors. I believe this amendment makes sense. It is penny wise and pound foolish to cut back on the Fulbright Program. one of the finest investments we have made. I think it is universally acknowledged. If we want to build a world of peace. we are not going to do it only with summit meetings in Iceland and arms control agreements with the Soviets. We are going to have to do it by building understanding between people. That is what this is all about. I would be halpy to answer any questions that anyone may have.

Not all items within this appropriation or any other appropriation outlay at the same rate. The $248.200.000 item for acquisition and maintenance abroad outlays at a particular rate. which I believe is somewhat considerably less than 1 for 1.

Countless leaders and heads of state around the globe. as the Senator from Rhode Island points out. have served under this program.

I hope we can work out the problem the Senator from New Hampshire has in terms of the budget process. I know of no other program that returns as much to this country as does this program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to participate in the Congressional Vigil for Soviet Jewry. this year on behalf of Mr. Yuri Druzhnikov. It was the sister of Mr. Druzhnikov. now residing in my district. who first brought the plight of her brother to my attention. Yuri Druzhnikov is a wellknown Russian novelist. playwright. and author of short stories for children. He has been a refusenik for 9 years and has been denied over 10 requests to emigrate. After his first application for an exit permit was submitted. he was immediately expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers. allegedly for \"having chosen the road of betrayal to his country.\" His books were removed from libraries and bookstores. his name was deleted from articles in professional literary journals. magazines. and newspapers. His books accepted for publication by Moscow publishing houses were prohibited by censorship. One of his plays which had a successful run of some 1.000 performances was closed down without notice. His other plays were prohibited by the Ministry of Culture. His voice. which had sounded regularly in a radio program for parents about the problems of their children. grew silent. In October 1982. a group of Minnesotans participation in the Friendship Forces trip to the Soviet Union visited Yuri Druzhnikov and other refuseniks. These new friends of Mr. Druzhnikov tell me that after that encounter. his mail was completely cut off. I am told that the original reason given for the denial of Mr. Druzhnikovs visa was that his wife. Galina. held a position as an engineer that was allegedly a security risk. Mr. and Mrs. Druzhnikov have been divorced for 6 years now and his former wife is not seeking permission to emigrate. However. to the best of our knowledge. the nature of Galinas job is still being given as the reason to deny Yuri his right to an exit visa. In the past years. Yuri Druzhnikov had chosen a path of quiet diplomacy and avoidance of political demonstrations or protests. But now after 9 years as a refusenik. life in the Soviet Union has become intolerable. I know that Yuri Druzhnikov is hopeful that all those individuals sympathetic to the plight of Soviet Jews will hear his plea and join in and appeal to the Soviet authorities on his behalf.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to introduce my colleagues to a brave young man. Albert (Chaim) Burshtein. a 20yearold citizen of Leningrad. In his 20 years. Chaim has witnessed continuous persecution of his family and friends. has experienced constant harassment. and has been a victim of harsh antiSemitic policy at the hands of the Soviet authorities. Chaim is a man of strong will and determination and despite the efforts of the Soviets to break his spirit. he is ready to challenge the officials that are out to destroy him. Chaim. although suffering from a debilitating disease of his shinbone which has left him an invalid. has not given up his fight to live in Israel. In the past year he was arrested for \"stubbornly demanding an exit visa to Israel.\" and for planning a work strike to protest the refusal of his familys exit visas. He then went on a hunger strike to protest his arrest from November 6 to 13. In December 1985. Chaim also participated in the hunger strike in sympathy for the plight of Leonid Volvovsky. In an effort to call attention to the plight of separated families. Chaim was a signatory to a letter sent to the 27th Communist Party Congress in February. Since that time Chaim has been receiving a great deal of pressure from the KGB at his job. because of all his activities. His telephone at work was also disconnected. Within the last 2 months the Soviet authorities have cracked down on Chaim. On May 25. Chaim was with a group of friends near a metro station. When he walked away from the group. they were surrounded by KGB agents and were taken away. Chaim followed. trying to ask questions but he too was taken away by force. While he continued to yell at the KGB. the group was finally released. In a matter of a few days. Chaim was fired",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. June 30 marks the 45th anniversary of the restoration of Ukrainian independence. The day commemorates the heroic actions of the Ukrainian people who defied both the Soviet and Nazi armies in 1941 to proclaim the freedom of their nation. The Ukrainian liberation movement took control of the radio station. called a national assembly and established a provisional government. Although the Nazi response was swift and brutalthe leaders of the Ukrainian Government were imprisoned or murdered and countless citizens were massacredthe Ukrainian resistance fought on. It was a critical factor in Hitlers final defeat. At the end of World War II. the Ukrainian Insurgent Army was the third leading military power in Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian struggle helped to ensure the allied victory in World War II but it did not win freedom for Ukraine. Soviet rule meant forced collectivization. outlaw of the Catholic church. suppression of the Ukrainian language and the harshest repression by the KGB. Yet the Ukrainian resistence continued. and continues even to this day. The call for independence that was sounded on June 30. 1941 lives on. It is symbolized by the unflagging spirit and the suffering of Ukrainian Catholic activist losyf Terelia who. after years of KGB persecution. was sentenced in February 1985. to 12 years of incarceration and was told he would never leave prison alive. The struggle of Ukraine was brought home to the American people by the determination of seaman Miroslav Medvid to seek freedom in the United States. Althougf Medvid was cruelly returned to the Soviets the American people must not forget his fate nor that of his countrymen and women.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Harkin amendment would result in production controls on wheat and corn. under certain conditions Although I will vote for the amendment. I want to discuss some of the serious qualms I have with it. First. under the amendment. only 60 percent of the producers would have to approve of this mandatory system for it to go Into effect. I would have been more comfortable with a requirement of 75 percent. a figure closer to a consensus. Furthermore. I am also concerned that by reducing the supply of domestic grain. as this amendment might lead to. we could end up raising the world price of grain for consumers. I am also troubled by the degree of Government intervention in agriculture which this amendment suggests. But it is important to keep in mind that these serious concerns about the Harkin amendment are in the context of an even more severe crisis in agriculture. Innovative measures will have to be taken in order to remedy the situation. In the 1930s in an effort to revitalize a stricken economy. Franklin D. Roosevelt was willing to experiment with solutions which involved risks. I believe the time has come with respect to the farm economy today when we cannot afford not to take some risks. The Harkin amendment at most involves a limited 2year risk that we should be willing to take in order to obtain some stability. raise farm income. get supply and demand back in sync. and to reduce and reduce government expenditures. We are facing a severe budget deficit in this country. And that crisis requires drastic measures. The Congressional Budget Office estimated this amendment would save the Government $35 billion over the next 4 years. That Is a significant savings which I do not believe we can ignore. For those reasons. I will vote for the Harkin alternative.",

I am not quarreling with that concept so much but to call this program voluntary probably means voluntary bankruptcy for those who did not participate. particularly if they have not got anything to feed it to. They can export It. which I assume requires some export subsidies. I guess the Department has indicated the cost could get to $20 billion or more if you are going to try to be competitive or try to sell some of the wheat. This amendment got 4 votes out of 17 in the committee. It lost by 69 votes In the House. It would price U.S. wheat and corn out of export markets. forcing cutbacks of 55 percent and 20 percent respectively. I understand. from the Information I have seen. that most of the corn producers are concerned about anything in excess of a 10percent reduction program. Costs to livestock producers would increase. in some cases dramatically. We have the Zorinsky wheat referendum In the 4year freezeand I know this Is important to some end I do not quarrel with thatand we also have a wheat \"TOP\" program which provides for a choice between five income support and reduction levels for wheat. The TOP price level for 1986 is $5.50 at a 40percent ARP in the TOP program. compared to $4.86 at 35 percent. I would suggest the wheat producer is better off with a truly voluntary program where he can determine what target price he would have to receive and how much he would want to retire. I think the amendment has been well debated. I know this amendment is well supported. I have visited with some of my farmer friends in the American agriculture movement. They gave me a copy of the amendment yesterday. They indicated it was voluntary and I guess It is. In other words. if you do not comply. you can feed it. But if you do not have anybody to feed it to or anything to feed it to. you must export it. If there is no export market. I guess you can pile it up. But it is all voluntary.

So we get about the same participation whether it is under that approach or my approach. So both are voluntary to that extent. On livestock. as I pointed out before. cheap grain leads to cheap livestock. The best thing we can do for them is to have a very stable. higher price for grain over a longer period of time.

Winter wheat farmers go through the same practice. and procedures for replanting that they do for any other crop. In South Dakota. winter wheat country. you will find a vast amount of the producers actually farm 2 acres to get 1 acre of a crop. because of fallow acres. They have a heavy. heavy investment. Regardless of how well it has been farmed. if winter kill sets in it wipes out a whole area. a whole field. and they have to start all over from scratch. There is no setaside large enough to take care of the kind of possible setaside acres I think the chairman is saying. If I am going to encourage participation of farmers in South Dakota. where we have not been participating. we have to take care of inequities like this. Last year. we had a similar problem with flooding of row crops and a lack of prevented planting payments. Farmers which participated in crop insurance did not get one nickel out of it if they were unable to plant their crop. On the other hand. those who planted it and were drowned out were reimbursed. I believe that the chairman took care of this inequity and I commend him for addressing that problem. Now. I feel that a study is very much in order. if we really want to make crop insurance take off and be beneficial for the farmers of this country by encouraging them to protect themselves instead of expecting disaster payments.

My original amendment would have served to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from prohibiting farmerowned cooperatives from doing what every other business enterprise in this country doesoffsetting any losses in one area of their operations against any gains in another area of business activity when determining their tax liability. This practice is commonly referred to as \"netting\" the gains and losses of the coop. The issue here was and is one of fairness and equity. It is one in which we only sought to have farmer cooperatives and their 2 million farmermembers treated in an evenhanded manner under the Tax Code. Now. we have translated that into a senseoftheSenate resolution. On April 2 of this year. Secretary of Agriculture John Block wrote to Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to ask that a recently issued technical advise memorandum prohibiting netting of gains and losses by farmer coops be withdrawn. In his letter Secretary Block stated that: Farmer cooperatives must have the authority to net gains and losses in their various divisions In order to survive In todays highly volatile agricultural industry. By netting gains and losses among several divisions. a cooperative may spread economic risk and significantly reduce the effect of catastrophic failure In any one of them. On April 22 I was joined by 25 of our colleaguesincluding 5 distinguished members of the Senate Finance Committeein signing a similar letter to Secretary Baker requesting that the IRS netting memorandum be withdrawn pending congressional action on tax reform. There would be no loss of revenue to the Treasury since netting has been allowed in the past and any revenue gains realized by disallowing it are not reflected in our baseline budget figures. That is just part of the historical background on it.

June 20. 1.985 moving the efficiency of coal from 35 or 37 percent up to 50 to 54 percent. somewhere in that range. that probably the MHD topping cycle from the onset will be a cheaper operation facility than the traditional or conventional coalfired steam generators.

I suspect if we add AVCO and the University of Tennessee and Stanford and MIT and Mississippi State and General Electric and Westinghouse. they would all say that same thing. probably longer than 10 years. That is the first step of the question the Senator poses about being competitive. There is no way of being competitive until we scale up the components to a size that we can put it on such an existing commercial plant as I have previously described. We are not at that point. unfortunately. We could have been if. instead of appropriating $30 million per year for the past 5 years. we had been appropriating $70 million to $80 million a year. We would be at that point. Because we slowed the program down just to be able to keep plugging away at it. we have only spent less than half as much as we should have during the past 5 years. That is exactly why we are not at the commercial size. When I say \"commercial size.\" Mr. President.

But I would point out that every industry group is fully supportive of this bill. and I hold in my hand a sheet with two pages of industry groups that are supportive of this bill. This bill is far different than that which was passed in the last Congress. It does not contain the controversial amusement park regulatory provision that was sponsored at that time by the gentleman from Illinois . We have watered that down considerably. We have changed it. It does provide for some reasonable reporting requirements in the case of death or serious injury. But there are other things that have been taken out of this bill from that which passed in the last Congress. The other controversial reporting requirements are not here. I would also point out something that is in this bill that Members should note. and that is that contains a legislative review and veto of Commission rules that are promulgated. That is a provision and a procedure that has been advocated by many Members in this body and voted on affirmatively. That provision is in here. ard would provide the authority for us to review any agency rules. and the authority to vote them down if we do not agree with them. or think that they do not comply with the law.",

I rise in support of the House joint resolution now before the House. reaffirming the friendship of the people of the United States with the people of Colombia following the devastating volcanic eruption of November 13. 1985. The resolution expresses the sincere and heartfelt sympathy for Colombia in its time of great disaster. Tragic devastation was wrought by the Colombian volcano. Nevado del Ruiz. last week which has saddened the world. The volcanic explosion. and the ensuing avalanche of mud and flooding. obliterated the entire town of Armeroa dozen other nearby towns were stricken as well. Official estimates now cite the death toll at 25.000. Colombia. in recent weeks. has experienced two violent eruptionsone natural. and one man made. The first tragic eruption. the manmade disaster. was the result of a terrorist act in the capital of Bogota. Leftist guerrillas. who seized the Supreme Court Building there. murdered half of Colombias Supreme Court Justices and 50 other hostages in a bloody seige of terrorism. Although the resolution now before the House addresses the tragic volcanic eruption. our deepest sympathies go out to the Colombians in this grievous chapter of its history. We express our friendship and solidarity with the people of Colombia. and with President Betancur who has been faced with these double tragedies. The resolution urges that all necessary emergency assistance be provided in the near term. as well as indicating U.S. willingness to assist in the longterm recovery efforts. The potential for additional destruction remainsand will for some time to come. Because of the unpredictability of the volcano. the situation will require close monitoring in the weeks and months ahead. Further evacuations and assistance may well be required. The United States remains prepared to provide any appropriate assistance. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of the resolution.",

It is estimated that widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the eruption took the lives of 20.000 people and left many more injured and disfigured. In the aftermath of this tragedy. the United States immediately sent 12 helicopters. tents. and medical supplies for use during the emergency rescue operations that continue to pull survivors to safety. The historic ties and longstanding friendship that bind the people of the United States with the people of Colombia require that we do everything we can to help relieve the suffering that is currently being experienced by our neighbor to the south. I am pleased to support the resolution we consider today as an expression of our sympathy and solidarity with the people and Government of Colombia. The resolution encourages the President to provide all appropriate relief and rehabilitation assistance to help prevent further loss of life and suffering among the people of Colombia.

It responds to the services most pressing construction needs. but at the same time maintains the committees high priority for quality of life projects. those projects that improve the facilities where military personnel live. work and raise their families. and which I might add our subcommittee chairman I think has taken a very strong positive leadership role in bringing those issues in front of the Congress and also getting action with respect thereto.

It is not generally recognized that the conferees on our sideand that is why I have those extra congratulations for the gentlemen of this committeewent to the conference in. sisting on the House version of military construction. especially as to the House insistence that this is not the time to consider thirdparty contractIng for a lot of the missions that al. ready are in existence in the various bases across the country. This is particularly true in the one to which I am paying particular attention. the New Cumberland Army Depot in Pennsylvania. where an entire construction project already on the books. groundbreaking for which was already conducted. and then something occurs in the other body which seems to put a pall over all those proceedings by insisting on a review of the possibility of thirdparty contracting. Quite correctly. then. our conferees. led by the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Colorado. Insisted that now is not the time. The projects are in hand. If we are going to do anything about thirdparty contracting. let it be in the context of some future negotiations. future processes to be adopted by the various committees who have jurisdiction over this subject matter. For that I repeat my gratitude to the House conferees. I will be one of the first to support as the future unfolds where we can go with thirdparty contracting. There are a great number of doubts that are raised simply by saying thirdparty contracting. because I would hate to see the day when we hand to a private contractor some service capability that could be hit by a strike at the very same time when we would require an Army depot. like New Cumberland. to be prepared for an emergency. so thirdparty contracting. although it sounds like motherhood to a lot of people. deserves a lot of close scrutiny.

I read in this mornings paper that one of those gentlemen. the head of the conference committee. said that by making GrammRudman work in 1986 it would mess up the whole works. that you were not serious about deficit reduction unless you delay deficit reduction. and that if you wanted deficit reduction to work. you could not have it this year. That indicates the folly of what the other side has been trying to do. They want to wave banners. they want to toot horns. they really do not want to reduce the deficit. because in 1986 is when this side wants to bring GrammRudman into effect. and the other side is saying no. They are saying no. they do not want it that way. they do not want a separate vote in the Senate to see if it should be in 1986 or 1987. What the heck is going on? What kind of double think and double talk is that. \"Yes. we should balance the budget. but. no. not this year\"? I think what has happened is that the other side has looked GrammRudman in the eye and they blinked.",

No. 1. a plan to balance the budget over the next 5 years. and No. 2. a vote that will leave Social Security alone. I cannot understand why there is so much adverse reaction on either side of the aisle. I think it is a very simple and deliberate action. and I think if we plan to do both of those things and if we believe in both of those things and we do want to leave Social Security alone. we should take this action and do it as soon as possible.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a freshman. I recognize the 98th Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. The President of the United States of America would submit a balanced budget to the Congress. The Senate Republicans in the majority refused it because the President did not want it. because they avoided the tough decisions of leadership that was given to them and granted to them by the electoral process. They did not want to gore the ox. They did not want to lose the White House. Now Democrats are sitting back and we are saying. \"Let the Presidents supply side suffer theories wreck the country. and we will gain the White House.\" The Republicans are saying. \"Let it last 2 more years. and we will put a Republican in the White House.\" The bottom line is. we are playing political football with the lives of the American people. GrammRudman is like kissing your sister. No. 1: and. No. 2. we are just not going to reduce spending and reconcile this budget. We are going to have to raise revenue. look at those corporations that are blatantly refusing to pay tax and have been getting blanket protection by this administrationAnd. finally. we have got to get out of a Disney World trade policy that is exporting all of our jobs overseas. It is not going to be a simple GrammRudman decision. There were 25 Members who wanted it brought to the floor before they even read it. Now. lets get serious. You are furloughing Americas welfare.

I think the American people watching this debate. as I did in my office and then came on over to participate in it. are probably growing a little disenchanted with all of the fingerpointing that is going on. The Republicans point the finger to the Democrats. the Democrats point the finger at Republicans. The American people are probably pointing the finger at all of us and saying. \"When are you going to do something about reducing deficits?\" The reason we have the deficits we have today. pure and simply. is because this Congress and those before it have loved the American people to the point of bankruptcy. We have helped them to the point of bankruptcy. We have passed program after program after program to try to do good work for the American people. and now we can no longer afford it. I guess we are loath to take those things back. But the GrammRudman proposal has as its goal forcing the Congress to do that. We have demonstrated in the last 6 years the lack of will in this Congress to really do it. So let us not point the finger beyond that. Let us accept the responsibility. let us pass GrammRudman. let us give ourselves some stiffening of the spine to do what has to be done to solve these budget problems.",

I do think that there is room for some application of the OrammRudman proposal in fiscal year 1986. and I was one of those Republican conferees who voted for it as the rollcall was taken yesterday. I agree with the gentleman from Ohio that approximately half of the Republican conferees did. Knowing full well. however. that House Democrat conferees did not feel much confidence in their proposal. knowing. for example. that the current estimates of what the deficit will be are so much higher than $161 billion. that there is no realistic way of achieving a $161 billion deficit without sequestration being involved. In other words. again they seek to duck their responsibility which could be undertaken in a reconciliation bill and the other measures that have been before us in the way of appropriation and authorization bills. We Just have not faced up to it. In order for GrammRudman to work correctly. we need to have the approach to a fiscal year over a 9- or 10month period that is normal in order for it to function well. But. OK. if you really want to try to apply GrammRudman in 1986 fiscal year. the current fiscal year. let it apply for that portion only which remains of the fiscal year when sequestration would go into effect.",

The National Science Foundation selects one outstanding teacher per State in each of two categories. science and mathematics. Maryland had 95 science nominees. A total of 11 semifinalists were considered and 3 finalists were considered by the National Association of Science Teachers and the National Science Foundation. To even be considered for such an award is quite an honor. George Radcliffe is one person who did not seek this honor. He has a different agenda. He was recognized for his unending devotion to the study and preservation of the environment along with imparting knowledge and the love of science to his students. fellow teachers. and the surrounding community. He utilized the total school site and outdoor environmental education facility. hiking trails. a freshwater pond for study and observation and led three planting activities in the Dorchester soil conservation district. The adult community has also benefited from George Radcliffes devotion to his profession. He is the founder of REACH [Reach for Environmental Awareness of the Chesapeake]. an organization whose goals are the cleanup and the preservation of the bay. As one who has worked to pass legislation to revitalize the bay. I more than appreciate the efforts of George Radcliffe. Let me conclude by quoting his school superintendent Mr. William J.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in a ceremony today at the central office of the Veterans Administration here in Washington. Gerald E. Albert. a vocational rehabilitation and counseling officer for the Agency. was awarded the eighth annual Olin E. Teague Award for his efforts on behalf of disabled veterans. The Olin E. Teague Award is presented annually to a VA employee. or employees working as a team. whose achievements have been of special benefit to veterans with serviceconnected injuries. Albert. who works in the VAs San Francisco regional office. is being cited for his role in bringing about a change in the San Franciso City and County Civil Service charter which now allows direct and noncompetitive job appointments of qualified disabled persons. Albert was instrumental in getting a proposition on the November 1985 ballot that resulted in the new law and has followed through by making veterans aware of it. Because of his efforts. disabled veterans in San Francisco now have even greater opportunities for employment. Albert has been a counseling psychologist with the VA for more than 22 years. He earned a B.S. degree from Florida State University in 1961 and a master of rehabilitation counseling degree from the University of Florida in 1963. As an officer in the San Francisco vocational rehabilitation and counseling division. his job is to assist eligible veterans in overcoming serviceconnected disabilities through vocational training. independent living services and other rehabilitation counseling. plus employment assistance. Obviously. he has done his job exceptionally well. Mr. Speaker. there is no greater record of service to the Nations veterans than that of the late Olin E. (Tiger) Teague. for whom the award is named. Tiger Teague served on the Veterans Affairs Committee for 32 years. 18 as its chairman. No one before and no one since has had a greater understanding of veterans concerns and needs nor has done more to address them. He set the standards by which we can best serve all veterans. I know my colleagues will want to join me in offering our deep appreciation to Gerald Albert for his concern. for his dedication. and for his innovation in meeting the special rehabilitation needs of our disabled veterans. We congratulate him for the excellence of his work and for the distinguished award he received today.",

I would like to read to you what the chief election officer and secretary of state of the State of Kansas has written to one of my Democratic colleagues. without mentioning the name of that colleague. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I urge you to reconsider your vote to refuse to seat Indiana Republican Rick McIntyre as a member of the House of Representatives. Petty. partisan politics must give way to greater concerns when the stakes are representation in the U.S. House for a half million people. And there is no doubt that partisan politics are behind your vote. for the facts clearly show that Mr. McIntrye should be seated. Mr. McIntyre won the election in Indianas 8th Congressional District by 34 votes and was certified the winner. Later. a recount not only confirmed his victory. but widened his lead to 418 votes. Never before in history has the House refused to recognize a valid election certificate issued by a sovereign state. Never before have I seen the election process subjected to such brazen and arrogan. abuse of power. I ask that you recognize the will of the people of Indiana. respect the electoral process and reverse your decision. With every good wish. Cordially.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to make a short response to the address made yesterday by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain. While I generally agree with much of what Mrs. Thatcher had to say regarding the relationship between the United States and Great Britain in todays world. I take exception with those portions of her remarks which dealt with the situation in Northern Ireland. Her assertions demonstrated little that is new in dealing with the oppression of the Catholic minority in that troubled land or in alleviating the killing that is coming from both factions and I emphasize both factions. All reasonable people deplore terrorism but to simply level that charge at one side is no answer to the pleas for political and economic Justice for the evergrowing Catholic minority. now estimated to be 40 percent of the population in Northern Ireland. Furthermore. to accuse. without proof. the American friends of the wives and children of dead or imprisoned people who struggled for liberty and Justice. of supporting the purchase of weapons. is irresponsible. It also represents nothing new in the Prime Ministers approach toward resolving this intolerable situation. The violence of the Royal Ulster Constabulary on peaceful civil demonstrators and their visiting American friends on August 12. 1984. is a classic example of how not to resolve this situation and how not to move toward justice and freedom. Again. Mr. Speaker. I share Mrs. Thatchers belief in the hallowed institutions of trial by jury. protection from unreasonable search and seizure. and unlawful imprisonment and detention. However. her support for these principles rings hollow so long as the Special Powers Act deny these basic human rights to people living in Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that the Prime Minister will take the steps necessary to end this tragic situation. As with all of my colleagues. I condemn the use of violence by either side in this conflict. However. I believe the only solution to this problem is the creation of an Ireland which is free. united and able to enjoy the same human rights our country so deeply cherthes.",

Yesterday the Federal Register brought us news of an oppressive and bureaucratic IRS regulation which is going to hurt our farmers and our small business people. These revised regulations stem from the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act. Under these rules. farmers and business people will have to document every mile their vehicle or vehicles are driven. This will be exceedingly onerous on the working people of our Nation. At the very beginning of this session I introduced legislation to avert this burdensome paperwork. Hundreds and hundreds of letters have been received here on Capitol Hill in support of that legislation. and I invite everyone to cosponsor this legislation. We do not want the IRS regulators to make pencil pushers or paper generators out of the American farmers or out of the American business people. Therefore. the repeal of 179B would be in the best interest of our constitutents. Actually it is the only appropriate action for this House to take.",

As a result. we are calling on the President to halt the new inspeeflon policy and seek direct negotiations with the Government of Mexico to find other means by which to locate the kidnaped DEA official. I fear that unless such action is taken immediately. the present situation could have lasting and adverse affects on our international communities along the border and United StatesMexico relations as a whole. Let me state from the outset that as chairman of the caucus. I do not intend to criticize the administration for its efforts to gain the release of the Drug Enforcement Administration official who was kidnaped last week in Guadalajara. Mexico. but rather to call attention to the adverse affects of the present policy and request that the administration seek other means by which to find clues about the kidnaping. The interdiction of drugs smuggled into this country is a paramount concern of this caucus. as is the life of U.S. officials acting in the line of duty. The scope of this meeting is. however. to explain the present situation and seek other solutions. To compound these delays. tensions along the border have flared. In Ciudad Juarez. the fourth largest city in Mexico. the local government. unions. and the chamber of commerce have organized a boycott against El Paso merchants. I have also been informed that veterinary health inspectors of cattle are refusing to enter Mexico to inspect cattle to be shipped to the United States for fear of retaliation as a result of the delays. To me. the situation demonstrates an insensitivity by our Government to the needs of the United StatesMexico border. I am concerned the situation could deteriorate to the point where U.S. citizens wellbeing could be endangered in Mexico. Further. I am again asking the President to immediately enter into ongoing bilateral negotiations with Mexico. our third largest trading partner. These obviously vitally necessary talks. I am convinced. would have prevented this intolerable crisis.",

I would like to call attention to a very significant budget fact that has caught my eye. One of the companion documents contains a chart entitled. \"Composition of 1986 Aggregate Program Spending Freeze.\" The chart compares fiscal year 1985 spending with fiscal year 1986 requests in 10 domestic and 5 defense and national interest accounts. A mere glance at these accounts makes me wonder whether or not the President is serious about reducing the deficit. There is no real change in spending. The only changes occur in the areas where money will be spent. Spending in domestic accounts will be reduced by about $30.4 billion in fiscal year 1986 while defense and national interest spending will increase by about $30.2 billion in fiscal year 1986. That is assuming the President has his way. I completely agree that the budget is ripe for more cuts. but everything must be open to budget cuts. We cannot simply shift economic resources from one area to another and proclaim to be taking bold steps toward reducing the deficit. Mr. Speaker. lets take the bold step of approaching the deficit problem by reducing spending in every facet of the budget.",

He is bringing before this body a workable solution to the growing problem of acid rain. Acid deposition is threatening our environment. health and economic wellbeing. Mr. Chairman. for too long. the current administration. too many of our colleagues and others have stonewalled a national response to the problem of acid rain. We have all heard the litany of excuses from \"acid rain is beneficial\" to the current standard excuse \"we dont have enough information on it.\" But while we fiddle. Rome burns. The jury is in. Mr. Chairman. and the verdict on acid deposition is guilty. Acid rain exists. it is a problem and we must act. There is no disputing the information we have received and the Increasing scientific documentation of the growing threat of acid rain. This May. my Subcommittee on National Parks and Recreation conducted hearings on air quality in the national parks. These hearings revealed the threat to our national parklands from air pollution. Witness after witness testified about the degradation in the parks from the loss of vegetation and poorer water quality to deteriorating cultural resources and visibility. Unless we counteract this growing problem. our national treasures will be lost forever. The subcommittee hearings also focused on the impact of acid rain on our environment. While the major public focus of acid rain has been on the Northeast and Midwest. the hearings indicated that the problems associated with acid rain may not be limited to those regions. Several witnesses indicated that both the Southeast and West could fall victims to the savage impacts of acid rain. Among those Western National Parks which were identified as sensitive to acid rain are: Mount Rainier. Yosemite. Sequoia. Yellowstone. and Glacier. Mr. Chairman. as one of the witnesses succinctly stated: We are sitting on a time bomb. We must act now to defuse this bomb before it is too late.",

We in New England are too well acquainted with the disastrous effects of acid precipitation on our lakes. rivers. and streams. Individually and as a group. members of the New England delegation have worked for years attempting to bring an effective control program into being. In spite of the crucial nature of the issue. we have yet to consider it on the floor of the House. My constituents regard acid precipitation as the most pressing of environmental problems. with the possible exception of hazardous waste disposal. Acid rain is causing significant damage to our waters and thus can well be addressed under the Water Quality Renewal Act. We have repeatedly delayed considering remedies to the damage which have already been caused by acid precipitation and while we have delayed the effects have grown worse. The amendment which Is being introduced would establish a fair and effective program to curb acid emissions and to share the cost of so doing nationally. We have authorized continued studies of acid rain essentially to buy time and avoid dealing with the real issue. There is simply no more time to buy. it is important that we act now.e",

It has not been without problems. I think our amendment sees to it that those problems will be dealt with adequately in terms of cost and performance. Mr. President. I want to take a moment to commend my colleague. the distinguished ranking member of the committee. Senator NuNN. Last year. Senators will recall. Senator NuNN urged upon us an amendment that we very wisely adopted. It was one that went a long way toward improving the status of collaboration between the United States and our NATO allies. It developed a program for NATO cooperative research and development. That program proposed funding for collaborative weapons development with the NATO allies. and to date the responses have been excellent. Progress has been more than encouraging and it is precisely because of the success of that program that the proposed termination of the RAM Missile Program has cast a shadow over this cooperative development program. In short. our NATO allies are questioning our commitment to the cooperation enunciated under the Nunn amendment. So in short. Mr. President. I feel that we have in this amendment cured the defects. The information that we sought was not available to the committee or to the subcommittee at the time of consideration. Senator NuN and I contacted Secretary Hicks. whose letter is included in those that I have inserted into the RECORD. We have been given assurance by him and other sources that the problems with the program stand to be corrected. and again I will simply state that the importance of the program both in terms of its merit in responding to the need of our Navy and that of the German navy and its importance symbolic in terms of making good on a program that we initiated last year under the Nunn amendment argue very strongly for the adoption of this amendment so that we may get on with the RAM Program.

Affordable newspaper postal rates are important for the rural newspapers. but more importantly theyre vital for the readers of those papers. While city papers are able to offer door to door delivery. the majority of rural newspaper subscribers receive their papers through the mail. In recent years. newspaper subscribers in rural areas have been subjected to more than their share of postal increases. These small journals cannot continue to absorb further postal increases and remain in business. This would be a great loss for those living in the rural sections of our Nation. While we were able to retain the revenue foregone postal funding at present levels in the fiscal year 1987 budget. the out of county limited circulation rates for newspapers was eliminated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act adopted earlier this year. Senator STEVENS added an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill to restore special adjoining county rates. Unfortunately the House objected and it was dropped from the bill. It is vital that these adjoining country postal rates berestored to assure continuing and reliable newspaper service our neighbors in rural America. Our rural citizens have the same right to know what is happening in their communities. their State. their Nation and around the world as their urban counterparts. Local newspapers also bind a community together. They are the voice of the people closest to the people and represent the earliest. and some would argue the most representative example of our first amendment freedom of speech. By assuring reasonable postal rates for these newspapers. we assure the continuation of a vital and historically important force in our national lifethe community press. This bill Mr. President. would restore special postal rates for newspaper delivery to adjoining counties for papers with up to 5.000 subscribers. This bill returns these postal rates to their prebudget reconciliation numbers. It quite simply restores the needed and necessary status quo.

Developmental disabilities affect nearly 4 million children and adults in the United States.

Developmental disabilities are attributed to chronic mental and/or physical impairments manifested before the age of 22.

Section 120 of this act addresses the concerns of the State of New Jersey with respect to the continued discharge of raw sewage by New York City. At the same time. this provision offers New York City sufficient protection from events beyond its control that might otherwise have triggered a ban contained in a version of the provision considered by the House during the 98th Congress. Mr. President. I applaud the spirit of compromise behind the drafting of this section. Senators MOYNIHAN.

In fact. I expect that New York will be ahead of schedule in accomplishing these goals. This amendment explicitly states that the Environmental Protection Agency shall be responsible for the monitoring required to ascertain the levels of sewage discharge. In this way. New York will not be expected to bear a greater financial burden under the act than is borne by other communities across the Nation. At the same time. this amendment offers protection to the city so that it will not be a victim of actions or occurrences beyond its control. Specifically. it provides an exemption should either plant come on line. but break down for reasons beyond the control of the city of New York. or if the plants could not be brought on line for reasons beyond the control of the city. such as an act of God. an act of war. or a strike. or if the violation of the cap was due to increased rainfall. or random or seasonal fluctuations. Finally. the section provides for a sunset provision for the raw sewage discharge cap on each of the plants. and it makes clear that the cap applies only to the drainage areas involved. not to the entire city.

I have every reason to believe the bill should also be satisfactory to Members. since it permits nonabusive seller financing to be provided on terms essentially similar to existing practice in the real estate industry. while preventing tax shelters that overvalue the tax bais of depreciable property or mismtach the timing of interest income and interest deductions. The only remaining concern that I am aware of relates to the problem of complexity. I would like to address that concern in detail. Despite the fact that the compromise bill is longI believe it will not be complex or difficult to apply in practice. Although there are essentially five new rules in the bill. the vast majority of transactions will be clearly within one rule or another. And once the seller or his real estate agent knows which rule appliesthe rules are relatively simple and straightforward to apply.",

In my judgment. the legislation we have crafted represents both good national security policy and a means for reducing defense expenditures. This bill also expresses the sense of the Senate that the Defense Department should place the highest priority the improvement of American capabilities to defend against the effects of chemical weapons. It further calls upon President Reagan to intensify ongoing efforts with the Soviet Union and other nations. to achieve a mutual and verifiable ban on the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. A major new. costly chemical weapons initiative will not make this Nation or our allies more secure. Improvement of defensive measures against chemical attack and the maintenance of our existing stockpile are essential. but the construction of new binary chemical weapons is a needless waste of national resources. The United States already possesses a large and usable chemical arsenal which more than meets our essential military requirements. There is simply no justification for producing new chemical weapons which would duplicate our existing capabilities. Moreover. U.S. forces will remain a target for attackdespite the size of our chemical arsenaluntil they are as well trained and well equipped to fight in a contaminated environment as the forces of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. Improved American defensive capabilities are the key to eliminating any incentive an adversary might have to use chemical weapons first In combat. Finally. Mr. President. the production of new binary chemical weapons will be expensive. Cost estimates run as high as $2 to $3 billion over the coming decade. In light of the extraordinary need for fiscal restraint. we must ensure that all defense expenditures are essential to our national security. New binary chemical weapons do not meet that requirement. Efforts to improve our defenses against chemical attack do. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing a bill to make permanent changes in the imputed interest rules of the Tax Code. These changes would accomplish two important goals. First. they will enable legitimate. nonabusive business transactions to use seller financing. and avoid imputed interest. on substantially more favorable terms than would be allowed under the permanent rules of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. Second. they will ensure that abusive tax shelters and aggressive. tax motivated deals will not be able to gain undue and unintended tax benefits. from understating the interest element of deferred payment transactions or from arranging for an intentional mismatch of interest income and interest deductions. The bill I am introducing today contains the same provisions approved by the Senate late last year as an amendment to H.R. 5361. That amendment was worked out with the cooperation and support of the distinguished Senator from Montana. Senator MELCHER. who had expressed serious objections to the original rules proposed by the Treasury Department and included in the 1984 Tax Act. It was also supported by the Treasury Department and a broad coalition of business and real estate associations. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD a copy of a letter of support for the amendment that was signed on October 3. 1984. by seven major business and real estate associations as well as the bill. Mr. President. unfortunately the Senate amendment was not accepted by the House of Representatives. The other body was not eager at that time to consider permanent legislation in this area. and so a temporary measure was agreed to as a compromise. That temporary measure will not apply to transactions after June 30. 1985. I believe that permanent changes are needed in this area. and that the compromise agreed to by the Senate last year should be the basis for such changes. I know that there were some concerns raised about the complexity of the Senate compromise. and there may be room for improvements in that regard. I look forward to working with all parties concerned with this important area of the tax law. and hope that a good bill can be enacted in the next few months.",

Mr. President. my proposal is modeled after a provision in the State of Hawaiis tax code which has been wellreceived by my constituents. It is an unfortunate fact that injuries have not replaced infectious diseases as a leading cause of death and disability among younger Americans. For example. I understand that half of all Americans aged 1 to 14. who died in 1983. died from injuries sustained in car and bicycle accidents. fires. falls. drowning. and the ingestion of toxic substances. The U.S. Department of Transportation recently informed me that. although child safety seat use has increased from 13 percent in 1979 to almost 29 percent today. the Departments investigations have indicated that only in about 15 percent of the cases where tethcred seats are being used. are they being used correctly. Further. for nontethered restraints. in only approximately 60 percent of the time that they are being used are they being used correctly. This is in spite of the fact that we know that if properly restrained. over 50 percent of the children who died in automobile accidents would have been saved and 65 percent would have been less severely injured. Mr. President. the most recent figures made available to me by the National Transportation Safety Board reported that in the years 1978 through 1982. nearly 3.400 child passengers under the age of 5 were killed in traffic accidents and more than 250.000 were injured.

I am today introducing a bill which would make permanent the present formula for determining livestock grazing fees on public rangelands in the 16 contiguous Western States. The present grazing fee formula was established by the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 and is scheduled to expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This formula was the result of many years of study and negotiation involving agricultural interests. environmental groups. the executive branch. and Congress. Each year. the formula is adjusted to reflect annual changes in the lease rates for private grazing lands and annual fluctuations in livestock prices. whether upward or downward. I am convinced that the formula has worked well during the 7 years it has been in effect. These are difficult times for agriculture in the United States. and this is no less true for those who depend on livestock production to earn a living. Retaining the present grazing fee forinula could mean the difference between making a living or going broke for many ranchers. It is essential that we take steps to insure that livestock producers are able to stay in business and are treated fairly and equitably. I recognize that. in the coming weeks and months. negotiations will be taking place on a comprehensive list of rangeland management issues. This legislation is being introduced at this time because I believe that a reasonable grazing fee schedule is essential to the survival of the livestock industry and should be adopted without delay.

I am submitting for the consideration of the Congress. the attached proposed legislation to amend Sections 546 and 565 of Title 28. United States Code. to provide for interim appointments of United States Attorneys and United States Marshals by the Attorney General rather than the Judges of the United States District Courts. Presently. interim appointments to fill vacancies occurring in a United States Attorneys or Marshals position are made by the cognizant United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 546 and 565 until the President. with the advice and consent of the Senate. appoints a permanent United States Attorney or Marshal. Although United States Attorneys and Marshals are directly accountable to and act under the supervision and control of the Attorney General. the Court is not obligated to consult with or even consider the views of the Attorney General In making an appointment. The proposed amendments are more consistent with the fundamental concept of separrtion of powers between the Judicial and Executive Branches of government. The need for the Courts to have this power of appointment because of the inability to communicate rapidly with Washington has long since passed. In addition. the serious disruptions and delays of the business of the Federal Courts which may result from a vacancy could be greatly allevated. In the recent past some courts have appointed attorneys to fill vacancies who have not been subjected to a Federal Bureau of Investigation background Investigation prior to their appointments. This poses serious problems for the Department because of the possible presence of classified and other extremely sensitive information within the United States Attorneys and Marshals offices. The proposed legislation would not change or limit the present requirement that all Presidential appointments be submitted to the United States Senate for confirmation. The Department of Justice respectfully urges that this proposal receive prompt consideration. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the submission of this proposal from the standpoint of the Administrations program. Sincerely.",

Mr. SIMON. introduced S. 1328. the Institutional Aid Amendments of 1985. legislation which seeks to strengthen programs under title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965. I am proud to cosponsor this measure. which clarifies the scope and direction of the title III programs. S. 1328 includes a provision for the establishment of the Black College and University Act. a program that specifically addresses the special needs of the Nations historically black institutions. The Black College and University Act would assist in the improvemcnt and maintenance of campus facilities. provide workshops and other activities for faculty development. and establish new curriculums to focus on those areas underrepresented by black Americans. The historically black institutions in my State of Arkansas have established themselves as integral parts of the community. and despite considerable hardship. continue to provide educational options and access for a number of young black students. One of these institutions. the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. has begun to direct its attention and resources toward developing more effective teacher education programs. Several weeks ago. I shared with my colleagues information with regard to UAPBs Educational Warranty Program. which provides assistance to teacher education graduates for 3 years after matriculation. The university has the distinction of being the first and only traditionally black institutionamong only five other universities across the countryto implement this program. With Dean of Education Dr. George Antonelli and Chancellor Dr. Lloyd Hackley at the helm. UAPB is emerging as an innovative force in the field of teacher education. Dr. Hackley has written a thoughtful and timely paper entitled \"The Decline in the Number of Black Teachers Can Be Reversed.\" which will appear in the fall issue of \"Measurement: Issues and Practice.\" I ask that Dr. Hackleys article be printed in the colleagues can benefit from his insight and research.

I rise to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his committees work on the recently reported budget resolution. We all recognize the seriousness of our skyrocketing budget deficit. Reductions in Federal spending must play a part in bringing the deficit under control. But. the way the House Budget Committee. under Chairman GRAYS leadership. has gone about making these spending cuts is as different from what the Senate did as night and day. Under the House plan. the defense budget was not treated as a sacred cow. it was made to assume its fair share of cuts along with other programs. The Senate plan made deep cuts in Social Security. railroad retirement. and other programs for the elderly and disadvantaged in order to avoid making defense take its fair share of cuts. I should add that the Senate took this approach despite reports that show the Defense Department is literally unable to effectively spend the huge sums of money it is already receiving. Furthermore. the minority substitute which our colleague Mr. LATTA plans to offer would make even more drastic cuts. The Latta substitute would require the sale of Conrail. despite the fact that all agree there are many unanswered questions that need to be addressed through the normal legislative process. For example. preliminary information raises serious questions that tax benefits available un der the Secretarys proposal might outweigh the revenue to the Government. What the Senate and the Latta substitute do is simply unfair. and I believe the American people know that. Due to the good work of Chairman GRAY and his committee. the House will soon have an opportunity to show how unfair we consider these other approaches to be. I urge my colleagues. therefore. to support the budget resolution reported by the Budget Committee.",

Mr. Chairman. being a new Member of Congress. one has to learn many lessons in this great institution. and the first lesson I have learned is. oftentimes it is much more important to be against something than it is to be for something. so I rise today against the Latta substitute for the following reasons: First. It provides entirely too much spending for the Pentagon. This substitute would Increase the Budget Committees recommendation by $10 billion in 1986. and $32 billion In budget authority over the next 3 years. at a time when we are finding out in this House that the Pentagon Is storing away money in shoe boxes. They are. In effect. using a baseline figure that entirely and wrongly inflates the baseline budget authority some four times over the baseline authority that we use in the domestic programs. It would also adopt the Senatepassed spending authority for the Pentagon which would. in effect. remove Pentagon spending from the table in any HouseSenate conference on the budget. It would cut the Social Security staff by 17.000 over the next 6 years. at a time in our history when many of our recipients have to stand in long lines or wait days to get the benefits due them. It would also terminate Farmers Home Administration direct loans. My farmers back in Arkansas right now are going under right and left. They cannot afford to pay any more toward deficit reduction. And last. but not least. I have asked several of my colleagues this morning. trying to learn something about our past mistakes. I asked them. \"Is this the same LATTA? Is his first name GRAMM? 1i this the same person that got us in this shape some 3 years ago?\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I had the opportunity to serve for 2 years on the Beilenson task force of the Rules Committee which studied the exact question that has just been discussed. that is. the reconciliation of authorizations. As I mentioned. this subject came up in the task force of the Rules Committee during the course of our review of the budget process. Many Members of the House came to us and protested the inclusion of authorizations in reconciliation instructions. and I believe that for 2 or 3 years now there has been an informal agreement between the Budget Committee and other Members of the House that reconciliation instructions would not cover authorizations. Many of the Members who appeared before us were authorizingcommittee chairmen who objected to this procedure. and there are some real problems with the procedure that has been suggested. One problem is that it essentially allows the Appropriations Committees line item work to be taken over by the authorizing committees. creating internal problems among House committees. Another is that it has the potential to slow down the entire budget and appropriation process because authorization levels have to be reworked In response to the directives. The appropriation bills are held up. If the Appropriations Committee reports its bills before the reconciliation is complete. then reconciliation of the authorizations is a fruitless exercise. The point is that reconciliation of authorizations is a senseless practice. Spending for programs before the funding is first authorized and then appropriated is controlled through the allocation process. Reconciliation of authorizations only complicates the matter. I would point out the specific language contained in this resolution. Reconciling authorizing legislation is not really real deficit reduction. These discretionary programs are best and most effectively controlled through the appropriation process. Let us look at it very specifically. The House Budget Committee resolution includes reconciliation instructions of $11.1 billion for fiscal year",

I do think that the Latta budget allows us to say to the Republican leadership. \"Youve come a long way. baby.\" If you drew a spectrum and put the House Democratic budget at one end and the Presidents budget at the other end. the Latta budget is a lol. closer to our budget than it is to the Presidents. I think that is an indication once again of where the American people are. But I think the Latta budget has some problems for those of us from many parts of the country. Let me talk about some urban concerns. The Latta budget cuts UDAG by 20 percent. UDAG is a program that has received wide support throughout this country because it is a program that is successful and it is a program that uses very little public money to leverage lots of private money. It terminates two new housing programs. the Rental Development Program and the 312 Program. and those programs are new kinds of housing programs that are different than the old section 8. They once again show that we can do things in Government with less money. but still do them. Those programs should not be terminated. Of course. revenue sharing is cut very severely in the Latta budget. Our budget eventually eliminates revenue sharing. but this Latta budget just pulls the rug out from under the localities which have had no chance to plan in terms of the cut in revenue sharing funds. Finally. in mass transit. the cuts there are deep. They are 20 percent. much greater than not only the large urban areas can take. but also very harmful to many of the smaller suburban and rural areas that depend particularly on operating subsidies to run their bus lines. So again. Mr. Chairman. I offer my compliments to the Members who have put together this budget. They have come quite close to us. but not close enough. and I urge its rejection by the Members.",

I hope that our friends In the other body are watching this debate or reading It so that they will understand when we show up with our budget that costofliving increases for Social Security recipients and civil servants Is not a conferenceable Issue. because It has not been limited here. and Is not likely to be. It Is something that Republicans and Democrats alike feel must stay. The reason the Latta budget will be defeated Is because it does not reflect the priorities of the American people. and I want to address myself to that one important priority of national defense. If there i one en9hrining principle of our Republican friends it is that you cannot solve a problem by throwing money at It. That Is what we have attempted to do In terms of national defense and national strength over the last 4 years. We have thrown money at it.

Let me talk just a moment about defense. We have seen through the years a need for a buildup in defense. For the past 5 years we have accomplished that. In this particular resolution that the Budget Committee has come out with we have provided only for 1986 that there is no additional increase. But for 1987 and 1988 there Is really a 7percent increase. We can adequately finance all of our defense needs with this budget resolution. We were very. very close in the committee with Republicans from the other side of the aisle to coming out with a bipartisan resolution. This Latta proposal undoes a lot of the things that the committee spent days and days and days trying to put together so that we would have adequate support on this floor from the various parts of the country. from the various philosophies. to get a meaningful resolution passed so that we could go to conference with the Senate. make the necessary adjustments there and begin on the road of reducing this terrible deficit that all of us face. This has been a tremendous job on behalf of the Budget Committee. I urge my colleagues to stick with the Budget Committees resolution because I truly believe that It is the best product that has come before this floor in many. many years.

I rise in support of the Latta budget with great thanks and appreciation to our ranking minority member for his efforts to put together a bipartisan budget in the committee. We were not successful at that. But I also thank our ranking minority member. the gentleman from Ohio for his unfailing commitment to making real structural reforms in the budget process. and to his commitment for a strong national defense. I think this budget continues to shift away from our previous policies of taxing and spending to a policy of less government. lower taxes. and greater individual freedom and opportunity. As I said yesterday. the day of reckonini. is here and there are no more easy choices to be made. We only face a lot of hard choices which we were sent here to make. But I think that living within our means at this time means that we are going to have to phase out and eliminate some programs whichi are worthwhile but which we simply can no longer afford. and some programs which have no place n the budget to begin with. The Latta budget takes this stand. Mr. Chairman. Iy eliminating 10 programs it makes real structural reforms and provides for a more efficient management of our Government resources and real outyear savings. The reductions made in these domestic outlays. however. are accompanied by fiscal restraint on the Department of Defense. which I agree should be made. .rat in a world of Nicaraguas. Afghanistans. and Polands. we have to realize that our defense needs are determined more by the Kremlin than they are by our own Pentagon. This budget. Mr. Chairman. is in the truest sense a compromise package and I feel strongly that we should support it. I understand many of the frustrations of my colleagues on this side of the aisle at the whole budgetary process. But I say to them that we simply cannot afford tc walk away from this budget because it does begin to make the changes that the American people want and need. It is a good start in reducing excess Federal spending and it does not attempt to get twothirds of the real savings from our national defense as the majority budget does.",

And it is very fortunate that we find ourselves in a situation where if everything goes as we hope it will. we have growth. we have unemployment staying about where it is. and we make $56 billion worth of cuts. and we still have a $180 billion deficit. and we are doing good. I would just like to respond to the gentlewoman from California who made the statement that we have continued to get budget waivers and pass bills here. I would remind the gentlewoman that any appropriation bills that we pass in this House has to have the signature of the President of the United States. so if we have exceeded and continue to spend. certainly the administration has been a part of this continued spending. I would just like to also mention one thing about defense. Now. I am a strong supporter of national defense. I ari chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee and I sit on the Defense Subcommittee. and I take a back seat to nobody in supporting the security of this Nation of ours. But just a few weeks ago we had the services coming in. testifying about the dire needs that they have in the quality of life and the homes and all of the things that we need to do.

It was clearly our intent from the outset to address this matter through legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this chance to rise today in support of the amendment to the urgent supplemental appropriation bill offered by Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI. This amendment would continue the exclusion of captialrelated costs from the prospective payment system for 1 additional year. The purpose of the amendment is to prohibit the Secretary from implementing regulations which would incorporate such costs into the PPS system. In a letter to all Members yesterday. Secretary Bowen of HHS indicated the administrations strong opposition to this amendment. He alleges that it will cost Medicare over $10 billion in the next 5 years if the Congress passes this amendment. Respectfully. this is not true. The committee fully intends. as Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI has indicated. to report legislation on this issue at the earliest possible date. This legislation. while treating hospitals equitably. will close the openended situation referred to by Secretary Bowen and will result in savings as necessary. The congressional provision adopted by the Congress. will however. be equitable and not have the devastating effect on hospitals as would the administrations proposal. The action taken by the administration clearly circumvents the intent of Congress that changes in capital reimbursement be accomplished through legislation. not regulation. The Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Ways and Means intends to develop a proposal which would incorporate capital into the PPS system. As a part of that process. we held public hearings on February 24. 1986. on proposals on how capital could be included into the PPS system. During the hearings we also heard from several hospitals what the impact of the administrations proposal would have on their institution. The impact was disasterous.",

I have been chastised by them so often when we offer an amendment that affects their committee. that I am glad they are using our Appropriations Committee to do this at this time. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment to provide a 1year moratorium before bringing hospital capital cost reimbursement under the Medicare prospective payment system. According to hospitals in my State. there are very serious problems with the reimbursement formula currently being prepared by HCFA for release next month. As I understand it. the consequences of the HCFA proposal. according to HCFAs own figures. would result by 1991 in hospitals being reimbursed for less than half of their expected capital costs. This could mean that hospitals would find it difficult to meet the tab on their current facilities. let alone making any further improvements. And since the driving force behind the HCFA proposal appears to be the need to obtain the savings proposed in the Presidents fiscal year 1987 budget. much higher than Congress is likely to adopt. a delay would have two benefits: First. it would give Congress the opportunity to decide upon the 1987 budget target for any savings in this area. and second. it would provide encouragement for all interested parties to sit down and work out an arrangement more likely to be accepted by all parties. with less disastrous consequences over time.",

I particularly recognize the imperative need to take action on the hospital capital cost issue. When Congress enacted the Medicare prospective payment system [PPS] in 1983. we deferred action on incorporating hospital capitalrelated costs into this system until October 1986. The final goal of incorporating these costs into PPS is containing their rate of growth and creating incentives for costeffective capital expenditures by hospitals. I want to point out to my colleagues that when we made this decision to purposely exclude capital from inclusion in PPS. we directed the Department of Health and Human Services to study the capital issue and report back to Congress by October 1. 1984. Finally. under the auspices of a fiscal 1987 budget request. Congress learned of the administrations plan for treatment of the capital issue. Further. as indicated in their testimony before the Health Subcommittee on February 24. the Department of Health and Human Services intends to implement their capitalcost plan through the regulation process. effective October 1. 1986. It is to this process that I strongly object. For that reason. I wholeheartedly endorse the Rostenkowski amendment. which will block implementation of these regulations and retain the current reimbursement schedule through",

In other words. I understand the motivation and I understand the sincerity with which the 500 quota is offered. I simply do not think that it will work. I do not think that we have laid the foundation that we as legislators need to lay before we attempt such a thing.

Fact No. 4. the morale in the control towers and at the control centers is bad not because some air traffic controllers have been rehired on technical grounds. but because not enough have been hired because they are overworked. The very conditions that led to the strike in 1981: Overwork. long hours. exhaustion. are back in the control towers today. and if we need to alleviate that however it is. it is much more important to do that than to continue this grudge match between Patco and the administration. I think it is very clear that this amendment is in good sense. We all know that they will not be hired unless we mandate it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate having these 2 minutes. I think it is most unfortunate that after 5 years we are revisiting this question and opening up some old wounds that had perhaps started to heal. I have really no friend in this House whom I would consider a better friend than the gentleman from New York . However. one of the things that we have learned is that when we disagree. we can disagree peacefully. we can disagree as friends. and we can disagree as violently and strongly as possible and then leave this floor as friends. In this situation the gentleman from New York is wrong. There is no doubt that these workers went on strike. and they went on strike in violation of Federal law. They took an oath that they would not strike. They did strike. They were asked to come back. They were given the opportunity to come back. and they chose not to come back. At that point the President did. I believe. what he could only do honorably in the discharge of his duty. and that was to enforce the law and replace them. in doing so. to rebuild the traffic control system for this country. We have come a long way since 1981. We know that by 1987 the goal of having 15.000 comtrollers in this country will be reached. And we have done this without compromising the safety of air travel for the traveling public. I think this is a great tribute not only to the administration but to the new traffic controllers that have been hired. And we must also thank those who remained on the job. those who did not turn their backs on the American traveling public and remained on the job all these years. Yes. they have been harassed. They have been harassed greatly. I do not think there is any question but that to mandate the rehiring of these traffic controllers would create tremendous problems in the tower. and that would probably be more to the detriment of the safety of the American traveling public than anything else we could do at this point. Mr. Chairman. under the bill that we are considering it is quite permissible for the Secretary to rehire these people. but we must not mandate the rehiring of those who broke the law.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the issue is not what happened in August 1981. The issue. in all dead seriousness. is the safety of the Nations air traffic control system. That system has gained less than 300 controllers systemwide since September 30. 1985. At current rates it will take 4 years to reach the full performance level staffing standards at en route centers. According to the projections by the GAO. FAA will fall short of the work force staffing goal of 14.480 this fiscal year and likely will fall short of next years goal of 15.000 air traffic controllers. The rate of controller retirement continues to be greater than FAA has anticipated. and that is a further threat to the system. FAA programs to manage the system. such as flow control and the Cross Option Program. have for the most part fallen by the wayside because of insufficient funds and insufficient staffing. Contracting out of controller training and data systems specialists may not be cost effective and will move very few controllers back to the boards. The system has increased the flow of air traffic by 20 percent overall since 1981. and it is even more in certain of the congested air traffic centers throughout the United States. A number of important systems have experienced slippage. The NEXRAD evaluation system has slipped 3 months. FAA has not yet settled on specifications for the Doppler weather radar system. They are way behind in installing Doppler weather radar systems. There were 420 operational errors reported to airport air traffic control towers in 1985. Mr. Chairman. all of these reports are indications that we need more people. This amendment will put more people to work in that system.",

Each one of us is a great advocate for the specific needs of a particular program that we feel is Important to our State or to our constituency or to the country as a whole that are deeply involved in. But It is important to focus again on what is not being done here. There is no cut here in these services. There is no cut in the amount of money. There is an increase to take care of the cost of living. There is no cut with respect to the entitlement portion of refugee assistance which is allowed to grow in accordance with the budget resolution to deal with demographic changes and costofliving increases. These are discretionary programs. They could be much larger as could domestic discretionary programs to respond to the needs of our poorest citizens who are not refugees. Let us not be misled. poor people of this country are located disproportionately in urban America for reasons that relate to Federal policies as much as refugees are in different parts of this country as a result of Federal policies. It is not just refugees whose burden falls disproportionately around the country. We are facing here a situation in which we have to make a tough choice about whether discretionary programs will increase. The June 1. 1.985 discretionary programs will increase under this amendment. They will increase by the cost of living. That is the same kind of treatment we are going to give discretionary pro. grams for lowincome Americans of other kinds that are not refugees.

This program was adopted by the Congress many years ago because those who studied the problem of inner city dissolution and abandonment became aware that one of the things that was contributing to innercity abandonment was the fact that businesses and homeowners could not get crime insurance. So the businesses would close down as they could not get credit lacking the proper insurance coverage. and you would have the problem of urban decay and abandon. ment. Following that problem. of course. you would have to call on the Federal Government for more money. in those days. urban renewal money. more recently.

In fact. we have made provisions in which we allow crime insurance to exist within States. We have an alternative. The HUDIndependent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1966 has provided for a onetime payment to any State that certifies that it will develop an alternative mechanism to provide crime insurance to all policyholders in that State. So far seven States have taken advantage of the opportunity. and several others are expressing interest. The fact is that this Federal program is not national in scope. Only 36.000 policies are in force nationwide. and approximately 60 percent of those policies are in only one State. The next largest State to that largest State has only 6 percent of the policies. and that State has withdrawn from the program.

Most of us have received a number of comments from constituents relative to the impact of the auto recordkeeping rules that were enacted in the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act. Needless to say. those comments were not of a positive nature. It was apparent early that the 1984 act provisions. especially as interpreted by the Treasury. imposed burdens that were not contemplated when the legislation was originally enacted. Recognizing these problems. the Committee on Ways and Means. under Chairman RosTENKowSKIS leadership. drafted a modification of those rules which was overwhelmingly passed by the House as H.R. 1829 several weeks ago. The Senate soon followed suit with a bill which had certain differences from the Housepassed bill. including a very costly revenue provision. The conference last week worked out the differences between those two bills In a manner which I think equitably addresses the legitimate complaints with the 1984 act while not resulting in an undesirable revenue loss. Chairman RosTKOwsKxi has aptly and accurately described the contents of the conference agreement. I will not repeat them.

I have heard from hundreds of my constituents who tell me that the recordkeeping process which went into effect in January is a paperwork nightmare. A return to previous recordkeeping requirements coupled with information to be provided on individual tax returns is a much better approach and one which I think will ensure that taxpayers take only those deductions which the law allows. I thank the conferees for recognizing the negative revenue effects of the Senate bill and for agreeing that the legislation not increase the deficit.

Few times in my 23 years in Congress have I witnessed the types of complaints and concerns generated by this requirement.

This wide range of individuals who use automobiles for business. includes sales people. fleet owners. large companies. small businesses. realtors. and the farm community. This recordkeeping section of the Tax Code came about due to a misinterpretation of congressional intent by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS interpretation of this code was estimated by the National Federation of Independent Business to cost the consumer $7 billion this coming year to comply with the regulation. This cost. through lost time and effort. was posed against a potential revenue gain of less than $100 million.

I am very pleased that the House of Representatives gave final approval to H.R. 1869. legislation which repeals the contemporaneous recordkeeping requirements for business use of automobiles imposed last year. The regulations issued by the Treasury Department were overly burdensome. particularly on the small business community. Thousands of contractors. salespersons and others using vehicles in their business would have spent countless hours to comply with the paperwork mandate. I was pleased to cosponsor H.R. 1869. which lifts this burden. and I am delighted that this matter has finally been resolved. While this may have been an area of past taxpayer abuse. I think the remedy should not impose onerous requirements on honest business men and women. I believe the conference agreement provides a workable system for substantiation of these deductions. The conference agreement essentially goes back to prior law requiring taxpayers to substantiate deductions by using adequate records or sufficient evidence corroborating their own statements concerning vehicle use. In addition. the conferees adopted language that includes specific questions on mileage and business use to be asked on tax returns. One of the questions is whether written evidence was maintained by the taxpayer.

I have been Inundated by mail from constituents opposed to the contemporaneous recordkeeping requirements that resulted from last years tax bill. A heavy flow of mail on Issues is not unusual for any of us but I was impressed by the depth of feeling on this particular matter. It became clear to me that. in trying to address a particular tax compliance problem. a remedy had been fashioned that was worse than that which it was trying to correct. The conference report before us today addresses that situation In a way that should restore common sense to this portion of the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service [IRS]. In addition. the conference report provides some much needed guidance to the IRS on the question of the tax treatment of the businessrelated commuting use of employer provided vehicles. I believe this guidance is necessary to ensure that employees who must take certain vehicles home as a condition of their employment do not have their income tax liability increased as a result. Mr. Speaker. the conference agreement on H.R. 1869 represents important legislation. In passing this measure. Congress demonstrates that it will repond to. and correct. the unintended consequences of prior actions. That is a reasonable position and represents an important message to all of our constituents.*",

I have refrained from examining the particulars of the gentlemans research in terms of his numbers as to how many States favor or oppose it. I will have to say that I disagree fundamentally with his characterization of half for and half against. The research that I have done and that we have done indicate about 2 to 1 for. But the thing that I think is most impressive is the sacrifice willing to be made by a number of States who perceive it to be a problem. For example. the State of Minnesota has indicated that although their polls close at 8 p.m. central standard time. they would be willing to accept a 9 p.m. closing time. in the interest of uniform poll closing. The State of New Jersey. which now closes at 8 p.m.. said they would be willing to take a later time. The State of Nebraska said. certainly. to solve the problem. a later time. North Dakota. yes. to solve a problem. a later time. Tennessee. yes. they would go to 10 oclock eastern standard time. Rhode Island. which currently closes at 9. said they would be willing to go to 10 oclock to try to solve the problem. So it just is not a west coast problem. It is a problem that is perceived as a problem across the Nation. I would tell the gentleman that if he would examine all of the hearings we have had. they constitute a study. and I personally do not think we ought to give the job of making this decision involved with the election of Federal officers. as outlined in the Constitution. to the executive branch. I think it logically is reposed here.

I rise in support of H.R. 2466 for its administrative improvements and in particular for an amendment contained in the bill which I introduced earlier this year to clarify a critical provision of law regarding Coast Guard drug enforcement procedure. In April of this year. I. along with the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime. introduced H.R. 2132. legislation to clarify the intent of 21 USC 955 as regards the definition of an \"arrangement\" and return jurisdiction to the United States to intercede foreign drug ships on the high seas. I wish to commend my friend from New Jersey. the Crime Subcommittee chairman for promptly convening hearings on the bill and providing us the opportunity to learn more about problems facing the Coast Guard in the drug enforcement area. I also wish to commend the Coast Guard staff for providing excellent technical assistance to us on this issue and on this bill. Mr. Speaker. this legislation was drafted in response to frustrations experienced by our U.S. attorneys in their efforts to convict foreign drug ships. A loophole was created in our jurisdictional statutes by criminal defense lawyers which worked to preclude our prosecutors from obtaining jurisdiction to convict drug smugglers. U.S. law was intended to reach foreign drug runners in international waters and this amendment simply clarifies the intent of the law as it is written. I wish to thank the U.S. attorneys office for their help in defining this problem and I especially thank the U.S. attorneys office in Miami. FL. for providing background information and direction. Lastly. I thank my friend from Florida. the fine gentleman from the other body. for his efforts in attaching our bill as an amendment to H.F. 2466 and once again helping this country close the gap between the drug smugglers edge and our law enforcement efforts. Our courts have been active in this area. Mr. Speaker. and I am pleased that we have this opportunity through legislation. to clarify this particular issue.

Elected as a Republican in a traditionally Democratic district. Chenoweths overriding loyalty was to his constituency. Due primarily to his efforts. Colorado has become the home of Fort Carson. the North American Air Defense Command. and the United States Air Force Academy. Even today. few Members have enhanced the economy and image of their districts more than the Judge. But Chenoweths achievements in Congress are only the most noticeable in a life dedicated to community service. Nowhere is this more evident than his contribution to the Colorado Boys Ranch. The many hours the Judge spent toward the betterment of the States young citizens showed that his commitment to Colorado was not restricted to the time spent in these Halls. but was rather his lifelong ambition. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment. however. was the respect he earned from Members of the opposing party and the press. In fact. the Denver Post once described Chenoweth as \"a kindly and gracious man who probably hasnt a single real enemy.\" As my colleagues well know. this is quite a compliment for a Member of 22 years.

Congressman STRANG. for arranging for this opportunity to remember a special individual and dedicated public servant. Judge Chenoweth was indeed a special individual. He first became known as \"The Judge\" during his days as a country judge in Colorados Las Amimas County during the late 1930s and early 1940s. His friends and constituents continued to affectionately refer to him as Judge Chenoweth throughout his 22year Congressional career and beyond. The Denver Post. writing about Judge Chenoweth 20 years ago. said he was \"a kindly and gracious man who probably hasnt a single real enemy.\" The citizens of Pueblo. Colorado Springs and the other communities in the old Third District. I believe. were fortunate to have known Judge Chenoweth. And he was indeed a dedicated public servant. The Coloradans with whom I have talked remember Judge Chenoweth most for the great care and attention he gave to his district. The Honorable Frank Evans. who succeeded Judge Chenoweth in Congress in 1965. recalls. \"He serviced his constituency with his whole heart.\" Judge Chenoweth was an ardent and effective advocate for a number of water projects in Colorado. including the FryingpanArkansas project. As a freshman Member of Congress he convinced the U.S. Army to convert thenCamp Carson into the permanent installation. Fort Carson. a role for which he was later to receive the Armys Patriotic Service award. By the time his work was done. Judge Chenoweth was instrumental in also bringing to Colorado the Air Force Academy and Air Defense Command. Right up to his last days. Judge Chenoweth remained very active and involved. At age 88. he continued to practice law in Trinidad and continued to serve the public that he so loved. His most recent activities included serving on the Judicial Nominating Committee at the request of the Governor. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to Judge Chenoweths wife. Ruth Chenoweth. and his five children. 10 grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren. All of Colorado shares in their mourning. Yet we also share in their warm memories of a man who generously gave to othersform his heartboth during a long career in public office and in his private life.

If we fail to act promptly. hundreds of thousands of longterm unemployed. currently receiving FSC. will feel the dire consequences. and so too will those who soon exhaust their regular unemployment benefits and then have no alternative but to go on welfare. I agree with the administration. and I am sure with every Member of this body. that the lasting solution to our unemployment problem is sustained economic growth and a healthy private sector. But. as we work toward this goal. we must not forget those who have already fallen victim to economic dislocation. With millions of Americans still out of work. and many no longer eligible for any form of unemployment insurance. we must not abandon those who want to work. but cannot. due to circumstances largely beyond their control. While Marylands unemployment rate remains below the national average. thousands of Marylanders are still Joble3s. and many have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits. Further. many of these jobless workers. particularly those laid off from manufacturing jobs. are unemployed far longer than in the past. and many will have to be retrained for other occupations because their former jobs are gone forever.

The welfare rolls in Maryland are already swollen by those who have exhausted all unemployment benefits. It is up to the U.S. Congress to address this deplorable situation by helping the longterm unemployed in their struggle to get back on their feet. If the situation were not so serious. perhaps we could appreciate the irony inherent in the compelling need for the continuation of this program. Here we are trying to rescue the third tier of our unemployment insurance system when the second tier. the Extended Benefits [EB] Program. is all but dead. Only 3 of the 52 States and other jurisdictions are currently eligible for EB. while at least 16 States have unemployment rates above the national average. The effectiveness of the EB Program was drastically reduced by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 by altering the criteria for triggering EB. The inequities of our unemployment insurance system have been well documented by Senators on both sides of the aisle. and it clearly needs a major overhaul. In light of this. extending the FSC Program for 6 months makes good sense. it gives us time to devise a permanent replacement for the complicated and fragmented unemployment insurance system we now have in place.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there has been extensive news coverage given to a recent publication by the Alan Guttmacher Institue comparing the teenage pregnancy rate in the United States with that of several Western European nations. The report has prompted much breast beating over the alleged \"fact\" that the United States has not followed the example of the European nations in pushing \"contraception saturation\" as the best means of reducing teenage pregnancy rates. Many people seem to have forgotten that. during the last 15 years. we have spent billions of dollars to provide subsidized contraceptives to adolescents and adults. On March 20. 1985. Cal Thomas. In his nationally syndicated column. provided an appropriate and needed response to the people who push the shortsighted contraceptive approach to dealing with the problems that adolescents face in our society. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD immediately following my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on January 29. 1985. Albert Shanker. president of the American Federation of Teachers. addressed an audience of educators. teachers. and business leaders at the National Press Club on the importance of making certain that only the best qualified to teach enter the classrooms of this Nation. In his thoughtprovoking statement. Dr. Shanker said that if we are ever going to improve the quality of instruction and really make reform possible in education. State and local school systems must initiate measures to insure that new teachers are qualified for the awesome task of teaching our youth. What Al Shanker suggested on that occasion was that there be a nationally devisednonfederally designedtest for new teachers. A test imposed by the teaching profession itself that would insure that a teacher of mathematics. for example. had sufficient command of the subject to teach it to students before entering the classroom and also knew something about how to teach. There is nothing particularly new in the notion of national board competency examinations. All physicians subscribe to them in order to be certified in their specialty. All my friend. Al Shanker is suggesting. is that if the teaching profession really wants to stake a claim on being classified as a profession. let teachers be subjected to the same competency requirements by their peers that other professions accept as routine. Teachers ought to be willing to police themselves. independent of government. as other professions do such as doctors and lawyers. Mr. President. because the remarks that Al Shanker made to the audience at the Press Club on January 29. 1985 make just good common sense. and since the question of teacher competence is under discussion in many areas of our country. his views should have the broadest national coverage. For that reason. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the dialog between Dr. Shanker and the attendees at the Press Club on January 29. 1985. be printed in the RECORD. including the question and answer discussion which followed his remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. what I think I see emerging hereand this is without any disrespect toward the distinguished majority whip or any other Senatorwhat I think I see here is a pattern whereby a unanimousconsent agreement will be offered with respect to a given measure with the knowledge beforehand that there will be objections. Now. this happened in the case of the African famine relief bill a few days ago. So I guess this is a game that can played by both sides. I had indicated to the leadership on the other side that there would be objections to taking up the war risk insurance bill under an order that would exclude amendments thereto. We are on this side attempting to work out a unanimousconsent agreement dealing with the Export Administration Act which would allow that measure to be called up under a time limitation and with no amendments in order. In the case of the war risk insurance measure. however. which is involved in the pending unanimousconsent request. I am advised that it had been indicated to Senators on this side of the aisle that that bill would be called up. that it would be a vehicle to which Members on this side of the aisle and Members on the other side of the aisle could offer amendments. With that understanding in mind. the leadership on this side of the aisle had certainly hoped to clear the extension on the Export Administration Act. So here we are. Some had hoped. on this side of the aisle. that S. 413. the war risk insurance bill. would be an appropriate vehicle for amendments and that it would be called up at some point so that Senators could offer their amendment thereto. So I would hope that the leadership on the other side would not press for an agreement on S. 413 at this time which would rule out all amendments. That is our problem. We need a vehicle to which we can offer the extension of the Federal Supplemental Compensation Act. and perhaps other amendments. I say this with apologies to the distinguished majority whip. but the presentation of this consent agreement does not comport with the understanding that we think we had with the leadership on the other side of the aisle. So if the distinguished Senator could refrain from presenting this request. it would be very much appreciated.",

And every time we attempt to move on. even with something with this importand this is very important. as are all of the things we do here. This is ordinarily a simple unanimousconsent agreement. But we cannot move unanimousconsent agreements here because appended to them are extraordinary amendments. most of them nongermane. So if there is going to be adventurism from this side. it certainly matches what is coming from the other side with regard to amendments to Issues which are ordinarily passed here by unanimous consent. The chairman of the Finance Committee. Senator PACKWOOD. and I have since found that those of the other faith in the House of Representatives will reject any extension of Federal supplemental unemployment compensation benefits. That is what we are advised. Therefore. the chairman of the committee obviously will regroup and do something else. But at this point.

I introduced this bill as a specific response to the findings of a Subcommittee on the Handicapped investigation into conditions in institutions for mentally disabled persons. This investigation and 3 days of hearings documented the tragic fact that the institutionalized mentally disabled citizens of our Nation are often the victims of serious abuse and neglect. The legislation before us today will go a long way toward alleviating the intolerable situations in which too many of our mentally disabled citizens find themselves. The bill provides for the establishment of a protection and advocacy system for the mentally ill in each State. similar to the protection and advocacy system already established for our developmentally disabled citizens. It will thus afford mentally ill persons access to a system which will assist them in securing their rights which are guaranteed under Federal and State statutes and the U.S. Constitution. The bill also enumerates a bill of rights for the mentally illrights which currently exist as title V of the Mental Health Systems Act. This bill before us today is a bill which was developed after hours of negotiating between Senators and their staffs of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. I would particularly like to thank Senator ORRIN HATCH. chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. for his assistance and support in developing the compromise bill. which is so critical for our Nations mentally ill citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. and thus send a message to the Nation that Congress will not tolerate the abuse and neglect of the most vulnerable citizens of our country.",

S. 974. the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Persons Act of 1985. provides members of our society who are mentally ill a stronger voice in ensuring their protection against possible abuse. S. 974. the Protection and Advocacy of Mentally Ill Persons Act. provides for the expansion of the existing Developmentally Disabled Protection and Advocacy Councils within each State to provide assistance to mentally ill persons. It has authorization of $10 million for fiscal year 1986. $10.5 million for fiscal year 1987 and $11.75 million for fiscal year 1988. All In all. this legislation will go a long way in protecting those citizens of our country who. like each of us. is entitled to freedom from abuse and neglect. This legislation. unanimously approved by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on July 10. 1985. was spearheaded by Senator LowL WzicKzR. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped. Senator Wzrcxr has highlighted through this legislation the need for further protections against abuse and neglect for the mentally ill who reside in residential facilities. The version of S. 974 approved by the committee and before the Senate today represents a compromise which retains the strong protections for the mentally ill patients who are victims of abuse while it ensures that appropriate steps will be taken to resolve expeditiously possible problems of abuse. I appreciate Senator WZICKaiS willingness to work with me and other colleagues on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in addressing concerns about the language of the original bill. Without reservation. I urge my colleagues to approve S. 974 and the accompaning budget waiver as reported from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.

Perhaps I could clarify the current state of the law and the effect of S. 49. Although not stated explicitly in current law. regulations promulgated by BATF have established that a dealer may not conduct business at any location other than that stated on his license. 18 U.S.C. 923(d)(1)(E). Rev. Rul. 59. 19691 C.B. 360. This prevents a licensed dealer from doing business at a gun show. On the other hand. nonlicensees. who are not engaged in the business of dealing in firearms. may sell firearms at such shows. This is unfair to federally licensed dealers. S. 49 remedies this by allowing dealers to conduct business temporarily at locations other than that mentioned on their license. As long as it is in the same State and the Secretary has promulgated regulations governing the practice. S. 49. however. does not allow indiscriminate sales at temporary locations. In the first place. the licensee must still keep all records and conduct business Just as if he were at his normal business location. Moreover. S. 49 states explicitly that \"nothing in this subsection shall authorize any licensee to conduct business in or from any motorized or towed vehicle.\" No dealer may sell out of the back of a pickup truck. This amendment will codify the current regulations of the Secretary of Treasury which further restrict these temporary locations. Under those regulations and this amendment. the temporary location must be \"an event sponsored by any national. State. or local organization devoted to the lawful uses of firearms.\" In other words. these must be responsible. legitimate. organized gun shows where an agent of the Federal Government may easily visit and Inspect to ensure that all sales are conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 1968 act. This amendment will ensure these \"temporary locations\" are reputable gun shows and that Federal licensees may conduct business at these shows on the same basis as nonlicencees except as specified by this act.",

Mr. President. the amendment is not without some problem for some people because they would like to see the opportunity for the entrepreneurs to enter into this kind of awayfrompremises dealings. I think it is important for us to look at this language and try to remember the BATF will have the opportunity under this language to define what a gun show is. My only reason for rising at this time is to indicate that a group of dealers that used the format of a gun show. so long as it was a genuine gun show and not just the extension of a sales effort away from a licensed premises. would be permitted under this provision. It would not. however. allow an individual dealer just to go out and establish a place of business under the guise of a gun show. I think it would have to be a legitimate. honest. entrepreneurial effort Joined in by several dealers who were banding together in a common effort that could be aptly described as a gun show in order for this provision to be applicable to them. I support the effort to allow the licensed dealer to make such sales at such a show. Therefore. I support the amendment. But I did want to get on the record. at least. that BATF in writing regulations should not so narrowly construe this as to rule out of the definition the opportunity for legitimate dealers to band together in a larger showing. even though some people might think that is simply an entrepreneurial act.",

I believe that the current law is broad enough to allow the prosecution of such people who are evading the current provision of law. but certainly. this amendment strikes at the real abuse by prohibiting the importation of those portions of handguns which are crucial to the ban in importation of handguns.

Mr. Davis has served the people of my district in various capacities with the Social Security Administration. John began his career as a claims representative interviewing applicants and informing people of their eligibility for Social Security benefits. John has been the branch manager for the Norwalk office since 1982 after working as a field representative and supervisor. It is as the Norwalk branch manager that I have had the honor to know John. He has personally assisted me in resolving problems people in my district have encountered with the Social Security Administration.

He has been invaluable to me and members of my staff in straightening out complicated problems.

I would just say that I do not really much care whether this particular amendment is adopted or not. but I would say if we are going to do it to this amendment. to this agency. that you are going to have to do it to the Department of Agriculture and to every other department of Government. and it should be applied to every congressional staff person who has any degree of responsibility whatsoever.

We are getting into the management itself of the program here in the Congress. In another amendment that will be offered we will give flexibility to the program director that as promise is shown in the various areas of research and development they can go where promise is shown and stop spending money where they are not getting the results that are anticipated. We are faced in this amendment with worse than no growth. What we would do would be to abrogate existing contracts. we would have not only no growth but the effect of this would be to wreck the entire program. So 1.4 is entirely unrealistic. Our committee. the Research and Development Subcommittee. came up with what we thought was a reasoned approach. reasonable. that the Members of this body will be able to vote on in just a moment. which is $2.5 billion. which is a reasonable approach that would allow them at last years level to proceed on this year with no new starts.

I want to make one other point. along with the oustanding rationale that the gentleman from New Jersey has provided. in support of the fully funded SDI for 1986. The other point is this: We have seen. since the ABM Treaty and SALT I and indeed the unratified SALT II. a massive buildup by the Soviet Union in socalled peacetime to develop a strategic firststrike capability. the likes of which is really unprecedented. As the President has reported to Congress. they have violated the ABM Treaty. and are on the verge of a breakout potential. They have violated SALT I and SALT II. through the development of two new ICBMswhich the treaty only permits one---the deployment of the SS16. encryption of telemetry. and in numerous other respects. It seems to me imperative that we fully support the one program that will not only force the Soviets to the tableand I think many Members on both sides of the aisle agree with that statementbut Indeed make them begin to respond with some degree to seriousness to the Presidents desire to reduce arms. It seems to me fully funding SDI is the quickest. most efficient. and most effective thing this Congress can do to convey our determination to reverse the adverse strategic trends and to negotiate from a position of strength. That will give us an opportunity to truly reach that point at which we can really begin to see nuclear weapons and nuclear wars become obsolete weapons and things of the past. Mr. Chairman. I have been a cosponsor and a major sponsor of this effort. and I appreciate the leadership that the gentleman from New Jersey has given us on this issue.

It is not a good idea. I think the funding includes every thing. It includes ideas and concepts that even the White House staff has recommended against. For example. over $100 million in this budget for midinfrared advanced chemical laser. Congress killed this program over 2 years ago. The Presidents own scientific advisers have said of this technology. \"We would be better off spending the money building nature trails in the national parks.\" I have six national parks in my district. Let me say that we have a responsibility within this body to meet our budget priorities. We have responsibilities as members of the Committee on Armed Services to come up with what we figure is a rational plan. This committee has come out with a $2.5 billion projection for SDI.

It is a dangerous amendment because of what it does besides reducing the level of funding for something less than we vitally need. It adds moneyand listen to this carefullyit adds money for medical research in the application of lasers. What is that program. on the medical use of lasers. doing in a Strategic Defense Initiative Research Program? I do not know. It adds money for the research and development of stopping bombers. What is that doing in a Strategic Defense Program which was designed to stop missiles. I do not know. The gentleman. in offering his amendment. says that it stops very important demonstration projects because they are in violation of the ABM Treaty. He cites title V of the ABM Treaty which prohibits the development. the testing. and the deployment of antiballistic missile components and systems that are sea based. air based. mobile land based. and space based. The problem is. what is the definition of development? The chief negotiator for the ABM Treaty said the definition in the treaty of the word \"development\" is as follows: The prohibitions on development contained in the ABM Treaty would start at that part of the development process where field testing is initiated on either a prototype or breadboard model. He goes on. saying: The Soviet Union agrees with that definition of development. So these demonstration projects in fact are not a violation of article 5 of the ABM Treaty. and therefore must go forward.",

Because in the past there has been disagreement with continued funding of these important programstargeted assistance. education assistance for children. and social servicesState and local authorities developed the technique of obligating funds before the end of the fiscal year. Currently. these obligated funds can be carried over into the succeeding fiscal year. In this fashion. State and local refugee assistance programs have been able to assure continued funding for vital refugee services. Mr. President. this issue was not addressed by our colleagues in the House. Furthermore. the Senate draft prohibits any forward funding through to the next fiscal year. For this reason. it appears that this issue will be a conferenceable item. However. herein lies my concern: because the present language expressly prohibits the traditional technique of forward funding. it is. therefore. necessary to strike it to allow for the continuation of appropriations for these vital services at the end of fiscal year",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the amendment I offer today is a simple one. It would provide communities that were early recipients of Housing Development Action Grants [HoDAGs] 1 additional year to begin construction on their projects. Current law requires that HoDAG projects begin within 2 years of notice of the award. If this requirement is not met. the recipient community will lose its grant money and thus. the additional rental property which the HoDAG Program was to make possible. Due to difficulties in interpreting and meeting the new HoDAG Program requirements. some localities have experienced delays in beginning work. which may cause them to miss the 24month deadline. In addition. because of the uncertain nature of taxexempt financing and other tax provisions which affect real estate investments. some communities have run into complications in structuring bond financing and ensuring the participation of private developers. Mr. President. when H.R. 1. the Housing Act of 1986. was considered on the floor of the House of Representatives recently. an amendment was adopted which would extend the start of construction deadline for all HoDAGs by 1 year. My amendment is similar in that it would allow any community that received notice of its HoDAG award prior to July 23. 1985. one additional year to get started. This would increase the likelihood that many muchneeded projects across our Nation will indeed become reality. I urge my colleagues to support the swift adoption of this important amendment.",

In response to the Senators other question. I would note that the Appropriations Committee has been presented with no evidence by the Corporation or anyone else regarding violations of the appropriations rider.

Bitburg also contains the remains of members of the Waffen SSpeople who were directly responsible for carrying out the Holocaust.

The President seems to think that by visiting the site of a concentration camp. he can somehow balance out his visit to Bitburg. But there is moral difference between killers and their victims. And if the President wants to honor what is best in the German people. then let him lay a wreath at the graves of those like the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer who gave their lives opposing the cancer of Naism.

I mean that you would have a vote up or down. whe:re there would be no amendment. and the majority leader has now asked this side to accommodate and consent to that process which we agrecd to last nightthat we would provide a vote on that. We agreed to it again today according to the conversation that I heard of the minority leader. We are ready to consent to do that again. But I think what we are saying is if we agree to that sort of extraordinary process which there is no amendment to. at some stage in the game we ought to be able to play. If we are to agree to that. but then the majority leader still through his power of recognition is going to obtain recognition. not for himself but I assume these are not amendments that the Senator is wishing to make to change the COLAs. or to take out REA. or to change the defense number. I assume the majority leader would not make those comments. but through his power of recognition he can keep the floor so that those may be made by people on his side. Again. we are asking. when do we get to participate? It is hard for us to consent Just to continue this extraordinary process so that we are shut out and never given an opportunity to offer an amendment.",

I will always remain grateful to Bill Brock for sharing with me his expertise. advice. indeed fascination with the subject of international trade. Like Bill Brock. I have devoted myself to an ongoing effort to convince my colleagues and the officials of this administration that international trade is the axis on which the worlds. and thus the United States economic world turns. Under Ambassador Brocks leadership the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has become. without a doubt. one of the most respected trade offices in the world. Personally. Bill Brock is viewed as being the lone credible. objective. and coherent representative of U.S. trade policy in an era when our own officials. much less those overseas. have difficulty separating trade facts from fiction. I must. in all honesty. say that it is with sincere regret that I watch Bill Brock depart the U.S. Trade Representatives Office for the Labor Department. However. there is little doubt that his negotiating skills and reputation for objectivity are sorely needed by that agency.

Given the fact that the President of the United States and the leadership of the House of Representativesprobably fairly stated. the leadership of the House of Representatives in both partieswere adamantly opposed to all four of those proposals. and most particularly to the last two. and due to the fact that we do have a divided Government in this Congress and in this administration. that effective alliance between the President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives makes it impossible to come to a perfect or even to a very good solution.

When the conferees. of the Senate and the House have reduced spending every way they responsibly could do it. and I assume they have done that. they should have been calling upon us to raise revenue to help further reduce the deficit. Mr. Paul Volcker. Chairman of the Federal Reserve. has said on occasion that we should cut spending all we can and then reduce that deficit by adding some revenue. I know the majority leader has suggested that. The minority leader has recommended that. Mr. CHILES has recommended that. I read by the reports that Mr. Doimo cr has recommended that. The President does not agree. But for us to stop at this point. by having reduced spending to the extent that the conferees have done and I assume the best of their ability to cut spending. it is my judgment that we should have been called upon to increase revenues to further reduce the deficit.

    "speech": "So if we hold target prices steady in those 2 outyears. we are assuming. regretfully. and possibly mistakenly. that the current level of target prices will be enough. But. nevertheless. the point I want to make is that we have been arguing for the past couple of days about a part of the farm bill on the target prices for crop years beyond this budget resolution. What we accepted in the committee on the motion of the distinguished majority leader. the Senator from Kansas. who understands the farm program and particularly the wheat program as well or better than anybody else on this floor. was to accept his motion to freeze target prices for at least the first 2 years. and by doing so. the full budget impact for target prices was addressed. Those of us who feel strongly that we cannot cut target prices in the next 2 fiscal years beyond that to anything less than that covered in this 3year span. I think. have probably made our case on behalf of agriculture producers and that is the least we can do in the farm bill. I hope that we will not be accused of following the wrong leadership and busting the budget when we take up the matter again. in September. because we have followed the majority leader in his proposal for the first 2 years of the bill and we believe we can do no less for the last 2 years of the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. with the conclusion of the Geneva summit. it is imperative that we not forget the plight of Soviet Jewry. While the recent decision to grant exit visas to several Soviet citizens who have spouses living in the United States is a positive development. the Soviet Government is showing no signs of flexibility on the issue of Jewish emigration. General Secretary Gorbachev has been recently quoted as saying that problems for Jews In the Soviet Union simply \"do not exist.\" The facts strongly indicate otherwise. Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union has fallen sharply from a high of 51.320 in 1979 to a low of 896 in 1984a decrease of nearly 98 percent during the past 5 years. Freedom of emigration is a basic human right guaranteed by a number of internationally accepted documents such as the Helsinki Final Act. Clearly. the Soviets are not living up to these agreements. The case of Lev Blitshtein is an example of Soviet intransigence. Mr. Blitshtein first applied to emigrate from the Soviet Union in June 1974. He was turned down In January 1975. and subsequently lost his job as a foreman at a meat processing plant in Moscow. Since then. he has repeatedly applied for an exit visa. but without success. No specific reason has been given for his denial. Mr. President. Lev Blitshtein is no threat to Soviet state security. He is simply a decent hardworking man who desperately wants to be reunited with his family. Unfortunately. the problem with exit visas Is but one form of harassment that Soviet Jews must endure daily. Soviet officials have broken up religious study circles and beaten and detained both teachers and students. During the last year. Hebrew teachers have been arrested and sentenced to prisons or labor camps. In addition. the Soviet news media disseminates antisemitic propaganda. belittling Jewish history and maligning Jewish activists. Mr. President. we must continue to speak out on the plight of Soviet Jewry. Improvement In emigration policy for Soviet Jews is a vital precondition for the establishment of better ties between the United States and the Soviet Union. The appalling legacy of antiSemitism in the Soviet Union must be ended once and for all. We cannot permit this injustice to be ig. nored.*",

The commissaries provide a source for military personnel to buy groceries and to buy related items. They do realize a savings and it is part of the contract when they come in. It is really one of the fringe benefits that they have for being in the service. All this is going to do is raise the price of tobacco products. It will only raise the price on this one particular product. It is going to result in an administrative nightmare. I just got to the floor and found out about this amendment a few minutes ago. I do not know if the Senator from Kentucky has discussed that issue.

I think the facts are very. very simple. I have offered an amendment very similar to this last year that was included in the committee report and then stripped out in the conference. We are dealing with a situation in which we are indirectly subsidizing and encouraging the members of the Armed Forces to smoke. It obviously constitutes a hazard to their health. By offering the sale of cigarettes at the military installations below their real cost. below the prevailing cost in the surrounding community. we are encouraging military personnel to do something that is hazardous to their own health. The recent study by the Department of Defense itself indicates that 54 percent of military personnel smoke cigarettes. while only 32 percent of the general public are smoking cigarettes. While subsidizing with one Government program the use of cigarettes. we then have to turn around with another Government program and pay .over $210 million a year to take care of the health problems. the direct health problems created in the military alone from the use of cigarettes. Mr. President. I recently received a letter from a retired Naval officer in Oklahoma who indicates to me that he was a heavy smoker and that he could afford to do so because of the low price of cigarettes at the Naval bases where he was stationed. He said: On the 16th of December I quit smoking the hard wayI suffered a minor heart attack and had quadruple bypass open heart surgery. His cardiologist and surgeon told him that the greatest single contributor to his problem was smoking. He goes on to say that he strongly supports the kind of action that has been proposed by Senator BINGAMAN and myself. I wish it had been taken a long time ago so that people in his circumstance would not have been indirectly encouraged to continue a habit hazardous to their own health by a subsidy. an indirect subsidy program of their own Government. I ask unanimous consent. Mr. Presi. dent. that the letter from Mr. C. Dennis Grady. from Oklahoma City. be printed in the REcoRD.",

I have visited with the Secretary of Defense and he has agreed that he and I will get together and discuss this general problem of putting the Coast Guard someplace. Right now. it technically comes under the Department of Transportation. That is wrong. I would like to see the Coast Guard become a recognized member of the uniformed forces. Mr. President. the Senator knows I have mixed emotions about this amendment. On the one hand. I have always supported the Coast Guard. On the other hand. I think everyone ought to be advised that we are about to reduce the defense budget request by nearly $30 billion. At the same time. we are proposing to fund the Coast Guard an additional $300 million when they should be funded by the Department of Transportation. We are funding a special operations force. unrequested funding for the Coast Gurad and reserve forces. a drug enforcement capability. all of which are noble and normally supportable efforts. However. funding was not requested by the administration. I do not think my colleagues were listening yesterday when Senator NuNN and I explained how many programs will be terminated if we must adhere to the outlay ceilings in the budget resolution. There is no doubt the Coast Guard is underfunded. But does it make sense to reduce active military and civilian personnel. reduce operations and maintenance and terminate programs in the defense budget. and then fund an admittedly good cause but one that should be included in the budget of the Department of Transportation? I will reluctantly agree to this amendment. but I would like some assurance that this will be funded in the Department of Transportation budget next year.",

The arguments raised against the amendment are really an absurdity. If one were to follow the reasoning laid down by the Senator from Maine. Congress would never do anything until a crisis had approached. The obligation of leadership is to try to make those laws that we pass work to the extent we intend them to. One of the extents to which we expect a Clean Water Act to work is that the States which wish to and have the competence to administer their own programs be permitted to do so. I understand that there is a position that would not have granted the States this authority at any time. There is also a position I have heard expressed here today that there is a general level of mistrust of these States. If that is the case. let us honestly take on the issue and say it. Absent that. can anyone explain to me why any citizen of the United States. corporate or individual. should have the obligation to deal with two levels of government at the same time for the same offense? That is the only purpose of this amendmentthat when an action has been undertaken. you do not suddenly find yourself engaged on two fronts. That is not the purpose of this Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Clean Water Act is clean water. not some sort of bureaucratic harassment. To say that it has not happened and a shred of evidence has not been offered. I can offer the Senate volumes of cases where it has happened in other administrative circumstances that the United States has on its books. We have now a Clean Water Act. with new penalties and a new set of circumstances. Are we to be told that as Senators we cannot look into the future and anticipate problems? Are we to be told. once again. that we are not competent to lead the country as we are being asked to do?

There are literally hundreds of actions which you. as an individual citizen. can take which would subject you to a prosecution under State law and under Federal law. They are all through the law books of this country. Dual prosecution. the jurisdiction of which is available to both Federal and States. exists in numerous examples. It is in the criminal law. If you rob a bank. you can be prosecuted by the State and the Federal Government. If you are engaged in any form of drug activity. you can be prosecuted by the State and the Federal Government. So on down an enormous list. This is nothing new. Generally. State and Federal authorities cooperate to avoid duplicate prosecution. That is what has happened here. There is not any problem. No evidence of a problem of any kind has been suggested. While the Senator suggests that it is leadership to anticipate problems and try to deal with them. it is also a form of leadership. I suggest. not to encumber the law books of this country with solutions to problems that do not exist. This is a problem that does not exist. There is absolutely no evidence of it. even though the dual authority has existed in law for some period of time. All we are talking about here is trying to solve a problem that does not exist. By striking out the last two lines. the Senator solved one problem and created another. One reason for this dual authority. frankly. is that there might be circumstances under which a State agency. confronted with a violation of the act by some significant entity within that State. would be reluctant to act or to act in a manner that was not the most vigorous. Under those circumstances. the authority to act at the national level is preserved. for good reason. It has not been abused. There is no evidence that it has even been used.

The amendment clarifies that oil and gas transmission pumping stations are included within that section of the bill for which permits would not be required. The term would apply to pumping and gas compressor stations for oil and gas transmission operations. For example. compressor stations are located at intervals along a pipeline and they are designed to pump natural gas through those underground pipelines. These facilities are maintained in a manner comparable to what you would find in most residential properties. These stations normally require about 5 acres. but in practice they will be buffered with 10 to 150 acres. Traditionally. they are buffered by grassland or timber.

    "speech": "I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding. First. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. the purpose of the bill H.R. 3781. which passed the House several weeks ago was to waive the 30day congressional review period required by section 6021(c)(1) of the District of Columbia SelfGovernment and Governmental Reorganization Act. euphemistically referred to as the Home Rule Act. for certain acts passed by the District of Columbia which authorized the issuance of revenue bonds. Further. I would say to my colleague. the District of Columbia acts authorizing the issuance. sale. and delivery of revenue bonds referred to are as follows: the Georgetown University Higher Education Facilities Revenue Bond Act of 1985. the George Washington University Revenue Bond Act of 1985. Sibley Memorial Hospital Revenue Bond Act of 1985. and finally. the Washington Hospital Center Corporation Revenue Bond Act of 1985. Those were the four issuances that passed the House of Representatives. The Senate amendment took out two of the bond issuances that passed the House that have now already become law as a result of time. They are specifically the George Washington University Revenue Bond Act of 1985. District of Columbia Act 676. and also the Washington Hospital Center Corporation Revenue Bond Act of 1985. District of Columbia Act 692. So those two were deleted. What the Senate included as their amendments were two additional issuances: George Washington University Bond Issuance. 1985. D.C. 6114. and American University Issuance DC6112. So to summarize. the House of Representatives asked to waive the 30day congressional review period for the purposes of the issuance of four bonds. two of them have now become law. What the Senate bill simply did was to strike the two that have already become law. leave the two that passed the House. and added the two that the gentleman just referred to. The recommendation of this side of the aisle is that we accept the Senate amendments and concur in the Senate amendments.",

The bill they sent to us today is a tenuous settlement which we understand is acceptable both to States with lowlevel waste disposal capacity. and to those States needing disposal capacity until new sites can be developed. It is tough on the States that have to develop this capacity over the next 7 years. but there is a consensus that we should settle this legislation and approve the compacts this year so that the regional groups can move forward to build their new management capability. We have agreed to accept the Senate proposal. with its substantially tougher milestones and tighter emergency exemption provision. Most significant. we have agreed to the Senates requirement that the States take title to lowlevel waste generated in their territory In 1996. We believe all States will have developed management ability by that time. Although States are also liable for damages consequential to taking title to the waste. we intend this a very narrow liability limited to situations in which State actions are directly involved. We believe the States will act responsibly to take care of lowlevel waste. and that waste obligations under the Atomic Energy Act.

I wish to congratulate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the tremendous job they have done In bringing this lowlevel waste bill to the House tonight in its present form. Mr. Speaker. I am very happy that we are today accepting the Senate amendment to the House lowlevel radioactive waste bill. I believe this is a strong bill and I compliment my colleagues on their willingness to adopt the Senate version of H.R. 1083. with one change in order to adopt lowlevel radioactive waste legislation this year. The Senate version Is based on the House version with a few changes. I believe my colleagues have handled a challenging situation quickly and well. and I want to thank them for all their efforts. This bill responds positively to the needs of the three States in which disposal facilities are located and encourages other States to develop sites. It provides the three sited States with the authority to impose surcharges on generators from States which have failed to meet the milestones for the development of new sites. It also provides for a rebate of 25 percent of the surcharges changed for each of the milestones met. Additionally. the bill provides emergency access to the existing three sites whenever necessary to address a threat to the public health and safety. Moreover. this bill limits the number of extensions to one. and conditions the emergency access upon a showing of diligence by the States who have failed to meet milestones. Finally. in the interest of reaching agreement this year on lowlevel radioactive waste legislation. the House has agreed to address the question of how mixed wastewaste which Is both hazardous and slightly radioactiveshould be regulated early next year.

Under current law. such a decision must be made at retirement and a second chance to choose is not permissible.

Many people have said that they were given incorrect or incomplete advice by the personnel retirement counselor in their employing agency. To address these concerns.

Mr. Speaker. all too often we forget the importance of the fishing industry here in the United States. The resolution I have introduced would merely ask the President to recognize the contribution of our Nations fishermen and the fishing industry. Fishing is a tradition deeply rooted in our history. Fishing provided our ancestors. the pioneers. and settlers of our country. with an immediate and steady food supply. These same resources allowed fishing to become a major ceremonial and sub. sistance activity of native American cul. tures. This fishing tradition lives on todayonly the fishing methods and tech. niques have changed. It is estimated that each year over 200.000 commercial fishermen ply the oceans in search of seafood to fill the plates of millions of Americans. It is also estimated that over 54 million Americans are sport fishing enthusiasts. It is often forgotten that in addition to being relaxing. sport fishing is an industry encompassing tackle manufacturers. boat and motor producers. and the service industries such as hotels and motels and bait shops. It is estimated that in 1985. the commercial and sport fishing Industries together will employ neiriy I million Americans and generate over $27 billion in economic activ. ity. Fishing also provides healthful. protein. rich food. In fact scientific research has recently shown that the consumption of fish can reduce the probability of heart disease. Perhaps this is one of many reasons why fishing will continue to grow as America grows. Our fishery resources are one of our Nations important renewable natural resources. Fishing promotes respect and value for these resources and the natural environment. The citizens of this country are committed to the longterm health of these resources as their sport and livelihood are dependent upon the resource itself. Whether the fishing is familyoriented outdoor recreation. or commercial fishing carried out on the highseas. the result is a healthier and stronger America. I urge my fellow Members to honor the fishing industry and fishing public of the United States by joining me as a sponsor of House Joint Resolution 433 calling for the President to proclaim June 28. 1986. as National Fishing Week.",

No one will even refer her to another clinic if she seems dissatisfied with the order they give. Perhaps AID also stands for the Agency of Informational Dictatorship. In this country. where the right to know all ones health options is so greatly prized. we cannot afford to promote a limitation of information abroad. No family planning agency should be allowed the dangerous exemption from informed consent. We must respect the right of the individual woman to make her own choice based on the personal. cultural. and medical needs which no one from the outside can impose. Mr. Speaker. today with my colleagues NANCY JOHNSON and OLYMPIA SNOWz. I am pleased to announce the Introduction of legislation that would restore the democracy of information to family planning policy abroad. Thanks to the leadership of Congresswoman JOHNSON. we may once again have an AID policy that allows for full Informed consent for all family planning groups in developing countries.",

I know this is the same message every Member of this body receives. and I am wondering Just how much longer some of my colleagues are going to ignore it. In Nebraska. for agriculture. the Federal budget deficit and the resulting overvalued dollar and continued high interest rates means our farm products cannot compete in the global market and our farmers must shoulder a backbreaking cost of servicing the farm debt. Rural America. along with much of the country. is hurting because of an annual Federal deficit that adds billions each year to the mounting public debt. Now finally. after months and months of empty rhetoric. we have the opportunity to do something about the pain. and I say lets get to it. The GrammRudman.Mack.Cheney deficit reduction plan may not yet be perfectedit means we in Congress will have to finally put together a realistic and responsible budgetit may mean some difficult spending cuts down the roadbut it is the only longrange. budgetcutting plan on the table. And it is time this House faces reality and listens to the cry from the taxpayers back home who are demanding a reasonable means of bringing Federal deficits under control and establishing a government we can pay for. I urge the conferees to bring GrammRudman out of conference. and I urge my colleagues to support it without any further delay.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday was a very important day regarding the military future of our Nation because the House Armed Services Committee reported out the Joint Chiefs of Staff Reorganization Act of It is the most significant change in military organization since the Department of Defense was created in 1947. Until now. the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has officially been only the spokesman of the corporate views of the four service Chiefs. As a result. the Chairman has been stuck with positions written by a committee. that is. the service Chiefs. that protects the institutional interests of each of the four services. The 1985 Joint Chiefs of Staff bill strengthens the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs by Boldface type indicates words inserted or appended. rather than spoken. by a Member of the House on the floor. making him the principal military adviser to the President and to the Secretary of Defense. As the only member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with no service responsibilities. unlike the four service Chiefs. the Chairman is uniquely positioned to speak for the broader military point of view. This change will undoubtedly strengthen his voice and help check the parochial interests of each of the four services. In addition. the Joint Staff will now work directly for the Chairman rather than for the Joint Chiefs as a whole. For a third of a century. the Joint Staff has not been working for a national or unified strategy but rather for three separate strategies. those of the Army. the Navy. and the Air Force. Giving the Chairman complete control of the Joint Staff will improve the joint multiservice perspective that has been lacking since 1947.",

The guerrillas. for their part. demand to share power with the Government before the conflict can be resolved. and until that occurs. they arm themselves through the help of the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua to fight the Duarte government with the apparent intention of bringing it down. President Duarte. in a speech to the National Assembly in El Salvador. blamed the Nicaraguans for being behind the kidnaping of his daughter. He said. Managua was the center of the operation. kidnaping. and this has to be denounced.

Now. as much as any time in our past. we need to promote individual savings. as well as savings on our public debt. To meet this object. my resolution calls on a tried and true resource. the U.S. savings bond program. which saves taxpayers over $2 billion a year in annual debt costs.

Another young mother and her 27dayold son also remain hospitalized as the result of smoke inhalation. When the fire department arrived. shortly after the fire began. they had a difficult time finding those trapped inside because of the thick black smoke and the way the fire spread so quickly throughout the structure. According to the Boston Fire Department. the exact cause of the fire has yet to be determined. Although they are listing the fire as suspicious in origin. they believe the fire was deliberately set. The No. 1 cause of property loss. due to fire. in the United States Is arson. Each year billions of dollars in property is lost. hundreds of people are either killed or Injured. Today. along with several dozen of my colleagues I am introducing a resolution to designate the week of May 4. 1986. as National Arson Awareness Week. This campaign was started by the National Association of Arson Investigators and has been endorsed by numerous fire and police organizations. Mr. Speaker. arson is a terrorist act which kills. National Arson Awareness Week will give an opportunity for fire. police. civic. housing. and community development people to inform the American people to this tragedy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when the House considered chemical weapons funding in the fiscal year 1986 Defense authorization bill. the House included language that prevented the production of chemical weapons until a number of conditions were met. One important one was that: The European member nations of NATO where such chemical weapons are to be stored or deployed are willing to accept storage and deployment of binary chemical munitions within their territories. The conference committee. as I predicted. struck this language and substituted meaningless \"consulting\" language. Thus. the authorization contained no \"fence\" on chemical weapons production. Last week. after a closed and classified markup. the full appropriations committee said \"no\" to chemical weapons funding. When the Defense appropriations bill is considered today. an amendment may be offered to restore the funds. The vote will be one to commit to $20 billion in funding for chemical weapons production with no \"fence\" around it. But even if a \"fence\" were to be resurrected. I would hope no one would be fooled into believing it would last. It would disappear Just like it did in the authorizing conference. An adequate chemical deterrent is needed and we have one: huge in number of projectiles. safe without question and forward deployed in West Germany where any Soviet attack would come. A commitment of $20 billion for new chemical weapons production is not needed. If you care anything about the huge deficits our country is carrying. please vote \"no.\"",

It was not more than 5 or 6 years ago that this body was lined up with daily speeches much like we heard on Nicaragua today down in this well suggesting that we ought not be doing anything in El Salvador that would support American policy there. That somehow we were to blame. and we ought to let nature take its course. and If that ended up causing a Communist overthrow of the El Salvadoran Government. well. that is the way the world is. We had those arguments out here. and we had to fight with everything we had in order to overcome that in order to give Duarte and his government a chance. Today I heard people down here talking about this miracle of democracy that is taking place in Central America. and including in that El Salvador as one of the success stories. They were some of the very people who fought the hardest on this floor to cut off all aid to El Salvador and continuesome of the religious left in this country continues to have documentation out calling Duarte a fascist. that we ought to withdrawn support from.

Democrats and Republicans alike. introduced legislation to promote competition in the natural gas market. to provide consumers and producers with access to transportation and to make available ample supplies of natural gas at the lowest reasonable price. This legislation. the Natural Gas Policy Act Amendments of 1986. has been submitted to the Congress by the Department of Energy. It is an excellent bill that would do much to improve our Nations energy security and would expand the use of a cleanburning and abundant domestic fuel. The Department of Energy estimates that if this bill were passed. natural gas prices would be lower by 10 to 20 cents per thousand cubic feet per year between 1987 and 1995. Allowing producers of gas from old fields to get market prices for that gas would result in the production of 30 to 34 trillion cubic feet over the next 40 years. This is equivalent to nearly 2 years of domestic natural gas consumption. Without legislation decontrolling old natural gas. this 2year supply of gas will never be produced. Passage of this bill will not be easy. It will take political courage to overcome the inertia. bogymen. and partisan politics that have blocked good natural gas legislation. The Secretary of Energy is serious about this legislation. The President is serious about natural gas decontrol. He said so in his State of the Union Address. The other body held a hearing on this bill and other natural gas legislation this week. I and those cosponsoring this legislation are serious about it and we plan to work for it.

NATO governments believe that abandoning the SALT II limits Would be more advantageous to the Soviets than to the United States. in terms of relative potential to add nuclear weapons systems and with regard to international political reactions. second. NATO governments still strongly favor continued U.S. compliance with SALT II and remain unconvinced that Soviet violations cited by the administration warrant suspending that compliance. They believe questionable Soviet practices should not be ignored. but the United States should continue compliance so long as western security is not prejudiced. third. NATO governments oppose adoption of grayarea noncompliance formulas. such as drydocking Poseidon submarines. instead of dismantling them. when new U.S. Trident boats begin sea trials. and. fourth. NATO governments are concerned that a U.S. move away from SALT II would sour the political climate for a summit meeting. and compound the damage to U.S. prestige before world opinion which the allies believe has been caused by the nuclear testing controversy. The United States has legitimate concerns over Soviet compliance with the provisions of existing arms control agreements. including the ABM Treaty. as well as limits of the unratified SALT II accords. I indicated in very clear terms to Mr. Gorbachev last September. when I led a Senate delegation to Moscow. that the U.S. Senate is very serious over compliance with the spirit. as well as the specific provisions. of arms control treaties. I agree completely with the statements in the BumpersLeahy letter to the President in this regard. that in \"order to maintain the integrity of those agreements and facilitate reaching a new agreement. the Soviets should be pressed to take positive steps to resolve our concerns.\" However. these concerns should not cause us to overlook the benefits to our overall national security of continuing the \"no undercut\" of SALT II policy in It is because of these benefits to our security that I support this continuation.

It is surprising and unsettling to note that in spite of reports of economic growth over the past 3 years. Marchs unemployment figure of 7.2 percent is precisely the same as that in June 1984. With the growth in the labor force over the past 2 years. the actual number of unemployed persons has risen by 200.000. In the last year alone. manufacturing employment has fallen by 130.000. Clearly. while the stock market traders may be getting rich. close to 8 million Americans still cannot find Jobs during this socalled economic expansion. In addition. another 1.1 million Americans are so discouraged about finding work that they have given up and dropped out of the labor force. Still another 5.5 million Americans are working part time because fulltime jobs are unavailable. Many of these people formerly were employed full time in highpaying jobs in our Nations factories. In other words. the poor performance of our Nations labor markets since June 1984 has left 15 million American workers deeply disappointed. Perhaps lower interest rates. cheaper oil. and a lower dollar will eventually result in an economic boom. but most labor market statistics have remained stuck at recession levels for close to 2 years.

The first article is an editorial that appeared in the April 6. 1986. edition of the Washington Post. It is titled \"SALT II: Renounce It.\" and was written by Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick. The editorial is a very thoughtful analysis of the reasons why the United States should discontinue adherence to SALT II. As Ambassador Kirkpatrick points out. the Soviets are violating previous strategic arms agreements with impunity. and failure to address these violations in any substantive way is a grave mistake on the part of the United States. Ambassador Kirkpatricks editorial recommends that the United States renounce compliance with SALT II. and I commend her editorial to the attention of all my colleagues. The second article appeared in the Officer magazine. which is a publication of the Reserve Officers Association of the United States. The article is entitled \"Latin Americas Democracies Need Us.\" and was written by the Honorable ROBERT K. DORNAN of California. Congressman DORNAN addresses the critics of U.S. Latin American policy who claim that democratic governments are not really emerging in Latin America. His analysis of the development of democracy in Latin America is very cogent and demonstrates that the growth of democracy in Latin America. although slow. is increasing. The third article appeared in the April 13. 1986. issue of Parade magazine and was written by Gen. William C. Westmoreland. former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and former commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. The title of the article is \"It Takes More Than Strength.\" In the article. General Westmoreland reflects on the meaning of liberty and the role of the officer and the citizen in a democracy. As he points out. liberty is not preserved by military strength alone. It is nurtured and protected by a responsible. duty conscious citizenry and the public will to bear the hardships that often accompany the protection of freedom.. Mr. President.

That was a piece of land bought by an innocent purchaser with no idea that there had ever been any disposal whatsoever historically on that site. What you have here Is people who have been dumping. they have been dumping into a site which leaks. that is a Superfund site. That somebody has to clean that site up. Now you will have every one of the dumpers coming In and alleged that they had nothing to do with the leak at all. You will spend hours and months and years of litigation that will prevent any sort of settlement. any sort of disposition of the problem other than under a very litigious situation. So I think what this amendment basically does is to disturb the parts of the bill that lead toward settlements and lead toward disposition other than in a litigative situation. I think what the gentlemans amendment does. it is offered in good faith. but what I think it does is encourage an incredible lawyers relief act in this country. It will encourage massive amounts of litigation for people to prove themself noncontributing in an almost impossible type of situation. I yield to the gentleman.",

Now. there is more to the amendment than that. The gentlemans amendment also deals with additional limitations on liability. I have been referring to additional defenses. On the additional limitations on liability. the amendment goes on to say this: In any case in which a person liable under subsection (a) establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that\"(1) at any site at which response costs are incurred as a result of the release or threat of release of any hazardous substances. the hazardous substance or substances with respect to which such person had any relationship described in such subsection is not physically mixed with hazardous substances with respect to which other persons had any such relationship.

In many instances the identity of the person who put the hazardous waste there cannot be identified by the character of the drums or the deposit because these sites now are old and the hazardouswaste containers have rusted and their identity is now lost.

I ought not be liable. and I ought not have to pay a share of the cost of cleanup.\" We remember that once the cleanup starts. you have hazardous waste that is leaking and you have hazardous waste that is not leaking. So you absolve this individual from his proper share of liability for the cleanup of the hazardous waste he has put there simply because he has established an affirmative defense that none of what he has put there is leaking. You have also absolved him of his joint and several liability under the statute. That. of course. creates an additional problem in terms of litigating out the cleaning of these sites. and it also makes additional difficulties for the cleanup and paying the cost of litigation. One of the things the bill before us is trying to do is to avoid the cost of litigation and to assure that the litigation goes forward. Now. I will observe to my good friend. the gentleman from Nebraska. that if a person has made a deposit of hazardous waste at a site that has been covered by deposits by a large number of persons or any number of persons. there is a mechanism elsewhere in the bill whereby the liability of the several parties can be adjudicated among themselves by action taken before the court once the matter is Joined. I am sure the amendment is offered in the best of good faith by the gentleman from Nebraska. but regrettably. it has the practical effect of allowing a person to simply cause himself to be absolved from the deposit of waste and cleanup simply by reason of the fact that the waste containers are not leaking on the site. They might present as much hazard as any leaking container a day. a week. a month. or a year hence. but they then do not have to be cleaned up and there is no liability that attaches to the depositor of those particular containers.",

When we start to chip away at that liability. we are chippng away at the whole program. It is the guts of the program.

I am very concerned about our rapidly growing trade deficit with Japan and the need to show the Japanese that we are going to take a tough stand on trade issues. We can no longer afford to let the Japanese drag their feet on trade liberalization. If Japan is not going to open its markets to United States or other nations products. then we will be forced to restrict imports from Japan. For decades. the Japanese have continued to impose trade restrictions on imports. We have been \"good guys\" in trade negotiations. while Japan has made relatively small concessions in trade liberalization. For example. last year Japan and the United States signed an agreement on beef imports into Japan. The slight concessions made by Japan on beef last year are nothing in comparison to our total trade deficit or the automobiles exported from Japan to the United States. The Japanese restrictions on imports also affect other nations trade with the United States. Underdeveloped and developing nations are restricted from exporting their products to Japan. As a result. in many cases they export those products to the United States because we are one of the few nations that has not erected protectionist barriers. Several years ago. I introduced trade reciprocity legislation which would require the United States to impose trade restrictions on Japanese imports equal to the restrictions imposed on U.S. exports to Japan. I believe if Japan does not take some major actions to open up their domestic markets to U.S. products. the Congress will take action to impose a surcharge or restrictions on Japanese exports to the United States.

In addition to that. the American auto companies are now pressing to get a waiver in connection with the fuel efficiency standards. a matter which the Energy Committee will address shortly. I believe that to get a waiver in connection with the fuel efficiency standards would be retrogressive. I do not think it would help us with energy consumption in this country. I do not think it will help the American automobile companies with respect to their sales or help save domestic auto jobs. I want to be certain that when they see this oveywhelming vote which I am sure will occur in connection with this subject. they not misinterpret it and not pay attention to the problems that American consumers and workers have with the American auto industry with respect to pricing. fuel efficiency standards. and keeping auto Jobs in this country.

    "speech": "Mr. President. Japans announcement yesterday that it would raise by 25 percent its annual auto imports to the United States to 2.3 million cars is not a concession. It is another black eye for the United States in the face of Japans $37 billion trade deficit with our country. Is this an example of the open hand of friendship that Japan professes to offer? Im fed up with talking across the table to the Japanese about its closed door policy. Like many of my colleagues here in the Senate. Im ready to meet the Japanese down at the docks to impose the same custom inspections. the same strict standards and certification processes that Japan imposes on U.S. imports. Export restraints by Japan are not an acceptable substitute for open markets in Japan. As a cosponsor of Senator DANFORTHs resolution. I urge President Reagan to take the toughest possible retaliatory measures against Japan unless it opens new markets to American goods. The real queslion before us today is not whether Congress is ready to take further action. but whether Japan can wake up and read the handwriting on the wall. This is not an issue limited to one particular market. however. What we are talking about are competitive products like telecommunications. wood and paper products. sophisticated electronics and medical equipment that Japan prevents from entering its markets on an equal basis. Time magazine recently reported that the Japanese ministry of posts and telecommunications. for example. could force American companies to disclose business plans. sales projections and even customer names before allowing U.S. firms to market their sophisticated telecommunications services in Japan. Despite their protests to the contrary. Japan remains committed to keeping its markets protected from foreign competition. It is time for action on the part of Congress and the President of the United States. The Japanese will not make changes until they realize we are seriously committed to changing the status quo. An open door trade policy does not mean trading with Japan through a crack in the door. Open door must mean a completely open door and free trade must mean fair trade. It is time for the United States to get tough on the trade issue. I. therefore. urge the immediate passage of Senate Concurrent Resolution 15.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 15. expressing the sense of Congress that the President respond to unfair trade practices of Japan. My colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee are to be commended for their initiative in taking this immediate action. which I believe will demonstrate to the Japanese and others that the United States is committed to bringing to an end the unfair trade practices which have resulted in record levels of imports flooding our domestic markets. For a long time. Mr. President. we have allowed foreign governments to pursuewith virtual impunityunfair trade practices aimed at fulfilling the threefold purposes of creating jobs for their workers. acquiring U.S. dollars. and achieving a more favorable balance of trade. all at the expense of American businesses and workers. The Japanese. as well as other nations. have been creative. innovative. and remarkably successful In these efforts. Last year. imports from Japan accounted for almost onethird of the entire United States record trade deficit. Mr. President. one reason we have such a trade imbalance with Japan is the extensive access we have granted them with respect to our domestic market. while they have consistently denied to us similar access to their markets for our manufactured goods. forest products. agricultural commodities. and certain services. Due to these unreasonable trade restrictions established by the Japanese. American exports to Japan have been held to very low levels. The effect of these and other unfair trade practices (on the part of Japan and other nations) have been devastating to many of our industries. In my home State of South Carolina. the textile/apparel industry has been crippled by massive increases to imports. In 1984 alone. textile imports increased by 35 percent over the previous year. Almost 50 percent of all textile/apparel goods sold in the United States today are imported. The 1984 imports of almost 10 billion square yards of textile/apparel goods represent 1 million lost job opportunities for American workers. Mr. President. we simply cannot allow the current trend to continue. I believe this resolution will send the strong message that we will no longer tolerate unfair trade practices.",

We are being told that the reason the Republican Members of the House voted for the Hamilton substitute yesterday was because of their sense of outrage at a procedure which would have tied one piece of legislation to another. That is the least plausible explanation I have heard for anything in a long time. They did that yesterday for one simple reason. They were going to lose on the McCurdy amendment. The American people will not support the Presidents right to wage war by proxy in an unlimited way down there. So they knocked over the table because they did not like the way the cards were being dealt. Before anyone believes that they were upset at the notion of tying one thing to something not fully related. remember that this is the party which gave us this year with their overwhelming vote a new subsidy for tobacco farmers as part of the reconciliation bill. These are the people who gave us the GrammRudman mistake as part of a bill to extend the debt limit. These are the people. many of them who were here then. who voted for GrammLatta. which took a whole range of unrelated things and made them into one very inconsistent whole. There has not been a time since I have been here that the Republican Party has objected to the tactic of tying one thing to another. They were going to lose the vote yesterday. so they kicked over the table. and now they are pretending to be procedurally outraged.

It is. of course. history now that the Geneva meeting denied and. in fact. ignored that request We should not be surprised by that. The fact is that the United States is only about 10percent dependent upon OPEC oil today. We should. however. be reminded that in the late 1970s. when we were approximately 30percent dependent upon OPEC oil. a similar request for a U.S. oil embargo was not only heeded. but adopted. with awful effects on this economy. Now my father when I was very young gave me a good piece of advice. He assured me that through my life I would make a number of mistakes. but he cautioned me not to make the same mistake more than once. We in America ought to consider my fathers good advice as we approach the end of this decade. Should we allow ourselves to become so dependent upon OPEC oil that the next request by the minister from Libya for an oil embargo against the United States would not only go unignored. but in fact heeded. and the United States might find itself in that same awful position It is time now. America. to wake up. to guard against that type of dependence on foreign oil. It is time now to adopt a sensible oil import policy for America.",

Most of us rightly pointed to Polands denial of workers rights to form their own organizations. as an indication of the repressive and undemocratic nature of that government. That is why so many of us took hope in the solidarity labor movement. In the United States. the National Labor Relations Board is charged with protecting the right of workers to engage in collective bargaining. usually by a representative election. Because of the shortterm nature of construction work. a different procedure was spelled out by the National Labor Relations Act. allowing prehire agreements in the industry. However. employers after signing prehire agreements are simply voiding them at will. Rulings by the NLRB and Federal courts have sanctioned a practice which. in essence. has denied employees the right to representation. We must restore to construction workers their basic rights under our Nations labor laws. That would be done by H.R. 281. which we have before us today. Either we believe in collective bargaining and employees rights to union representation. or we dont. If we do believe in these principles. we need to do something about current practices in the construction industry which undermine free collective bargaining. I. therefore. urge my colleagues to support H.R. 281. before we leave here this afternoon.",

From this vile crime that showed a total disregard for humanity and international law has come a beautiful gesture of love and caring. Warren Klug. Jr.. the husband of Maria and the father or the infant. Demetra Kristina. was so moved by the poverty and pitiful condition of the children of Argos that he established the Argos Fund. the name of the town upon which his loved ones fell from the heavens. He said: My daughters life ended before it started and we wanted to direct your expressions of sympathy to the fund for needy children. Mr. Klug also said that: We recognize that our personal tragedy is also an American tragedy. We are grateful that more people were not hurt by this crime. and our love and prayers are with the family of Mr. Ospino (the fourth victim). We are weakened by the loss of our loved ones. but we remain strong in our belief in God and our country.

As the Hofers will tell the subcommittees today. the craft which carried their son lacked basic survival equipment. In fact. it is quite apparent that the 48foot vessel. a wood vessel. the Western Sea. should never have been allowed to leave port. Christopher Hofers loss on board the Western Sea was a tragic but not isolated incident. Coast Guard statistics indicate that an average of 250 fishing boats sank each year from 1981 to 1983. I find it disturbing and shocking that the death rate of fishermen is seven times the national average for all industry groups. and twice that of the next most hazardous profession. mining. There is no doubt that many of the dangers stem from natural causes such as unpredictable winds and high seas. but it is also very clear to me that an industry that is riddled with natural hazards should be governed by strict safety regulations.

Before we discuss the sweeping new organizing powers for trade union officials. we must first consider the special powers enjoyed by these trade unions which no other unions in our society share. I suggest that the answer to trade unions problems with declining membership isnt to heap on more compulsory unionism powers. The solution to their problem is to win the hearts and minds of construction workers by providing decent. professional representation at the bargaining table. rather than squandering the workers dues on salaries and political schemes.

Eleanor Marie Wade was born in 1909 In the rural Minnesota town of Kimball. She spent the formative years of her life on a farm near that community. but like so many of us. she found herself yearning for the excitement and opportunity of the big city. in her case Mfsneapolls. As a young lady she moved to Minneapolis. a place she would call home until 1968. She worked her way up the corporate ladder. winding up her career as a top secretary for the Crown Zellerbach Paper Co. Following her retirement in 1968. she moved to Tucson. AZ. In 1980. Ms. Wade became aware of and Involved with the Sertoma Foundation. The SertomaService to ManFoundation works to aid those with communication problems. educate the public about such problems. and inform the afflicted about the availability of such aid. Ms. Wade actively suported the goals of the foundation. and subsequently bequeathed her entire estate. worth over a quarter of a million dollars. to the Sertoma Foundation. Her estate provided much needed funding that was crucial to the establishment of public education programs and gave the foundation the ability to invest enough money to make it a permanent institution. It is very difficult to understand the traumas of going through life with speech. hearing. or language impediments. Thanks to organizations such as the Sertoma Foundation. something is being done about these problems. Through public education programs and scholarships for research. the Sertoma Foundation has proven itself worthy of gifts such as the one given by Eleanor Marie Wade. Her generosity and compassion for others also set a good precedent. If more shared her eagerness to help others. mankind would profit in the long run. Eleanor Wade succeeded in doing what every person dreams ofcreating a legacy to be cherished and honored. She should be remembered for her remarkable and generous gift to a worthy cause.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a resolution calling on the administration to grant asylum to South Africans who refuse to support South Africa by force of arms. There is universal military conscription for white males in South Africa. The period of service has increased over the years as the resistance to the evil of apartheid has grown. When the universal conscription of white males was introduced in 1967. the length of service was 9 months. The length of service has now increased to 4 years with the possibility of subsequent callups. Those who are inducted into the South African Defense Force may be called upon to serve in the prevention or suppression of terrorism and in the prevention or suppression of internal disorder. These internal security functions are essentially the support of apartheid by force of arms. To put it another way. these functions can be viewed as the waging of war on the majority black population by the minority of whites who wield power in South Africa. The issue of conscription into the South African military came to my attention last summer. At that time. I met a young man. Richard Dunne. who had left South Africa rather than serve in the South African Defense Force to impose apartheid on the blacks of South Africa and to participate in the occupation of Namibia and the raids into neighboring states. Mr. Dunnes older brother had previously been granted asylum in the United States. but the initial advisory opinion from the Department of State recommended denial of asylum to Richard Dunne. Although the advisory opinion will be reconsidered. there are no guarantees that there will be a change of position by the State Department. There are those who bemoan the fact that the peace movement in South Africa Is not stronger. It would be best if the transition to majority rule could occur nonviolently. People who refuse to engage In violence In South Africa deserve our wholehearted support. The case of Richard Dunne and his fellowdraftrefusers presents us with the opportunity to support those who work against the evil of apartheid in a nonviolent way. I urge you to join with me in making it clear that this body condemns apartheid and supports those who will not take up arms in its defense.*",

Consumers who have had updated credit profiles have found that credit accounts that had been paid off for more than 4 years previous were still listed as credit risks. Many consumers have times of financial instability. However. their credit rating should not be marred for up to 7 years as a result of those brief periods of financial instability. Four years is a much fairer length of time for the consumer. while still protecting those institutions dealing with consumer credit. The purpose of this bill would be to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to disallow reporting of obsolete information for accounts placed for collection or charged for profit and loss which predate the report by more than 4 years. Also. any other adverse information which predates the report by more than 4 years could not be listed in an individuals credit profile.

Dr. Yousaf. a highly respected 34yer~rold orthopedic surgeon in southern Maryland. is soon to embark on a humanitarian mission to his native homeland of Pakistan. His destination is the Afghanistan Surgical Hospital in Peshawar. Pakistan. where he will train Afghan doctors in the treatment of mine and gunshot wounds. While at the hospital. Dr. Yousaf will also attend to Afghan freedom fighters who have been wounded in their struggle against Soviet occupation. More than anything I might say here. I believe that Dr. Yousafs own words capture the essence of his journey: In Pakistan today. there are 3 million Afghan citizens living in refugee camps. These people are fleeing across the Pakistan border to escape an oppressive government and the horrors of an ongoing guerrilla war. Many of these people are seriously injured. Often. even young children lose limbs to land mines. Skilled medical care is scarce. The physicians are overworked. There is no one who can train others in the techniques of first aide. Often. even this rudimentary knowledge would save lives. We are realistic in our goals. We want to help train physicians and emergency personnel to use the tools available to better serve the needy. We know that all of this cannot be accomplished in a single trip. Therefore. we hope to be the first of several teams working with these people over the next eight or ten years. Dr. Yousaf. who will be accompanied on his venture by Dr. Sid Houff and emergency medical technicians Gary Summers and Marty Stinnett. is prepared to go to the front lines if necessary. He and his colleagues weapons will not be for war. however. but for life. taking with them antibiotics and medical tools to battle broken bones. It is a rare individual who sees suffering and selflessly acts to heal it. Dr. Yousaf is such an individual. His spirit of giving and compassion is something for which we can all be proud.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. you will hear the argument that the FEC was not involved in the compulsory union dues for political activities cases and. therefore. we should not require the FEC to enforce the U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the Street. Abood. and Ellis cases. These cases were decided on the first amendment. It was found that political activities involving compulsory union dues were in violation of the first amendment. The FEC is the congressional creation that regulates contributions and political/campaign activities. It is not only appropriate. but it is the duty of Congress to enforce first amendment protections. The FEC is the agency at hand in this bill that can help enforce these first amendment protections. The FEC authorization was defeated on suspension so this is the only opportunity that Congress can insist that all steps available are used to enforce the law of the land. You may also hear the argument that no official request has been made to the FEC to enforce the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court. Since when did the action of a Federal agency to protect constitutional rights depend on a request? The FEC should have acted on its own to carry out the Supreme Court decisions. It has been over a year since the Ellis case and no action has been taken by the FEC to enforce the decisions. If the Justice Department or Civil Rights Commission tried to use the argument that they did not protect constitutional rights because there was no request to do so. they would be laughed out of town. The cases ending with Ellis protect a very important constitutional right. Lack of enforcement cannot be justified by the lame excuse that. \"no one asked us to enforce the Constitution.\" The Bliley amendment simply ensures that the FEC does not continue to ignore the law of the land.

We wanted an opportunity to fully debate some of the controversial practices and proposals of the FEC. Today we have an opportunity to debate the controversial FEC practices of not enforcing the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Ellis versus Brac. The plaintiffs in the Ellis case argued that their compulsory union dues were being used to finance political causes and candidates they opposed in violation of their rights of free political expression. The Supreme Court recognized. as it has in past cases such as Street and Abood. that the enormous power of unions must be tempered by protec ing the first amendment rights of dissenting union members. The court ruled that compulsory union dues may not be used for political purposes and required the reduction of dues to objecting union members.

We have debated this matter every year for several years. and we all realize that we have three former Presidents who do in fact receive what I consider to be a relatively small office staff allowance. The truth of the matter is that this allowance Is not used just for bubble gum. it is not used just to fool around. but it is used actually to operate an office and to answer mail that is received by former Presidents coming from the citizens of this country.

The Senate approved the DomeniciChiles substitute to the GrammRudmanHollings legislation by a large vote. That substitute merely built upon the good work and the originality of the authors. It contained 25 perfecting and clarifying amendments. not an unusually large number considering that the legislation itself ran more than 40 pages. The legislation Senator PACKWOOD and I have now put before the Senate continues the perfecting and clarifying process. It contains an additional 50 amendments to GrammRudmanHollings. but keeps intact the basic concepts of the authors. Now. 50 amendments may sound like a large number. However. as my colleagues who have worked on such legislation as the Clean Air Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act with me remember. 50 amendments of a technical variety occur on any bill of substance. And. of the 50 amendments Senator PACKWooD and I now offer the Senate in the substitute. fully 20 of them are purely technical and another 9 are procedural or related to the Budget Act and its operation.

I had planned to offer an amendment to the reconciliation bill that would make the trust funds whole. but am pleased that the issue has been addressed in the modification to the GrammRudman bill. My concern. Mr. Chairman. is this: I have reviewed the language passed by the House on this issue. which is identical to the language I would have used in my amendment. and believe that it is favorable to the modifications now contained in the Senate version of OrammRudman. Mr. Chairman. this issue of redemption of the Social Security trust funds has been widely misunderstood. Essentially. there are two issues: the first is actual interest lost to the funds. The Social Security trust fund is protected for some lost interest due to the way Treasury transfers FICA tax receipts to the Social Security trust funds. However. the other trust fundscivil service retirement and military retirement. for exampleare losing millions of dollars. This problem is taken care of in the House language and in the Senate language. The second problem. however. is more completely addressed by the language adopted by the House. That problem has to do with the fact that longterm securities with higher interest rates have been redeemed that otherwise would not have been redeemed had we not bumped up against the debt limit. In order to be certain that those securities are reissued at the same interest rate and with the same maturity. it is my understanding that the Treasury Depzrtment must be directed to do so. and that legislative language simply instructing the Treasury to pay back the interest does not assure the Congress and the elderly Americans of this Nation that the Social Security portfolio will be put back in the same condition as it was before. Mr. President. the language adopted in the House version was suggested by officials at the Treasury Department. It is for this reason. Mr. Chairman. that I would urge the Senate conferees to adopt the House language on making the trust funds whole in order to ensure that the trust funds are fully restored.",

I stated then my concerns with this sweeping change in the way we do business around here and I want to renew that statement of concern today. A distinguished American military leader. commenting on the nuclear age. said that we have suddenly become technological giants. while we remain ethical pygmies. I hold a similar concern for the ability of the Congress to measure up to our obligations in the postGrammRudman era. We are about to create a budget process which consolidates considerable power in the Budget Committees and the OMB. and compresses the time in which Congress must make extremely important decisions. What we will have when this measure eventually passes will be a process. what we still need is a policy to carry out our goals. The people of Minnesota didnt send me here to act as an observer. who watches as a mechanical process grinds out a Federal budget. I am here to protect and manifest their hopes and aspirations as Americans. That is the policymaking mandate that we all have in this body. to which the systems and procedures of this body must be subservient. Those who heave a sigh of relief at the passage of this amendment. who feel we have \"solved our deficit problem\" thereby. could not be more mistaken. We are ushering in a period of intense and prolonged policy debate. such as we have not seen in decades in this body. At best. this amendment will succeed in putting everything on the bargaining table. including defense. revenue increases. and entitlement reform and getting everyone. including the President. to that table. It is with that hope that I support this amendment. It is my fear. however that this exercise may serve as a confirmation of Wendell Wilkies wise words: \"That a good catchword can obscure analysis for years.\" Unless the policies we formulate and implement are wise. this process will do more harm than good. That is the challenge we accept with the passage of this amendment. In closing. I remind my colleagues of the old joke about where a 300 pound gorilla sits: Anywhere he wants to.

While the genesis of this legislation may have been the recent and tragic crash of a plane killing 248 brave soldiers of the 101st who were returning home for the holidays. it is legislation long overdue. When a member of the military dies in the line of duty. difficult times always lay ahead for his or her family. Friends and loved ones may comfort thembut the cruel reality is that most of these soldiers are young and do not always have the financial means to support a wife or family in the event of a tragic accident. This bill. in a small way. helps alleviate the burden of worrying about housing for the dependents of a serviceman. We often forget that simply being an American serviceman is a dangerous undertakingwhether It be in Korea. Lebanon. Central America. or anywhere else our global commitments take us. We often forget the routine stresses and strains to which these courageous men are subjected on a daily basis. This bill is straightforward. The Secretary of Defense or Transportation. in the case of the Coast Guard. may provide an allowance for quarters to the dependents of servicemen who die in the line of duty for 60 days. There is no way. Mr. President. that we can adequately express our profound sorrow over the death of the men who died in Newfoundland or servicemen that may die in the future while wearing the uniform.

A great many Americans are wondering where Secretary Shultz has been for the last 3 years. because the facts of Romanias repressive behavior have been well known to everyone except the State Department. which has long served as an apologist for the most authoritarian regime in Eastern Europe. The question is whether the Secretary of State is really serious with his warning. or is it merely a rhetorical exercise to placate the Congress? Mr. President. for some reason the State Department is under the naive impression that Romania has a supposed independent foreign policy. but United States Ambassador David Funderburkwho was the closest United States official to the Romanian atrocitieshas pointed out there is definite proof that this alleged independence is dictated by Romanias masters in the Kremlin. The real story on Romania is so well known to everyone. except those in Foggy Bottom. that even the fashionable Washingtonian magazine has reported extensively on the brutal regime. Mr. Ion Pacepa. former Deputy Director of Romanias Department of Foreign Intelligence and personal adviser to Ceausescualso the highest ranking intelligence officer from a Soviet bloc country to defect to the Westdescribes the horror of the Ceausescu regime in detail in the current issue of the Washingtonian. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Pacepas article be printed in the REcoRD.",

The Soviet Union will host the inaugural games in Moscow July 520. 1986. and the United States in 1990. More than 5.000 athletes representing over 40 countries will be participating in this new quadrennial competition. I was also honored with a goodwill games flag from visiting athletes: 1984 Olympic U.S. gold medal swimmers Rowdy Gaines and Nancy Hogshead. triple Jump world record holder Willie Banks. the captain of the 1984 gold medal water polo team. Terry Schroeder. and Russian track star Viktor Saneyev. who won the Olympic gold medal in the triple jump in 1968. 1972. and 1976. The goodwill games will mark the first time since 1976 that Soviet and American athletes will participate in summer world class events. This is an important step toward establishing even more of an athletic bond with nations around the world. On the heels of the successful Geneva summit between President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev. I could not think of a better way in which to foster mutual cooperation among nations around the globe. As ambassadors of the goodwill games. these young athletes are participating in a 20city national and international tour. I know their enthusiasm. which was so evident in our meeting today. will generate broad support for the games. As a former athlete myself. I know that athletics has a way of breaking down barriers. Therefore. I hope those participating in next years games will compete together in the spirit of good will and sportsmanship.",

From the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 to the Infant Formula Act of 1980. the Congress has sought to ensure and enhance the health of the American people. Because of the importance of its mission. FDA has often endured intense scrutiny. both from the Congress and from the general public. It decisions have been heavily debated. but most often upheld. Through it all. the FDA has developed a worldwide reputation for professionalism. and a striking reputation within the Congress of the United States for being accountable for its actions. But now increasingly that reputation is being called into question and doubt. Over the past 5 years. while other agencies have come under considerable public scrutiny and criticism for their failure to adequately protect the public health. often substituting politics for science. similar workings at the FDA have been ignored. Through the dry words of the Federal Register. the administration has launched a quiet revolution that. in my view. threatens to undermine one of the best health protection agencies in the world. This silent regulatory coup is wrongfor industry and for the publicand it should be reversed.",

Experience tells us that it is far easier to deny the basic human rights of others when we consider them to be less than full human beings or when we can lump them into a category where they are labeled as being morally inferior. Statements like \"they dont value human life\" or \"they are racists.\" or what. ever other derogatory label one wishes to add. are merely the beginning of a process that allows us to judge others harshly and to condemn them en masse. The labeling and discarding of whole groups of people as morally. intellectually. or physically inferior is the first step in denying human rights. It is for this reason that I am concerned about the U.N. resolution which equated Zionism with racism. It is that kind of thinking which allowed skyjackers in Malta to lead a 20yearold Israe. li woman outside the plane and proceed to shoot her at close range in the head. Fortunately. she survived her execution and did not die for the simple reason that she be. longed to a group which was condemned by the skyjackers. However. this attitude still stands out as the underlying basis for denying the most basic rights to others solely because they were born into a disapproved group.

We are not encouraging rollcall votes today. we are discouraging them. so If there are matters that can be resolved without rollcalls. it would be helpful to those 40 or 50 Senators who are scattered around the Capitol in various conferenceson the farm bill. reconciliation. the continuing resolution. Those three conferences. I know. involve at least 25 to 35 Senators. So.

She was by his side during his early business career. and throughout his long and distinguished political career. She was an exemplary mother to their two daughters and two sons. and cherished grandmother to their 10 grandchildren. In todays world. sharing your life with someone for 51 years is a remarkable feat. But BARRY and Peggy GOLDWATER proved that couples can survive lifes ups and downs. and do it with a sense of humor and style. I know that BARRY will deeply miss Peggys presence and none of us here in the Senate can fill that void.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my myth of the day is that the social safety net woven out of unemployment insurance is as tight as ever. While the unemployment rate has dropped from a recession high of 10.7 percent to the current 7 percent. the proportionnot just the number. the proportionof jobless workers who receive unemployment compensation benefits has fallen even more sharply. In May uf 1975. 5.2 million of the 7.7 million unemployed workers. or more than twothirds. received unemployment benefits. In April of 1983 only 52 percent or 5.7 million out of the 11 million unemployed Americans received unemployment benefits. In October of 1985 only a little over 2 million of the 7.9 million unemployed workers were receiving unemployment benefits. The astonishing decline in unemployment insurance coverage meant that in October only 1 out of every 4 unemployed workers was getting unemployment compensation benefits. What accounts for this remarkable decline in the coverage by unemployment compensation of unemployed Americans? First. tighter Federal and State eligibility rules have made it more difficult to qualify for benefits. Second. two recessions occurred with only a brief upturn between them. leaving many workers without enough recent time on the job to qualify for unemployment benefits. Third. a larger proportion of the work force is now employed in jobs which are not covered by the unemployment insurance system. Whatever the reasons. it is clear that the unemployment insurance safety net created during the depths of the Great Depression and vastly expanded in the following 40 years now contains giant gaps resulting in the overwhelming majority of todays unemployed receiving no unemployment insurance benefits.",

This amendment will not cut anyones project. or impede any project in any way. It simply reflects savings that will be realized from costsharing reforms when necessary authorizing legislation. already approved by the Public Works and Transportation Committee. is enacted. Let me explain. The bill before us. H.R. 2959. appropriates a lump sum of roughly $847 million for Corps of Engineers construction. without any further elaboration whatsoever. However. the report on the bill indicates that $100 million of this sum is intended to be used to start new water projects. Further. the report contains a list of 62 new starts of which half are unauthorized. Since the bill before us does not authorize these projects. they will have to be authorized at some other time or in some other legislation before any money can be spent on them. The members of the Appropriations Committee are not. I am sure. planning to add the necessary authorizations to this bill in conference with the other body. Rather. I believe they are anticipating passage of the proper authorizing legislation. which is H.R. 6. H.R. 6 was approved by the Public Works Committee 3 weeks ago and should be coming to the floor in the near future. It would authorize all the new starts on the Appropriations Committees list. plus many more. It would be helpful if the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee could confirm for us here this afternoon that it is their intention to wait for H.R. 6 to authorize the unauthorized projects on their committee report list. rather than trying to add them to the bill before us at some later time.",

The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that an adequate repayment agreement has been arranged between the Bureau of Reclamation and the municipal users of this water project. For 5 years. the Bureau of Reclamation has promised such an agreement and for 5 years. they have broken those promises and delivered nothing. The Bureaus latest offering is a draft supplemental repayment agreement. This agreement. however. carries with it far too many uncertainties to convince me that the taxpayers will be protected. First. this new contract has a number of provisions that are of highly questionable legality. Second. the contract must go through the Bureaus headquarters. Interior. and the Office of Management and Budget and it has been approved at none of these levels. Finally. the contract must meet the approval of the local electorate but the contract will not be voted on. however. until next November. All of these problems add up to another year with no guarantee of a repayment agreement. In thiti ease. the Bureau of Reclamation has had an abysmal track record. Should the draft contract not go through next winterand it may very well fail at any number of levels. I. for one. can no longer trust the Bureau to persevere and protect the interests of the taxpayers. I have no choice but to place the Bureau on notice that this situation will no longer be tolerated. and that no more funds will be expended this year until a contract Is signed. sealed and delivered. I want to assure my colleagues from Utah that I bear no malice for their water project. My first obligation. however. is to protect the interests of the taxpayers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I urge a vote against the previous question on the rules package. and urge my colleagues support for Mr. MICHELS substitute. The Republican substitute contains a provision which will insure fairness on committees. It requires party ratios on committees to reflect the party ratios in the House. Under the proposal. the Ethics Committee would be exempt. under present House rules. that Is a bipartisan committee. Mr. Speaker. it is fundamentally unfair that representation on the committees of the House do not reflect the party ratios in the House. In the 98th Congress. the Republican Party was underrepresented on committees by 23 seats and on subcommittees by 62 seats. This effectively disenfranchisesnow. listen to this11.5 million Americans at the committee level and 31 million Americans at the subcommittee level. The Democrats control 58 percent of the seats of the House of Representatives. but will apparently control 61 percent of the committee seats and 62 percent of the subcommittee seats. The problem will be worse in the 99th Congress than it was when the 98th Congress was organized. On the Appropriations Committee. for examplethe committee where I serve as ranking Republicanthere are 35 Democratic seats and 22 Republican. for a ratio of 61 percent. This is far different than the 58 percent of the seats the Democrats control in the House. If committee size was purely representational. the Democrats would have 34 seatsnot 35and the Republicans 23not 22. This inequity has consistently occurred since the 88th Congress from 1963 to 1964. when the Democrats had 59 percent of the House seats. but 60 percent of committee seats. According to some research which I have done. the problem is worse in years when a Republican wins the Presidential election. We need only look at the other bodythe Republican Party does not disenfranchise Democrats on committees over there. It is simple fairness to allow proportional representation on committees in the House. I urge support for the Republican substitute to help correct this imbalance. This is the people& House. I urge my colleagues to put aside the partisanship that normally might occur in the adoption of the rules of the House. support the Michel package. and let us not undo the decision made by the American electorate on November 6.",

Mr. Speaker. much has been said about this evil of proxy voting in committees. and I am here to subscribe to the condemnation of that procedure. In the Judiciary Committee in the 98th Congress. when the minority advanced a sound proposal for reform of the insanity defense. it was rejected by virtue of a proxy voting pattern established in the subcommittee in which this proposal was formulated. Now. what was wrong with that was that that particular vote was taken very early in the session and the minority. who offered it. proved that it was correct when in the final stages of the 98th Congress a true reform of the insanity defense was actually passed by this House and by the Senate in exactly the same form in which the minority. during the committee process. offered it. It was the meanspirited proxy voting that canceled out our chance to have reform of the insanity defense early in the session and avoid that lastminute rush that finally saw some reform come to this important facet of the law. But beyond that. at one point. the subcommittee of which I was a member. offered an amendment that would have brought for the first time in a generation the death penalty as a proper penalty for certain homicides. including assassination of the President of the United States. into the Federal law process. What happened? It was defeated in subcommittee by virtue of proxy votes. Now that cannot be tolerated by the American public. The American public is confused by the maze of rules and procedures that we have on the floor of the Congress. as are Members of the Congress itself. but there is one thing that the public will understand: That they want their elected Representatives in committee to vote in their own presence. in their own voice. and out of their own convictions. They do understand the evil of having somebody grant a piece of paper to somebody else to vote for them. Vote against the previous question.",

At that point it was a meaningless gesture. it was an election fraud. It was an attempt by people here to demonstrate to the country that they had done something on balanced budget. It was not real. Today. you have got a chance to do something real.

As has been said by gentlemen on the minority side. the majority party. the Democratic Party now has 58 percent of the House. There are 35 Democrats on the 57member Appropriations Committee. That gives the Democrats not 58 percent. but 61 percent of that committee. which is a 3percent discrepancy. On the Rules Committee. that discrepancy is 11 percent. On Ways and Means. that discrepancy favoring the Democrats is 6 percent. The gentleman from California. in his illuminating recitation of other countries that do not follow ratios precisely. mentioned that the only other countries that do not do it are behind the Iron Curtain. I do not know why they do not do it. but I do know why this House has historically not done it. Because of the vagaries of the basic. traditional rules which govern this House. because of the wide political. social. and economic fabric that comprises the American quilt. and. of course. our representation in this House reflects the threads of that quilt. and finally. because there are 435 of us in this large Chamber. we are required to have some authoritarian. workable control within the major committees.",

If we adopt this rule. we move the funding for Superfund from the legislation. we are merely delaying this question until January or February when we can take it up again. We are doing nothing with Superfund itself. only with revenues. So I cannot understand why there would be any opposition at this late hour to this resolution. If you oppose the resolution. what you will be doing is. for all practical purposes. killing this reconciliation bill which saves billions of dollars. Now I do not think anybody wants to do that. I know there are some interests that would like to see the new VAT that is being proposed in this legislation written into our tax laws. Well. let me say I do not think that is going to happen. Even if this House would turn down this resolution and come forth with another resolution. the President says he will not accept the VAT tax. To start a new system of taxation for the American people would be absolutely wrong. Go back and look at the history of the income tax. You know. when they came forth with that. $3.000 was the limit. $3.000. and look at how it expanded. the income tax. The same thing could happen on VAT if we opened up this whole keg of worms. Every time the Congress wanted more money for this program or that program. it would increase the VAT. We do not want to get into the history of VATs in some of these other countries. how detrimental they have been to the economies of these countries. That was fully debated.

D 2030 Where I disagree is with his inclusions. because by the inclusion of the one provision which allows for the VAT tax or MET tax or SET tax. whatever you want to call it. the valueadded tax. by that one provision I think we invite a certain veto of this bill. We have gotten a strongmore than strongword from the White House or from the administration repeatedly for months as to their veto of any kind of a VAT. SET. MET. or whatever you want to call It. any tax on this Superfund. What is happening here tonight is that we have taken an issue where we have a provision in the House and a provision In the Senate. and we are splitting that issue right down the middle. and by a sleight of hand we are moving the funding into a larger bill that all of us want because we want to effect these savings so that we can avoid the prospect of a conference next year. Members should not be fooled. We are still going to have to meet to resolve the programmatic differences In this Superfund bill next year. What we are trying to do here or the attempt here this evening is to split out the tax portion so we do not have to deal with that. What kind of a deal did the House get? The House voted for zero VAT funds. The Senate voted for $5.4 billion of a tax on manufacturers. and the reconciliation of that ends up with $5.7 billion. I do not call that a very good deal for the House. When you go from zero to even higher than what the other body voted. that is not a good deal for the House. The House expressed its will on this matter. It defeated the VAT tax. It voted for an alternative tax. and the House is being robbed and cheated of its position by this mechanism that we are going through this evening. Mr. Speaker. I urge support for this rule.",

I would like to address the House and to assure the Members that if we are genuinely concerned about environmental cleanup. if we have in our hearts a feeling for the appropriate financing of Superfund. and our philosophy is in fact that the polluters should pay rather than having a consumer tax straight across the board to be borne by every single individual. then certainly we want to be guaranteed that we take advantage of this opportunity to excise the Superfund financing mechanism from reconciliation. Let me assure the Members that funding for Superfund is totally extraneous to the reconciliation bill. It has nothing to do with deficit reduction. If this VAT does pass. we can be assured that the President will veto it. But to follow up on my colleagues comments. if you are going to return to your constituents and say that you made an environmental vote by voting \"no\" on this rule. you are misleading your constituents.

We have 16 House committees. 12 Senate committees. and thousands of manhours of labor over 167 items. with subheadings. so that you can multiply the 167 by 10. and you have a number of items that the House had in this provision that the Senate did not. You also have a number of items the Senate had that the House did not. And what we did was reconcile the differences. Over every single issue that was in disagreement. we came to an agreement. A majority of the Senate conferees signed every single item. A majority of the House conferees signed every single item. There was agreement across the board. You have before you now a rule that imposes someone elses wishes on the conferees that you ap. pointed from both the House and the Senate. I understand the peculiarities which got this rule in front of us. A commitment was made. and in this rule that commitment is honored. but it is up to the House to decide whether or not it is appropriate. Now. I know the deck is stacked because it has been folded into the rule. We can unfold it by voting down this rule and by allowing. at the suggestion of the gentleman from Texas. another rule which would provide a separate vote. We have talked about whether or not the President is going to veto this measure. There was a threatened veto by the Treasury on every single item that came up. I can tell the Members that tonight there is one certainty. The one certainty that we have to hang onto is that if this rule passes and we vote reconciliation out. it is not going beyond those double doors. That is as far as it is going to go tonight. It will not cross the Capitol. it will not pass the Senate. Our only chance is to vote this rule down and let us do it right.",

I think we ought to recognize a point that was Just made by the previous speaker. The other body has just as much at stake in reconciliation as we do. It cannot be something that we get rolled on tonight. So I think the question is whether or not you want a conference on Superfund with our version in the conference. where the tradeoffs can be made from the bucket of money as to whether or not the list has 600 or 600.000 toxic waste sites on it. The dilemma that you might face if you do not get a chance to have a conference with some money in conference is whether or not we want to leave here for Christmas with the question on some peoples minds. did the Congress want to satisfy oil and gas or the President of the United States?",

I thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon for clarifying an uncertainty that has created a great deal of concern for those caring for and providing services to the more than 100.000 elderly Americans in lifecare facilities throughout the Nation. Mr. President. under the lifecare amendment. a facility qualifies as a qualified continuing care facility only if substantially all of the facilities which are used to provide services which are required to be provided under the continuing care contract are owned or operated by the sponsor of the lifecare facility. In the State of Florida. Mr. Chairman. there is. in effect. an informal moratorium on the construction of new nursing homes. As a result. in some cases. lifecare communities may. on a temporary basis. have to provide longterm nursing care for their residents by entering into contracts with unrelated nursing facilities under which the sponsor of the lifecare facility will operate. along with the operator of the nursing facility. beds in the unrelated nursing facility. Mr. Chairman. I understand that in your view. such an arrangement would qualify under the statute so long as the sponsor of the lifecare facility is taking all reasonable steps to obtain the regulatory approval required to construct a new nursing facility. or is constructing such a facility.",

    "speech": "I will. I am offering these amendments on behalf of Senators CHILES and HAWKINS. as well as myself. I will be happy to explain my amendment. which I would in any event. The first amendment would actually preserve the viability of a small number of existing lifecare communities currently serving older Americans in their retirement years. The amendment is necessary because some existing lifecare facilities. while meeting important housing and health care needs of their elderly residents. do not meet the requirement that substantially all of the facility be owned or operated by a single owner. These are existing facilities that need some grandfathering. Due to historical patterns. some existing facilities have contracted out with nursing homes to meet the health care needs of their residents. While we are requiring that future facilities provide these services in one setting and under a single owner. it would work an undue hardship on existing facilities which are providing valuable services to. in essence. put them out of business by imposing this standard on them retroactively. So that first amendment would provide a grandfather clause so that the facilities in existence as of July 1. 1985. would be exempt from the requirements. The second amendment. Mr. President. is also technical in nature. This amendment states that all loans to facilities that meet the requirements of a continuing care facility in all respects except that they do not provide care for the life of the resident will be exempt from section 7872 until December 31. 1985. The reason for this amendment is that some facilities have been set up in such a way that they provide care until an individual becomes severely disabled. and then contract out for nursing home services. We recognize that some existing facilities operate in this manner. and to the extent that they are affected by the preceding amendment. they will be given a 6month moratorium from its application. until December 31. 1985. This will allow them ample time to decide whether they wish to change their manner of operation to conform to the new regulations. or to discontinue providing such services.",

We have hearings on it almost every session in one form or another. We have undertaken action in the past. I recall in the last decade. although I may be off a year or two. we passed a provision to allow you to sell your house and get $125.000. I believe it was. $125.000 tax free so you could roll it over in some other kind of retirement facility. Clearly. when we set up 401(k) pension plans. or approved them which are being widely used. much to the concern of the Treasury. because the projected revenue losses on them are maybe extraordinary. it was deemed for the principal purpose of retirement. So the committee is always open to consider other forms of retirement security. additional forms of security for those on retirement. I do think the particular amendment the committee adopted that Senator HEINZ offered was a particular form of lifecare retirement. There may be others to be considered. I do not think it unfair that we said on this particular occasion we will limit it to life care even any more than it would be unfair to say when we passed the rollover of selling your house when you are 55 or older that it is unfair. Yes. the committee will try to consider it. You know the schedule. We are between now and the end of September running about 3 days a week on tax reform hearings.

The same rules apply to all properties. First. I think it is unfair that we are going to single out farm properties and say these will be treated differently than any other kinds of property. Second. there is in the bill a provision that says that the Treasury can issue regulations to say that if a buyer can prove to the Internal Revenue Service that a rate below the going rate of interest that the Federal Government pays for money is appropriate. then they can enter into that kind of contract without the tax penalty that is assessed under the statute. If there is an appropriate circumstance. But an appropriate circumstance is not to artificially inflate the value of the property so that you get a big capital gain as the seller and so that you can get a big depreciable piece of property as the buyer. That is all we are trying to remedy. The amendment of the Senator from Montana looses. in terms of the way the Federal Government talks about money. an infinitesimal amount of money. very small. But I believe I will raise a point of order against it because we are going to have bills coming before the Senate. coming out of my Finance Committee. involving not just hundreds of billions of dollars but trillions. and amendments being offered that are going to cost $30 billion. $40 billion. $50 billion. $60 billion or more.

A sawmill that is in bad straits now. they are losing money. although not a big sawmillwith. say. 40 or 50 employees. That transaction may easily exceed $2 million and the transaction may involve the present seller having to get out offering some of the key employees or all of the employees the chance. or two or three people in the community a chance to keep the sawmill going with the 40 or 50 Jobs. it could very easily exceed $2 million.

The bully of Tripoli is now violating the borders of peaceloving Tunisia while rudely expelling thousands of Tunisian guest workers who have been laboring in Libya. The colonel recently massed his troops on Tunisias eastern border and threatened to invade. Diplomacy by intimidation and terrorism appears to be his style. His name has become synonymous with terrorism. Libya watchers in our Government can recount long lists of Libyan plots and operations directed against Tunisia and other proWestern nations. A few years ago. the colonel engineered an attack on the Tunisian town of Gafsa. Libyan agents have attempted assassinations in Egypt and routinely execute opponents of Colonel Qadhafl in Europe and in other countries around the world. Numerous terrorist training camps are located in Libya and some of the worlds most infamous terrorists have been trained there. Qadhafl has assisted the brutal former ruler of Uganda. Idl Amin. and succeeded in occupying a valuable mineralrich strip of land along the northern border of Chad. He has assisted marauding bands of Pollsarlo rebels In the Western Sahara and has sprinkled mines throughout the Red Sea in order to disrupt navigation through the Suez Canal. A few years ago. Libyan intelligence agents infiltrated Into Saudi Arabia disguised as religious pilgrims while carrying a healthy supply of Sovietmade AS47 assault rifles.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. given our overall 1984 trade deficit of $123 billion. we should pay attention to our most profitable exportagricultural products. Last year alone. the United States exported $38 billion in farm goods and imported only $18.9 billion. As the worlds largest exporter of agricultural products. the United States as a whole. and farmers in particular. would benefit from freer trade. Last year I proposed a fourpoint plan to boost agricultural exports. As the second point of my proposal I urged congressional action to ensure that agriculture be given equal treatment with other export interests In multilateral negotiations. Agriculture should not be treated like the poor stepchild of the American economy. Since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GAIT] was first negotiated. agricultural Interests have been placed on the back burner. The United States can no longer afford to play the role of innocents abroad. It is past time that agriculture be given a position on an equal footing with other products. The present high level of agricultural protectionism contrasts so sharply with trade liberalization in other areas that it behooves the Congress to act promptly. I have introduced legislation which calls on the President to negotiate with our GATI trading partners to revise current rules which make an artificial distinction between agricultural and manufactured products. Agricultural export subsidies would thus be treated in the same manner as tariffs. and agricultural products would be treated the same as manufactured products. A unified treatment of tariffs and subsidies would clarify trading rules for market participants and simplify trade negotiations. In a market free of distorting influences. the American farmer would fulfill his role as a competitive producer. The agricultural sector of most countries is highly protected from foreign competition. Tariffs. quotas and export subsidies are all widely used instruments of protection. The case of the European Economic Community is a glaring example. That body of countries should be a net importer. but by using certain tools it has been able to become a net exporter. Import restrictions on dairy products. sugar. meat and other products have led the United States to request a GAIF waiver every year since 1955. Japanese trade policy has caused the price of basic food items to be well above the level of the rest of the world.",

I am fearful that Congress will retaliate by passing a plethora of protectionist legislation ranging in nature from acrosstheboard import surcharges to quotas and tariffs on specific goods. One such bill that would have a devastating impact both domestically and internationally is H.R. 3035. legislation that would impose a 25.percent import surcharge on countries that have a substantial trade surplus with the United States. While Japan is the main target. Korea. Taiwan. and even Brazil would be adversely subjected to this surcharge. As Robert J. Samuelson points out. \"Protectionism may satisfy an urge to punish foreigners. but It threatens to reduce economic growth and worsen our economic problems.\" In his article. \"Politics of Protection.\" he further notes that. \"the trade deficit by itself Is not the trade problem.\" Instead. he views the problem as a result of violent swings in our trade bal. ance that harms those industries dependent on exports or vulnerable to Imports. I find Mr. Samuelsons analysis correct. and further believe that it is the strong U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies that plays a major role in the disparity in cur. rent trade balances bctween the United States and foreign competition. The U.S. Congress. with its record budget deficits and high interest rates. can be held responsible for this strong dollar. Until the Congress exercises some fiscal responsibility. the overall situation for American busi. nesses forced to compete with lower priced imports is unlikely to improve. Recent legislative action aimed at reducing the Federal deficit and lowering interest rates would contribute greatly to reducing the value of the U.S. dollar. Thus. rather than punishing our foreign competition. we in Congress should be focusing our attention on our Federal deficit and our high interest rates. Until we get our house in order. we should not be taking out our frustrations on our foreign trading partners. For more insights into the complex trade position that the United States currently finds itself in. I urge my colleagues to read the following article by Robert J. Samuelson. The article follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to announce that MUMPS is spreading throughout the Federal Government and around the world. This disease has proven to be an extremely effective antidote to the fatal ailments big budgetitis and cost overrunus extremus. Whats more. this antidote was developed within the walls of an often criticized Federal agencythe Veterans Administration. So often we hear of how much the Government wastes. from golden fleeces to $91 screws. Cant the Government be run effec. tively? Well. Im glad to report the VA has saved taxpayers millions of dollars and simultaneously Improved service to the countrys veterans simply by implementing a new. efficient. automated data processing system. On February 18. 1982. the VAs Depart. ment of Medicine and Surgery was given a directive to develop a Decentralized Hospital Computer Program [DHCP]. One of the key provisions of this plan was the choice of softwware systemsthe Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi.Program. ming System [MUMPS]. This system was chosen because it is user friendly. needs much less computer space than other language with comparable functions. The cost of implementing this system. including hardware. through fiscal year 1985 is only $100 million. as compared to the $2 billion to $3 billion cost estimated by commercial firms. Not only has the VA implemented the DHCP internally and for much less than expected. but only 2 years after the inception of the DHCP in 1982. the initial MUMPS software was fully operational in 169 VA hospitals. MUMPS software has also been adapted by hospitals in Japan. Europeincluding the largest hospital in the world in Fin. landby HHSs Indian Health Service. and the Department of Defensestill immune to MUMPSis assessing the feasibility of using MUMPS in military hospitals. It is high time that the VA. particularly the Department of Medicine and Surgery. be recugnized and commended publicly for its outstanding job in implementing the DHCP and MUMPS software. Implementation of MUMPS in the VA has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars. Imagine the possible savings if MUMPS were to spread to other age.acles. I for one am proud of the VAs accomplishments and applaud their fine work.",

I was reminded of an old line from a former President. which said \"watch what we do. not what we say.\" Suddenly. after 41/2 years. the President says he is corcerned about our Nations trade crisis. After all of these years of blindly swearing allegiance at the altar of free trade. the President now says he is for fair trade. Mr. President. its too little. too late. Two weeks ago. you rejected the recommendation of the International Trade Commission to limit the number of shoe imports coming into this country. You slammed the door in the faces of Americas footwear workers and manufacturers and left it wide open for their competitors in Korea. Taiwan. and Brazil. Last March. you did much the same to Americas automobile industry. Mr. President. tough talk wont stop the flood of foreign importsfrom computer chips to shoesdumped on our markets. No. only a strong. comprehensive. and farreaching trade policy for our Nation will help us regain our competitive edge in world trade. We in Congress are ready to move ahead quickly on legislation which puts American workers and American businesses first. We urge you Mr. President. to put aside the press releases. roll up your sleeves. and Join us.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in recent months the American public has been reading a number of accounts relating to medical problems in our military hospitals. As chairman of the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. we have looked into many of these allegations and. in all honesty. I must report to the Congress that military hospitals are not immune from matters relating to care of patients and the quality of medical attention. but neither are civilian hospitals for that matter. Over the August recess period. I had occasion to be closely associated with Bassett Army Hospital located at Fort Wainwright. AK. Mr. Speaker. Bassett Army Hospital is a small 40bed hospital located adjacent to the city of Fairbanks and which. I would suppose. is as remote a military post as we have in the entire continental United States. During a longplanned vacation to Alaska. my wife developed a rather serious kidney infection necessitating that I locate medical care. which I found after driving some 300 miles from the Valdez area. I cannot speak too highly of the excellent medical care she received in that remote military hospital. and despite the fact this small hospital did not have all the latest equipment found at the Bethesda Naval Hospital or Walter Reed. the personal attention provided by doctors Jake Allen and Frank Foyd. and by nurses Helen Schotz. Marilynn Harasich. Pnd Holly Buchanan more than made up for these deficiencies. I have never been prouder of military medical care than that which I witnessed during my wifes 5 days at the Bassett Army Hospital from the dedicated doctors and nurses who. much like the television serial MASH. perform their daily duties in combat boots and camouflage olive drab attire. America can be just as proud of Bassett Army Hospital and of its counterparts throughout the continental United States wherever American military men and women serve.",

Third. the President has eliminated the threat of future sanctions contained in the congressional bill. Those sanctions would have put South Africa on notice that Americans are deadly serious about ending apartheid. This package may play in Pretoria.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am deeply disturbed this afternoon because of the remarks of the President of the United States with regard to the bipartisan coalition in the House and the Senate on South Africa. Unfortunately. the President has come forward with an illdisguised. illadvised attempt to circumvent an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in the Congress. If the President were truly interested in having our Nation speak with one voice instead of continuing to support the apartheid regime in South Africa. he would sign the legislation that a broad crosssection of Republicans and Democrats have put before him. I fear that the Presidents tragic refusal to support the compromise legislation will only undermine those moderate forces in South Africa who seek nonviolent reform of apartheid. In essence. the President has said. \"I am going to allow loans by our banks to the apartheid regime as long as they say it is going to help the majority.\" Second. he is going to go to GATT to ask for permission on a prohibition of Krugerrands. This is the first time we have done our foreign policy by a Gallup poll of other nations rather than acting on what Americans believe inour values and our interests. Finally. he has said that there is to be no future sanctions despite the fact that over a thousand of the citizens of the majority have been brutalized and killed in the last few months by the apartheid regime. Mr. Speaker. it is a sad day for all Americans. and I hope the Members of the other body will have the courage and the strength to continue the bipartisan coalition and approve the compromise legislation in the conference on the Antiapartheid Act.",

And I suspect that a lot of our colleagues on the other side were also. Over the years Tommy has been an incredibly reliable and accurate source of information about what is going on in this place. what has gone on and what is likely to go on and when. He brings order out of chaos. sense out of the senseless. meaning out of gobbledygook. To say that we will miss him is woefully inadequate. I must say that anyone who has been around here for 30 years as Tommy has. has to be either very stupid. very masochistic or very dedicated. And since we all know that he certainly is not stupid. and has shown no penchant for selfflagellation. I conclude it was indeed his dedication that guided him. Tom has always been the quiet spot in the middle of the stormone of the few who kept his head when all about him were losing theirs. But the reason I really have so much respect and admiration for Tom Winebrenner is that he is a sailor. Those who go down to the sea in ships or even in small boats as Tommy does are a breed apart. They are thoughtful people. Im sure that Tommy has welcomed his boat as a respite from the babble of this place. Out there all he has to contend with are the wind and the waves and the occasional gulls. I have learned much from Tommy over my years here about procedure and process.

I have seen the objectivity of his information that is requested of him as people come through the doors and ask what the vote is. a little bit of information about it. I have watched and he will give the same response to a Democrat as well as to a Republican. and I think that says a lot because he works for the House of Representatives in the true institutional fashion.

Tom. you are a marine. You are a marine and you will always be a marine. My friends. the term professional Is sometimes abused and we lose sight of what it really means.

I think. however. that we have all talked about Tom the person and how nice he Is and how great he has been to all of us. particularly those of us when we were new.

He probably has made a greater contribution than many of us that have spoken here tonight to this country. The other day. at the Republican conference. when it was announced that Tom Wlnebrenner was leaving. there was spontaneous applause. 175 people stood up. applauding and applauding and applauding. with a couple to tears coming down his cheek. and they asked him to get up and speak. He did not want to speak. he was embarrassed. That is the kind of people we have helping us here in this institution. Nobody will ever serve finer than Tom Winebrenner.

Tommy spent a lot of time on the House floor sitting around waiting on us. sitting around waiting on the other body to send legislation over. That Is one of the functions.

I have come to depend heavily upon his insight and objectivity. He will be sorely missed by Members on both sides of the aisle. Tommy came to Washington as a page in the early fifties and graduated from the Page School in 1954. Upon his graduation. he began work as a telephone clerk in the Republican Cloakroom.

He has exerted tremendous influence on the floor ever since. Tommy Winebrenners success and acclaim are the result of a personal commitment to careful and objective analysis. As a result. his counsel is sought by floor managers of both parties. Many times I have seen Democrats and Republicans alike seeking his advice on issues of substance and procedure. When Tommy departs we will lose a friend and a tremendous resource. On a more personal note. Tommy and I have developed a close friendship over the years. He has assisted me with legislation and advised me on scheduling. In addition. he has worked closely with my staffoffering them guidance and advice.

If the opponents do not require us to have a second cloture vote. we could dispose of it in 2 days. On the merits. the South African issue could be disposed of in 1 day. But unless we are able to obtain some assurance about a fair opportunity to vote on South Africa. we will have to exercise whatever parliamentary rights we have. so that the Senate can express itself on this issue.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have today introduced a Senate resolution urging the President to incorporate specific. tough elements into the U.S. negotiating stance on the U.N.s new International Convention on Drug Trafficking. This resolution flows from the work of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. which I chair. The caucus held hearings on this general subject in June where we took testimony from our U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters. the Justice Department. Customs. and the Coast Guard. This Drug Trafficking Convention is currently being drafted at the U.N.s Division of Narcotics Drugs in Vienna. A preliminary draft should be circulated for comment to member nations some time this month. Comments from nation states on this preliminary draft will be sought before October 31. 1986. The draft treaty will then be discussed in depth at the U.N.s February 1987 Vienna meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. By getting the views of the Senate in on the ground floor. we should be in a better position to affect the actual language of the new drug trafficking convention. In essence. this resolution seeks the same no nonsense and expedited procedures for apprehension and prosecution of drug traffickers as has been secured in international law for airplane hijackers. Universal jurisdiction over drug trafficking offenses would allow the long arm of U.S. law enforcement to reach out wherever drug traffickers seek refuge. Other specific elements for the drug trafficking treaty sought by this resolution include provisions to: Expedite extradition of drug traffickers. Removal of the statute of limitations for drug trafficking offenses and asset forfeiture laws by member nations. Establishment of an appropriate regime of international controls for precursors and essential chemicals needed for drug production. Tighten surveillance and improved cooperation in free ports. many of which are currently considered major trafficking transshipment hubs by law enforcement officials. Improved money laundering and asset forfeiture laws which anticipate and deal with the various ruses and dodges of drug traffickers and their witting and unwitting agents. This is in no way intended as an exclusive list of suggestions by the Senate. It is simply a compilation of some key elements which have come to the attention of the Senate Caucus. I hope my colleagues will see fit to join me in this worthwhile initiative. which is intended to be helpful to our treaty negotiators.*",

This project will deepen the Blair waterway from 35 feet to 45 feet below mean low water. It would also widen the channel bottom width to 300 feet to improve the access through the East llth Street Bridge. In order to accomplish this. the bridge must be replaced. The port is anxious to widen the channel to mitigate the serious safety problems that exist now because of the narrow span of the bridge. For example. on March 29. 1983. a freighter struck the bridge. unable to navigate the narrow channel. causing $200.000 in damages to the bridge and closing it for 1 month. Widening the bridge is also a critical component of the future development of the port. Of the ports 2.400 acres. 1.000 acres are on the upper Blair waterway. This area cannot be developed until a deeper and wider channel can provide access. The bridge problem has already cost the port millions of dollars. SeaLand. which recently moved to Tacoma. had to turn down a terminal site because its ships could not navigate through the narrow Blair waterway bridge. Development of the port is critical to the State of Washington. International trade with Pacific rim countries through Pacific coast ports has grown dramatically over the last 10 years. It is estimated that 350.000 jobs in Washington. or 1 job out of every 5 in the State. are dependent on international trade.

I had thought of offering an amendment to continuing resolution that would earmark $456.000 for the Federal share of a small beach erosion control project in Seattle. WA. This amendment does not involve additional money. Rather. it would direct that the project be funded through existing section 103 funds. The city of Seattle owns 130 acres on Williams Point in Puget Sound. Approximately 1 mile of shoreline along Williams Point. also owned by the city. is protected by a concrete and cobblestone seawall. Severe winter storms in November 1981 seriously damaged this seawall. breaking 80 to 90 feet of the seawall into several sections and moving them seaward. The city of Seattle is in great danger of losing both the seawall and the citys property. including an important metro utility line. due to severe beach erosion and damage to the seawall. These storms also breached or undermined the seawall causing cavitation of the city sidewalk adjacent to the seawall. Emergency repair work consisting of filling the cavities with crushed rock has been a stopgap measure at best. A study conducted in 1982 by engineers for the city and the Army Corps of Engineers concluded that without effective longterm erosion protection measures. the southwest beach and the seawall at Williams Point will continue to fail. resulting in the permanent loss of the citys property. The city can no longer risk the destruction to its property that would result from continued exposure to winter storms. The project will add beach fill to the eroded beach to approximate the original configuration of the shoreline. This will eliminate the erosive action of the water on the seawall.",

Even more important in the long haul is the question of the reduction of strategic defensive arms. This will have to be discussed along with what limitations there should be on the strategic defense initiative. the socalled star wars. The summit should seek to resolve the impasse in strategic offensive and defensive arms as well as the impasse on intermediate range nuclear missiles.

Today is the centennial of his birth in 1886. and I want to honor this true son of North Dakota whose unyielding belief in honest representation earned him the label \"maverick of mavericks.\" As a testimonial to his political genius. \"Wild Bill\" Langer managed simultaneously to attract controversy and convert it into political energy. North Dakotans grew accustomed to a recurring syndrome known as \"Theyre after Langer again.\" As the strongminded and strongwilled independent representative that he was. Bill Langer was often hounded by those who felt threatened by his populist philosphy. Much to the consternation of his opponents and to nonNorth Dakotans. our State understood him. respected him. and took great pride in him. Perhaps that was partially due to the fact that there never was a problem too small for his attention. After serving as Governor. he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1940. He served 19 years in the Senate where his dedication to serving the best interests of his people. his North Dakotans. always took precedence. Bill Langer seemed to confound his adversaries with an uwavering commitment to North Dakotans by never forgetting where he was from or whom he was representing. As North Dakota approaches its own centennial in 1989. we salute the centennial of the birth of one of our favorite sons. Senator William Langer.",

Bob Cook joined the Navy in 1938. He later attended the Naval Academy. graduating in 1943 just in time to see action in the Pacific theater in World War II. During the ensuing 20 years. he saw combat in Korea and served in a variety of assignments. Most of his duty was at sea on destroyers. These duties involved sacrifice of creature comforts and time away from his family. Bob Cook retired from the Navy in 1964. He then joined the Applied Physics Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University where he has served for the past 22 years. His record is distinguished by the high regard in which he is held by the professionals with whom he has served for the past half century. Bob Cook. and other men and women like him are the bedrock of America. George Marshall was once asked if he could name the indispensable qualities of a public servant. He replied. \"courage. wisdom. tolerance and an understanding of democratic procedures.\" These are qualities Bob Cook has exemplified throughout his career and our country is better for it.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the tragic nuclear accident in the Soviet Union has led to new concern about the safety of American reactors. including the reactors operated by the Department of Energy. We have four such reactors in South Carolina. at the Governments Savannah River Plant. None of these reactors has a containment structure. the kind of concrete dome that covers civilian nuclear plants. The reactor at Chernobyl also lacked a containment dome. a factor that contributed to the spread of radioactivity at that site. Over the years. we have not seen any real evidence that Energy Department reactors require containment domes. They are very different from commercial reactors. operating at much lower temperatures and pressures. That is because they produce nuclear materials instead of creating steam to drive turbines that generate electricity. Their safety systems are called confinement systemsairtight buildings designed to hold in radioactivity. Containment domes offer an additional protection. they are designed to withstand the kind of hydrogen and steam explosions that can occur in hightemperature. highpressure commercial reactors. The experts have always thought these kinds of explosions will not occur at Energy Department reactors. Hence. they have not recommended containment domes. However. in light of the Chernobyl accident. this seems a prudent time to review safety systems at the Energy Department reactors. We cannot afford to be too careful when it comes to nuclear safety questions. Too many lives are at stake. As a result. I have called upon the Department of Energy to undertake a comprehensive safety review of the reactors at Savannah River. I also have asked them to include an analysis of possible accidents. using new methodologies developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. President. I am not convinced at this point that Energy Department safety systems are inadequate. But given the new questions raised by the Soviet disaster. I want a new. comprehensive. and expeditious review of these reactors. Anything less may jeopardize the safety of our systems and the reliability of our defense nuclear programs.o",

It is a breath of fresh air to find a proposal like this which is direct. fair. precise. and effective. This amendment actually will do something to prevent waste. fraud and abuse. Abuses which have resulted in millions of lost dollars. This amendment authorizes HUD to require applicants and participants in HUD programs to provide their Social Security numbers as a condition of initial or continuing eligibility for participation. Some of my colleagues may recall the recent Baltimore Federal grand jury indictment of 21 tenants of an assisted housing project in Seat Pleasant. MD. The tenants were indicated for falsifying income information in order to qualify for Federal rent subsides. It was reported that overpayments made by HUD to the tenants exceeded $200.000. Unfortunately. this is not an isolated incident. Such overpayments have been documented in reports by the GAO and the HUD inspector general. A GAO review of six HUD programs estimated that overpayment of assistance in 1979 totaled $867 million. including $42 million in HUDs section 8 program. The HUD inspector general has estimated that at least 12 percent of the tenants in the section 8 program fail to report their full income. and currently. overpayment for all subsidy programs may be as high as $200 million annually. I find these statistics mindboggling. We here stories all the time about defense contractors gouging us for millions. This may be smaller in scale. but its not peanuts. HUD has asked to be given this authority to verify income levels. and I think it is time that we do so. At the same time. I might add. this amendment protects the rights of the individual under the Privacy Act of 1974. and furthermore. gives the applicant ample opportunity to examine and refute any information which may lead to the termination of the individuals participation in the program involved. I do not believe there should be any controversy over the need to halt this waste. fraud. and abuse in HUD programs. I urge the adoption of the Carper amendment.",

Such a specific amendment is necessary to override the strong general presumption that no one may be compelled to give his or her Social Security number except for Social Security purposes required by law. I will not at this time oppose this specific part of the amendment. recognizing the public policy goals that will be served by allowing HUD to require applicants to give their Social Security numbers. This should in no way be interpreted as a break with the Committee on Ways and Means longstanding and -trong concern about breaching the privacy of workers and beneficiaries in the Social Security system. This action also should not be viewed as a precedent of waiving the committees jurisdiction over Social Security number issues and requirements relating to the use of the Social Security number as an identifier. I plan to schedule a public hearing at the first available opportunity for the Committee on Ways and Means to review whether efficient and effective mechanisms exist for HUD to receive appropriate and uptodate income information. to allow better administration of public housing eligibility requirements. I wish to commend the gentleman for his efforts to make our Nations housing programs work more effectively. so that assistance will be available for the truly needy within our society. I hope that we can work together toward that end.",

Whether It is in Great Britain or in Cubaand I do not mean to suggest that Cuba is moving toward capitalismthey have begun to convert their public housing stock back to private ownership to get people to take care of it. That is the principle we are trying to establish. This does not speak down to anybody. It simply allows them the incentive to build up the chances in their own lifetime. if not for themselves. at least for their children. of converting that public housing project into home ownership. I wish more Members were here to address the issue. I do not suggest this is a panacea. But on behalf of myself and other Members of the House.

Ownership is what makes a house really your home. your part of the action. your space in affairs. I tried. in 1977. to coop Marina Village. a complex of 440 twofloor townhouses in Bridgeport. CT. Do you know what I found my worst enemy was? This is fascinating. nothing happened. nothing happened. We got the money out of HUD. that was a major occurrence. $4.2 million. Nothing happened. Guess what? The commissioners did not want to lose turf. they did not want to lose 440 units which means x number of secretaries. x number of papers and so on and so forth. The people wanted to own these apartments. People that own maintain. People that own take care. People that own cut grass. People that own have a real. real percentage in not allowing the crime to rise. The same thing we were talking about with Nehemiah. Bureaucrats should not stand in their way. In fact. this whole movement should be encouraged. The very basic replacement of parts and kitchens and furnaces and everything else is cut dramatically by ownership. Mr. Chairman. it always amazes me when someone says. \"Oh. those rotten tenants in public housing. they do not care for their buildings.\" What tenant does care for his building? I used to rent a house on the beach for the most extraordinary amount of money that I thought people could possibly pay in a month. and I come in and have to replace the stove and have to replace the washing machine and have to replace the carpets because everybody had torn the place to pieces. they did not own it. So I am simply saying anything we can do to give people a piece of the action. that is all they are asking for. that is all you are doing. and anything we can do to keep the bureaucrats out of the process is a good bill.

I will be brief this evening and would suggest to my colleagues that this amendment should be supported for at least two principal reasons: First. there is a growing recognition among Members of this body that abortion terminates the lives of children. and that abortion methods including injection of saltwater into the baby in order to poison the child. literal dismemberment. and other methods. are wrong. Thus we have annually approved the Hyde amendment and other similar enactments. The amendment today clearly and unambiguously ends LSC involvement in abortion litigation. Let me say that if abortion rights groups want to challenge local ordinances. State statutes or other laws relevant to abortion. thats their right. but they will have to do so with their own attorneys. their own funds. not Uncle Sams. The second reason for supporting this amendment stems from the fact that absent this limitation language. scarce funds in the LSC account could well be diverted from the essential mission of Legal Servicesthe defense of poor peopleand could be channeled into costly abortion advocacy litigation.

I would like to commend the chairman of the Aging Committee for his leadership on this issue and for his diligence in fighting to protect the rights of Social Security beneficiaries. Mr. Speaker. 14 local Social Security offices are scheduled to be closed in 1985. These closings are scheduled despite the repeated assurances from the administration that none have been targeted. In 1981. the Social Security Administration began an informal review of its field office structure. Since 1981. there have been 68 instances of field offices being closed or downgraded. Furthermore. the Social Security Administration recently implemented a formal review of local field offices which jeopardizes the existence of 760 local Social Security offices nationwide. There are currently 36 million Social Security beneficiaries. That number is expected to increase to 40 million in 1990. Additional closings. downgradings and staff reductions will hamper the Social Security Administrations ability to respond to public inquiries and to efficiently administer the benefit program. It is totally inappropriate to cripple the Social Security Administrations ability to provide competent and effective service delivery in the face of increasing demand. Mr. Speaker. 1985 marks the 50th anniversary of the Social Security Administration. It is a time to strengthen the program. not turn back on the SSAs long standing tradition of serving the American people.

The Air Force system was to be a bargaining chip for those talks. The negotiations deadlocked when the Soviets wanted to include restrictions on the U.S. space shuttle and ended altogether after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in In 1983. the thenSoviet President. Yuri Andropov. said his country would not test an antisatellite weapon as long as the United States refrained from doing so. The Reagan administration has steadfastly refused to accept that proposal. arguing that the Soviets already have an operational. lowaltitude. orbital antisatellite weapon while the United States has none. Administration spokesmen also have said that there is no way to verify compliance with such a ban since many space vehicles could be used as antisatellite weapons. (From the Los Angeles Times.

The weapon. which would be launched from beneath an F15 fighter jet that soars high into the atmosphere. would intercept and destroy its target on impact. The Reagan Administration believes that an American ASAT system is needed to match the Soviet Unions comparable weapon. which has been operational for more than a decade. Proponents note that the Soviets showed interest in banning ASAT weapons only after the United States decided to begin developing its own. However. opponents point out that the Soviet weapon threatens only lowaltitude satellites and is only marginally effective. They argue that Washington and Moscow should agree to ban all tests of ASAT weapons. rather than allow the United States to develop its own system. A technical difficulty In the radio link between the target payload and ground control aborted the June 22 launch of a Scout missile that was to have carried the balloons into orbit. Pike said. Another attempt to launch the targets will not be made for three to four months. with a similar delay in the scheduled test of the weapon itself. he said.*",

But aside from an occasional maninthestreet interview. no one mentions the fans. This is not just another labor dispute. If it were. we could go back through the history of increasing salaries. recalcitrant owners. arbitration and incentive clauses. But baseball. in addition to being big business. is also the national pastime. Children grow up watching and playing baseball. Adults review the box scores every morning. Families go to the ballpark together. In the last analysis. the players probably are not as pampered as many people think and the owners are not as obsessed with profits. And the issues at stake are no doubt important ones. In some ways. we have come a long way from the days of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb. through the era of Jackie Robinson. to the present. Desegregation and free agency representation were important victories for the players. The owners have done well by night baseball and television contracts. But throughout these changes. the constant source of support has been the fans. If no agreement is reached by August 6. it will be the fans who suffer the greatest disappointment of all.",

I think it is important that we understand what we are doing here and why. There are. two reasons. The first reason is. of course. we are trying to help a good friend and ally. Israel. Israel is having a very difficult time. economically speaking. This action will help her help .herself by expanding her economy inthe area of free trad. . If a country is strong economically she can have a strong defense. she can take care of herself better. and there will be. perhaps. less aid needed from the United States in years to come. This is also a good way to reward a good friend and ally. a very strong democracy In a part of the world that always -seems to be in some sort of chaos.. There is one steady partner there. and that is Israel. But there is a second reason. It also helps the United States and helps us in a very. great way. Right now our greatest trade competitor besides Japan. is the European Economic Community. They have had this arrangement with Israel now for a decade. which means anything made or grown in the European Economic Community can be sold more competitively than we can sell it to Israel. So what we are doing here is finally giving the United States and our own producers the same benefits that the Europeans have been having for a decade in dealing with Israel. We have been running the greatest trade deficit in the history of this country. This is a way to begin to reverse that. We have a positive balance of trade with Israel. This gives us the opportunity to open Up new trade areas with them. sell them new products we cannot sell now because we do not have this agreement we are now implementing through this bill. So I conclude by saying to my colleagues. there are two great reasons for supporting this legislation: First. it helps a good friend and ally. and second. it helps us. We do not lose anything by this. We all gain. I believe it is most important that we pass it.",

In addition. Mr. Speaker. I want to highlight one aspect of the free trade area H.R. 2268 would implement because it is of extreme importance to many of my constituents. That. Mr. Speaker. is the treatment of importsensitive commodities under this bill. Under H.R. 2268. duties on products designated by the International Trade Commission as importsensitive are frozen until 1995. It is understood ti.at Presidential efforts to eliminate or modify duties on these products before 1995 require the President to first obtain the International Trade Commissions advice on whether these products remain import sensitive. as part of the Commissions reexamination of these products sensitivity. the Commission must give the affected industries an opportunity to present information on their status. Further. the President must secure from the Congress new authority to reduce duties before he can actually do so on these particular products during the 5 years preceding January 1. 1995. Mr. Speaker. this approach to the International Trade Commissions handling of importsensitive items is extremely important to my constituents. It is consistent with certain understandings I developed with former Ambassador William Brock last year. and its inclusion in the implementation of this free trade area with Israel is one of several reasons I find the H.R. 2268 to be acceptable.",

These are not easy undertakings. from either an economic or political perspective. However. the Israeli Government. labor. and the business sector have worked together to implement wage and price freezes. budget cuts. subsidy reductions. and strict budgetary guidelines concerning expenditures. Within this context. the establishment of a free trade area will be a significant approach to aid Israels economy. For the United States. the relatively high tariff on close to onehalf of American exports and the competitive disadvantage that the United States faces visavis the dutyfree entry of European Community products will be eliminated. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker.

Some concern has been voiced about the Impact the agreement may have on certain American industries. I want to assure my colleagues that the Ways and Means Committee has carefully considered this aspect. I am convinced that the United States stands to gain much more from free access to the Israeli marketplace than any possible disadvantage certain U.S. manufacturers may fae. For example. approximately 90 percent of Israeli goods already enter our country duty free. whereas close to onehalf of American products encounter tariffs in Israel. Art important component of this agreement is the parity it will provide U.S. manufacturers. Israel has entered into a free trade arrangement with the European Community. Since nearly 70 percent of U.S. industrial exports to Israel compete directly with goods from these EC nations. H.R. 2268 will assure even footing for domestic manufactures. When then Ambassador Brock and Ariel- Sharon signed\" the free trade agreement on April 22. the President noted that in his discussions with Israeli Prime Mi:.iter Shimon Peres last May 7. 1.985 .10627 ..fall. the free trade area legislation was agreed to be \"instrumental in helping -Israel put its economy back on the foundation of vigorous. selfsustaining -growth.\".

The primary purpose of this act is to strengthen and develop economic relations between the United States and Israel through the establishment of a free trade zone.

I think that that was. quite frankly. a stroke of genius. inasmuch as the net result has been that our advisers are having to work closely with the Salvador Army. Air Force. and Navy officials. to teach them the necessary skills to become a more professional army. air force. and navy. and certainly professionalism and discipline is in large part responsible for the dramatic decline in human rights violations that we have seen in El Salvador and that were confirmed by the various individuals with whom I spoke. One other point that impressed me was the concept that they are now working on. that they will basically go into the various hamlets and villages and train the citizens of those villages and hamlets in civil defense. the idea being that if each of the individual villages is capable of defending themselves from attack from guerrillas or what have you. that you will not have this centralized army that might well at some point under the wrong leadership turn on the people. that quite frankly right now have no way of defending themselves against such a force. This would. in essence. as I understand it. decentralize the military. would achieve the objective at least in large part of stabilizing the military situation. the guerrilla attacks that are trying to destabilize the economy through terrorist strategies and in so doing it will take away. hopefully. some of the concerns that we have about capitalists who have moved out of the region. many of them into Miami and safer ports. for fear of the military and economic instability.

It is actually the Contras or the democratic resistance military pressure on the Sandinista government in Nicaragua that has enabled the stabilization of the military situation in El Salvador. because the Sandinista government is not able to give the kind of aid they have been giving to the guerrillas.

    "speech": "I thank the Speaker. One other point that I would like to mention with respect to what the gentleman was just talking about was the fact that as I talked to both military and nonmilitary leaders alike. there was a general agreement that in direct proportion to the degree that there was an acceleration of the attacks of the Contras and the intensity of the attacks in Nicaragua. that there seemed to be a diminution of attacks and intensity of the attacks in El Salvador. When I asked about that. it was explained to me that their conclusion was that as the Contras were applying more and more pressure to the Sandinistas. that the net result was that the Sandinistas could not look outwardly to help those individuals who were now in El Salvador seeking to basically overthrow the Duarte administration in El Salvador. One point that I thought was most significant about that is the documents to which we previously referred that were captured in late April. They point out very clearly that a number of the leadership in the Salvadoran guerrilla ranks have been trained in Vietnam. have been trained in Bulgaria. have been trained in the Soviet Union and n East Germany. There was also a list of individuals who were scheduled to be trained in this year. 1985. in those same countries. I think that is significant. because I have heard a number of our colleagues here on the floor of the House arguing that there is no linkage between the guerrillas in El Salvador and the Sandinista government. Well. certainly that fact. coupled with the correspondence between the leadership of the Sandinistas and the leadership of the Salvadoran guerrillas. contradicts that. When you impose on top of that the documents that we found in Granada and the secret speech made by Commandante Arce. we begin to get some flavor of the complicity between those. but I think probably the most striking evidence of all is the evidence that they can actually see this lessening of guerrilla activity in El Salvador in almost direct proportion to the degree that the Contras are increasing their activity in Nicaragua. There is one other point I would like to talk about which is the contrast that I saw between the government in El Salvador and the government in Nicaragua.",

These people. the Contras. the democratic resistance. the freedom fighters. whatever you want to call them. are the forces of liberation in Nicaragua.

But I am thankful that I can live in a country June .5. 1985 where that kind of criticism can be leveled. That is the first black flower of communism.

For many years. Washington. DCs prison has been located in Fairfax County. VA. During those years. the Lorton correctional facility has been plagued by escapes. riots. and similar disturbances. and the financial burden of resolving those problems has often fallen on Fairfax County citizens. It is they who pay the cost of mobilizing the county police force to search for an escaped convict. It is they who pay county police to guard the prisons perimeter during a riot to help prevent escapes. And. it is they who must finance other emergency efforts by county personnel made necessary by Lortons presence in Fairfax County. My proposal will redress this unfair situation by requiring that the District government reimburse Fairfax County for expenses incurred by the county in providing police. fire. and related services to the prison. Simply put. this bill will help place the financial burden of handling emergencies at Lorton back where it belongson the city that runs the correctional facility. Last year. I offered an amendment similar to this to the D.C. appropriations bill. That amendment was approved by the Congress. and I am pleased that $50.000 of the Districts fiscal year 1986 budget has been earmarked for reimbursements to Fairfax County. However. I believe that the reimbursement requirement must be made permanent. To that end. this bill will help ensure that the costs of maintaining the Lorton prison and responding to emergencies there will be borne by the District government. and not by my constituents in northern Virginia.

In 1980. the National Park Service. under the guidance of William Whelan. issued a report to the Congress on the condition of the resources in our Nations parks. Mr. President. Mr. Whelan did not have good news. Our parks. once pristine areas. are being exposed to many of the air and water pollutants plaguing our cities. The report concludes. \"It is clear that events are taking place that are causing demonstrable and severe damage to the natural and cultural resources of the nations national parks ...\" The National Parks Preservation and Revitalization Act addresses the problems cited by the National Park Service in the 1980 report. The National Park Service was created by the Yellowstone Act of 1872 to protect areas of unique beauty and to preserve prime examples of the Nations natural and cultural heritage. In the past 25 years. more than 54 million acres have been added to the National Park Service and total visits to Park Service lands have increased from 135 million to 350 million per year. Pressures on the parks resources have increased dramatically. yet many of the parks have no resource management plan. and no baseline data. Without documentation of the resource. it is difficult or impossible for the Park Service to identify the incremental changes caused by overuse. pollution. or both. The legislation introduced today will ensure that each unit of the National Park Service devises a resource management plan providing an inventory of significant resources and their current condition and identifying current and potential problems for protection and management. With this data. the parks.will be able to devise a program to prevent and reduce the degradation of the resource base so vital to this Nations heritage. Secretary Watt implemented a $1 billion parks restoration and improvement project to improve and refurbish the National Park Service user facilities in 1982. The project is nearly complete. It is time that the Congress addresses itself to the resource base itself. We must do all we can to protect the resources within the Nations national parks. we otherwise risk degrading our heritage.9 By Mr. MITCHELL:",

February 24 marked the 68th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Estonia. Under the dominion of the Soviet Union. the Estonians are unable to celebrate this special day. Estonia has had a very turbulent history. Prior to World War I. many foreign armies invaded and illegally occupied this country. At the end of World War I. Estonia acquired its independence after engaging in a war with the Bolshevik Russians. Unfortunately. this period of freedom was very short lived. In 1940. the Soviet Union illegally seized and occupied the Estonian Republic and incorporated it into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. After all they have been through. the people of Estonia have not given up their struggle for sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union. The United States has never recognized Estonia as Soviet territory. Estonians have suffered tremendously under the rule of the Soviet Union. Many Estonians met their deaths from 1939 to 1949 as they struggled for freedom. During this tragic period. onethird of the entire Estonian population either died or fled their beloved country. Thousands of Estonians have been slaughtered and imprisoned in slave labor camps or committed to \"psychiatric\" institutes. The Soviets have ruptured the Estonian way of life by practicing a Russification program. This program involves removing the Estonians from their homeland and relocating many Russians to Estonia. Only about 60 percent of the native Estonians presently live in their homeland. The Soviet Union continues to show total disregard for even the most basic of human rights of the Estonian people. Even after 46 years. Estonians have not given up their fight for sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union.

Mr. Brookes points out that \"with at least four major levels of taxing authority (city. county. State. and Federal). there is simply no way to avoid taxes on taxes.\" Mr. Brookes correctly goes on to point out that \"The genius of the Federal system. which promotes the one thing monopolistic government lacks. dynamic competition. is in fact deliberately undermined by this deduction.\" Mr. President. the arguments raised by Mr. Brookes in this and his other articles on the subject clearly demonstrate the fairness issue involved in deductibility.

This comprehensive approach to resource management affords much needed protection to vulnerable wildlife habitat. vegetation. historic structures. as well as other park resources. The four major elements of this 10year program include: Preservation and revitalization of park resources. provision for monitoring and researching activities to enable the Park Service to better understand park resources and alert it to emerging resource pressures so it can respond in a timely and effective manner. preparation of resources management plans providing for periodic. systemwide reports on resource conditions. and the provision for an increased staff and for training in natural and cultural resource management. Over the past several years. we have made significant advances to protect our environment but the job of environmental protection is far from finished. We need continued vigilance to see that past gains are not lost. We need innovative ideas to deal with problems that have not been addressed before. It is imperative that legislation such as this is adopted so that the National Park System is afforded the highest degree of protection. Resource management is a fundamental component to the preservation and enhancement of natural beauty.9",

During the past 9 months. the President has declared national emergencies in three areas. Nicaragua. South Africa. and most recently In Libya. In each case the President also imposed emergency economic sanctions. such as the trade embargo with Nicaragua. The President acted in all three Instances under the authority of the National Emergencies Act [NEA]. enacted in 1976 and amended in 1985. and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [IEEPA]. enacted in 1977. These statutes were enacted in the aftermath of Watergate and sought to subject the Presidents use of emergency powers to strict procedural limitations. Specifically. the President is required to do two things. The President is required to consult with Congress before acting under the NEA and the IEEPA and consult regularly once the actions have been carried out. Second. the President is required to transmit reports to Congress at the time of the initial action and every 6 months thereafter. In addition to the Presidential requirements. the Congress has the option to consider a joint resolution on whether to continue the current emergency actions. The essence of my legislation is twofold. First of all. I would require a more detailed report from the President outlining specific areas I believe should be reported. I believe this more specific information is essential in order for Congress to understand the total picture and decide on whether a vote on this issue Is warranted. Contained within my legislation is a timetable for this action. I have introduced this bill because I do not believe the President or the Congress have fulfilled their duties concerning the original intent of the NEA and the IEEPA. I believe our President should be held accountable and the Congress must respond to this explanation.",

The Rehabilitation Act is very important. Mr. Speaker. It provides the mechanism by which the States and the Federal Government have maintained a successful partnership for a number of years. This partnership has worked to the benefit of our economy by providing employmentrelated assistance to individuals who are disabled. thereby increasing the contributions by such individuals to our economy. It also helps some persons with disabilities maintain a level of independence that adds immeasurably to the quality of their lives. and thus. enriches us all. The Subcommittee on Select Education has held five hearings around the country and in Washington. We have heard from many witnesses. representing individuals. governments. and rehabilitation organizations. Out of these many helpful discussions have come the suggestions that are now incorporated in this proposed reauthorization bill. I referred to the changes as \"modest.\" Witnesses pointed out a variety of problem issues that minor statutory changes could resolve. For example. this bill modifies the definition of local agency in order to ensure that Indian organizations are included in this definition. Other examples of such modest changes would include adding a requirement that the annual report go to the Congress simultaneously with its delivery to the President and making the language genderfree.",

The United States operates a uranium enrichmen! program through the Department of Energy. and it is intended to be fully selfsufficient through the revenues it generates from the customers it serves. In the recent past. the demand for uranium enrichment services has been substantially reduced causing a significant retrenchment in the Governments program and the closure of one of the Governments three uranium enrichment plants in the United States. Soviet Union sales of enrichment services to domestic utilities impair the ability of the United States to continue its uranium enrichment program. which the United States operates without a profit for the benefit of electric ratepayers. The Soviet Union does not operate its uranium enrichment business on the principles of a free market society. They offer this enrichment services at a discount from whatever level is established as the price of enrichment services in the United States. The Soviet Union is an unfair competitor and enrichment service sales to U.S. citizens detract from the national energy security of the United States. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker.

This is the same hazardous waste dump. Mr. Speaker. that the Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly cited for violating the Federal laws which govern the safe disposal of toxics. Because of the significant violations against Kettleman Hills. EPA barred the facility from receiving any Superfund wastes. EPA took the right action. The Agency wants to ensure that Superfund wastes do not go to facilities like Kettleman Hills which may themselves become future Superfund sites. Despite EPAs action against Kettleman Hills. Federal agencies have continued to dump huge quantities of poisons at the facility. The Secretary of Defense and other Federal agency heads must stop this practice immediately. Failurp to do so creates a potential future legal liability for the Federal Government and threat to the public health. In addition. Mr. Speaker. this incident points out the need for the Congress to put EPA in charge of the cleanup of all Superfund sites. including the cleanup of military Superfund sites like McClellan. currently exempt by Executive order.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1986 reported from the Committee on Appropriations on July 25 recommends a total of $1.599.338.800 for the upcoming fiscal year. That is a reduction of $728.338 from levels provided for fiscal year 1985. and a reduction of $183.916.200. or 10.3 percent from the budget request. With those reductions. I believe we have complied with both the Presidents desire for a 10percent reduction in the legislative branch. and the assumption of a 10percent reduction implied by the first concurrent resolution on the budget as passed by the Senate. Our committee bill also compares favorably with that passed by the other body. Exclusive of items pertaining strictly to the House and Senate. including funding for office buildings provided through the Architect of the Capitol. the committee recommends a total of $820.494.000. while the Housepassed bill would provide $824.920.000. So this bill is $4.426.000 below the House bill in that respect. To look at it another way. Mr. President. the bill as reported by the committee recommends a total of $309.291.800 for the Senate. including amounts of Senate Office Building. which is a reduction of $23.140.200. or 7 percent from the request. The other body would provide a total of $469.553.000 for items pertaining solely to the House. including House Of ice Buildings. a reduction of $27.201.000. or 5.4 percent. from the request. Without in anyway impugning the work of the other body. Mr. President. I believe the Senate can propcrly say it has done a little bit better Job in taking its share of the reductions necessary to achieve meaningful deficit reduction. There is no reason to kid anyone. Mr. President. Reductions of this magnitude are going to change some plans for fiscal year 1986 and force some cutbacks. But the committee believes such actions are necessary. and will not cause undue disruption in the services provided to Congress and the rest of the Government by the support agencies. or in our service to the people we represent.

    "speech": "I thank the Chair. Just as I have thought of that proposal I have also thought of all the problems it brings into play. There are many problems that should be looked at. I assure the sponsor and the cosponsors of the amendment that it is my intention to have the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee begin joint hearings at the earliest possible date this year on the entire Budget Impoundment and Control Act and the recommendation for a 2year budget cycle. It is also my intention to do whatever I can. as a result of those hearings. to recommend to the U.S. Senate whatever amendments that joint effoit yields to improve the budget process for the U.S. Senate. Obviously. whatever we look at has to be enacted by both Houses because. I do not think Congress could have one budget for one House and one for the other. although of late it appears that we are trying to do thatto have one for the House and one for the Senate. At least. the House thinks it might work. Obviously. if It were that easy. it would never have needed a substantive law. and several years of work that many Senators like the Senator from West Virginia. ROBERT C. BYRD and 10 or 15 others spent on it. I give my colleagues these assurances. and I commend them for their genuine concern. I understand their frustration. and I submit. in closing. that the frustration is commensurate with the nature of the problem. and the nature of the problem is far more the size of the deficit than it is the budget process in general. If there were a will. Congress could do almost anything it wanted to do. The problem is that to find a collective will to address these deficits is difficult these days. It is amazing how many votes we have on issues that are allegedly in the budget which are not in the budget. which are not to be carried out by the budget. and that makes the process very difficult for Members. I do not know if we can resolve such issues. but we should consider it. I have to return to the conference on the budget. for the seventh different format. and I wonder whether the Senator from Indiana has any further questions of the Senator from New Mexico.",

I think under the rules that were set up under the Congressional Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974 that jurisdiction on any modification within this area is the responsibility of the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee. As a matter of fact. I think the first chairman of the Budget Committee. Chairman Muskie. was responsible for those decisions. So I would hesitate to modify and add other committees. But certainly it would be the intent of this individual and I am confident of the chairman. the Senator from New Mexico. that we would want to involve other distinguished Members of the Senate. certainly the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. who has. as he has rightly pointed out. been long interested in a 2year budget. I would hope that he and the distinguished Senator from Indiana would be among the earliest witnesses before the Joint hearings which the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and myself agreed to hold. But I think under the rules of the legislation those are quite clearly spelled out as to where the responsibility lies. It would not be appropriate at this time to modify them. But again let me say that I. like the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. have for many years been a strong advocate of a 2year proposal. I think that this is an idea whose time has come and deserves a most careful consideration by the two committees. Certainly. speaking only for myself. I would welcome the participation of the Senator from Kentucky in the hearings and in the deliberations as well.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to submit today an amendment calling for appropriation of funds for the creation of an American International Narcotics Control Commission. No threat strikes America as savagely and as frequently as that of illegal narcotics. Its deadly impact is felt in failed education. lowered productivity. impaired national defense. increased violent crime. addiction. and death. To combat this threat effectively. we must use a threepronged approach: We must eradicate. we must educate. and we must cut off drugs at the source. In order to achieve the eradication of drug abuse in our Nation. we must fight the battle against illicit narcotics simultaneously on all three fronts. and in so doing we must use every weapon at our disposal. A most useful weapon would be an American International Narcotics Control Commission. designed to monitor and promote international compliance with narcotics control treaties. including those involving eradication. money laundering. and terrorism. This Commission would also monitor and encourage U.S. Government and private programs seeking to expand international cooperation against drug abuse and narcotics trafficking. The Commission would be comprised of Members of the U.S. Senate. and individuals from the private sector. The President of the United States will participate in the activities of the Commission by submitting a semiannual report with regard to the status of international compliance with narcotics control treaties. the initial report to be submitted 6 months after the date of enactment of this proposal. In turn. the Commission is authorized and directed to report to the Congress on a periodic basis. and at the end of each fiscal year the Commission will submit to the Congress a report on its expenditures. Mr. President. a wellstructured and wellsupported entity such as the American International Narcotics Control Commission would be of invaluable assistance in the battle against drug abuse. Providing adequate funding for this Commission would ensure the creation of an international forum for consideration of narcotics control efforts worldwide. and would enable my colleagues in the U.S. Congress to express their concern in this most vital of issues. Mr. President. as we all work together to achieve the eradication of drug abuse in our Nation. I wish to take this opportunity to urge that favorable and expeditious action be taken on the funding request for the creation of an American International Narcotics Control Commission.",

Mount Carmel Church has stood as a symbol of the great strides made by Poughkeepsies Italian Immigrants. who have enriched the Queen City along the majestic Hudson River since the early 1900s. Those immigrants came to this country to find employment opportunities and liberty. One of the first things they did after arriving in this country was to build a church. which would become Mount Carmel Roman Catholic Church. Using borrowed money. construction started on a yellow brick structure. At the outset. Mount Carmel became one of Poughkeepsies national churches. serv. Ing one of the citys numerous ethnic groups. But it was more than just a place of worship. It was the community meeting placea place where neighbors talked. exchanged Ideas. and planned for the future. In 1932. at the direction of the late Bishop Joseph Pernicone. who was Mount Carmels young pastor at the time. the church community built a school. which was dedicated in 1935. Since that time. 2.500 students have passed through the schools halls. Again. it was the community that raised the money in the beginning to operate the school. The church and school still stand In Poughkeepsies little Italy. Many of the areas former residents return to their old neighborhood regularly. Mount Carmel and the community It serves have realized an American dream. Through hard work and perseverance. the children of the first immigrants have become part of this countrys culture.

PROCLAMATION: Lupus AWARENESS WEEK Whereas. there are approximately one million Americans who are victims of lupus and it is estimated that over 55.000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Although not well know. lupus is more prevalent than muscular dystrophy. cerebral palsy. multiple sclerosis. leukemia. cystic fibrosis and other highly visible and better known diseases. Ninety percent of lupus patients are women. with the average age of onset being 16 to 30. It affects all races and lupus strikes one woman in about every 400. and Whereas. the cause of lupus is not known. and its initial diagnosis is difficult to make since there is no single set of symptoms or pattern to the disease. Lupus is not cancerous or infectious. Recent studies indicate distinct hereditary factors exist. and Whereas. in recent years. the outlook for lupus patients has improved due to extensive and vigorous research and positive results have emerged from studies uncovering several diverse defects of the immune system and from research on genetic and environmental factors influencing the disease. Therefore. I. Ed Herschler. Governor of Wyoming. in recognition of the need for greater public awareness of lupus. do hereby proclaim the week of October 20 through October 26. 1985. as \"Lupus Awareness Week\".",

It is with tremendous pleasure that I am able to add my voice to the chorus of gratitude expressed by her colleagues and many friends. An outstanding educator. Sister Mary DePaul entered the convent at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. MO. in 1927. She has taught thousands of children in eight different schools over the years and her message has always been the same. Sister Mary DePaul instills in her students that regardless of scholastic ability. each stu. dent is special. She has the knack to make the less capable student feel as proud as the straight A pupil. A foreign language specialist. Sister Mary DePaul taught several other classes besides German language and culture. She was at different times a mathematics. English. and social studies teacher.

Programs. like people. grow over the years so that each birthday marks another milestone along the path toward maturity. In the case of these two programs. much has been learned and changed. but much more can be done in the future. Let us. just for a moment. go back to 1965. It was a time of economic expansion and a belief in abundance. It was in this environment that Medicare and Medicaid were created in order to protect those who were most in need of help: the elderly and the poor. Now. 20 years later. Medicare Insures 95 percent of all older persons. regardless of their income or their assets. Medicaid provides medical assistance for those with low incomes and for the bulk of nursing home care. Without these programs. the elderly and indigent would be at risk of catastrophic illness. many would not be able to seek adequate care. But that is not to say that all the battles have been fought. In fact. like the maturing programs that they are. Medicare and Medicaid represent only a beginning. There is much left to be done. The elderly are paying large sums of money for outofpocket care under Medicareover $1.500 per person. That must be remedied. The cost of medicine and prosthetic devices are not included under Medicare and therefore create a financial hardship for the elderly. That must be reme. died. There is not a coordinated. comprehensive system of longterm care. That must be remedied. In 15 short years. this Nation will enter the 21st century.

Ptach [Parents for Torah for All Children] is an organization that establishes special education programs for learning disabled Jewish students in Yeshivot and day schools around the country. Learning disabled children are prefectly capable of succeeding in the academic community. yet they require personal attention to maximize their potential. Ptach programs provide this individualized academic remediation and support services to enable these youngsters to remain in the mainstream of their Yeshiva. Ptach graduates have pursued higher education and a variety of careers becoming productive members of the Jewish community and society at large. Today there are 16 Ptach programs in operation in elementary and high school level Yeshivot serving over 400 children in the New York area alone. The cost to support these programs is enormous. averaging $10.000 per student per year. far more than most parents can afford to pay. Ptach must rely heavily on private donations in order to keep these vital programs afloat. For hundreds of learning disabled Jewish children. Ptach opens the door to a brighter. more promising future. I would like to place in the REcoRD an article that recently appeared in the New York Times about the fine work of Ptach.

Shcharansky has protested in the last way available to him. by a hunger strike. while exiled internally in the Soviet Union. His valiant and devoted wife Avital. who herself had a difficult time leaving the Soviet Union. testified just yesterday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. explaining how the Soviet Union seeks to exploit her husband. It addresses the situation of all Soviet Jews. who face truncated opportunity within the Soviet Union. and limited chances to leave that country. As these courageous individuals have encountered Soviet discrimination. they have become activists on behalf of their coreligionists. with the result that tbey face persecution and terrible treatment at the hands of the Soviet State. Vladimir and Maria Slepak. Ida Nudel. Yosef Begun. and Vladimir Felstman. are just a few of the thousands who face Soviet heavyhandedness.

The old question. which my friend from Alaska has brought up again. is the question which was debated many. many years ago: The question of whether effective water or air pollution requirements ought to be based on the capacity of the receiving air or the receiving water. or ought to be based on effluent and the effective control of that effluent. I suggest to my friend from Alaska that this question. debated many years ago. was decided many years ago and decided clearly and successively at both State and Federal levels. We decided not to leave the opportunity in any circumstance. and I am not suggesting that the Sitka mill is such a circumstance. to use up all of the receiving waters or the receiving air but rather that each one would be requested and required to use the best treatment possible on their own effluent to retain the highest quality air and water in the area.

I simply go back to the nexttothelast remark I made: the people of the United States. through Congress. when they passed the Clean Water Act. based it on a technology standard. not a quality of receiving waters standard. The reason they did so. primarily. was to avoid questions about unfair competition between one mill and another. that one mill could claim that the waters were not adversely affected. and therefore avoid an investment which other mills had to make. It is the fundamental policy of the law of the United States. Here we have an entity which seeks to avoid the expenses which its competitors have undertaken by asking the people of the United States to pay for that compliance. I do not think that proper.

There are. in Alabama. many depressed areas and depressed cities where. because of the War Between the States. there is still a hangover. There is a hangover from Reconstruction.

I agree that we must cut the budget wherever possible and reasonable. but I also believe we must protect essential community and development programs of proven value which continue to be vitally needed by communities and our people throughout the country. One of these programs is the Urban Development Action Grant Program. It has been an excellent one for my home State of West Virginia and for other States which have suffered substantial economic devastation in the recent recession. In concept. this program provides seed money or leveraging funds to bring investment by the private sector into economically devastated areas. In my home State of West Virginia. the unemployment level reached 21 percent in the nottoodistant past. Absent the UDAG Program and the help which it and other community and regional development programs have provided we would. undoubtedly. not have been able to lower this level to the present level of around 15 percenta level which remains unacceptably high. Since the UDAG programs inception in fiscal year 1978. it has provided funding for 17 projects in West Virginia. amounting to $40 million. These funds have leveraged an investment into the State of almost $200 million in private sector funding. along with the creation of 5.500 permanent jobs. With the continued help of such programs as UDAG. we can continue to move forward. Without them. I fear that we will revert to a downslide in our economy and quality of life. We need this type of incentive program. It is a good program with a proven track record. There Is much remaining to be done. and I call upon my colleagues to join in support for the continuance of this program at a responsible level of funding.",

This is one of the Presidents programs that called for termination. He actually said let us terminate 23. This is one of them. When the Senate passed our budget bill we had only terminated 13. When we came back from conference in the House we only had terminated two. and only one single program. So I compliment our colleagues. We are talking about $352 million. You know. it is not just $352 million in 1 years appropriation. but also you might say our children will be paying. and we will be paying about $32 million per year in interest to finance this. The Senator from Virginia is aware of it. If you look at your State grants that go into UDAG. you will find a lot of things that maybe you kind of questionwhether they really bear public scrutiny and value. So I hope that we would have the courage to actually terminate this program. I think it is wise. I think it is prudent. I think it is time that we start actually making more difficult decisions.

Mr. CRANSTON. for their efforts to provide our Nations servicedisabled veterans with a fair and equitable cost of living increase in 1986. S. 1887. the Veterans Compensation and Benefits Improvements Act of 1985. will allow more than 2.2 million veterans to enjoy a 3.1percent increase in their benefit checks this year. This is the same COLA that will be provided to Social Security beneficiaries and to VA pension recipients. I would like to remind my colleagues that the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution assumed that Social Security. veterans compensation. and veterans pension benefits would be provided an identical increase in 1986. Thus. S. 1887 is consistent with the assumptions and intent of the budget resolution. As my colleagues go to conference with the House on this bill. I urge them not only to complete action as expeditiously as possible. but also to maintain the Senates position on the amount of the COLA. The House companion bill provides a 3.7percent COLA for veterans compensation recipients. this is above the actual costofliving increase being provided for indexed programs in 1986. While no one can deny that these brave men and women deserve an increase in 1986. I do not think that any veteran expects to receive a COLA in excess of the actual inflation rate. especially when our Nations Social Security and pension beneficiaries. including disability recipients. will receive a 3.1percent increase. Mr. President. I raise this issue today because we will soon begin conference with the House on the reconciliation bill. As with S. 1887. the House and Senate reconciliation packages differ significantly with regards to veterans benefits and services. Both bills contain significant reforms to veterans medical care. including a means test and third party reimbursement provisions. However. the House version significantly expands medical care for most veterans. I remind my colleagues that as we search for ways to reduce the deficitas we are doing now with GrammRudman and reconciliationthis is not the time to expand benefits or increase spending. Although the distinguished ranking minority member of the Senate Budget Committee. Mr. CHILES. cannot be here today. I know that he shares my views.

Our staff has met at length with their staff. We have listened to their concerns. We have been more than fair in terms of process.

It is about the section 404 permit program. Some Senators for months now have been holding the Dawson nomination hostage to extract concessions from Mr. Dawson about this program. I even understand that some of the opposition to Mr. Dawson relates to individual permit actions in particular States which have been controversial. Now that the nomination is being considered. the same Senators say they oppose the nomination.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today. along with my distinguished colleague from Illinois to introduce a bill to amend the bankruptcy code to prevent the discharge of administratively ordered support obligations. The bill would amend the bankruptcy amendments contained in Public Law 98353. and would fill a gap that currently permits discharge of certain spouse and child support debts through a bankruptcy declaration. We enacted the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act. Public Law 98353. in 1984. Section 454(b) of the act clarifies section 523(a)(5) of title 11. United States Code. to eliminate loopholes that formerly had allowed the discharge of spousal or child support debts through a judgment of bankruptcy. Before the enactment of Public Law 98353. only support debts created in separations. divorce decrees. or property settlements were protected from discharge by bankruptcy. The bankruptcy amendment extended the protection to debts established in other orders of a court of record. thereby preventing discharge in cases where a marriage has never taken place. for example. support awarded as a result of a court paternity determination. Through inadvertence. however. the bankruptcy amendment did not contain a provision to protect support obligations established in State administrative proceedings. Administrative proceedings are used by approximately 16 States to determine paternity suits and establish and enforce support obligations. Administrative proceedings have proved to be an effective and efficient procedure for resolving those disputes. It would be unfortunate if we were to prevent the States from using these procedures by denying protection from discharge by bankruptcy for administrative support judgments. The efficient adjudication of paternity and support suits. and the enforcement of legally established support judgments. are of crucial importance to the economic health of our Nation. Senator SIMON and I have drawn the bill to protect State administrative support judgments from discharge by bankruptcy. and thereby to encourage the States to resolve those suits as quickly as possible through efficient administrative forums. The bill is strongly endorsed by the Department of Health and Human Services. I ask unanimous consent that both the text of the bill and a letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services appear in the RECORD.",

The Soviets first got possession of the island in the usual waythey occupied it through military force in 1924and since 1981 the State Department has been trying to legitimize the occupation. There was some fear that the final closing on the transaction might be undertaken at the ReaganGorbachev meeting. but as near as we can tell that did not occur.

For 5 long years we have achieved no new meaningful nuclear arms limits. now the DOD Secretary Weinberger suggests that we go backward. Weinberger advises Reagan to pursue the star wars.SDI Program. disavow the 1972 ABM Treaty and the SALT II accords. belittles past Presidents arms agreements and the Soviet compliance to existing accords. Mr. Speaker. the Congress and our Nation deserve far better and want progress on the agenda of nuclear arms reduction. Just avoiding the rehashed Weinberger issues is not good enough. We should expect the summit to set in motion new meaningful nuclear arms reductions and grant the proper perspective on past agreementsnot the gratuitous undercutting of the past Presidents achievements or the overblown rhetoric concerning Soviet compliance. The Weinberger letter is clearly extremest rhetoric that has led the American. and world. media on a wild goose chase. Nothing in this Weinberger letter or Secretary Shultz reaction concerning continued SALT II compliance is newand if indeed the President were to take this advice we would have an unravelling of current nuclear limitations. Then why this outburst? Is the Reagan administration at war with itself? Hardly. What is being attempted and really quite successfully. is manipulation of the news. This not only makes President Reagan look moderate. but provides a safe harbor when he comes up empty. Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. In other words. at least he did not accept Weinbergers advice. Frankly. that type of conclusion just wont do. There is no substitute for meaningful progress at this summit when both the Americans and Soviets have offered significant cuts in nuclear weapons.

I strongly support retaining a capital gains differential for all timber producers. this tax reform retains a capital gains differential for incorporated timber producers and it is unfair not to do so for noncorporate timber producers as well. All timber producers deserve the same tax treatment on capital gains. Capital gains is justified for timber producers because they take real longterm risks. unlike the investor who simply buys stock in IBM and holds that stock for 6 months. Timber producers must maintain their investments for several decades before they \ufffdee a return. This is precisely the type of risktaking that the capital gains exclusion should reward. Timber producers. both corporate and noncorporate. will receive the benefits of lower tax rates. but they lose the benefits of the investment tax credit. For some timber producers. the reductions in tax rates will not offset the value of the ITC if there is no capital gains exclusion. The U.S. timber industry is suffering already from unfair. subsidized foreign competitors. I am hopeful that the administration will reverse its position on Canadian Government timber subsidies and that this issue can be resolved long before the current negotiations on a United StatesCanadian free trade zone are concluded. But we can at least ensure that this tax reform bill does not aggravate the plight of the U.S. timber industry. I am distressed that the Senate will not have an opportunity to vote directly on the capital gains issue. The parliamentary rules of the Senate have been manipulated to prevent a direct vote on timber capital gains. This doubles the unfairness for those of us who support the efforts of timber producers to be competitive and prosperous.*",

Constant changing of the rules in the tax laws creates unstability for decision making in industry. in business. and in individuals. A nonchanging Tax Code offers stability for the decisionmakeis of America. We need to frustrate the tax increasers. We need to frustrate the Tax Code changers and encourage stability. We are creating in this bill the opportunity for greater savings. rewards. incentives. investments. fairness. equity. capital formation. entrepreneurship. Job creation. and trade. But how long is it going to last? Is it going to last 6 months. 1 year. 2 years? We need to give this new law a chance. secure it from the spurofthemoment kneejerk congressional changes. We have all listened to the questions and the concerns registered here in Congress. back in our States and across the United States. But I would wager to say that the last question or statement made by any individual or group was. \"All right. Senator. I can and I will live with the law and the new tax rates. but please. please dont change the rules later on.\" Stability. permanency and. reliability. is now needed as a final touch to this tax reform bill. Who can run America best? Not the Government. But instead the American people can provided they are left alone. Senator PACKWOOD and Senator LONG have asked us throughout this debate to keep the bill intact. I agree. After 4 p.m. today. when we vote on final passage. after the conference committees meet and come up with the final bill. after it is ratified by both the House and Senate. and after the signing ceremony at the White House. then it is Americas turn. Let us give it to America and then back off for at least 5 years. If the bill Is good. and it is. let us take it one step further. Let us guarantee certainty. Let us crown this bill with a resolution of fairness and stability. Mr. President.",

The fact is that El Portal is an area of land outside of Yosemite National Park. and all of us who have visited Yosemite are familiar with the problems that occur on the Yosemite valley floor. especially with the amount of housing both for concessionaire employees and by the public employees that serve this park. The fact is that some of the conditions of the housing in the valley floor were such that they were among the poorest housing. the poorest public housing. in all of California. It was really a scandal. In the late 1950s. the U.S.N.P.S. actually purchased some land outside of the park where we would construct public housing for the park employees and for concessionaires. The fact of the matter is. though. that the law only provided for 55year leases. This legislation provides for 99year leases. that the banks and other financial entities suggest will be adequate in order to actually finance and to loan the money for any type of housing that might be built. The hope today is that with the amendments that have been made in this measure we are considering and the way this measure is written. once and finally. we will really move some of the housing out of the floor so that the Yosemite valley can be unimpeded and available to the tourists and the many other hundreds of thousands of people who enter that valley floor each year. visiting the park.",

Federal employees. including all of us in this room. will get an extra day off with pay. I say rather privileged only in the sense that Federal employees on average get more days off with pay than people in the private sector. It is quite true that probably private businesses will not give the day off. Therefore the day of contemplation. or merrymaking. or whatever we are going to do to honor the Constitution. is going to have to be confined to Federal employees. rather than to the public at large. I believe the Constitution is bigger than this bill. I believe the Constitution should be an object of honor. not a means of featherbedding. It ought to be honored by all citizens at all times. There are going to be plenty of serious. justified celebrations in 1987.

However. they estimate that expenditure to be $27 million. It is not the $4.5 billion that my colleague from Pennsylvania indicated. I might add that this estimate would be further reduced since the holiday does not include the postal employees. It just seems to me that $27 million for something that has kept 200 years of peace and prosperity. has given us the strongest Nation in the world. a document that was written at a time when horses and carriages were the means of transportation. instead of rockets to the Moon. and here we are still living by that Constitution.

It would seem to me that $27 million is a very small price to pay for what I consider to be a very significant day. because without that Constitution God knows where this country would be today. So it is to that end that I ask that we support this measure. I think it is important. I know that come 1987 that we are going to have a big celebration in the city of Philadelphia. I might add.

This legislation. identical to that introduced by Representatives FOGLIETTA. BOGGS. and myself. would make September 17. 1987. a onetime national holiday to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. James Madison once boasted that the \"American Constitution would accomplish a revolution which has no parallels in the annals of human society.\" The Constitution has lived up to Madisons expectation. The document which provides the framework for our laws and beliefs has matured and met the challenges of a growing nation without infringing on individual freedoms. In 1983. I introduced the original House legislation to create a Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. The purpose of the Commission. as described in section 3 of Public Law 98101. is to \"promote and coordinate activities to commemorate the bicentennial of the Constitution.\" The Commission hopes that it will be able to stimulate thousands of organizations at the grassroots level to educate the public on the Constitution and the unique aspects of this document which ensures freedom under law. In an effort to facilitate this grassroots celebration. the 23member Bicentennial Commission. chaired by Chief Justice Burger. unanimously approved a resolution endorsing the onetime holiday bill. Following Senate passage on a bipartisan basis. it is now up to the House of Representatives to determine whether or not the 200th anniversary of our Constitution receives the celebration that it so richly deserves. I hope that the House of Representatives will fall in line in this patriotic legislative effort. In closing. it should be remembered that while our Nation may be one of the younger nations in the world. it has the oldest. relatively unchanged. form of government in the entire world. The U.S. Constitution is considered such an act of genius that it is the most frequently used constitutional model for developing and restructuring countries. Almost 200 years ago. the framers of our Constitution fashioned a nearly perfect instrument of government. one that has demonstrated the remarkable capacity to adapt to a changing world. The Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution of the United States desperately needs the support of the 99th Congress to ensure that proper recognition and tribute is paid to this truly great achievement.

I would just like to make sure that they all get recognized. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Arizona. . my chairman. for all of the help and the encouragement that he has given to me and to other members of the committee to get this problem resolved. because. as was witnessed. as so many in this Congress as Members of the California delegation have fought over these projects. and had their disagreements. we have seen the State of California fall further and further behind in the rational development of its resources that are so essential to its economic growth.

President Reagan wants to do as little as possible. as late as possible. For 51/2 years. the Reagan administration has been soft on South Africa. Over and over we have heard soothing words about quiet diplomacy. constructive engagement. and restraint. Is this the kind of language that the South African Government understands? Did that Government use restraint in detaining over 5.000 men. women and children under the state of emergency declared this past June? Have the South African police used restraint as they fired shotgun blasts at unarmed demonstratorsand then attacked the funerals of the people they killed? Was South Africa thinking of constructive engagement when it starved the people of Lesotho into submission. overthrew their government. and installed a quisling regime? Since the collapse of Nazi Germany. South Africa has been the only country on Earth whose legal and political system is based on explicit. systematic. and allencompassing racial discrimination. It is the only country that occupies a United Nations trust territoryNamibiain violation of international law. South Africa has an unparalleled record of aggression against its neighbors. It has mounted air and ground attacks against Botswana. Zimbabwe. Mozambique. Swaziland. Angola. and Zambia. killing hundreds of people and causing some $10 billion in damage. South Africa. the richest power in the region. has done more than any other to keep its neighbors destitute. South Africa has shown its contempt for quiet diplomacy and constructive engagement. We have no choice but to show a firmer hand. Last year President Reagan stopped a sanctions bill with a token Executive order. This year he waited until the last minute to veto a strong antiapartheid bill. The days of too little. too late are over. The Presidents veto wont stop this bill. We will override his veto in both houses of this Congress. This is one bill that wont get lost in the lastminute crunch. There is a growing consensus in this country. In cities and towns and State legislatures across America. people are saying no to apartheid. They are saying no to institutionalized racism. Now we in the Congress are joining that consensus. We must take the necessary action to bring about progressive change in South Africa now. I urge my colleagues to vote to override the Presidents veto.",

I voted with the majority of the Members of this House for last years bill. which imposed a number of restrictions on our dealings with the South African Government. However. the bill before us today simply goes too far. and unduly interferes with the Presidents ability to conduct our foreign policy. Beyond that. I just dont believe that the sanctions contained in the bill will have the effect that its sponsors anticipate. In the Philippines. we supported successfully a peaceful transition from autocratic rule to a democracy through our great political leverage over the Marcos government. But. this does not parallel the situation in South Africa. Our already limited political and economic influence over the South Africans will be further reduced by the punitive sanctions contained in this bill. We will not end apartheid any faster by exerting this type of economic pressure. because the South Africans will simply withdraw. as they have always done in the past. and become more selfsufficient and less amenable to outside persuasion. Further. the disruption to the South African economy causes by these sanctions will serve to support the efforts of the Communistdominated ANC in their attempt to violently overthrow the current government. In essence these sanctions will create more black unemployment. reduce the influence of the forces of moderation that are working for peaceful change. and fuel the tragic cycle of violence gripping South Africa. This is a clear case of bowing to the passions of the moment by cutting off our nose to spite our face. Only it is not our noses that will suffer. from our actions. it is the good people. black and white. in South Africa who will suffer. Mr. Speaker.

I saw black people branded with passbooks that had to be on their person at all times. or God save them from the consequences. And 27 years later. what has changed? Ten years after Soweto. what has changed? Five years after constructive engagement. what has changed? Nothing has changed. Mr. Speaker. nothing. Blacks are still secondclass. or really thirdclass citizens in their own country. Socalled radicals are still jailed in the name of preserving law and order. And the hopes of those seeking peaceful change and justice are still snuffed out like a candle in a gale. The bill before us today is already a compromise.

I believe today we have an opportunity to provide a moral and diplomatic wakeup call for a President who does not understand the issue. Black South Africans are already the victims. they are suffering under apartheid and they know that sanctions may hurt. but they also know that apartheid kills. Over 130 per month this year. Why is it today we are having such a difficult time understanding that? I cannot for the life of me understand why our President will not listen to the majority. to the Desmond Tutus. to the mine workers. to the black labor leaders. to the Soweto mothers? And why does he listen to P.W. Botha. who says to us the blacks will suffer. Second. the President said the neighboring states will suffer. Well. the neighboring states have issued a joint communique including. some of them having imposed their own sanctions. They know what is in their best interests. Is it not interesting that we know what is in their best interests better than they do? Then finally the President said we would just be morally posturing. Well. let me tell you something. my friends: Sometime we need to feel good about who we are. what we stand for and what we participate in. And that is why in 20 nations around the world we have imposed sanctions. We did not ask about the victims in Nicaragua. we did not ask about the victims in Cuba. Libya. Poland. Afghanistan or Iran. Why? Because we wanted to stand for something. Let me tell you something else to those who are concerned about Marxism. This Congressman is concerned about Marxism. too. but you do not stop the spread of communism by supporting racism. Today we have a choice. We can stand with P.W.

The United States has expressed its outrage over apartheidfailing a response from Pretoriawe must express out sentiments in stronger language. For the United States to be a credible voice in Africa and the Third World. we must speak and act plainly. Our opposition to apartheid should be viewed as sincere and tangible. I regard the Presidents policy of constructive engagement as a valid attempt to address the repressive and segregatory apartheid. Unfortunately. the reality is that Pretoria has not responded to our efforts in a manner acceptable of an ally. To the contrary. the situation is only deteriorating. Judging from the amount of time this policy has been in effect. and Pretorias intransigent response to our patient diplomatic efforts. I now feel that the United States must take a stronger stance on this issue and send a more powerful message of disapproval to the South African Government. I continue to believe that by accepting the Senate version of this bill. we will not be \"washing our hands of South Africa.\" as some more radical proponents of disengagement would suggest. We must retain a voice in that countrys affairs and use it constructively. The sanctions offered in the bill send a strong message of disapproval. but are not a punitive strike which will further inflame the situation in that state. Finally. Mr. Speaker. once these sanctions are in place. we cannot turn our backs on the South African citizens nor the South African Government in the belief that we have done all that we can do. Congress must have a longterm commitment to the resolution of this dilemma. and to bringing about a just and lasting peace to this troubled nation.",

In doing so. he turned his back on the millions of South Africans who are crusading for the freedom and justice now denied to them by their Government. Indeed. the President of the United States used the prestige and power of his office to sentence millions of South Africans to a life of terror and oppression. Now. it is up to the Congresswith the full backing and support of the American peopleto overturn this indecent decision by the President. The Congress did not easily reach the decision to impose economic sanctions on South Africa. knowing as we do the severity of such a policy. But. the intransigence of the South African Government and their rocksolid commitment to apartheid leaves us no alternative. What moral suasion do we have left? The elegant rhetoric and mild rebukes used thus far have produced no discernible progress. and no promises that conditions will improve tomorrow or the next day or the day after. Without this legislation. we have no policy in place to end apartheid. On the contrary. our inactivity breathes new life into a regime that understands all too well empty gestures and unkept promises. Ours is a nation which treasures justice. and. just as we have fought oppression at home. so must we reject a regime that would perpetuate oppression elsewhere. The South African Government is not my ally and it is not Americas ally. The Government spreads more evil than it can contain. The South African Government is not our bulwark against communism nor is it a guarantee of stability. No good can come of a morally corrupt regime. Therefore. let us not hesitate to act as one nation against apartheid. We must not cede to any President the right to seal the fate of millions to a life of poverty. of humiliation. and worst of all. of hopelessness. We can be proud when Congress overrides the Presidents veto. But. we can celebrate only when all South Africans are free. And so. let us begin.

At the heart of the matter has been the organized Government of South Africas willingness to treat human beings there like animals. with numbers and degradation by color.

Every single survey that has been taken has overwhelmingly indicated that the people oppose our imposition of sanctions.

Representative MICHAEL BARNES. who will be leaving public service at the end of the 99th Congress after a distinguished 8 years in the House of Representatives. While we come from different sides of the aisle. as Members of the House from the Metropolitan Washington area. MIKE BARNES and I have worked together on many issues of interest to the Washington community. He has been a fervent supporter of Federal employees and retirees and has worked tirelessly to protect their pay and benefits and focus attention on the importance of a quality Federal work force. We also have worked closely on area transportation issues and he has been a leader in the fight to continue the Federal commitment to build the regional Metro system. Several years ago. when the Potomac River which separates our Maryland and Virginia districts was siphoning people to their deaths in its treacherous \"drowning machine\" at the Little Falls Dam. MIKE joined with me in working with local and State officials and the Army Corps of Engineers to redesign the dam and save lives. This is an appropriate time. too. to salute MIKE BARNES for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen the drunk driving laws in our Nation. He was the driving force several years ago when Congress enacted a measure to cut off Federal highway aid to States that do not raise their drinking age to 21. The Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for his efforts to end the tragedy of \"blood borders\" which have taken the lives of so many young people. MIKE BARNES has been a valued and respected colleague and an outstanding public servant and I wish him well in his future endeavors as he returns to the private sector. where Im certain he will enjoy continued success.",

She doesnt speak loudly. but she does speak out.

This is an antisubsidy section of the law. an antisubsidy section of the law. Subsidies are now and have been illegal under international law and under U.S. law for so long a time that man cannot remember. What are we merely attempting to do here? Somehow our antisubsidy laws over the long years have been eroded by administrative interpretation and judicial interpretation and now a resource that a country finds in its treasury if it delivers it unfairly to a private producer is not counted as a subsidy anymore. but if they give a cash subsidy to a private producer. there is no doubt that it is a subsidy. I ask you this question. In practical effect. is there any difference in taking a resource subsidy out of your treasury. an inkind gift. and giving it away to a private business entity. or taking cash out of your treasury and giving it away to a private entity? That is the test that we are trying to meet. This is a generic piece of legislation. It does not deal with any specific type of resource. It just says that if you have got a resource in your treasury and you are giving it away or selling at less than fair market value. then you have got to pay the subsidy penalty.

Where there is an injury. there must be a corresponding remedy. Now. under our law of 1916. we do in fact have treble damages and criminal violations for illegal dumping. The fact is that this has never been exercised because the level of proof is so high that it was almost impossible to prove the case. and because you have to show specific intent. There is no violation of GATT. because this has already been grandfathered in long before GATT ever came into existence in 1948. Also. this is a private remedy. It is not between countries. It is between private parties. In regard to whether or not it applies to American companies. if they are benefiting by illegal dumping. putting factories and workers out of work in other parts of our country. they should be held responsible. We should have the same level of test for them that applies to anyone else. As far as lawyers are concerned. there are no legal fees that are prescribed in this particular bill. Also. it is going to be highly expensive to bring this kind of an action. It can only be brought after there has been a finding. a ruling by the ITC. It only goes back for 3 years for damages. There is a 2year statute of limitations. It has been very. very carefully thought out. Let me say it is the biggest deterrent we have in the 458 pages of our trade bill to assure protection to our industries here that are illegally being preyed upon by foreign companies that are forcing illegal practices on our companies and putting our people out of work. It is not consistent. It is not protectionism. It already exists in our law. and I think it is about time we did have an effective cause of action which we could being here in our court system where a wrong has been perpetrated. If an American company feels that there is a problem. they can always get indemnified by that foreign manufacturer. There are safeguards and protections for our own companies here.

I rise today in support of H.R. 4800. the omnibus trade bill. and against the Frenzel amendment. This amendment would delete one of the most important provisions of the bill: Section 138 of H.R. 4800. which would allow domestic companies a private cause of action for illegal dumping. Currently. the only tool against illegal dumping are countervailing duties. While these are not very effective. most often they are too little. too late. It usually takes several years for the Department of Commerce to make a finding of dumping. Foreign firms. with no disincentive against dumping. continue to dump their goods into our markets during this period. Even if these foreign producers are hit with countervailing duties years after they began their illegal activities. they still are not adversely affected as they simply pass the duty on to the consumer. Most importantly. our domestic firms witness their markets deterioration at the hands of foreign dumped goods. By the time that limited relief in the form of countervailing duties is received. our firms have lost significant market share to exports and. in some dire cases. our firms have even gone out of business. The best solution to remedy this dramatic problem is an economic disincentive to halt dumping and that is just what this provision in the bill. and similar to the Trade Law Improvement Act which I introduced with Representative TRAFICANT recently. is designed to do. This provision of the omnibus trade bill is a microcosm of what this debate on trade is all about. Its all about jobs. This provision is not protectionism. instead. it gives the American business and the American worker a chance to compete fairly. This amendment would merely continue to facilitate the import invasion which has led to the loss of some 4 million American jobs. over 40.000 in northeast Ohio alone.

There is no reason to distinguish natural resource subsidies from other subsidies. Nor is there a rational basis to distinguish removal right subsidies from other natural resource subsidies in terms of available remedies. Indeed. if the United States imposes a remedy against natural resource pricing as an unfair trade practice. as opposed to action against an illegal subsidy. United States action may be subject to claims of compensation under the GATT. Remedies against unfair trade practices are entirely discretionary with the President. Under the unfair trade practices provision. the President may choose not to act against a natural resource subsidy for any number of reasons unrelated to the issue of the subsidy itself. Under current law. the President already has the authority to act against unfair trade practices. including unfair natural resource pricing. but no action has been taken. The number of outstanding trade disputes demonstrates the inability of discretionary unfair trade practices provisions to deal adequately with our current $150 billion trade deficit. Proposals to relegate natural resource subsidies to unfair trade remedies are obviously intended to prevent effective action against foreign subsidies which are costing U.S. jobs. Countervailing duty decisions are made in public. quasijudicial proceedings which allow both sides to effectively present their case. If a foreign program is a subsidy and injures a U.S. industry. a duty should be placed upon goods benefiting from that subsidy. The procedural safeguards of the countervailing duty law are both necessary and adequate if natural resource subsidies are to be acted against effectively. Natural resource subsidies are harming. among others. the U.S. lumber. petrochemical. cement. and fertilizer industries. There is no reason to delay action in making such subsidies countervailable. While the Commerce Department has recently issued an opinion indicating that it may now find natural resource subsidies countervailable. that decision is preliminary and should not prevent Congress from taking necessary action. As Chairman GIBBONS has stated. if foreign governments are not subsidizing natural resources they have no reason to be concerned with this provision. If they are subsidizing. the United States should impose duties.",

I am sorry the gentleman from Minnesota had to lump all his items into one amendment. because I share many of his concerns. but I must part company with him on the resource subsidy issue. The question is: Why is this provision necessary in the trade bill that is before us? It is important if we are going to establish a definitional standard on what constitutes a resource subsidy. Presently. the countervailing duty laws allow for relief when a foreign government is proven to have engaged in subsidized practices. like workers wages or transportation. but there is no comparable provision or standard when it comes to resource subsidies. The result is that the rulings of the Department of Commerce are not very consistent. If we look at just one case. involving carbon black. it was a decision out of ITA in favor of the foreign government the first time around. and that was based on the Canadian lumber issue. and then subsequently they reversed their ruling on this case and now it appears that the Canadian lumber issue is up in the air again. If there is not a single standard. if there is not a consistent means for the trade agencies to apply the trade laws. then we are going to have a great deal of uncertainty and inconsistency. With respect to the Canadian issue. the Canadian provinces now have 35 percent of our market in wood products. Do they achieve that goal because they are more competitive? No. According to an ITC report. they are not more competitive. They are getting that sizable share of our market because they are subsidizing their resource. In 1985. U.S. timber interests had to pay $105 per thousand board feet versus $10 per thousand board feet by our Canadian neighbors. The provision in the bill is not protectionist. it actually fills the gap by providing a definitional standard for what constitutes a resource subsidy. That is why we should vote down the amendment.",

H.R. 4800 has been windowdressed and made a political document. at a time when we need to pass constructive and helpful trade legislation. While there are many provisions in H.R. 4800 I find hard to support. section 135 of the bill is needed to help rectify our current trade imbalance. with one or our major trade partnersCanada. The administration has come full circle in recognizing the inherent trade problem that exists between Canada and the United States. It isnt the administration that presents the problems to our domestic timber industry. it is the Canadians unwillingness to negotiate in good faith. Subsidized Canadian lumbers have dramatically injured the United States softwood lumber industry. Over 650 U.S. softwood lumber mills have closed since 1977 and tens of thousands of U.S. workers have been forced out of work. In my own State of Idaho. 20 mills have closed. displacing 3.000 workers and silencing many axes that used to be heard in Idahos plentiful forests. By eliminating section 135 in H.R. 4800. we are simply reverting back to our existing trade laws. making the issue of natural resource subsidies remedy actions as unfair trade practices under section 301 but not as counterviable subsidies. Section 135 addresses the trade distorting effects resulting from subsidization of input products used in manufacturing products as well as the trade distorting effects resulting subsidization of removal rights. The Frenzel amendment will not accomplish what we need to have done. in the area of subsidies given to raw products by our foreign trade partners. Section 135 is the hammer the domestic timber industry needs to keep the saw mills humming and American homes being built by American timber.

Adoption of the Fenzel amendment will keep the playing field tilted. and our mills silent. I urge my colleagues to reject my good friend of Minnesota.

The resolution which Mr. BIAGGI is introducing today. and which I am supporting as an original cosponsor. is therefore particularly timely. What our resolution will do. if passed. is express the opposition of the House of Representatives to any reductions or alterations in the funding of the Legal Services Corporation which would reduce the availability of legal services provided to lowincome older Americans through the Corporations program. Since its inception in 1975. the Corporation has provided invaluable legal services for lowincome older people. In recent years. the Corporations funds have assisted about 200.000 older persons annually. The problems on which the Corporation provides assistance reflect the complete range of legal difficulties which any citizen can encounter. For the people served by the Corporation. however. these difficulties are compounded by the specir circumstances which our elderly and lowincome citizens face. These run the gamut from will preparation and estate planning to difficulties encountered with such public benefits as those provided by the Food Stamp Program and the Social Security Administration. The Corporations program provides assistance with consumer fraud problems. with difficulties encountered by frail older persons in nursing homes. with age discrimination problems encountered in the workplace. It is very important that such direct legal services continue to be available to lowincome older persons. and it is our hope that this resolution will contribute to that end.*",

As cochairmen of the congressional human rights caucus. we are pleased that over 70 of our collea.guics have joined us In cosponsoring this resolution which recognizes the importance of respect for human rights. On August 1. 1975. representatives from 35 countries joined together in Helsinki. Finland. to sign the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This agreement. referred to as the Helsinki Accords. covers every aspect of EastWest relations. including military security. scientific and cultural exchanges. trade and economic cooperation. and human rights. The year 1985 marks the 10th anniversary of the signing of the accords. The signing of this agreement triggered the hopes of many people living in countries who believed that it signaled a new era of respect for human rights and improved EastWest relations. In many countries Helsinki monitoring groups were established with the purpose of publicizing the standards of the accords and monitoring the application of these standards by their governments. Unfortunately. the formation of these groups were not encouraged by many countries. In fact. most of the groups in Eastern Europe met great opposition from their governments. The leaders of these groups. who persisted in their cause despite the efforts by thzir governments to jail them and to disrupt the meetings. are truly world leaders in the fight for human rights. Recently I became involved in the plight facing one member of the Helsinki monitoring group in Czechoslovakia. Charter 77.

The proposal undercuts the basis of our health care system. the excellent basic and applied research that have been the products of The National Institutes of Health and Mental Health.

This action compromises our ability to keep talented investigators in the health research field. resulting in the loss of core personnel on major research projects. Further assaults on the Nations ability to produce clinical and research personnel comes from the administrations proposal to eliminate $25 million of direct Federal support of health care professions.

The January 17 issue of The Wall Street Journal contained a spectrum of reactions to comprehensive editorialpage coverage on arms control and the SDI which had appeared in the January 2 issue of the Journal. One of the most valuable contributions among these reactions was a letter written by my colleague. the Honorable MARILYN LLOYD. Mrs. LLOYD views arms control matters and the SDI Program from the broad technology perspective of membership on both the Science and Technology and Armed Services Committees of the House. She chairs the Energy Research and Production Subcommittee of the Science and Technology Committee. which authoirizes funding for the Department of Energys Space Nuclear Power Program. while the full Committee on Science and Technology authorizes funding for all of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASAs] space power activities. Thus. Mrs. LLOYD has a keen interest In SDI because of the strong program linkage driven by the space power requirements of the various defensive technologies. I strongly recommend Mrs. LLOYDs letter to my colleagues. It includes discussions of attractive arms control aspects of SDI. a critique of certain scientific criticisms of the program and a rationale for emphasizing the deterrent features of a partially deployed missile defense system.",

At issue is Japans continued commercial slaughter of thousands of whales. This time. however. the United States could find itself allied with the whale killers rather than with the whale conservation countries. In November 1984. the United States negotiated an agreement with Japan that would allow that country to continue commercial whaling until 1988 despite the IWCs overwhelming decision. which the United States supported. to suspend all commercial whaling in 1986. The agreement with Japan circumvents U.S. law. which requires certification of countries whose actions diminish the effectiveness of IWC decisions. gives official sanction to whaling in violation of established IWC regulations. and makes a mockery of consistent administration commitments to the Congress that countries which violate IWC decisions would be certified. In order to demonstrate continuing congressional concern for the conservation of the worlds endangered whale species. I am introducing today a resolution on this matter with my distinguished colleagues Representatives YATRON and GEJDENSON. This measure calls on the President to ensure full U.S. support for the whale conservation initiatives of the IWC. urges all nations to abide by the IWCs decisions. and calls for certification of countries whose whaling actions diminish the effectiveness of IWC regulations. Since 1972. the United States has been in the forefront of international efforts to strengthen protection for the worlds endangered whales. In view of the importance of this years IWC meeting. it Is timely for the Congress to reaffirm our support for the moratorium on commercial whaling as well as our opposition to any weakening of longstanding U.S. leadership In this endeavor.

I especially applaud the work of the members of the subcommittee in recognition of the importance of maintaining our Nations transportation systems. which are essential to maintaining the quality of life for our Nations citizens. In many of our urban areas. such as the Cleveland metropolitan area. the availability of Federal assistance is especially critical to correcting safety and traffic problems caused by rapidly deteriorating roads and bridges. H.R. 3244. which includes appropriations totaling $55.4 million for interstate substitute transfer grants for highway and transit projects in the Cleveland metropolitan area.. Will go a long way toward helping our region maintain a high quality of public transportation services. The funds provided in this bill will also help to fulfill the Federal commitment made to Ohio in 1979. when Cleveland relinquished funds for a 7.9mile segment of Interstate 1490 because of other highway and transit needs were more important to the maintenance of Clevelands transportation system. These interstate substitute investments were then. and remain today. vital to Ohios economy. Six years later. however. Ohio has received less than 43 percent of the substitute highway funds and only 27 percent of the sibstitute transit funds committed when the Initial agreement was approved. Mr. Chairman. the Cleveland metropolitan area has a strong record of utilizing Federal transportation dollars in a wise and effective manner. The projects which will be funded utilizing the resources provided in II.R. 3244 entail the reconstruction and renewal of basic transportation services. Commitments have already been made by local governments for the requisite nonFederal matching funds. These projects were identified as urgent in 1979 by local. State. and Federal agencies.

The Committee on Public Works and Transportation has been deeply involved in the Federal Aviation Administrations airline safety inspection program and has consistently resisted administration efforts to cut inspectors. We must allow no deterioration in the Governments ability to ensure that our Nations airlines are being operated and maintained safely. This amendment to provide $15 million to increase the inspection work force by 300 people is a relatively small dollar amount in the grand scheme of things. but each of these dollars will be a dollar spent directly on aviation safety. The public is concerned about the safety of the air trans. portation system in light of some of the recent accidents. and they are asking what is being done to ensure that flying is safe. More safety inspectors and a better inspection program will have direct benefits for aviation safety. I urge my colleagues to join in support of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from California to increase the number of air safety inspectors. As we all know. there has been a recent surge in the number of airline accidents. Although none of these accidents have yet been tied directly to a lack of inspectors. there can be no doubt that these accidents raise doubts in the traveling publics mind about aviation safety. The reduction in the number of safety inspectors over recent years certainly does nothing to reassure them. This amendment should help restore that confidence. In addition. there have been rapid and significant changes in the aviation environment in recent years. These changes have resulted from vastly accelerated technologi. cal advances and economic deregulation. These have raised concerns that the changes could lead to a reduction In avia. tion safety. Studies have shown that the airline industry Is adapting well to these changes and that overall there has been no diminution in safety. But the question remains whether a reduced FAA inspector work force can keep pace with the Industry and the changing environment. I believe that now is the appropriate time to move forward and increase the number of safety inspectors in order to better meet the chal. lenges they now face. I am also pleased that this amendment will not have any effect whatsoever on the overall budget or the deficit. The $15 million for additional inspectors will come out of the facilities and equipment account. Prior savings in that area allow this to be done without any harm to other important aviation programs. I therefore support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. I would also like to thank Mr. MINETA for offering this amendment and the members of the Appropriations Committee for their fine work on this appropriations bill.",

The restriction of funds previously authorized and funded to the Coast Guard for training purposes. travel. and per diem relating thereto. has seriously curtailed the necessary training of reservists. Regulars. and recent volunteers just coming on board. In this day of high tech and new programs introduced affecting intelligence gathering and drug interdiction it is imperative we give this line of defense the best available training to go along with the equipment this Congress has previously authorized. It is my understanding that the Departments of State. Treasury. Justice. and De. fense have exempted themselves from restrictions under section 2901 of the act. The importance of the Coast Guard. with Its missions of defense and drug interdiction along with others. is vital to our national security and should be permitted to exer. cise the same options in its training pro. grams as the agencies I have mentioned. Repeating what I have previously stated. this amendment does not add 1 cent to the budget. In fact. with the end of this fiscal year just a few weeks away. it will not even restore to the Coast Guard funding previ. ously appropriated. It will. however. insure against administrative cuts in this category from funds appropriated for the next fiscal year.",

His work on the Foreign Relations Committee reflects his own decency and compassion for all people throughout the world. CHARLES MATHIAS is a man of discernment and courage. a reasoned force for deficit reduction and sensible economic policy. He is a softspoken man. who takes the time to listen. to survey the options. weigh them. and cast an informed vote despite the pressures of politics. He has been a widely popular Senator. able to earn votes across the party spectrum because his fellow citizens always believed his only aim was to do what was right.

He said. \"There is life outside the U.S. Senate . . . If I can work on the outside and keep my hand in public service. it would be the best of both worlds.\" By his own admission. Senator LAXALT has not been especially fond of the plodding pace of the legislative process. In some ways. the long hearing and markup sessions have left him with a sense of confinement. But that is not surprising considering his affection for the hills of his native Nevada. I have heard him say on many occasions how much he loves the solitude of the hills where he spent so many summers herding sheep with his father. And he has taken his own grandchildren to those same hills to let them develop a feeling for the beauty and strength of nature. On two occasions PAUL LAXALT has had to make difficult decisions about his career in Government. Although a popular and respected Governor. he turned down the opportunity to seek another term. Although a popular and nationally respected Member of the Senate. he has decided to lay that aside. He has made it clear there are things in his life more Important than public acclaim. and we must respect his wishes. Certainly. PAUL LAXALT has been a dependable lieutenant of Ronald Reagan throughout the Presidents tenure in office. He has been steadfast in supporting the White House positions on the broad range of issues. and has often taken to the White House sometimes unwelcome but always realistic assessments of events in Congress. Yet Senator LAXALT also took that same message from President Reagan to Ferdinand Marcos when it became clear the former Philippine leader no longer had the support of the American people. Senator LAXALT. throughout his Senate career. has had a feel for the bigpicture side of the issues. His contribution to the Senate has been solid. genuine and worthy.

His conservatism challenged those who did not share it to reexamine their premises. not to abandon the debate. His conservatism is of the kind that seeks to preserve the Constitution. not undermine it. In his Senate duties. Senator GOLDWATER has worked indefatigably for the goals toward which his principles point. He has worked for Armed Forces that are effective and efficient. He has worked to reinstill a spirit of partiotism and duty in the defense sector of the economy. He has always recognized that it is the spirit and morale of our fighting men that is the ultimate defense of our Nation. and he has stood up for them. Recently Senator GOLDWATER remarked that the Senates approval of this Defense Reorganization Act was his most important contribution to public policy. I respectfully disagree with him.

Senator LAXALT demonstrated those qualities of patience and good faith that have won him the strong support and affection of Nevadans throughout his political career. Senator LAXALTS voyage to the Philippines in behalf of the President and the outcome of that voyage. which helped avert what could have been a terrible civil conflict. were not the customary duties of a Senator. but they represent the unique role Senator LAXALT has played as the Presidents close friend in the Senate. He visited Manila. he spoke with President Marcos and he brought back from his visit the conviction not only that Marcos was isolated from his people and dangerously so. but he brought back a willingness to face the facts when it became evident the Philippine election outcome was tainted by illegality. Most importantly. he was willing to share that conviction with President Marcos and to stand behind it. As a leader of the Western Coalition of Senators who seek to represent the problems and needs of the Western States here in the Nations Capital. Senator LAXALT has worked to ensure that the more sparsely settled States receive the same kind of careful consideration as the populous part of the country. He has retained his close association with the outdoors. an association growing out of his fathers life in the Sierras and one he is passing on to his grandchildren. And throughout his Senate career. he has demonstrated by his commitment of time and effort the strong concern for preserving the American family which is the legacy of this own strong family background.

From his service in the Army Air Corps during the Second World War through his distinguished chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee for the last 2 years. his foremost concern has always been the strength and competence of our Nations military. Indeed. BARRY has been the best kind of friend and patron to our armed services. He has fought doggedly to win them the best in weapons and resources. yet never hesitates to take them to task for faults or excesses. He is what we call down in South Carolina \"a hawk who flies with his eyes open.\" In Korea and again in Vietnam. he had a special appreciation for the difficulties of waging war on behalf of a fickle. impatient democracy. It was a Frenchman who said that war is too important to be left to the generals. BARRY GOLDWATER would counter that war is too important to be left to the politicians. Throughout his career. he has held fast to the traditional conservative convictions: that Government should not interfere with the economy. and that the State should not intrude in citizens private lives and personal decisions.

The amount of that restoration affecting the Treasury bill would be $141 million. if I am correct.

The budget resolution assumes $8 million for the customs forfeiture fund in 1986. This fund is authorized by the crime bill that passed last year. The Budget Committee did not credit our ceiling with this funding level. or the funding in the request by the President in his 1986 budget request back in February. The result is another $8 million that is not allocated to us. or at least I cannot find it in here. I do not mean this to be critical of the chairman. He has the authority and the responsibility here. and I do not mean to leave the impression that he is not doing a good job. because he is. He has taken on some battles I would not take on.

I think my good friend knows as well as I do that in this particular section of the appropriations bill we are really not dealing with any program. so to speak. The Health Program and the Retirement Program are two big programs. They are mandatories. So the vast end of what we deal with is personnel. Maybe our mistake was made in the first place by trying to cut 5 percent out of salaries when the original proposal was put together. Not only my subcommittee. but also the Appropriations Committee and. as far as I can tell. almost everyone else in Congress. is in accord with our thinking.

    "speech": "I rise in opposition to a 2percent acrosstheboard cut in the Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bill. Let us look. for example. specifically at the effect this would have on the revenue forgone function. A 2percent reduction in the revenue forgone appropriation will seriously hurt the affected mailers. Even with the $801 million contained in this bill for revenue forgone. the mailers who use this subsidy do not escape rate hikes. Library rate mailings will increase 24 percent. Classroom materials. veterans and religious mailings would be up 30 percent. Small newspapers would skyrocket 42 to 56 percent. The 2percent cut suggested by Senator DOMENICI will result in an estimated $16 million loss in the revenue forgone category. Just how much do we want to hurt these mailers this year in the name of budget balancing? Through lower postal rates. the Federal Government acknowledges the important contributions made to society by the nonprofit mailing community and assists nonprofits to channel as much revenue as possible into program services rather than operational expenses. The administration has repeatedly stated their commitment to this idea. Since the administration agrees that reduced postage rates for nonprofit mailers is a good idea. the way to ensure their continuation is through direct and sufficient appropriations. Even $801 million is not as much as I would like to see for the worthy cause. $16 million less. as proposed by Senator DoMENIcI is totally unacceptable. $801 million for revenue forgone is $166 million below the 1985 funding figure. It is $160 million below the $961 million contained in the Housepassed Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bill. And it does not place this Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bill over its budget allocation. For all these reasons. I support the bill. and oppose the present amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill we are now considering. the Treasury/Postal appropriations for fiscal year 1986. is $128 million over the conference agreement on the first concurrent budget resolution. It is $859 million over the Senatepassed resolution. Not only is it over the budget resolution it exceeds the Presidents request even when adding the Senate appropriation for postal subsidies to the request. The amendment Senator DOMENICI and myself are proposing would reduce all discretionary spending by 2 percent. This would produce a total savings of $139 million. When the House of Representatives considered this bill. they accepted one amendment to the bill. That amendment called for a reduction in every program. except for law enforcement. postal subsidies. and mandatory spending. It passed by an overwhelming vote of 288133. When that amendment was initially offered. it was intended to bring the bill in line with the first budget resolution as passed by the House. Where they failed in that effort. we can succeed by adopting this amendment. One may argue that the Senate has already reduced its budget well below that of the House and in many of the programs affected by the acrosstheboard reduction. However. of the 34 programs affected by this amendment. the Senate is over the House level in 26 instances. This indicates that the typically spendthrift House has outdone us in these 26 programs. Another argument used is that this amendment will hurt vital programs. This is not the case. The BATF. Customs Service. and Secret Service. all will experience increases over the budget requested amount even with the 2 percent reduction. Furthermore. government payment for annuitants and employees health benefits. and payment to the civil service retirement and disability fund will likewise be exempt from the reduction. While I feel that several of these programs could use additional cuts. this amendment as it is now structured would have the best chance of passage. Finally. Mr. President. the bill does not even hold to our commitment to our own budget. For instance. under the budget resolution. we set a level for postal subsides of $700 million. this bill exceeds that amount by $101 million. If we are going to vote for attractive budgets around here. we have got to stick by them when it comes appropriations time.

Congress restored the rights of these individuals by providing for hearings and requiring. at least. that there be a showing of improvement and the ability to work before these unfortunate Americans who had already proved their disability could be denied their benefits. A proposal has now been advanced by some in President Reagans administration which is a bald threat to the independent judiciary. and will deprive hundreds of thousands of the protection of the Federal court system. The administration has drafted a proposal to establish a separate Social Security Court to take away the authority of the district courts and most appellate courts to review Social Security decisions. Now. this is an assault upon the Constitution. It is well known that the district courts have been the bulwark in defending the rights of the disabled in the face of administration efforts to remove them wholesale and without benefit of judicial protections guaranteed by our Bill of Rights. Before it advances very far we should serve notice that there will be no tampering with the independent juFSE 4199 diciary. and this Congress will not establish a rubberstamp court to ride roughshod over defenseless persons who have become disabled. and are only trying to collect the benefits for which they are eligible. because theyve paid into the system.",

This is a modest measure which would not increase the authorizations for the Emergency Relief Program. but would merely increase to $100 million from $30 million the amount which can be made available to any State in connection with a single disaster in 1986. As such it reflects the continuing congressional policy of keeping the program up to date in terms of the needs placed upon it. In the same vein. we have extended eligibility for assistance under the program to the territories. with a maximum collective annual cap of $5 million for emergency relief to the Virgin Islands. Guam. American Samoa. and the Commonwealth of Northern Marlana Islands. This provision has long been urged by the delegates from the territories and we agree that it has merit. Another provision would simply increase to $40 million from $30 million the annual level of funding for small flood control projects undertaken by the Corps of Engineers. at a maximum cost of $4 million each. without specific congressional authorization. Mr. Speaker. I mentioned that we attempt to keep this program abreast of needs.

The emergency relief fund derives all of its revenue from the highway trust fund. and it was set up specifically to assist States struck with disasters that wreak havoc on the Federal aid system. States are only eligible if there is a Federal disaster declaration. and only if they can prove to the satisfaction of the Federal Highway Administration that the road damage was directly attributable to the disaster. It is our hope that we can remove unnecessary restraintsat this critical timeso that the emergency relief fund can be used for the purpose for which it was intended.

CALTRANS. which states that the severe damage to the roads and bridges was caused by prolonged flooding. rock slides. avalanches. bridge washouts. roadbed slipouts and more. While a complete assessment of the damage has not been finished. the estimates far exceed the $30 million limitation. The emergency relief fund was established to help States recover from the ravages of Mother Nature. Currently. the emergency relief fund has adequate dollars to assist California. however. the Department of Transportation is bound by the $30 million cap. This legislation does not require the appropriations of any additional moneys. Rather it allows the emergency relief fund to be used to assist California and the other Western States who suffered similar damage during the February storms. If we have the dollars available. we should not allow a legislative restriction to impede the wise and necessary expenditure of the funds. This bill lifts that legislative restriction so that the States can get on with putting its roads and bridges back in the condition they were prior to the devastation. As a cosponsor of this measure. I want to commend my colleague from California for introducing this bill. The preliminary estimates show that there is at least $55.6 million in damage to the States roadways. much of which is in my congressional district. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4240 which will help to alleviate the disasterrelated damages which certain States have incurred in recent months. The bill modifies these provisions to provide increased Federal funds for disaster assistance and flood control. The bill amends section 205 of the Flood Control Act of 1948 which authorizes the Corps of Engineers to construct small flood control projects of not more than $4 million without specific congressional authorization. Currently. no more than $30 million may be allotted from funds otherwise appropriated for flood control in any fiscal year for these projects. This bill would raise that limit to $40 million. In recent years. the allotment has been near the full $30 million available. The recent disasters in California demonstrate the need to expand the corps Small Flood Control Project Program. The bill also would increase the limitation for emergency relief projects for disasterrelated highway needs from $30 million to $100 million for calendar year 1986. All States would be eligible to receive the increased benefits. Finally. the bill would make the U.S. territories eligible for emergency relief assistance for disasterrelated highway needs. A $5 million annual limitation is imposed for the territories collectively. Mr. Speaker. we are all aware of the severe disasterrelated damages which have occurred in this country. This bill would both aid in responding to damage already incurred and aid in reducing future damages. I urge its passage.",

It would be a total repudiation of history. Andrei Sakharov. Anatoly Schranski cannot leave the country. along with a long and depressing list of people who seek to emigrate from the Soviet Union. Yet. the Soviets undertook in this accord to free up immigration. We have just finished imposing in both bodies. sanctions on the Republic of South Africa. But Bishop Tutu can leave the country. Chief Buthelezi can leave the country. They do not hold people under house arrest over there remotely approaching what the Soviet Union does. And yet here we are celebrating 10 years of adject failure to provide the slightest respect for any practice of human rights in the Soviet Union.

I do not know where that is. maybe the United Nations. or the World Court where virtually nobody ever votes with us. that the Soviet Union does not live up to its undertakings. A treaty. an understanding. an accord is as good as the intention of its signatories to live up to it. Once more the Soviet Union has shown that words do not mean anything. Solemn undertakings do not mean anything to its leaders and to its government. I hope the lesson of 10 years of failure in the field of human rights visavis the Soviet Union. as celebrated today upon the celebration of the Helsinki accords will teach us as we try to negotiate treaties at Geneva for arms control that we need a cleareyed. unsentimental view of the Soviet Union. its philosophy. its history. and its goals.

The resolution condemns the ongoing Eastern bloc violations of the Helsinki accords. It direct our Government to convey our deep concern about the flagrant human rights violations in the Soviet Union. Ten years ago. President Ford and other leaders signed that solemn accord concerning human rights and related matters. This anniversary should be a joyous occasion. Today. all of us should be able to praise the great strides made in human rights in the past 10 years in the Soviet Union and bloc nations. But the opposite is true. The anniversary of that signing ceremory is an occasion of great sadness. It is a grim human tragedy that little progress has been made in improving human rights conditions in the Eastern bloc. and the Soviet Union. In reality. the human rights situation in those countries hasnt improved. While the accord commits the signers to respect human rights. the Soviets and Eastern bloc nations have ignored their promises. To them. this agreement was a joke. After the pact was signed. a group of Soviet citizens formed the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group to monitor the Kremlins compliance with the accord. Most members of that group are now in labor camps. or in harsh exile. Many of them are in poor health and some are being denied proper treatment outside the U.S.S.R. because of their involvement with that group. The free flow of information and ideas between the East and the West has never really started. In 1984. for example. only 900 Soviet Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union. The real value of the legislation before us is that it calls attention to the continued human rights violations by the Soviet Union and their allies. How can we hope to have real peace with the Soviets if they cant respect a solemn agreement? How can we trust a country that seems to delight in breaking accords? How can we work with a country that enjoys silencing dissenting voices? I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.",

I do so in the hope that the next 10 years of the socalled Helsinki process are more successful than the first. The Soviet Unions record of compliance with the agreement signed in 1975 has been atrocious. Soviet leaders take what they like from the pactnamely. our recognizing their hegemony in Eastern Europeand ignore the human rights provisions they also signed. Apparently. individual liberties are fineas long as they dont involve the freedom to think. speak. and write as you please. to worship as you please. to read Western books and newspapers. to telephone a relative in the United States or Israel without the KGB listening in. Soviet leaders have been especially cynical in the treatment of their citizens who had the temerity to take them at their word and set up groups to monitor compliance with the Helsinki agreements. According to the U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee. of the 100 or more people who openly Joined these groups in the Soviet Union. 51 are currently In prison. in psychiatric hospitals. in labor camps. or in internal exile. Four have died in prison. another was killed in a suspicious automobile accident. Another 20 have been incarcerated and released. Not surprisingly. these groups have had to abandon their tasks. Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is the other area where the high hopes of the Helsinki era have been bitterly disappointed. After reaching a high of 51.000 in 1979. emigration has dwindled to a tiny fraction of that number. Last year. only 896 Jews were allowed to emigrate. So while I support the resolution. I want Mr. Gorbachev to7 know that Americans in. and out of government are losing patience with the Kremlins cynical. empty pronouncements. As President Ford warned us. the Helsinki accord will be judged not by the promises that are made. but by the promises that are kept.9",

Furthermore. the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade reported that nearly $40 billion in illegal imports were slipping into the country annually. That costs the Treasury. according to the committee. $3 billion annually. Perhaps a more important point to stress with the Customs Service is that it is the front line against the influx of illegal narcotics threatening the social fiber of our society. In testimony before our committee. the Commissioner of Customs stated that for every pound of cocaine customs seizes. two or three get through. Furthermore. according to the Customs Service. of all cargo containers which enter the country. 98 percent pass through uninspected. The odds presented by that situation are unacceptable in the war on drugs. According to the Select Committee on Narcotics. in 1984 the supply of heroin in this Nation increased by 200 percent. The supply of cocaine increased by 50 percent and the supply of marijuana increased by 300 percent. However. the gentlemans amendment would cut not only 540 enforcement personnel out of the bill. it would also cut $1.6 million from the air interdiction program of the Customs Service. In .effect. those cuts would probably cut back on the available air time for P3As used to detect and track planes carrying dope into this country. and the funds for the operation and maintenance of 2 additional Blackhawk helicopters Customs hopes to acquire as well. which are used to intercept such aircraft. To cut these funds for the Customs Services Drug Interdiction Program. while the illegal drug trade continues to flourish. would be a dereliction of duty.

So did the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that this could result in new revenues of up to $1.2 billion or more. Mr. FRENZELS amendment would cut that figure in half. if not more. As a matter of fact. It would probably result in more losses in the long run. For instance. the committee approved funds for 500 additional personnel to process returns in fiscal year 1986. I do not believe there is a Member here who is not aware of the terrible backlog being experienced by the IRS this year. They are 6 million returns behind. which will cost millions in interest. The committee added the personnel in anticipation of 500 million additional returns to be processed next year. Yet. Mr FRENZELS amendment would eliminate those positions and we would be left in a worse position. While no one may be too fond of the IRS. they are an important function of Government. When we spend money on them they bring more back in. In light of our deficits. and the amount of taxes owed yet unpaid. it is foolish not to properly fund the agency. Mr. FRENZEL would cut the examination and appeals section of the IRS by over $37 million. cutting staff by 1.000 positions resulting in 60.000 fewer examinations. This lowers the overall audit coverage to 1.2 percent. the tenth straight year of decline since 1976. And. again. we lose badly needed and owed revenue. The gentleman would cut the Bureau of Alcohol.

This agency enforces our alcohol taxes. estimated at $5 billion annually. Their enforcement capabilities would be greatly deterred. particularly when the increase in distilled spirits tax rate is due to increase on October 1. 1985. It would also curtail their ability to halt cigarette smuggling involving organized crime and to investigate domestic bombings in a time of rising terrorism.

I regret that the roadless area of Blood Mountain. approximately 10.000 acres in Union and Lumpkin Counties. will not be included in this bill. However. in the interest of compromise. it is my hope that this 4.460foot peak containing endangered plant species. pioneer homesites. and waterfalls. will be considered again at a later date.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 5496. the Georgia Wilderness Act of 1986. I am proud to say that all of the 42.258 acres proposed for inclusion in the National Wilderness System in this bill lie within the boundaries of the Ninth Congressional District. which I represent. My family and I have lived all of our lives in these mountains at the lower end of the Appalachian Mountain chain. I was born at the foot of Brasstown Bald Mountain. which will be surrounded by wilderness areas when this bill becomes law. This act incorporates six tracts of U.S. Forest Service lands in the Chattahoochee National Forest. forming four wilderness areas and adding a tract to an existing wilderness area. Georgias most rugged peaks. its highest point of elevation. and some of its most scenic natural beauty in rock outcrops. waterfalls. and vegetation reside here with the whitetail deer. the black bear. and the wild turkey. Five threatened or endangered plant species can be found in one of the areas. The headwaters for three rivers form in these areas. The addition of these areas to the National Wilderness System doubles the wilderness designated lands in Georgia. All of these areas have been found by environmentalists. Forest Service personnel. and local residents to fit into the natural primitive definition of wilderness. It is with their approval that I bring this bill to you. I would like to commend the Interior Committee for its work on this bill and for the expeditious manner in which it has acted in bringing the bill to the floor. I also would like to thank my colleagues from Georgia. especially Congressman DARDEN. a member of the Interior Committee. for their support of this bill. I now ask the remainder of my colleagues in the House to join us in preserving these areas not just for this generation but for all future generations.",

The bill authorizes the sale. at fair market value. of approximately 5.000 acres of public lands within the city of Mesquite. NV. We were told the city wishes to purchase these lands to allow for additional house sites. and recreational development such as a golf course. Current development is taking place on the limited privately owned agricultural lands within the city limits. The city wishes to retain these agricultural lands in their current state to maintain the agricultural base and character of the town. The dilemma facing Mesquite is not unique. As my colleagues know. many of our towns in the West are surrounded by public lands or national forest lands. They are landlocked unless they can purchase Federal lands. Authorities exist for purchases such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. the Townsite Act. or the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. but the process can be very slow. In the case of Mesquite. a new resource management plan identifying the lands for sale could take 10 years or more. The solution crafted by the subcommittee chairman. Mr. SEIBERLING. authorizes the sale in three segments over a 6year timeframe. Therefore. the city is given enough time to come up with the necessary funds and is given the sole right of purchase over a 6year period which is faster than could be done administratively. It is my understanding that the bill has been discussed with the BLM and most of their suggested admendments have been incorporated into the bill. I am told they do not oppose the bill.

As is very common for small towns in Nevada. the city of Mesquite is surrounded by public lands and it has been unable to expand. The inability to grow threatens the agricultural business which best represents the citys economic base. This bill will allow the city to purchase numerous tracts of Federal land and develop them for housing and public facilities pursuant to a master plan the city has prepared. Today rural America is depressed and its economy on the decline. For most small towns economic development is only a dream. We have an opportunity with H.R. 3352 to give a small. rural town in Nevada a shot in the arm and our vote of confidence in Mesquites ability to make economic development a reality. H.R. 3352 is a noncontroversial bill and is supported by the whole Nevada delegation and the city of Mesquite.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3352. a bill which would allow the city of Mesquite. NV. to purchase real property from the Bureau of Land Management for market value. Mesquite is an incorporated city approximately 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. near the Arizona/Utah borders. Like many communities in the West. the city is completely landlocked by federally owned land. In Nevada 87 percent of the land is federally owned. Mesquite is a growing community with a traditional agricultural base. In recent years. a hotel/ casino has located in Mesquite which created 700 new jobs. Sixty percent of the work force in Mesquite now commutes to work. a large portion of whom would live in Mesquite if there were land available to build more housing. Without additional land. the only option for development of any kind is to use the precious farmland in the valley. and that is neither economically nor environmentally sound. The city leaders of Mesquite have tried to obtain the land from the BLM using nonlegislative avenues. However. due to administrative restrictions concerning payment and certain time limitations. they have found it prohibitive. During the July 15. House Public Lands Subcommittee hearing. the BLM raised several concerns having to do with receiving fair market value for the land. permittee access to grazing allotments. and protection of two endangered fish species in the Virgin River. Since the hearing. we have arrived at a compromise that is satisfactory to all parties concerned. There is simply no reason that this land should sit idle when the city could use it for recreation and productive growth for airport facilities and housing. Mesquite is literally bursting at the seams. and further development is sure to follow if only the city has a place to expand. I consider acquisition of this land imperative to the future of Mesquite. and therefore. urge your support for passage of this bill.",

I commend him for his efforts in pressing for prompt action on this meritorious proposal. There are some who will argue that the town should be required to purchase the land. However. I believe strong arguments were made in favor of conveying the land without compensation. First. the town is landlocked. which greatly limits their tax base and expansion capabilities of the town. And. second. the town has spent over $100.000 on park improvements. The Forest Service testified that there is no national forest use for the land which they currently allow the city to use under a special use permit. Two additional provisions were added to the bill in committee by our distinguished chairman . One. to allow BLM to transfer some lands in Arizona to the State as partial compensation for a debt owed as a result of construction of the central Arizona project. and. second. to convey approximately 80 acres in Santa Cruz County for a courthouse and community park. Congressional action is needed because of the National Wildlife Federation lawsuit which is holding up hundreds of equally meritorious exchanges or conveyances.

AZ. which lies just below the MogolIon Rim. This piece of land is presently being leased by this town. whose citizens embody the pioneer spirit by which our Nation was built. as a public park. Should this bill pass today. the land will continue to be used as a recreation center for the community. First. allow me to point out that I join with my colleagues in being very slow to convey public lands. There are. however. several factors which should be carefully reviewed in the particular care of Payson. It is important to note that the town of Payson is tightly surrounded by the Tonto National Forest. As a result of this extremely limited amount of private land available for development. the town has a very small revenue base from which to draw. The citizens of Payson. while laboring diligently. making goodfaith efforts to pay market value for the land by purchasing several small parcels within this same tract of land. are unable to go beyond their means and purchase this final 31 acres. which would unite the plots previously purchased. In accordance with the towns valiant efforts to assume the responsibility of the recreational needs of the members of the community and of the surrounding area. it has prudently invested funds in the land by developing public facilities. such as a swimming pool. several multiplaying fields. a volley ball court. and an exercise trail. The citizens of Payson hope to further improve their park by covering the swimming pool to allow its use year round. and by adding additional ball fields. As I am sure each one of us can appreciate. the citizens in this town are reluctant to continue costly investments in this piece of property until they hold the title. Let me underscore the scarcity of available private lands to Payson and the towns patriotic and hardworking spirit. evidenced by their goodfaith effort to improve and purchase as much of this tract of land as their means would allow in order to provide suitable recreation for the community.

The bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague on the Interior Committee and I believe he will explain the need for the legislation in more detail. Let me just say that the Department of the Interior supports the removal of the restrictions and the exchange because a great deal of critical wildlife habitat will be gained in the exchange. At the same time. the bill does not affect the ownership of any mineral rights on the State lands or the private lands. Members should be aware that the chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee amended the bill in committee to add a separate provision directing the Secretary to accept title to an historic railroad line which runs through and near the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area. There was no opposition in committee to this amendment. I have been told the Park Service would like to purchase this rightofway. however. the railroad has been unable to produce a clear title to all portions of the line. The amendment allows the Secretary to purchase it based on whatever title the railroad can come up with. This leaves the Park Service in the position of having to clear the remaining title problems themselves which may involve some additional administrative costs. However. we are told this is minor and I am also told that funds are available and earmarked already to purchase these lands. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

I was getting this dope for the Contras. which I think is a pretty selfserving statement. Let us go to some documented evidence that came out of hearings in the U.S. Congress.

I ask my col. leagues: Using the same analogy. why do we not attack the Soviet Union or China or Cuba? The response was that World War III would be detrimental. which precisely makes my point. The only place where we are prepared to challenge communism is in Third World countries where the people are black. brown. yellow. and red. and where there are problems of poverty and hunger and disease and starvation and death. That is the contradiction and that is the hypocrisy. We raise this big red menace only where we can beat up on nations like Grenada. 90.000 people. Nicaragua. one of the poorest nations of the world. but not these other countries. these great Communist countries. because we want to keep trading with them. We do not want to engage in World War III. so we intimidate these Third World countries. and that is the contradiction and that is the hypocrisy of this whole act that is taking place on the floor of this Congress today.",

The Commission is responsible for promoting the implementation of arms control agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. In light of the Presidents recent decision with respect to the SALT II Treaty. I think this special session of the SCC comes at just the right time. Later this year. it is expected that the United States will proceed with plans to equip its 131st strategic bomber with cruise missiles. this going over the SALT II limit of 1.320 multiplewarhead delivery systems. Before this happens. I believe it is important for us to sit down with the Soviets and dicusss the reasons for our change of policy. I do not hesitate to say that I have my concerns about the Presidents announcement that our country will no longer be bound by SALT II. Of course I do. No one can be completely certain what effect this change in policy will have on the arms race betwten the United States and the Soviet Union. However. I do feel that adherence to a treaty must be mutual if it is to work and have any meaning. The Soviets. unfortunately. continue to violate var. ious major provisions of SALT II while the United States remains in compliance. and this makes no sense to me at all. Unilateral compliance with any bilateral agreement is inherently destabilizing. The special session of the SCC offers an opportunity to address U.S. concerns about Soviet noncompliance. and thereby focus on the heart of this entire issue. It is my hope that something productive will come out of this session and that the Soviets will join us in reaching an arms control framework based on significant. equitable. and verifiable reductions in the size of our nuclear arsenals.e",

I would like to call my colleagues attention to the retirement of a couple who have helped to shape journalism during more than half a century of reporting In Rhode Island. Zelmore \"Zel\" and Esther C. Levin retired simultaneously recently. Together they founded and ran their own newspaper. the Woonsocket Sunday Star. in 1950 and published it for 5 years. Zel began his Journalistic career in 1928 as a 14yearold junior high school student. writing as the school correspondent for the Call in Woonsocket. RI. When he graduated from high school he went to work full time as a reporter. He remained at the Call. with the exception of 5 years of military service. for the next 22 years. He became the newspapers news editor and then its executive city editor. He left to found his own newspaper with his wife. After selling the Woonsocket Sunday Star. Zel worked briefly in public relations and advertising before returning to the Call to manage its radio station. WWON. for 13 years. He left that post to become a reporter at the Evening Times in Pawtucket. RI. He was promoted to assistant managing editor at the Evening Times after 6 months and held that position for 9 years until his first retirement. Then he resumed his formal education. earning his bachelors degree and masters degree in 5 years. During that time he also edited two weekly papers. the East Providence Post and the Seekonk Star. He retired again in 1981. but returned to journalism the next year working at the Federation Voice. published by the Jewish Federation of Rhode Island. Now that he has retired for the third time and his wife has retired from her Job as a psychiatric social worker at Butler Hospital. Zel plans to complete a novel he began 20 years ago. If Zel can translate even a fraction of his wealth of knowledge. spirit. and experience into that bookit should be a remarkable novel. The story. by the way. is about an idealistic Journal. ist and his search for peace. I. for one. look forward to reading it. Mr. President. I ask that an article from the Call of Sunday.

In an ara when family values are sometimes questioned. Rose Kennedy has inspired us to her devotion to her family as well as by the values and tradition which she has imparted to that family.

Those who know Rose Kennedy know that that record of public service is due in great part to the values and to the influence which she has had on her own family. President Kennedy defined courage as \"grace under pressure.\" By that standard and by any standard Rose Kennedy is a woman of great courage. She has known tragedies which fev of us are capable of knowing. She has lost three of her sons in service to their country. a loss which no mother should have to bear. But she has borne those losses publicly and those tragedies publicly with great courage. with the grace. and the dignity which I think serve as an inspiration to all of us.

It was a shameful apologia for repression and a pathetic excuse for inaction. In parts of his address. he made a nation that is like a prison seem like a country which is a paradise. To the extent that he indicated any regret over the conditions under which the black majority in South Africa must live. his expressions of concern made crocodile tears seem like Perier water by comparison. I would have been far more impressed with his argument against sanctions if the people he wants to help agreed with him. but the truth is that virtually all of the major black leaders in South Africa: Nelson Mandella. Oliver Tambou. Bishop Tutu. and the Reverend Bosak as are the leaders of all of the black African states in the region. are pleading with him to impose sanctions. In view of the fact that the very people he says he wants to help are in favor of sanctions. it constitutes an act of moral arrogance and political cynicism for the President to take the position that he knows better than they do what is in their own best interests. The debate in the Congress over South Africa is not over whether to impose. but what kind of sanctions to impose against South Africa.

I introduced a bill that cr att: a panel designed to reform intercollegiate athletics. There is a builtin conflict in running a major sports program and being an educator at the same time. In the quest for the sports dollar. college athletic programs often seek not to produce educated. wellrounded students. but to turn a profit. Such programs often enroll athletes who cannot be considered students in any sense. These athletes do not attend class and live like campus royalty with no pretense of attaining passing grades or graduating. Too many of these youngsters leave the university upon completion of their eligibility. unprepared for life and vulnerable in many ways. College athletic programs should be integrated into the university and student athletes should be personally integrated. Unfortunately. some educators wash their hands of athletics. consigning it to a separate. independent category. believing that they are insulating their academic programs from the commercialism of sports. Though the National Collegiate Athletic Association has attempted some halfhearted reforms in recent years. it has failed to reform the system. Its time for a national and rational plan to control collegiate athletic abuses.

Our national economy has been thrown off course by a persistent trade deficit. a lagging farm economy. and an abrupt decline in employment and investment in the energy sector. Recent figures indicate that industrial production is down. capacity utilization is down. and retail sales are down throughout the United States. The evidence Is overwhelming that the administrations forecast of 4percent economic growth for 1986 is pitifully off the mark. forecasting dire prospects for the budget deficit. Todays numbers make clear how seriously the trade deficit is restraining our economy. Last month. for the first time. we actually bought more farm Jul 2. 1986 products from abroad then we sold on world markets. Between April and June. Imports grew seven times as fast as exports. As a result. American business is not investing enough or selling enough abroad to sustain economic growth. A month ago. the House passed a comprehensive trade bill which. if it becomes law. will turn the tide on trade deficits. The time has come for this administration to recognize the thrat that the trade deficit poses to An rican jobs. farms. and industry. .Le administration must cast aside itz implacable opposition to a national trade policy and embrace. instead. a fair tough program that will restore robust economic growth and enhance Americas competitiveness in world markets.",

Mr. President. a recent New York Times article entitled: \"Elagu Vaba Eesti.\" long live free Estonia. speaks of the efforts of the EstonianAmerican community in this country to keep attention focused on the continuing Soviet oppression in their homeland.

One of the key efforts of the BalticAmerican community is to secure official recognition of Baltic Freedom Day on June 14 of each year.

I am pleased we are considering House Joint Resolution 499. \"Womens History Week.\" which sets aside the week of March 28. 1986 for us. as a nation. to recognize these women. In my own State of Utah. one cannot think of the founding of its territory without being reminded of the women who emigrated to the mountain deserts of Utah from all parts of the United States and from other countries of the world. From the very beginning. women were part of the settlement of Utah. Three women came with the advance company of Morman pioneers to enter Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. An additional 60 women marched with the Mormon Battalion from Fort Leavenworth. KS. to Santa Fe. NM. and spent the winter of 184647 at Pueblo. CO. before entering the Salt Lake Valley just a few days behind the advance company. They were accompanied by another 20 women who had migrated from Mississippi and Illinois and wintered with the battalion women at Pueblo. Before the end of July 1847. there were almost as many women in Utah as there were mena fact which set Utah apart from most Western territories. In the companies which subsequently migrated from the Midwestern and Eastern United States and from Europe. women continued to come in numbers equal to men. The settlement of Utah began with a partnership of men and women. and that pattern has continued to characterize the \"family State\" to this day. In the past 5 years. \"Womens History Week\" has been met with a great deal of enthusiasm and support. Celebration of this week has included such events as panels. media shows. school programs. lectures. conferences. and rallies. Public awareness of the part women have played in our Nations past has risen remarkably. I am delighted to be joined by 31 of my colleagues and by Congresswoman BARBARA BOXER. sponsor of the resolution in the House of Representatives. in supporting this resolution.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the bill I am introducing today is a revised version of legislation I introduced last month. S. 2001. This bill retains the mandate of S. 2001 that the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment undertake a program of research into health outcomes associated with medical and surgical procedures. It is my intention that the center give priority to those procedures most significant for the Medicare population in terms of cost. risk. frequency. and length of hospitalization. But the bill I am introducing today also contains important changes from my earlier proposal. First. it makes absolutely clear that the funds to be made available for this research from the Medicare trust fund cannot exceed $4 million per year for fiscal years 1987. 1988. and 1989a total of $12 million. My earlier proposal. S. 2001. would have permitted a much larger allocation of funds from the trust fund. far in excess of what was prudent or practical and far more than I should have proposed. That was a mistake and I intend this legislation to completely supersede S. 2001. Second. in light of the reduced funding contained in the bill I am introducing today. I have deleted the requirement for the establishment of a national advisory council. The available funding is better allocated to conduct the research itself. The National Center for Health Services Research has sufficient authority to consult experts in the field to provide guidance in the selection of these research projects and I expect them to do so. In addition. the National Center already meets informally with a number of agencies that I suggested for inclusion on the national advisory council and it is my intention that they include health outcomes research on their agenda so that related agencies are kept apprised of this research effort and can lend their expertise. Finally. the bill includes a new section requiring the National Center for Health Services Research to report to the appropriate committees of the Congress on the results of this research and to provide. in cooperation with the appropriate medical specialties. for widespread dissemination of the results.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today. joined by 11 of my colleagues. to introduce a bill to grant a Federal charter to the 82nd Airborne Division Association. The 82nd Airborne Division was originally activated as an infantry division which participated in three of the major campaigns of World War I: Lorraine. St. Mihiel. MeuseArgonne. On May 27. 1919. the 82nd Division was inactivated. The division was reactivated on March 25. 1942. under the command of Maj. Gen. Omar Bradley and became the Armys first airborne division under the command of Maj. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway. Deployed to North Africa. the 82nd made parachute and glider assaults on Sicily and Salerno. In a 2year period during World War II. the regiments of the 82nd saw action in Italy at Anzio. in France at Normandy. where I landed with them. and at the Battle of the Bulge. Following the end of the war. the sky soldiers of the 82nd were ordered to Berlin for occupation duty where they became known as \"Americas Guard of Honor.\" The division saw action again in Santo Domingo in 1965 and in the I Corps section of Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 during the Tet counteroffensives. Designed to move quickly to any part of the world and to be prepared to fight immediately upon arrival. the members of the 82nd Airborne have served with distinction for over 45 years. They have demonstrated a tireless commitment to our Nations defense and ideals. Therefore. I can think of no other military association more deserving of the recognition given by Congress in the granting of a Federal charter. I urge my colleagues in this body to join me in cosponsoring this measure to grant such a charter to the 82nd Airborne Division Association. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the measure be printed in the RECORD.",

Every day I hear from farmers in my State who do not have enough money to put their crops in this spring. They cannot get the money either. This past January. I held a hearing on farm credit in North Dakota. and among the many messages I heard. one was that it is the interest that is killing our farmers. If we can reduce the interest costs. many of our farmers would be able to make a go of it when they otherwise would surely fail. Our farmers just cant keep paying 12. 13. 14 percent on their loans and still make the grade. We have a genuine agricultural crisis on our hands. Affordable credit now could tip the scales in favor of many farmers and ranchers and allow them to weather these difficult times. To top it off. the farmers lender of last resort. the Farmers Home Administration. has used up all of its money in North Dakota for direct operating loans. And were in the midst of the heavy lending season. We just passed farm credit legislation at the end of last year. I almost didnt support that legislation because I didnt think it did enough for the farmers. It helped shore up the Farm Credit System and that was necessary. But there isnt much benefit trickling down directly to the farmers. Thats why we need more legislation. and thats why we need this billand we need it now. I applaud my colleagues. Senator MELCHER and Senator FORD. for their work in this area. I am pleased to be in their company. and I hope the remainder of my colleagues will give their support to this measure as well.*",

I am dedicated to seeing to it that they are repaired and brought up to current Corps of Engineers design standards. The legislation that I am introducing today is needed because. at the present time. the Corps of Engineers does not have the authority to repair roads that were constructed prior to the enactment of Public Law 86645. the River and Harbors Act of 1960. This bill would modify section 9 of the 1946 Flood Control Act which provides the corp with the authority to repair roads that are considered to have been damaged by the operation of Army reservoir projects. to include the Toppers and Whitehorn Cove roads. The corps contends that these roads were not damaged due to reservoir operations. and therefore do not feel the obligation or authority to repair them. The corps. however. has inspected the roads and agree that they are extremely hazardous because of their steep embankments and lack of lateral stability on the surface of the roads. They state that maintenance is most difficult since there are no shoulders. Mr. President. I introduce this legislation today out of deep concern. Government redtape is standing in the way of the much needed repair of these roads. While different governmental entities are denying the responsiblity to repair these roads. people are continuing to be hurt. and in at least one instance killed. because these hazardous roads are not repaired by todays safety standards.

What the amendment does is take away $15 million that has been appropriated for the National Endowment for Democracy. This organization sets its own agenda. NED does little to monitor and evaluate its own programs. and taxpayers never really know if funds appropriated to NED are properly used and accounted for. NED essentially doles money out to the AFLCIO. the chamber of commerce. and the Democratic and Republican Parties. and they turn around and give the money to their favorite organizations in countries all across the world. We see no tangible results from hundreds of the funded projects. and some of the projects do more to undermine democracy than to promote it. I heartily applaud NEDs assistance to La Prensa. but that same assistance could be offered through other Government agencies and we could save millions of dollars wasted by the NED bureaucracy. If you read the 1984 GAO report on NED or the May 1986 testimony on NEDs administration of its grant program presented by GAO. you will be appalled and you will vote for this amendment. I want to remind you again of who gets the money. Believe it or not. this money goes to the Democratic Party. the Republican Party. the AFLCIO. and the chamber of commerce. There is no coordination between them. There is no coordination as to whether two or three groups are giving grants to organizations in Nicaragua or Argentina or France. or whether theyre giving grants to competing organizations in a country. In one instance NED gave money to an organization trying to overthrow the Mitterrand government in France. How do you think we would feel if Mitterand sent money to this country to a group to help overthrow the U.S. Government?",

I find it totally unacceptable that NED should have supported opposition groups in France. an established democracy and NATO ally. I am. however. confident that the NED board under the leadership of John Richardson and Carl Gershmantwo sincere and very thoughtful menwill make sure that these mistakes are not repeated. The National Endowment for Democracy is doing innovative and constructive work. In Poland. NED has helped sustain the spirit of Solidarity. In South Africa. it is working on behalf of democracy and majority rule in that troubled land. In Chile. the National Endowment for Democracy is working with the opposition partiesat their requestto help replace the Pinochet dictatorship with a democratic government. It would be a tragedy to drop this effort. I would particularly like to commend the work of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. Under the leadership of Brian Atwood. NDI is playing a key role in the process of reconciliation in Northern Ireland. NDI has developed a close relationship with the SDLP. the democratic alternative to the IRA in the Provinces Catholic community. By helping the SDLP enhance its organizational and political skills. NDI is strengthening the one element that can effectively work to negotiate a settlement in that troubled province. NDI and its republican counterpart played a very useful role as election observers in the Philippines and thus helped insure that Ferdinand Marcos did not get away with stealing the elections. NDI is now working with Argentinas Congress and will soon undertake a study mission to Pakistan. I believe the NED experiment is producing results and should be continued.",

Mr. President. an extraordinarily shortsighted amendment. In the less than 3 short years since the birth of the National Endowment for Democracy. it has created an impressive record. In the Philippines. the Endowments Free Trade Union Institute provided massive assistance to rural and urban democratic unions against the combined assaults of the antidemocratic right and left. the Endowments two party institutes sponsored a major international observer delegation which contributed to assuring respect for the Filipino peoples will during the recent Presidential elections. In Northern Ireland. the Endowments National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. working with the Social Democratic and Labour Party of Northern Ireland. has developed a program to strengthen the SDLP by helping it create an institute for partybuilding and education development activities. In Poland. the National Endowment for Democracy is providing aid to Solidarity and for a wide range of independent intellectual and cultural activities. In Nicaragua. timely endowment assistance has enabled La Prensa. that countrys only independent newspaper. to survive. In South Africa. the endowment is giving support to lawyers working for human rights and for the peaceful dismantling of apartheid. In Haiti. the Endowment for Democracy has given support to an emerging free trade union movement and for the establishment of a center to promote research. civic education. and democratic cooperation for the consolidation of Haitis democracy in the postDuvalier era. What better tool in public diplomacy than providing financial and moral support to proponents of freedom and democracy around the world? That is precisely what the National Endowment for Democracy does in Guatemala. Granada. Panama. Nicaragua. the Dominican Republic. Chile. Argentina. Peru. Poland. Northern Ireland. Portugal. Afghanistan. the Philippines. China. South Africa. Southern Africa. and a host of other countries around the world. The National Endowment for Democracy embodies the U.S. commitment to democracy to leaders and future leaders in every corner of the globe. Having achieved a remarkable degree of success in making new friends for the United States and for the democratic process. we must not now eliminate the opportunity to strengthen those relationships and foster new ones among the people of the world community who are struggling to keep freedom and democracy alive.

In 1982. with the cooperation of the senior Senator from Arizona. Congress enacted the Telecommunications for the Disabled Act. also to help hearing impaired people. In compliance with the Disabled Act. the Federal Communications Commission has categorized certain telephones as \"essential.\" and these must be hearingaid compatible. Essential telephones include coinoperated telephones and telephones provided for emergency use. such as those in elevators. along highways. tunnels. and bridges. The FCC also requires that a portion of new telephones installed in hotel and motel rooms. hospitals and nursing homes. and public parts of offices and businesses be hearingaid compatible. Today all new domestically manufactured telephones are hearingaid compatible. All operating Western Electric/AT&T/Bell System telephones are compatible. all telephones on Capitol Hill are compatible. About half of the imports are compatible. According to both the industry and the Commerce Department. compatible telephones are not more expensive to produce or in retail price than telephones which are not compatible. The General Services Administration. for example. procures only compatible telephones. The advocates of this amendment dont find fault with the Disabled Act or with the FCCs enforcement and application of the act. Both have done a lot to help people who rely on hearing aids. They have given hearing aid users a taste of what it is like to use the telephone. Now we want to expand their access to cover all new telephones. If the FCC is studying the act to gauge its effectiveness. thats just fine. It is effective. but it covers only telephones categorized as \"essential.\" Most of us could not carry on in our homes. at our jobs. or anywhere else for as much as 1 day without using a telephone. Using the telephone has become an indispensable part of modern life. It is essential to find a job and keep a job. it is essential to maintain normal contact with other people. it is essential for mobility.

Now. however. GAO has determined that that is inconsistent with the underlying statute and that not only should our reimbursement for such purchases be made in full within 45 days but also that we should work out a lumpsum settlement of our account for furniture already in inventory.

I probably will not take 3 minutes. but I think that we ought to include in the RECORD at this pointand I am a very strong supporter of small business. and a very strong admirer of Mr. AsPIN and Mr. CooPERbut I am concerned about textiles. Presently the small business groups get about 92 percent of all the defense textile business. This excludes a tremendous amount of expertise that is available only in the large companies such as Milliken. West PointPepperell. and others. What is happening in this respect is that these companies are joint venturing with foreign firms. For instance. not many people know that there is not one single firm in the United States that can manufacture chemicalwarfare protective clothing. So I had supported the Aspin amendment which would have brought this back down to 38 percent and in my opinion balanced it out in a little bit better way. However. I will not object to Mr. CooPERs compromise here at this time. but I do want to maybe talk about it in conference a lttle bit later. One other thing that is happening is that the Defense Department in dealing with their share of business to small firms is throwing it all over into the textile arena. exempting many of these firms from their percentage of high technology type business. So I think that we have a real problem here and a dilemma which is going to create a drastic problem with the apparel and clothing and footwear that defense organizations will have in future years. A report recently to Mr. NICHOLS committee. the Subcommittee on Investigations. simply pointed out that in a period of something less than a decade. this country will not be able to clothe its military people if we continue on the path along which we are going right now. So as a proponent of small business. a very strong supporter of Mr. MITCHELL and Mr. CoOPER and Mr. AsPIN.

I heard just now and earlier the crazy argument that somehow defense contractors. corporate financial officers should have less responsibility and greater protection than taxpayers or Social Security recipients or other businesses. Let me read 18 U.S.C. 1003: A citizen making a demand against the United States of America for more than $100 must certify the claim. at risk of perjury. punishable by $10.000 in fines and 5 years in prison. We have had every time trips to Pago Pago. congressional honorariuns. dog boarding has come up. and those same corporate officials. official officers say it is not occurring. When we show them their own invoices they say. \"We dont know about it.\" What the gentleman is proposing to do then is give them an excuse. but not give it as an excuse to the taxpayer. Earlier the gentleman said there is a difference between taxpayers who foot the bill and these people who are billing the Federal Government. The difference. I submit. is that the taxpayer does not get to bring his accountant and his lawyer to the audit and say they are at fault. do not punish me. You are proposing that that system. which is the system currently in existence. be continued. We simply say that ignorance may be bliss for these officials. but under the law. for Social Security recipients. for Medicare recipients. for school lunch kids. for everyone from the bottom to the top are going to be treated the same.

In response to the gentlemans statement. all we are trying to do. or all he is trying to do is put a company in the same position as a private citizen. I respond in the following way: When a private citizen certifies that his tax return is correct. he has read it. and when he certifies that his claim against the Federal Government contains the facts to his own knowledge. it is his own claim. The individual. there is not one. there is no law in existence in America that requires an individual citizen of the United States to make a certification with criminal penalties and sanctions with respect to the actions of a third party of which he does not see. and which maybe by mistake an error be made. So I really cannot see how anybody would do business with the Federal Government if the certifying officer of that company could have criminal sanctions attached to his behavior. risking a jail sentence. risking a criminal record. if a mistake occurs in one of tens of thousands of vouchers sent to the Federal Government by 1.000 employees inside the corporation in which he works. It would be ridiculous for that company to subject that individual to criminal sanctions under those types of circumstances. So I think there is a dramatic difference between the situation as I have described it and the situation with food stamps. or ones own complaint. or ones tax return. In that particular case. you are dealing from personal knowledge. you are dealing from what you do yourself. and you know yourself. You are not certifying the accuracy of reports that you. in fact. have never seen. that no one can expect you possibly to review in one lifetime.",

This is truly a national problem: it does not Just affect large cities or certain areas of our country. Last month I held a congressional hearing in Tacoma. WA. and heard the message loud and clear that the numbers of homeless in all of our home towns are increasing. for a variety of reasons. It is estimated that more than 2 million people in the United States are homeless. Since emergency shelters nationwide have the capacity for only 111.000 people. the majority of the homeless are left without a place to sleep and many of these people risk freezing to death in the bitter cold winter months. A major contributing factor to homelessness is the severe shortage of lowincome housing. Since 1981. Federal funding for section 8 housing assistance has been reduced by 44 percent. The total number of housing units available through the program has been reduced by 69 percent. Despite the increasing homeless population and the lack of adequate emergency shelter. the administrations fiscal year 1986 budget proposes a 2year freeze on additional HUDsubsidized housing. This would reduce the number of units available through the HUDprogram by approximately 65.000. The administrations budget also calls for a 95percent reduction in budget authority for the section 8 lowincome housing assistance program. and a reduction in budget authority for the Public Housing Loan Program from $14.9 billion in fiscal year 1985 to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 1986. The Federal Government cannot ignore its responsibility in helping to eliminate a major cause of homelessness. We in the Congress must seize the opportunity this spring to work for more affordable lowincome housing. Our goal should be to reduce and to eliminate the number of individuals who will be without adequate shelter next winter.e",

Through good times and bad. this New England artist and writer remained firm in his desire to keep alive the greatness of this countrys earlier years. His presence will be sorely missed. However. to dwell on his passing is not what Eric Sloane would have wanted. Eric stood for something that surpasses death: celebration. He came to symbolize joy. the joy that springs from a deep understanding and an openness to the inspiration and greatness of our past. In his words: Most of my lifetime has been in painting and writing. with the steadfast purpose of retrieving certain worthwhile things of the American past. There are countless examples of his efforts in this regard. One is his \"I Remember America\" exhibit. which was shown in the Soviet Union as a means of increasing the Soviets understanding of our national heritage. Another is the SloaneStanley Tool Museum. which Eric founded and directed. This institution is American history. Yet a third example is the center mural at the National Air and Space Museum here in Washington. Eric produced this work for the bicentennial opening of that institution. The accomplishment that best demonstrates Eric Sloanes commitment to preserving our national Identity was his successful effort to revive the tradition of ringing bells on Independence Day. We have Eric to thank for the glorious sound of bells chiming simultaneously across America each Fourth of July. In short. though sadness inevitably accompanies the passing of such a wonderful human being as Eric Sloane. this time of reflection also affords us a chance to appreciate his contribution to our lives. For 80 years. we had in our presence a man who devoted his life energies to the celebration of all that is good about these United States. That our Nation can create a man of such dedication and patriotism is cause for thanks. Let us hope that more like Eric Sloane follow. for then indeed can we say that our best days lie ahead.*",

Earlier this week. the Commerce Department announced that the U.S. current account deficitthe broadest measure of a nations financial and trade relationships with the rest of the worldhas reached the unprecedented level of $101 billion. In short. the most developed country in the world is rapidly becoming a net debtor nation. joining the ranks of Third World countries such as Mexico and Brazil. Experts agree that the leading cause for this staggering debt is our record $123 billion trade deficit. to which Japan contributed over $36 billion. At a time when the United States is speeding toward severe traderelated economic problems. I find very disturbing the Presidents decision to abandon the VRA without seeking trade concessions from Japan. Past efforts to urge Japan to ease its protectionist trade policies have largely failed. To achieve relief from Japans high trade barriers. we need to increase our leverage on the Japanese Government. not weaken it by abandoning a bargaining chip as valuable as the auto restraints. Mr. Speaker. I am offering a new approach to moderating imports of Japanese automobiles into the United States and opening up Japanese markets to U.S. exports. My measure would call for reimposition of the VRA for an additional 3 years at the current 1.85 million autos per year annual level. However. the measure would also permit Japan to increase its auto exports 15 percent annually. about the 1.85 million limit. if it increases its imports of U.S. agricultural and industrial products by $10 billion over the same 3year period. An increase in U.S. exports of this magnitude could create 250.000 American jobs. I believe this resolution represents a responsible step toward addressing the larger. menacing problem of our enormous trade deficit. while protecting Jobs at home and giving the U.S. auto and related industries the reprieve needed to prepare for the eventual lifting of Japanese auto import restraints. I urge that it be given early committee consideration and be considered on the House floor as soon as possible.*",

Some of the homeless take refuge in crowded shelters while others attempt to brave the elements hovered over hot air grates or in abandoned buildings. In January. I Joined a number of our colleagues in forming a bipartisan HouseSenate Task Force on the Homeless. The purpose of this unfunded task force is to educate and to facilitate communication on how to deal with this disturbing national problem. In the face of confusion and gaps in knowledged concerning the homeless. it has been very difficult for policymakers and programs to address the problem in a meaningful and effective way. It is likely that the solutions will be as diverse as the causes of the problem and the people who make up the ranks of the homeless. It is certain. though. that solutions must be actively sought for this tragic problem.*",

Since the House of Representatives. the peoples House. has served as a matchless resource for our Nations youth. It must be available to all our Nations youth. Mr. Speaker.

This year marks the 110th anniversary of Sears death. and I would like to take this opportunity to tell you a little about him. Edmund Hamilton Sears was born in Sandisfield. MA. on April 6. 1810. Although resources were such that Sears was unable to obtain formal education during his early years. his love for books and learning surpassed this limitation. Early in his youth he began his ventures into poetry and prose. He wrote many poems. sermons. and hymns. Through hard work he received an opportunity to attend Westfield Academy and then in 1831 enter Union College in Schenectady. NY from which he graduate in 1834. At Union College his writing abilities received him an editorial position on the Parthenon. the school paper. and many awards for his literature. Soon after graduation he accepted a teaching job in Brattleboro. VT. Under the instruction of Rev. Addison Brown. he studied theology and thus entered the Harvard Divinity School. from where he graduated in 1837. After graduation he assumed an appointment as missionary of the American University Association. He was then invited to become minister of the Unitarian Church in Wayland. MA where he was ordained in February 20. 1839 and later installed in the Lancaster Unitarian Church. Sears was invited to join many larger churches yet he refrained because he perferred the small and more secluded churches. His writings affected a large group and were particularly satisfying to many of that time. His literature. which made a great contribution to Christian literature. was forceful and unique. While his sermons and writings were well known during his lifetime. today he is best remembered for two hymns: \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" and \"Calm on the Listening Ear of Night.\" On November 30. 1986 the people of New Boston Congregational Church in Sandisfield. MA will be honoring the life and works of E.H. Sears. Among those in attendance will be Emily Vogellus and her sisters Isabelle and Helen of the Sandisfield area who are descendents of E.H. Sears. Their brother Wallace and other relatives will also be present at the ceremony. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to one of the oldest communities in the United States. Snow Hill. MD. on the 300th anniversary of the issuing of its original charter. On October 26. 1686. Somerset County granted a charter to the residents of Snow Hill to establish a royal port for the shipping of tobacco. lumber. and produce to England as well as a receiving port for slaves and products manufactured in England. The first documentation known to exist is the Somerset County rent rolls of the Second Lord Baltimore in 1669. The Snow Hill town then consisted of 500 acres surveyed for William Stevenson. 250 acres possessed by Henry Bushop. and 250 acres by Thomas Peterkin in the right of George Bishop. This document also verifies that Snow Hill had been used as a landing port for several years before the actual rentrolls survey. \"Each possessor of a lot was to pay .01 Penny Sterling per annum for each Lot so taken up. paid for and built upon to the right Honorable Lord Proprietary and his heirs forever.\" is a direct quote from Bacons Laws of Maryland in 1742. chapter 11. concerning the property in Snow Hill. Snow Hill is situated on the Pokamoke River far enough upstream to protect ships from the raging storms which sometimes lash the mouth of the Chesapeake. Todays large oceangoing vessels are not as likely to use such a port. So. this once thriving waterfront community has become a beautiful small town that is rich in tradition and history. The town courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1894. Unfortunately. most of the early records were lost. The history and records that survived were retained by the early church congregations or passed down through generations. Makemie United Presbyterian Church. the first regularly organized Presbyterian church in America. dates back to 1683. and All Hollows Episcopal Church was founded in 1692. Today. Snow Hill is the county seat of Worcester County. MD. For over 300 years. Snow Hill has provided Maryland and the Nation with fine leaders and outstanding citizens. As Snow Hill enters her fouth century. the people of Marylands First Congressional District join in saluting Snow Hill for its outstanding achievements that have contributed so much to Maryland and the country. and wish the residents much continued success.",

I am here for another purpose. but listening to the argument. the basic fairness of human rights. in such a manner and presented in such a good. unique way. based upon facts. nonemotional. I think it is persuasive to my colleagues. I wish we had more here to listen to this. and I hope that some of them are listening to the TV and the communications system we have in effect. because today it might be Sakharov and Mrs. Bonner. tomorrow it could be somebody else. The principle is there. It will never change. We can go back in history and find history repeating itself so many times. If you ignore. as an individual or a responsible government official. the situatin that is so basic. it is going to come back to haunt you. I would just hope that in the next special order. if it is necessary. that the notices go out and maybe some other Members who might not be too active in this area or this arena would be here to help make a salient point so that the world. through this record. would take cognizance of the unjustice that has occurred.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. His words are very much appreciated. Mr. Speaker. I just want to reiterate in very simple terms what we have here: Two very distinguished people. Andrei Sakharov in particular. a man who was a Nobel winner for efforts on behalf of the Soviet Union. He did not win the Nobel Prize for helping Nepal or Abu Dhabi. He won it as a Soviet citizen. as a servant of the Soviet state. For expressing views which would be commonplace in any open and democratic society. Andrei Sakharov and Yelena Bonner find themselves on trial. They are convicted of a sentence which. in itself. violated Soviet law. They are then confined to an exile for longer than Soviet law allows. and now to compound the illegal and unjustified and arbitrary treatment that these two now aging and ailing people have to sit by watch their families receive altered mail. be shut off from any communication. and we have a situation where the families literally cannot know today what the state is of their existence or their health. Again. we want to express to the Soviet Union the simple point that many of us here would like to see progress in arms reduction. We would like to see a reduction of tensions around the world. We hope the Soviet leadership will understand the relevance of the very simple human pleas that are being made on behalf of these two terribly mistreated. brave people. If the Soviet Unions new leadership is at all interested in fostering good relations. can they not understand what a useful step it would be for them to show a little humanity in the case of Sakharov and Bonner. and many others similarly situated? It will cost them nothing. It will detract not one wit from their economic growth. from their military strength. It will enhance their world political position. No one is asking them to sacrifice. We are simply asking them for a little humanity.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank my colleagues. the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. FRANK. and the gentleman from New York. Mr. GILMAN. for calling this very important special order today. The continued persecution of Nobel Prize Winner Andrei Sakharov and his wife. Dr. Yelena Bonner. calls into serious question the desire of the Soviet Union to be included in the community of civilized nations. and clearly raises doubts about their desire to comply with international agreements which they have voluntarily signed. The internal exile of Andrei Sakharov to Gorky over 5 years ago. violates the Soviet Unions own law and constitution. In addition. the refusal to allow his wife and he to travel abroad for medical attention violates the Helsinki accords. the U.N. Charter. and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Man. I suppose these violations should come as no surprise to us. granted that the character of the Soviet regime has been marked by continued repressions and brutalities against their own people and their neighbors. No one should soon forget the Soviet regimes conduct in the streets of Budapest and Prague and in the hills of Afghanistan. Still. the treatment of Andrei Sakharov. an individual of worldwide renown. has touched the hearts and minds of all who share a concern for world liberty. From the earliest reports of their detention by the KGB. to recent reports on the possible removal of Dr. Sakharov and his wife from their Gorky apartment. Members of this House have raised their voices in protest. I know that I and several of my colleagues have had the opportunity to meet with Soviet officials. both here and overseas. on the Sakharov case. In almost every instance. our conversations have been unproductive in securing the couples release. Still. I believe we have responsibility to speak out. to raise our objections clearly and consistently. and to let the Soviets know that the cause of Andrei Sakharov and Yelena Bonnor is a cause that can never be silenced. and that it is a cause shared by Members of this House and by the American people.o",

I wish to commend our distinguished collegues. BARNEY FRANK and BEN GILMAN. for their leadership in calling this special order. The Soviet Governments continued abuse of Dr. Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner is morally indefensible and it cannot and must not go unnoticed. I am appalled over the recent reports that the Sakharovs have once again been forced to move to another apartment in Gorky. further isolating them from friends and family. Over a year ago we in Congress called upon the Soviet Union to allow Yelena Bonner and Dr. Sakharov to emigrate to the West. Our request fell on deaf ears. I find it incomprehensible that the Soviets continue to deny the Sakharovsand many othersthe fundamental human rights of living where one chooses. When the Soviet Government signed the Helsinki Accords in 1975. it accepted the solemn international obligation to its own citizens as well as to the rest of the world to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Yet the Soviet Government has failed to observe the international human rights obligations it has accepted. but instead it continues to persecute Hebrew teachers. Christian and Jewish believers. and human rights activists. such as Anatoliy Shcharansky and Andrei Sakharov. We must continue to demand that the Soviets honor their obligations. The Sakharovspeople of great courage. humanity. and dignitydeserve to be able to live where they choose. to think and speak as they choose. Their continued harassment and persecution demonstrates the most heinous side of Soviet insensitivity to human rights.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Andrei Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner are two eminently courageous Individuals and they stand today as nothing less than historic figures in the ongoing. universal struggle for basic human rights. The Sakharovs need and deserve every bit of honor and support that we can give them. and I congratulate my colleagues. BARNEY FRANK and BEN GILMAN. for taking this time today. As the world knows. Andrei Sakharov is a Soviet academician and brilliant physicist. He and his wife were among the elite of Soviet society and were entitled to all the privileges that go with that kind of status in the U.S.S.R. But they chose principle over comfort and status. and began a battle for human rights in the U.S.S.R. that resulted in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. This struggle also resulted in their being banished by the Soviet authorities to the industrial city of Gorky in 1980. For the past 5 years Sakharov and Bonner have endured a cruel. destructive. and illegal banishment that has damaged their health and caused them to engage in hunger strikes as a means to force the authorities to alter their treatment and isolation. When we think about this valiant couple. we need to remind ourselves that they are speaking for many thousands of other Soviet citizens who suffer under that government. We honor Sakharov and Bonner and we express our growing concern for their well being and in doing this we also remember the many others in the U.S.S.R. who seek the right to speak. to read. to practice their religion and to emigrate.0",

In violation of Soviet law and human rights. the Sakharovs are being held in almost complete isolation. Now is the time to protest this illegal and senseless abuse of the Sakharov family. Mr. Sakharov has been exiled in Gorky for over 5 years. He has never. however. been convicted of a crime. His wife. Yelena Bonner. has also been exiled with him for over a year. There Is real concern about the health of both of them. Their mail has been tampered with and they may have been moved to another apartment in Gorki. The KGB has denied the Sakharovs a television. telephone. and a typewriter. They even jammed their radio. In addition to ignoring their own laws. the Soviets routinely violate the Helsinki accords which they signed in 1975. Once again. we see that law and international accords mean little to the Kremlin. For these reasons. I join my colleagues in protesting the Soviet Unions abuse of the Sakharovs.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to Join my colleagues in expressing the concern of this Congress and the American people for the fate of Andrei Sakharov and his wife. Yelena Bonner. For more than 5 years nowunder four stepg:ate leadersthe Soviet Government has illegally held this Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife in internal exile. What was their crime? Even the Kremlin has not been able to fabricate a charge that would justify the actions they have taken. The Sakharovs only crime was that they dared to monitor Soviet compliance with the provisions of the Helsinki accords. and spoke out against the regimes flagrant human rights violations. The truth continues to be a threat to Soviet totalitarianism. Fortunately. we in the West do not have the same fear of the truth. The Kremlin may be able to silence the voices of Andrei Sakharov and Yelena Bonner. but their fate and their message will continue to be heard. Mr. Gorbachev must know that the Congress of the United States is monitoring not only the fate of the Sakharovs. but the state of human rights in the Soviet Union which they have so courageously sought to defend. Mr. Gorbachev is still new in his job. He represents a new generation of Soviet leadershipone not burdened with the dark traditions of Stalinism. We in this Congress invite Mr. Gorbachev to take an important step in improving relations with the West by releasing the Sakharovs and complying with the Helsinki accords. We are greatly concerned for the health of the Sakharovs and we urge Soviet authorities to allow Miss Bonner to seek medical attention in the West. I can assure the Kremlin that continued persecution of the Sakharovs and continued Soviet violations of human rights. will not go unnoticed or unanswered in this country.*",
