    "speech": "Leader PELOSI. thank you for your kind words. Members of the House. the Senate. my wife Debbie. who is with us todaythankfully the girls are workingand all of you and our fellow countrymen. we meet again at democracys great port of call. Every 2 years. at this hour. the Constitution brings a new order to this House. and its an interlude for reflection. a glimpse of old truths. To our new Members and their families. let me just say \"welcome.\" I know youre feeling a bit awestruck at this moment. History runs through this building. Now youre among a select few to share in this privilege. For those of you who are returning. whove walked these aisles before. maybe its time we get a little awestruck again. The way our Founders envisioned it. the Republic would be led by citizens who recognize the blessings that we receive by governing ourselves. and it requires that we give something of ourselves. Everything depended on this. So they made each other and their successors swear an oath of allegiance. In a few moments. Ill take this oath for the 12th time as the representative from the Eighth District of Ohio. It is word for word the same oath that we all take. Note that it makes no mention of party or faction or title. It contains no reference to agendas or to platforms. only to the Constitution. The one addition we dare make. as George Washington did at the very first inaugural. is to invoke the assistance of our Heavenly Father. This covenant makes us servants of posterity. It calls us to refuse the pull of passing interest and follow the fixed star of a more perfect union. Put simply. were sent here not to be something. but to do something. Or as I like to call it. \"doing the right thing.\" Its a big job. and it comes with big challenges. Our government has built up too much debt. Our economy is not producing enough jobs. And these are not separate problems. At $16 trillion and rising. our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state. The American Dream is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt. Break its hold. and we begin to set our economy free. jobs will come home. and confidence will come back. We do this not just to boost GDP or reduce unemployment. but to secure for our children a future of freedom and opportunity. and. frankly. nothing is more important. As Washington wrote in his farewell address. \"We should not throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\" Well. that burden is ours. and so is the opportunity. Theres no substitute for the wisdom of the people. We here are their servants. As Speaker. I pledge to listen and to do all I can to help all of you carry out your oath of office that were all about to take. Because in our hearts we know its wrong to pass this debt on to our kids and our grandkids. Now. we have to be willing. truly willing to make this problem right. Public service was never meant to be an easy living. Extraordinary challenges demand extraordinary leadership. So if youve come here to see your name in the lights or to pass off a political victory as some accomplishment. youve come to the wrong place. The door is right behind you. If you come here humbled by the opportunity to serve. if youve come here to be the determined voice of the people. if youve come here to carry the standard of leadership demanded not by our constituents but by the times. then youve come to the right place. There is a time for every purpose under Heaven. For the 113th Congress. it is a time to rise. When the day is over and the verdict is read. maybe its said that we well and faithfully did our duty to ensure that freedom will endure and prevail. so help us God. I am now ready to take the oath of office. I ask the Dean of the House of Representatives. the Honorable JOHN D. DINGELL of Michigan. to administer the oath of office.",

This rules package is straightforward and builds upon the reforms and transparency implemented in the 112th Congress to address job creation and the economy. control the growth of government. and limit wasteful spending. We have incorporated a number of significant improvements. including a proposal from the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. JAMES LANKFORD. the gentleman from Oklahoma. to identify duplicative programs and examine the usefulness of existing government programs. This will help ensure that hardworking taxpayers dollars are not wasted and that we remain focused on making the Federal Government smarter and more efficient. Similarly. two proposals from the gentleman from Michigan. Congressman JUSTIN AMASH. will improve transparency of the legislative process by making it easier to see how proposed legislation would interact with existing law. Additional proposals from the Republican Study Committee chairman. STEVE SCALISE. the gentleman from Louisiana. will help bring more transparency to the regulatory process. American families and small businessmen and -women already suffer from too much red tape coming out of Washington. This proposal will ensure that the regulatory burden of any proposed bill is part of our deliberations. Under the current administration. Madam Speaker. we have also seen an explosion in spending for welfare programs. For the first time. we will require our annual budget resolutions include information about the growth of meanstested and nonmeanstested entitlement programs. This important reform will allow us to begin to responsibly control the growth of these welfare programs and ensure they can help those who need them most. I look forward to a productive 113th Congress where we can work together to produce results and make life work for more Americans.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I want to begin by congratulating my colleague. Mr. SESSIONS. on his new role as chair of the Rules Committee. Ive worked with Mr. SESSIONS now for many years. and I look forward to working with him even more closely in the months and years to come. And we will welcome the new class of legislators. as well. today. and we go through the traditions and procedures that have governed our Nation since Thomas Jefferson first wrote his manual. Im pleased to welcome our newest colleagues and welcome back old friends. Its a great honor to be chosen by our fellow Americans to represent them in Congress. Our neighbors have placed their trust in us. and we must never take such an honor for granted. With this honor comes a solemn responsibility. Starting today. we have the opportunity to move our Nation forward. and in the words of our Nations Founders provide for our common defense. promote our general welfare. and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and for our posterity. Our work begins today. and one of the first orders of business is considering the rules package for the incoming Congress. During the last Congress. we were promised an open and transparent process. but we unfortunately fell short. Under the majoritys leadership. more than onethird of the rules were completely closed. and at times brinksmanship endangered our economy. Today provides an opportunity for the majority to put these behind them and govern in an open. collaborative. and bipartisan way. and we are willing to meet them every step of the way. With this goal in mind. though. of this Rules Committee. I must say that I look at it with a little bit of trepidation. The most troubling for me is the proposal to. once again. adopt the Ryan budget. Doing so will keep alive dangerous budget proposals. including the repeal of parts of the Affordable Care Act. In addition. todays resolution makes it easier for Members of Congress to use private planes. and Im puzzled by that. I dont think Members should be flying around in corporate jets. And it continues the politically motivated campaign over the socalled Fast and Furious operation. To begin by loosening the ethics restrictions and advancing politically motivated campaigns should not be the priorities of Congress. Finally. with todays resolution. the majority continues their efforts to oppose marriage equality before the courts. In an age where marriage equality is recognized by Americans across the country of plurality. this Chamber should not be using taxpayer money to be standing on the wrong side of history. We could start our new beginning by joining all the Democratic colleagues and me in finally reforming our broken election laws. and I know everyone wants to do that. In the years since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in the Citizens United case. unlimited amounts of money from billionaires and hidden special interests have flooded our elections. Led by secret political spending that is hidden from public view. wealthy special interests have tried to buy our airwaves. to fund outrageously expensive campaigns. and to launch dishonest political attacks to persuade the outcome of countless elections. The Sunlight Foundation reports that during the 2012 election cycle alone. super PACs. as they are called. spent more than $620 million to affect the Federal elections. Nobody believes that corporations are people. and they should not be able to use unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections. At the end of this debate. my Democratic colleagues and I will provide the House with an opportunity to consider a constitutional amendment to overturn the flawed Citizens United decision. If approved. this amendment would finally remove the unlimited and untracked political donations from our electoral system. In addition to addressing the uncontrolled money in our political process. the Congress should be ensuring that every American citizen can easily exercise their right to vote. Voting is fundamental to what it means to be an American. but in recent years. weve seen a concerted effort to discourage voters from casting a ballot. Under the cover of a cynical and untruthful claim that voter fraud is a serious threat to our democracy. political operatives in States across the country have methodically advanced a number of discriminatory and dangerous pieces of legislation. Their methods range from enacting voter ID laws to reducing the number of voting machines in lowincome neighborhoods. Unfortunately. these discriminatory practices have indeed made it harder for our citizens to vote. This past November. there were numerous reports of voters being turned away from the polls. Many of those who did manage to vote had to wait in line for hoursand sometimes as many as 8 hoursbefore they could cast a ballot. It is clear as day that keeping people waiting in long lines is purely intended to make them give up and go home. Later today. my Democratic colleagues and I will ask the House to bring to the floor the Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early Voting Act. or SIMPLE Voting Act. This legislation would guarantee that no voter would have to wait more than 1 hour to cast their ballot and require that every polling station in the country have the resources it needs to run a smooth and fair election. When taken together. the overwhelming influence of money in politics and the discriminatory attacks on Americans right to vote. they have distorted our electoral system and helped to create a broken legislative process that is failing to serve the American public. As we open the 113th Congress. my colleagues and I stand ready to work with the majority on fixing our broken electoral system and getting back to a bipartisan legislative process worthy of the citizens who sent us here. I couldnt be happier or more honored to serve in the 113th Congress. I look forward to serving with all of my colleagues. and it is my sincere hope that well have an open. transparent. and bipartisan House so that we can produce meaningful results for those whom we represent. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Rochester. New York. I look forward to our time where we will work together day and night. perhaps. with the committee that she will be the ranking member for and I will be the chairman of. I told the gentlewoman before today that it will be my hope and her hope that we will not only work for the betterment of the institution. but also the Members. to ensure that they stand a better chance to make sure that our committee. the Rules Committee. is one that we can both look at each other and know that we have done a job that would be fair and appropriate on behalf of the minority leader. the majority leader. and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and all of our Members. The rules package before us today will continue the effort by our Republican majority to make the work of the House as open. transparent. and streamlined as possible. This work began in the 112th Congress under the leadership of former Chairman DAVID DREIER. When a number of important reforms were implemented. DAVID DREIER made sure that they worked. Today. we will continue the tradition of that transparency initiated by Chairman DREIER. The nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation recently praised our endeavors in that effort by saying: It is clear that the House has become a more transparent institution over the last 2 years. The accolades there go to the gentleman from California. DAVID DREIER. This body is wholeheartedly committed to advancing that reform process. and I am as its new chairman. Our work must begin and must always be directed to accountability. to the people who granted us the privilege of serving in this body. But the imperative for accountability is never higher than when we face tough economic times. economic times that each of us bring to the floor because of the demand upon people that we represent. As our national debt skyrockets. our economy limps sluggishly along. and unemployment remains predictably high. the need for a fully transparent and accountable process in this institution to help in that effort of unemployment in this country and to gain more jobs is one of the things which this Rules Committee and the work of the floor should be about. The rules package that we focus on today for the 113th Congress will help us to achieve that goal. It preserves the important reforms that we made in the previous Congress. while adding a few perfecting amendments and several other ideas. One such amendment in section 2 will help to streamline and expedite floor voting procedures. It is important to note. however. that these procedures are intended to be used to expedite consideration of questions of the House while ensuring that no Member is denied an adequate opportunity to vote. Section 2 also makes several improvements and clarifications in the Congressional Code of Conduct in order to more efficiently hold each Member of this body accountable. For example. it expands the current nepotism rule to conform to current law and to add grandchildren to the rule. who are not currently covered under House rules or current law. This is a strongly held bipartisan measure that has received praise from a number of transparency groups. including the Sunlight Foundation. as I mentioned at the outset. This rules package also amends the restrictions on the use of private aircraft contained in the Code of Conduct so as to harmonize House and Senate rules. These changes provide more flexibility to Members whose districts. including rural and remote locations. are not easily reached by car and do not have scheduled air service. They will also facilitate travel during extraordinary circumstances. such as in an emergency or in the aftermath of a natural disaster. At the same time. the revised rules keep in place safeguards to help ensure that such travel is fully consistent with House and ethics guidelines and rules. The new rules will simply ensure that Members pay a fair market rate for air travel. regardless of the type of aircraft that is used. Together. the amendments and the clarifications to the Code of Conduct contained in this resolution will better ensure that elective representatives. officials. and employees of the House can execute their official duties in an efficient. ethical. and transparent way. Section 3 of the rules package makes a number of separate orders. The most significant among them eliminates provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act that limit the ability of the House to respond to recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Now. House Republicans have made it very clear that we oppose ObamaCare. We have acted repeatedly to repeal and to replace this controversial law. But regardless of where any Member may stand on this issue. the question of preserving the prerogative of the House of Representatives to its work and its will without dispute or controversy must be achieved. Article I. section 5 of the Constitution very clearly states that this body has the right and the responsibility to determine the rules of its proceedings. This provision will ensure that. as we proceed with the issue of health care reform. the ability of the House to respond to the Independent Payment Advisory Board is not abridged. Sections 3 and 4 go on to make a number of adjustments that enhance our budgetary process. preserve our oversight rules. and strengthen our ethics procedures. Finally. section 5 allows the Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day through January 15. 2013. Every Member of this body has sworn an oath today to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is a very worthwhile endeavor to spend time in the first few days of this new Congress. and perhaps any Congress. to review the inspiring words of our Nations founding document. The rules package that I have just outlined for you will better enable each of us. as an institution. to perform our constitutional duties and obligations with integrity. transparency. and accountability. while streamlining its operations. Presenting this package to Hi1 the House is my first official act as chairman of the Rules Committee for the 113th Congress. and I think it exemplifies our commitment to an open and deliberative process that empowers the majority to work its will while preserving the ability of individual Members. particularly those in the minority. to present their ideas and engage in meaningful debate. I urge my colleagues to support this rules package. and I will insert. for the RECORD. a sectionbysection analysis of the resolution. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Despite bipartisan agreement in the Budget Control Act. the continuing resolution and. just this week. on the fiscal cliff. this rules package returns to the partisan stance that Republicans brought to the last Congress on fiscal issues and particularly on the budget. It deems the amounts in the Ryan budget to be the default funding levels this year. levels well below this weeks compromised agreement. We saw that in the last budget process as well. We made an agreement. and lo and behold. the budget came out with numbers substantially below that agreement.",

I will try and do my very best within the limits and constraints that I have. but my attitude is always to be stellar. and I hope that he knows that he can count on that also. I thank the gentleman very much. I would also extend that to other Members who are here. Madam Speaker. who have come down to express their ideas. Their ideas about how to make this a better place are always important. The Republican Conference. the majority. had a vigorous time yesterday afternoon as we debated the House rules. as we offered our ideas. as we debated how we could make this a better place. not just transparent but really work to the efficiency of the people who sent us here. I must say that Im fresh from that wonderful and invigorating time in which we talked about the ideas. we defended what we did and changed the things that needed to be done. Our Members all were accorded. not just equal time. but a chance to bring their ideas forth. perhaps from back home from a season of election. perhaps from their experiences that they had back home. It was really a good time for not just me as a Member but. I think. for all of us in our body. Today. we enjoy that same opportunity as we come together. Democrats and Republicans. on the floor to talk about the rules of the House. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the ranking member for yielding me the time. Madam Speaker. today is a day of great pride for every Member who has just been sworn in. particularly our newly elected Members. It is a great honor to be elected to serve in this body. On Election Day. our constituents went to their polling places and voted for us. We should be thankful for that. particularly so when. for far too many of our constituents. regardless of their political leanings. voting on Election Day was an unnecessarily burdensome. timeconsuming. and unpleasant experience. In my home county in South Carolina. voters reported waiting in line for over 4 hours. One young voter thought ahead of time. He brought an iPad. and watched the entire \"Hunger Games\" movie while in line. Others. understandably. didnt have 3 hours to spare on a workday. In Detroit. Michigan. Gina Porter waited in line for more than 3 hours before giving up. Danielle Wilkins voted after waiting for 4 hours. In Lee County. Florida. Angela DeFranciesco went to her polling place in the morning with her infant son. Seeing a 3hour line. she decided to come back later. After finding a babysitter. she returned in the afternoon. at which point the line had grown to 51/2 hours. Unable to be away from her infant son that long. she left without voting. As President Obama said on election night. \"We have to fix that.\" As we take our places in this Congress that we earned on Election Day. now is the time to fix it. This motion to commit would ensure that no voter has to wait longer than an hour to cast a ballot. We have a long history of struggle over the right to vote in this country. Yet. time and again. we have reaffirmed the principle that every eligible American has an equal right to cast a ballot without facing discrimination. A 3hour wait is discrimination against those who have to work. those who have to take care of their kids and those whose health prevents them from waiting in line for such a long time. Long lines are the 21st century version of poll taxes and literacy tests. disenfranchising the least advantaged and the most vulnerable citizens. We have an obligation to ensure that every American has an equal opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to vote.",

Im not particularly optimistic. but Im always hopefulhopeful that we can return to some semblance of regular order with committees doing their work. bills coming to the floor under an open amendment process. and Members having the opportunity to reflect the will of their constituents. At the very least. I hope that the outrageous. partisan and closed process we saw during the fiscal cliff crisis is not repeated. That is no way to legislate. and its no wonder after that bit of theater that the American people have so little regard for Congress. One of the best ways that we can help the country is to improve the way we conduct our elections because bad elections lead to bad lawmaking. If 2012 taught us anything. its that we desperately need campaign finance reform. If the previous question is defeated on this rule. Democrats will amend the resolution to give the House a vote on a constitutional amendment to control the corrupting influence of money in politics. The Supreme Courts terrible decision in the Citizens United case opened the flood gates. and our election system is now awash in a sea of millions of dollars of unregulated money. drowning out the voices of individual citizens. Politicians are increasingly beholden to wealthy special interests. A multinational oil company that doesnt like a particular Member of Congress can now simply write a big checkundisclosed checkto Americans for Apple Pie and Puppies and watch the negative advertising work their magic. There are a variety of ways to tackle this problem. In the last Congress. I introduced the peoples rights amendment which would overturn Citizens United and put a stop to the corporate personhood nonsense that it represents. Despite what Governor Romney said on the campaign trail. corporations are not people and they do not deserve the same constitutional rights as American citizens. Other Members will have other ideas. But at the very least. we need to have this debate. and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentlewoman for this recognition. and I rise in favor of the motion to commit that I will be offering with Mr. CLYBURN and Mr. LEWIS before the House later today so that we can take a small. but very important. step to protect the right of every American to vote. I was appalled on this past election day by widespread reports across the country of voters forced to wait in hourslong lines simply to exercise one of our most fundamental rightsthe right to vote. Even in some States with early voting. voters were forced to choose between waiting for hours or missing work or taking care of their children in order to cast their vote. or giving up their right to vote altogether. At some precincts in Miami. hundreds of voters stood in line for over 4 hours. past the 7 oclock closing time of the polls. even after President Obama had been declared the winner of the election. It offends our basic values that Americans would be denied the right to vote because of a lastminute illness or change in the work schedule. the need to pick up a child from school. or some other unavoidable emergency. meaning that they could not afford to wait in line for several hours simply to exercise that right. The motion to commit in the House will make two important changes. First. it will require in Federal elections that every State provide for at least 15 days early voting. and. two. it would require the State to provide adequate resources. staff. and machines at polling places in Federal elections to ensure that voters are not forced to wait in line for more than an hour. There are numerous changes that need to be made to adequately protect the rights of all Americans to their right to vote. and I support the comprehensive approach to voter protections that has been developed by Mr. LEWIS and Mr. CLYBURN. However. today we have a chance to take a very simple step to make sure that voting is simple for Americans so they can exercise their right. a right that we broadcast to the rest of the world about how we choose our leaders and how we exercise our democracy. But that right and that democracy is now being thwarted by efforts at the local and State levels to make voting more difficult. to prohibit people from voting. We can change all of that in the motion to commit today in this rules package. and I would urge my colleagues to support that. I want to thank Mr. CLYBURN and Mr. LEWIS for their leadership. Im very sorry that Mr. LEWIS is unable to be here today with the untimely death of his wife. Lillian.",

Section 4 of the resolution continues to authorize the expenditure of taxpayers money to defend. in court. the unconstitutional and discriminatory socalled \"Defense of Marriage Act.\" It goes further to state that this partisan effort \"speaks for and articulates the institutional positions of the House.\" That is simply not true. The original decision to defend DOMA was taken by a partyline vote of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. and all further decisions have been taken by the Republican leadership alone. some in secret. So far. the Republican leadership has authorized the expenditure of $2 million of taxpayers money to defend this discriminatory law. This defense is not supported by the entire House. 145 Members of the House have signed a brief arguing that DOMA should be declared unconstitutional and struck down. So far. every court that decided this question has agreed that DOMA is unconstitutional. We have repeatedly asked the Speaker for a briefing from the lawyers retained by the Republican majority. The Speaker hasnt even seen fit to give us the courtesy of a response. If these highpriced lawyers really represent the House. they should at least have the courtesy to meet with their alleged clients to answer questions about that representation. The time has come to call a halt to this farce.

The rule promoted responsible government by requiring the delegates to take public stands on issues. It also sent a message of inclusion to our constituents. Yet. once again. in a move that is as unnecessary as it is unjust. the new rules will deprive us of this privilege. As Resident Commissioner. I represent 3.7 million U.S. citizens. more than any House member and 44 senators. My fellow delegates represent about one million people. Our constituents are part of the American family. They fightand many have diedin defense of our nation. The rules package demeans their sacrifice. In November. a referendum in Puerto Rico showed a clear majority wants to end the Islands undemocratic status. and that more voters support statehood than any other status option. Todays rules demonstrate why the status quo mustand willend. I look forward to the day when Puerto Rico will have equal representation in the government that makes its national laws. rather than having to plead for the reinstatement of a limited and largely symbolic vote.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition to the Rules Package which once again denies the opportunity for Delegates to Congress and the Resident Commissioner to vote on amendments in the Committee of the Whole. We were privileged to have this right first in the 103rd Congress and then again in the 110th and 111th. Mr. Speaker. the over 4 million citizens in the U.S. territories are among the most patriotic Americans you will find anywhere in our country. They have served and died for their country in every war and conflict since the First World War including the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Much like their fellow citizens on the mainland they are a diverse group of individuals. Some were born in the territories under the American flag. some have migrated there and embraced our culture and our values before naturalization. and others were born in the states and have chosen by virtue of their chosen occupation or by love of our islands to make the territories their home. All are Americans in every sense of the word. except for full representation in the House of Representatives and the ability to vote for the President of the United States. We had hoped and expected that our colleagues in the House would recognize the contributions of their fellow American insular residents and afford their representatives the opportunity to participate more fully in the decisions of the \"peoples House\". unfortunately however the rules package being voted on has once again proven to us that we still have a long way to go to ensure equality and justice for all. It is ironic and sad. that the United States is the leading voice calling for people around the world to have more. not less say in the governance of their countries. while the rules of the House of Representatives disenfranchise the representatives of American citizens living in U.S. Insular Areas and the District of Colombia.

    "speech": "The House has adopted a revision to the rule regarding the admission to the floor and the rooms leading thereto. Clause 4 of rule IV provides that a former Member. Delegate or Resident Commissioner or a former Parliamentarian of the House. or a former elected officer of the House or a former minority employee nominated as an elected officer of the House shall not be entitled to the privilege of admission to the Hall of the House and the rooms extending thereto if he or she is a registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal. has any direct personal pecuniary interest in any legislative measure pending before the House. or reported by a committee. or is in the employ of or represents any party or organization for the purpose of influencing. directly or indirectly. the passage. defeat. or amendment of any legislative proposal. This restriction extends not only to the House floor but adjacent rooms. the cloakrooms and the Speakers lobby. Clause 4 of rule IV also allows the Speaker to exempt ceremonial and educational functions from the restrictions of this clause. These restrictions shall not apply to attendance at joint meetings or joint sessions. Former Members Day proceedings. educational tours. and other occasions as the Speaker may designate. Members who have reason to know that a person is on the floor inconsistent with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the SergeantatArms promptly. 2. Introduction of Bills and Resolutions The policy that the Chair announced on January 3. 1983. with respect to the introduction and reference of bills and resolutions will continue to apply in the 113th Congress. The Chair has advised all officers and employees of the House who are involved in the processing of bills that every bill. resolution. memorial. petition or other material that is placed in the hopper must bear the signature of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is jointly sponsored. the signature must be that of the Member first named thereon. The bill clerk is instructed to return to the Member any bill which appears in the hopper without an original signature. This procedure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It has worked well. and the Chair thinks that it is essential to continue this practice to insure the integrity of the process by which legislation is introduced in the House. 3. UnanimousConsent Requests for the Consideration of Legislation The policy the Chair announced on January 6. 1999. with respect to recognition for unanimousconsent requests for the consideration of certain legislative measures will continue to apply in the 113th Congress. The Speaker will continue to follow the guidelines recorded in section 956 of the House Rules and Manual conferring recognition for unanimousconsent requests for the consideration of bills. resolutions. and other measures only when assured that the majority and minority floor leadership and the relevant committee chairs and ranking minority members have no objection. Consistent with those guidelines and with the Chairs inherent power of recognition under clause 2 of rule XVII. the Chair. and any occupant of the chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore pursuant to clause 8 of rule I. will decline recognition for the unanimous- consent requests chronicled in section 956 without assurances that the request has been so cleared. This denial of recognition by the Chair will not reflect necessarily any personal opposition on the part of the Chair to orderly consideration of the matter in question. but will reflect the determination upon the part of the Chair that orderly procedures will be followed. that is. procedures involving consultation and agreement between floor and committee leadership on both sides of the aisle. 4.

    "speech": "Madam President. it is my pleasure to convene the 113th Congress. I welcome back all my colleagues to a place that we love. the U.S. Senate. But in particular. I would like to welcome Illinois Senator MARK KIRK. He has been away from us for a year recovering from an illness. We are all grateful for his recovery. He has been an inspiration to us. Today. on the east front of the Capitol. to see him walk up those steps said it all. So we are very proud of him and glad he is back with us. I also offer a special welcome to the 13 new Members of the Senate. I am confident that each Senator will treasure their memories in this historic legislative body. and that each will serve their State and our Nation with distinction. All of the Members of this freshman class are accomplished in their own right. I can remember many years ago30 years ago. Madam Presidentbeing a new Member of the House. Speaker ONeill called us in. in small groups. to talk to us. And he said to each of us: All of you are accomplished or you would not be here. You are all politicians. It is not a bad word. And I say that to all our Senatorsthe new Senatorsthat they are all accomplished or they would not be here. and they should all understand that. They should have confidence in moving into this body because they are just as experienced as the rest of us. I trust that serving in the Senate will be the most rewarding experience of their lives. In this Chamber the 113th Congress will face the most significant challenges of our careersnot just the new Members. all of us. To turn those challenges into triumphs. I urge all Senatorsnew and experiencedto draw not only on our varied experience at every level of government and public service. but also on each others experience. regardless of political party. Daniel Webster said: \"We are all agents of the same supreme power. the people.\" Today. as we begin a new Congress. we are afforded the opportunity to reflect upon the successes and failures of past Congresses. It has been said that the 112th Congress was characterized by some of the sharpest political divisions in memory. But during the last Congress. there were also many commendable examples of compromise. The recent effort to avert the fiscal cliff was an example of both the divisions and the collaborations that mark a moment in historyand it was a moment in history. Although the process of resolving some of the fiscal issues facing this country was extremely difficult and protracted. in the end our two parties came together to protect Americas middle class. That is something of which we should all be proud. As we advance the debate over the best way to strengthen our economy and reduce our deficit during this Congress. the 113th. Democrats will continue to stand strong for the principle of balance. I am hopeful and confident my Republican colleagues will do the same. Any future budget agreements must balance the need for thoughtful spending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among us and closing wasteful tax loopholes. The 112th Congress. unfortunately. showed that we had some political differences. and these differences prevented us from accomplishing as much as we had hoped during the Congress that was just completed. But we also passed very important legislation. such as the transportation jobs bill. This was important because it kept 2 million people working. and we began the restoration. with that legislation. of our crumbling infrastructure. We made strides to reduce the Nations deficit and prevented a tax increase for 98 percent of American families and 97 percent of small businesses. I guess I should have started. Madam President. by telling everyone that the marks that people see on my facethat has nothing to do with the fiscal cliff or the disagreements that Speaker BOEHNER and I had. It is from being very pale and living in the desert most of my life. We were able to accomplish. as I indicated. many things to reduce the deficit and prevent a tax increase for American families and small businesses. We reformed our patent system for the first time in six decades. gave small business owners access to the capital they need to compete. and reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration. keeping 300.000 workers employed. Not a single piece of that legislation became law without the votes of both Democrats and Republicans. All those legislative initiatives I just talked about were bipartisan. Unfortunately. many other worthy measures that passed the Senate with strong. bipartisan support then languished. awaiting action by the House of Representatives. In the 113th Congress. it will be incumbent upon the House Republican leadership to allow bipartisan bills passed by the Senate to come to a vote before the full House of Representativesnot before the Republican Members only but before Democrats and Republicans. all 435 Members of the House. Too many good pieces of legislation died over the last 2 years because House Republican leaders insisted on passing legislation with a majority of the majority. that is. only Republicans. Democrats were ignored most of the time. For example. postal reform. the Violence Against Women Act. the farm bill. and relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy all passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis after extensive deliberation and debate. Yet the House failed to act on all four of these measures. and there were others. As Speaker BOEHNER saw on New Years Day. when he allows every Member of the House to vote and not only Republican Members of the House to vote. Congress can enact bills into law. No legislation can pass the Senate without both Democrats and Republicans. During the 113th Congress. the Speaker should strive to make that the rule of the House of Representatives as well. Still. it is true that the 112th Congress left much undone. That is why we resolve to pick up where we left off in just a few weeks. The first crucial matter we will address will be the longoverdue aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy. I am hopeful that the House will act. as they said. on the 15th. Then when we get back here. we will move on it very quickly. We need to strive to be more productive. and we will do little if we dont address a major reason for our inefficiency. Simply. the Senate is not working as it should. That is why in the last Congress I made plain that Democrats would do something to fix those issues. The beginning of a new Congress is customarily a time that the Senate addresses changes to its rules. In the last Congress. Democratic Senators JEFF",

    "speech": "Madam President. I would like to welcome everybody back after what we all realized was a somewhat abbreviated recess. In fact. I believe you would have to go back to 1970 to find the last time the Senate was in session and voting between Christmas and New Years. In particular. I want to welcome back Senator MARK KIRK. He has made a brilliant recovery since suffering a debilitating stroke almost a year ago. The fact that MARK is here today says a lot about his tenacity. his dedication. and his commitment to the people of Illinois. I am told that about twothirds of the patients in the facility where he has been recovering over the past year dont return to work. but true to form MARK opted for an experimental rehabilitation program so grueling. it has been compared to military boot camp. His staff counted 45 steps from the parking lot to the front door of the Senate. and during his treatment he made walking those steps his goal. Today he did it. He did it. So we admire him for his spirit. and we applaud his achievement. It is wonderful to have him back and ready to work. I would also like to welcome the new Members who take their oaths of office today. particularly the four new Members of the Republican conference: Senator FLAKE of Arizona. Senator FISCHER of Nebraska. Senator CRuz of Texas. and Senator SCOTT of South Carolina. Congratulations to you all. We welcome the energy and intelligence each of you brings to the challenges we face and especially to the transcendent challenge of our time: a Federal debt so huge. so huge it threatens to permanently alter an economy that has provided generations of Americans the opportunity to fulfill their dreams of a better life. Four straight years of trilliondollar deficits and projected spending that no realistic amount of tax revenue could cover have put us at a crossroads. Either we tackle our Nations spending problem or it is going to tackle us. It is that simple. and there is no better time to do the work we need to do than right now. The bipartisan agreement we reached earlier this week was imperfect. I am the first to admit itespecially the process. But aside from shielding 99 percent of my constituents and many of yours from the painful effects of a middleclass tax hikethe President seemed all too willing. by the way. to impose thatit gave us something else: It settled the revenue debate for good. The revenue debate is over. President Obama declared the other night that those he calls rich are now paying their \"fair share.\" so it is time to move on. The President got his revenue. and now it is time to turn squarely to the real problem. which we all know is spending. We all knew that the tax hikes the President campaigned on were never going to solve the problem. Now that he has gotten them. he has a responsibility to put his preoccupation with taxes behind him and to work with us to actually solve the problem at hand. It is time to face up to the fact that our Nation is in grave fiscal dangergrave fiscal dangerand that it has everything to do with spending. This is a debate the American people want us to have. The President liked to point out on the campaign trail that most Americans supported the idea of taxing the rich. What he conveniently left out is that even more Americans support the idea of cutting spending. One recent survey I saw said that about threefourths of all Americans say they want to see major spending cuts in Washington. When you look at some of the things Washington has been wasting their dollars on. it is no wonder. I mean. if we cant stop spending taxpayer dollars on robosquirrels. dancing robot DJs. or hot air balloon rides for Smokey the Bear. then there is no hope at all because if we cant fix the easy stuff. the robosquirrels and the robot DJs. the things most of us agree on. how are we ever going to get at the hard stuff? That is why the first step in this debate is for Democrats to get over their fanatical commitment to guarding every single dime the government ever got its hands on. This has to stop. The best time to stop it is now. There is actually no better time for this debate. In a couple of months the President will ask us to raise the Nations debt limit. We cannot agree to increase that borrowing limit without agreeing to reforms that lower the avalanche of spending that is creating this debt in the first place. It is not fair to the American people. and it is not fair to our children. whom we are asking to foot the bill. The health of our economy requires it. so now is the time to get serious about spending. If the past few weeks have taught us anything at all. it means the President needs to show up early this time. The American people will not tolerate the kinds of lastminute crises that we have seen again and again over the last 4 years as a result of this Presidents chronic inactivity and refusal to lead on the pressing issues of our time. We dont need speeches. we need action. and we need it now. We need courage because the only way we are going to address the spending that is at the root of our Nations fiscal problems is if the President is willing to bring the members of his party to the table and get them to rise above the partisan voices on the left. who treat every single penny of government spending as sacred. Hopefully. that kind of cooperation will be forthcoming but. if not. we will have several opportunities in the coming months to force the conversation Washington needs to have. The first such opportunity. as I have said. surrounds the Presidents upcoming request of us to raise the debt ceiling. After that. there is the continuing resolution. But let me be clear. there is no need for dramano need for dramaand we dont want any. The President knows as well as I do what needs to be done. He can either engage now to significantly cut government spending or force a crisis later. It is his call. But for the sake of the country we must have this debate now. So today I call on my friend the majority leader and the rest of my Democratic colleagues to start working with us right nownot 1 hour. 1 day. or 1 week before we hit the debt limit but ahead of time for once so we can pass a bipartisan solution on spending that everyone will have an opportunity to weigh in on in early February. We need a plan that can pass the House and actually begin to get Washington spending under control. If we are serious. we will get one done. With taxes now off the table. the only way to achieve a balanced plan is to focus on the spending side of the equation. particularly. as the President pointed out. health care entitlement programs because. as I said. taxes simply cant go high enough to keep pace with the amount of money we have projected to spend on them without crushing our economy. The best way to reform these programs is to make them work better. The debt isnt exploding because these programs exist. it is exploding because they are inefficient. They were created in a different erathe era of blackandwhite TV. They should be updated for the age of the iPad. and we should want to fix them not just because we want to lower the debt but because we want to strengthen and improve these programs themselves. Over the next few months it will be up to the President and his party to work with us to deliver the same kind of bipartisan resolution on spending that we have now achieved on taxes. but it needs to happen before the eleventh hour. For that to happen. the President needs to show up this time. The President claims to want a balanced approach. Now that he has the tax rates he wants. his calls for \"balance\" means he needs to join us in the effort to achieve meaningful spending reform. The President may not want to have this debate. but it is the one he is going to have because the country needs it. Republicans are ready to tackle the spending problem. and we start today.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I know he is working diligently and we have some very positive things happening. Madam President. as we begin the 113th Congress. I have submitted on behalf of myself and Senators MERKLEY and HARKIN a resolution to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate. Our proposal to reform the rules is simple. it is limited. and it is fair. Again. we are not ending the filibuster. We preserve the rights of the minority. We are only proposing the following: No. 1. an end to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead. Senators would be required to go to the floor and actually tell the American people why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a filibuster. No. 2. debate on motions to proceed to a bill. or to send a bill to conference. would be limited to two hours. and No. 3. postcloture debate on a nomineeother than a justice to the Supreme Courtwould be limited to 2 hours. rather than the current limit of 30 hours. These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live with if we are in the minority. And yet. we are warned that these simple reforms will transform the very character of the Senate. Will leave the minority without a voice. These arguments are covers for continued abuse of the rules. The reforms are modest. Some would say too modest. But they would discourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the right to filibuster. but not the right to do so by simply making an announcement and then going out to dinner or. more likely. to a fundraiser. Let me just say again: Senators MERKLEY. HARKIN. and I are not talking about taking away the rights of the minority. We are not abolishing the right to debate or to filibuster. But there must be change. The unprecedented use. and abuse. of the filibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate from doing its job. We are no longer \"the worlds greatest deliberative body.\" In fact. we barely deliberate at all. For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly. But. in recent years. what was rare has become routine. The exception has become the norm. Everything is filibusteredevery procedural step of the waywith paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the process. not send it into a deep freeze. Since the Democratic majority came into the upper chamber in 2007. the Senates of the 110th. 111th. and current 112th Congress have witnessed the three highest totals of filibusters ever recorded. A recent report found the current Senate has passed a recordlow 2.8 percent of bills introduced. That is a 66 percent decrease from the last Republican majority in 20052006. and a 90 percent decrease from the high in 1955I have listened with great interest to the arguments against rules reform by the other side. Each day. my Republican colleagues have come to the floor and made very impassioned statements in opposition to amending our rules at the beginning of the new Congress. They say that the rules can only be changed with a twothirds supermajority. as the current filibuster rule requires. And they have repeatedly said any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" This simply is not true. The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article I Section 5 of the Constitution states that. \"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. punish its Members for disorderly Behavior. and. with the Concurrence of two thirds. expel a Member.\" When the Framers required a supermajority. they explicitly stated so. as they did for expelling a member. On all other matters. such as determining the Chambers rules. a majority requirement is clearly implied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents. sitting as President of the Senate. on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it applies to the Senate. In 1957. Vice President Nixon ruled definitively: [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another. the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules. stemming as it does from the Constitution itself. cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is. in the opinion of the Chair. unconstitutional. VicePresidents Rockefeller and Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses. I have heard many of my Republican colleagues quote Senator Robert Byrds last statement to the Senate Rules Committee. I was at that hearing. and have great respect for Senator Byrd and know that he was one of the great Senate historians and deeply loved this institution. But we should also consider Senator Byrds other statements. as well as steps he took as Majority Leader to reform this body. In 1979. when others were arguing that the rules could only be amended in accordance with the previous Senates rules. Majority Leader Byrd said the following on the floor: There is no higher law. insofar as our Government is concerned. than the Constitution. The Senate rules are subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution in Article I. Section 5. says that each House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past. In addition to the clear language of the Constitution. there is also a longstanding common law principle. upheld in the Supreme Court. that one legislature cannot bind its successors. For example. if the Senate passed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in the future. that would violate this principle and be unconstitutional. Similarly. the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules that a majority of the Senate in the future cannot amend or repeal. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For example. in 2003 Senator JOHN CORNYN wrote in a law review article: Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote. one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power. after all. would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another. So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" It is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules. and that when there is a conflict between them. we follow the Constitution. I find some of the rhetoric about amending our rules particularly troubling. We have heard comments that any such reforms. if done by a majority. would \"destroy the Senate.\" Again. I can turn to my Republican colleagues to answer this accusation. In 2005. the Republican Policy Committee released a memo entitled \"The Constitutional Option: The Senates Power to Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote.\" Not only does the memo support all of the same arguments I make today in support of reform by a majority. but it also refutes many of the recent claims about how the Senate will be permanently damaged. In a section of the memo titled. \"Common Misunderstandings of the Constitutional Option.\" it responds to the misunderstanding that \"the essential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the constitutional option is exercised\" with the following: When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and precedents. those illustrative exercises of the option did little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed. many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger today in a body that still allows for extensive debate. full consideration. and careful deliberation of all matters with which it is presented. What is more important about the Republican memo is the reason they believed a change to the rules by a majority was justified. Back then it was about the filibuster of judicial nomineesand what Republicans saw as a break in longstanding Senate tradition. They claimed they werent using the constitutional option as a power grab. but as a means of restoring the Senate to its historical norm. The memo states the following: The Senate is a relatively stable institution. but its norms of conduct have sometimes been violated. In some instances. a minority of Senators has rejected past practices and bipartisan understandings and exploited heretofore \"off limits\" opportunities to obstruct the Senates business. At other times. a minority of Senators has abused the rules and precedents in a manner that violates Senators reasonable expectations of proper procedural parameters. These are efforts to change Senate norms and practices. but they do not necessarily have the support of a majority. Such situations create institutional conundrums: what should be done when a mere minority of Senators changes accepted institutional norms? One option is to acquiesce and allow \"rule by the minority\" so that the minoritys norm becomes the Senates new norm. But another option has been for the majority of Senators to deny the legitimacy of the minority Senators effort to shift the norms of the entire body. And to do that. it has been necessary for the majority to act independently to restore the previous Senate norms of conduct. This is exactly where we find ourselves today. Back then. the Republicans argued the constitutional option should be used because 10 of President Bushs judicial nominees were threatened with a filibuster. I believe the departure from Senate tradition we see today is far worse. Since Democrats became the majority party in the Senate in 2007. we have faced the highest number of opposition filibusters ever recorded. Lyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate Majority Leader. In the same span of time HARRY REID has faced over 385. So. as the Republicans argued in 2005. \"[a]n exercise of the constitutional option under the current circumstances would be an act of restoration.\" We must return the Senate to a time when every procedural step was not filibustered. But if my Republican colleagues really believe using the constitutional option would be so harmful to the Senate. there is an alternative. We dont have to reform the rules with only a majority vote. That is up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Each time the filibuster rule has been amended in the past. a bipartisan group of senators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with the inevitability of a majority vote on the reforms looming. enough Members agreed on a compromise and they passed the changes with twothirds in favor. We could do that again this month. I know many of my Republican colleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. I said 2 years ago that I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next Congressregardless of which party was in the majority. At the time. many people believed the Democrats would lose their majority. So let me be clear. If Leader MCCONNELL had become the new majority leader today. on the first day of the 113th Congress. I would ask him to work with me on implementing these same reforms. I will say again. The proposed changes will reform the abuse of the filibuster. not trample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I am willing to live with all of the changes we are proposing. whether I am in the majority or minority. The other side has suggested that a change in the rules is an affront to the American public. But the real affront would be to allow the abuse of the filibuster to continue. We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is time for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and the things that matter to American families. That was the message we were sent in the election. and we would do well to listen to it. Under the abuse of the current rules. all it takes to filibuster is one senator picking up the phone. Period. It doesnt even require going on the floor to defend it. Just a phone call by one senator. No muss. no fuss. no inconvenience. Except for the American public. Except for a nation that expects and needs a government that worksa government that actually works together and finds common ground. Some of my colleagues may believe the Senate is working as it should. that everything is fine. Well. Madam President. we do not take that view. It isnt working. It needs to change. The American people. of all political persuasions. are clamoring for a government that actually gets something done. The challenges are too great. the stakes are too high. for a government of gridlock to continue.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. next week in Casper. a member of Americas greatest generation will be recognized by the Casper Area Chamber of Commerce for a lifetime of service and leadership. I am honored to tell my colleagues about my friend. R. Stanley Lowe. In 1943. Stan was in college and had been deferred from the draft because of his studies. But. at age 19. he wanted to do his part to protect our great Nation. He enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine. He served on five ships in the Pacific and Atlantic. each voyage lasting several months. Stan became a staff officer. in charge of personnel and payroll. He was also a chaplain and medical officer. called a pharmacists mate and purser. Stan served from 1943 to 1946. seeing things that would have a life long impact on him. The Merchant Marine had the highest rate of casualties of any service. dying at a rate of 1 in 26. and Stan was there to help the injured and comfort the dying. Following his service. he returned to Wyoming to complete his law degree and then practice law in Rawlins. It was there he met the love of his life. Anne \"Pat\" Kirtland Selden Lowe. while they were skiing. She was remarkable. too. Pat was among the first female geologistsand a scholarship in her name continues to support students pursuing degrees in geology at the University of Wyoming. Wyoming has benefited immensely from Stans career. He served in the State House of Representatives and was elected to be the county and prosecuting attorney for Carbon County. He spent the majority of his distinguished career as general counsel for True Oil. In 1985. Stan led a delegation of American lawyers on a goodwill tour to China. The legal profession benefited from his wisdom through his service as counsel for the American Judicature Society. While practicing law. he never forgot about his service and his fellow veterans. Stan was appointed to the Wyoming Veterans Affairs Commission by Governor Mike Sullivan in 1991 and upon his retirement he was named chair emeritus. In 2003. Stan was awarded the Civilian Meritorious Service Medal. Stan has led the efforts to expand Wyomings only Veterans Cemetery. His passion for history paved the ground for the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum. Stan served in supportive and leadership roles in multiple veterans organizations. Stan is a 3 year district commander of the American Legion. He was recently honored with the title of Honorary Past Department Commander. a title only given four other times in the history of the Wyoming American Legion. Stan continues to highlight veterans events and issues through his weekly article in the Casper Journal and attends almost every troop homecoming and veterans event. Wyomings veterans have benefitted immensely from Stan Lowes wisdom and leadership. Stan will turn 90 this year. Wyoming continues to look to Stan as the voice for veterans. My wife. Bobbi. and I are happy to have Stan as our friend. and veterans all over Wyoming are fortunate because Stan chose to serve.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the \"Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2013.\" permits a bankruptcy judge to reduce the principal amount of an underwater mortgage to the fair market value of the home. which will encourage homeowners to make their mortgage payments and help stop the endless cycle of foreclosures which further depresses home values. It also authorizes the mortgages repayment period to be extended so that monthly mortgage payments are more affordable. In addition. the bill permits exorbitant mortgage interest rates to be reduced to a level that will keep the mortgage affordable over the longterm. And. it authorizes the waiver of prepayment penalties and excessive fees. Further. the bill would allow hidden fees and unauthorized costs to be eliminated. This bill addresses the fundamental problem with every privatelysponsored and government program that has previously been developed to deal with the home foreclosure crisis. Unlike every other government program. this legislation empowers a homeowner to force the lender to modify the terms of the mortgage by allowing the principal amount of the mortgage to be reduced to the homes fair market value. which numerous economists and housing experts agree is the most effective way to respond to the foreclosure crisis. And. unlike every other government program. the implementation of this measure will not cost taxpayers a single penny. This legislation is identical to H.R. 1587. which was introduced in the 112th Congress. and contains similar provisions included in H.R. 1106. which the House passed nearly three years ago. Unfortunately. those provisions were taken out in the Senate and not included in the final version of the bill that was subsequently enacted into law.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. a bill that would implement the findings of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. Since being elected to the House of Representatives ten years ago. I have introduced a version of this legislation in each Congress. Over the last several Congresses. H.R. 44 passed the House on five separate occasions. This bill would implement the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. which was appointed by Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and established by an Act of the 107th Congress (Public Law 107333). The Review Commission. in a unanimous report to Congress in June 2004. found that there were significant disparities in the treatment of war claims for the people of Guam as compared with war claims for other Americans. The Review Commission also found that the occupation of Guam was especially brutal due to the unfailing loyalty of the people of Guam to the United States of America. The people of Guam were subjected to forced labor. forced marches. internment. beatings. rapes and executions. including public beheadings. The Review Commission recommended that Congress remedy this injustice through the enactment of legislation to authorize payment of claims in amounts specified. Specifically. the bill would authorize discretionary spending to pay claims consistent with the recommendations of the commission. It is important to note that the Review Commission found that the United States Government seized Japanese assets during the war and that the record shows that settlement of claims was meant to be paid from these forfeitures. Furthermore. the United States signed a Treaty of Peace with Japan on September 8. 1951. which precludes Americans from making claims against Japan for war reparations. The treaty closed any legal mechanism for seeking redress from the Government of Japan. and the United States Government has settled claims for U.S. citizens and other nationals through various claims programs authorized by Congress. The text that I introduce in this Congress addresses concerns that have been raised about the legislation. First. the text reflects a compromise that was reached with the Senate when they considered the legislation as a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. That compromise removes payment of claims to heirs of survivors who suffered personal injury during the enemy occupation. The bill continues to provide payment of claims to survivors of the occupation as well as to heirs of citizens of Guam who died during the occupation. The compromise continues to uphold the intent of recognizing the people of Guam for their loyalty to the United States during World War II. Further. the bill that I introduce today contains an offset for the estimated cost of the bill. I understood the concerns express by some of my colleagues in a July 14. 2011 hearing on this legislation. My colleagues expressed concern that there was no offset to pay for the cost of the bill. Guam war claims has a very simple offset that will pay for the cost of the legislation over time. The bill would be paid by section 30 funding remitted to Guam through the U.S. Department of Interior at any level above section 30 funds that were remitted to Guam in fiscal year 2012. With the impending relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam as well as additional Navy and Air Force personnel relocating to Guam it is expected that Guam will receive additional section 30 funds. Claims would then be paid out over time based off the additional amounts that were made available in any given year. Not only does this offset address payment of claims but it only impacts my jurisdiction and is a credible source of funding that will ensure that claims will be paid. Congressional passage of this bill has a direct impact on the future success of the military buildup. The need for Guam War Claims was brought about because of mishandling of war claims immediately following World War II by the Department of the Navy. The longstanding inequity with how Guam was treated for war reparations lingers today. If we do not bring this matter to a close I believe that support for the military buildup will erode and impact the readiness of our forces and the bilateral relationship with Japan. Mr. Speaker. resolving this issue is a matter of justice. This carefully crafted compromise legislation addresses the concerns of the Senate and fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives. This bill represents a unique opportunity to right a wrong because many of the survivors of the occupation are nearing the end of their lives. It is important that the Congress act on the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission to finally resolve this longstanding injustice for the people of Guam.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Joes Stone Crab on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. Established in 1913 by Hungarianborn Joseph \"Joe\" Weiss. Joes Stone Crab has since gone from being a small lunch counter in a quiet. backwater town to a beloved institution in the Miami Beach community. The story of Joes Stone Crab is truly an American one. Joe and his wife Jennie were both Hungarian immigrants living in New York when their son Jesse was born in 1907. At the time. Joe was a waiter and Jennie cooked in small restaurants. Suffering from asthma. Joes doctors told him that a change of climate was the only remedy. According to Jesse. his father borrowed fifty dollars on his life insurance policy and left his family in New York to try his luck in Florida. After one night in Miami. Joe took the ferry boat to Miami Beach. where he was able to breathe. He stayed there and started running a lunch stand at Smiths bathing casino in 1913. serving topnotch fish sandwiches and fries. That was the beginning of the restaurant that would later grow to become Joes. Joe sent for his wife and son to join him in Florida. In 1918. Joe and Jennie bought a bungalow near the casino on Biscayne Street. They moved into the back. set up seven or eight tables on the front porch. and called it Joes Restaurant. Jennie waited on tables. Joe cooked. and everything grew from there. For about eight years. Joes was the only restaurant on the beach. serving snapper. pompano. mackerel. and meat dishes all day long. Joes Restaurant was a hit. but stone crabs were still yet to come. At the time. no one knew that the local crustacean was even edible. In 1921. James Allison. Fishers partner in the Speedway. built an aquarium at the foot of the bay and Fifth Street. He invited a Harvard ichthyologist down to do research. who gave Joe the idea to serve stone crab. After much thought. Joe threw the stone crabs into boiling water and the rest was history. They served them cracked with hash brown potatoes. coleslaw. and mayonnaise. and they became an instant success. Although his parents started Joes. Jesse Weiss became its face and brought in the VIPs. from movie stars to journalists to politicians. athletes. and gangsters. He knew everyone. and everyone who came into Joes wanted to see him. At the age of 75. Miami anchorwoman Ann Bishop spent many hours recording his memories. particularly the love and support of his family in keeping Joes Stone Crab going through the years. Anyone who is anyone. from anywhere in the world. would stop in at Joes if they were in Miami Beach. Notable guests include Al Capone. Will Rogers. Amelia Earhart. the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Gloria Swanson and Joseph Kennedy. J. Edgar Hoover. Walter Winchell. and Damon Runyon. Mr. Speaker. Joes Stone Crab is a monument to the people who built it and those who continue its legacy: Joe and Jennie Weiss. their son Jesse. granddaughter Jo Ann. and the entire Joes family. I have frequented Joes on numerous occasions and always enjoyed a marvelous meal. Please join me in congratulating the entire Joes Stone Crab family on this momentous occasion. I wish them another 100 years of success and. of course. great food and company.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I introduced the Rehab and Ahmed Amer Foster Care Improvement Act of 2013. which is substantively identical to a bill I introduced in the 112th Congress. It will enhance the existing federal policy of encouraging state foster care programs to place children in the care of willing and able relatives. This legislation accomplishes that goal by requiring States that receive federal funding for foster care programs to add certain procedural enhancements to their foster care programs so as to ensure a more fair placement decisionmaking process. Specifically. my bill requires that. within 90 days after a State makes a foster care placement decision. the State must provide notice of such decision to the following affected parties: the childs parents. relatives who have informed the State of their interest in caring for the child. the guardian. the guardian ad litem of the child. the attorney for the child. the attorney for each parent of the child. the prosecutor involved. and the child if he or she is able to express an opinion regarding placement. Additionally. States must establish procedures that: allow any of the parties who receive notice of the States placement decision to request. within five days after receipt of the notice. documentation of the reasons for the States decision. allow the childs attorney to petition the court involved to review the decision. and require the court to commence such review within seven days after receipt of the petition and conduct such review on the record. The harrowing story of Rehab and Ahmed Amer of Dearborn. Michigan prompted me to craft this bill. In 1985. the Amers lost two of their children to Michigans foster care system after Rehab had been subject to criminal charges related to the death of her twoyearold son Samier. who died because of head injuries resulting from a fall in a bathtub. Although Rehab had been acquitted in August 1986 of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Samiers death. the State refused to return the Amers other two children to them and. in fact. removed a third child from the Amers custody four months after Rehabs acquittal. As a temporary alternative. Rehabs brother petitioned to be a foster parent to the Amers three children. but was denied his petition even though he had previously served as a foster parent for other children. It is important to note that the Amers are Muslim. Nevertheless. the State. rather than placing the Amers children with a foster family of the same faith and cultural background. sent them to live with an evangelical Christian family. which renamed the Amers childrenMohamed Ali. Sueheir. and Zinabewith Christian names and raised them as Christians. Today. only the oldest of the Amers three living children. Mohamed Ali. now known as Adam. communicates with them. In reaction to the Amers story. Michigan enacted what became known as the Amer Law. That law requires foster care placement agencies in Michigan to consider and give special preference for relatives when making a foster care placement decision. The Amer Law is consistent with federal foster care policy. which also seeks to give preference to a childs relatives and. for Native American children. a family of the same cultural background as the child. when making placement decisions. The Amer Law. however. has several provisions that go beyond current federal law to ensure due process. In sum. this law gives parents. relatives. guardians. and the child in certain cases additional procedural rights. including the right to written notice and an explanation of a placement decision. In addition. it authorizes judicial review of a placement decision by a foster care agency. My legislation simply adds these enhanced due process features of the Amer Law to existing federal foster care law. The best interests of the child should always be the overriding consideration when making foster care placement decisions. That standard should also require foster care agencies to give special preference to placing a child with relatives. where the child can be raised in the same culture or religion as his or her own. all other things being equal. I thank Rehab and Ahmed Amer for bringing this issue to light and for their tireless efforts to make the foster care placement process fairer for everyone. first in Michigan. and. now. nationally.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to reintroduce legislation that will amend the United States Constitution to force Congress to rein in spending by balancing the federal budget. We have a spending addiction in Washington. D.C.. and it has proven to be an addiction that Congress cannot control on its own and which is bringing dire consequences. We have gone in a few short years from a deficit of billions of dollars to a deficit of trillions of dollars. We are printing money at an unprecedented pace. which presents serious risks of massive inflation. Our national debt recently surpassed an astonishing $16 trillion and continues to rapidly increase. along with the waste associated with paying the interest on that debt. Our first Secretary of State. Thomas Jefferson. warned of the consequences of outofcontrol debt when he wrote: \"To preserve [the] independence [of the people.] we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty. or profusion and servitude.\" Unfortunately. it increasingly appears that Congress has chosen the latter path. Our current Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton. issued a similar warning when she recently declared: \"I think that our rising debt levels [sic] poses a national security threat. and it poses a national security threat in two ways. It undermines our capacity to act in our own interest. and it does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable. And it also sends a message of weakness internationally.\" Despite these warnings. Congress has refused to address this crisis. Congress spending addiction is not a partisan one. It reaches across the aisle and afflicts both parties. which is why neither party has been able to master it. We need outside help. We need pressure from outside Congress to force Congress to rein in this outofcontrol behavior. We need a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. That is why I am introducing this legislationa commonsense. 3part balanced budget Constitutional amendment which garnered the support of 133 bipartisan cosponsors last Congress. This bill would (1) amend the Constitution to require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. (2) require that bills to raise revenues pass each House of Congress by a 3/5 majority. and (3) establish an annual spending cap such that total federal spending could not exceed 1/5 of the economic output of the United States. The bill would also require a 3/5 majority vote for any increases in the debt limit. The legislation provides an exception in times of war and during military conflicts that pose imminent and serious military threats to national security. Our federal government must be lean. efficient and responsible with the dollars that our nations citizens worked so hard to earn. We must work to both eliminate every cent of waste and squeeze every cent of value out of each dollar our citizens entrust to us. Families all across our nation understand what it means to make tough decisions each day about what they can and cannot afford and government officials should be required to exercise similar restraint when spending the hardearned dollars of our nations citizens. By amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget. establish measurable spending limits. and make it harder to raise taxes. we can force the Congress to control spending. paving the way for a return to surpluses and ultimately paying down the national debt. rather than allow big spenders to lead us further down the road of chronic deficits and in doing so leave our children and grandchildren saddled with debt that is not their own. 49 out of 50 states have a balanced budget requirement. and it is time that the federal government had one too. Our nation faces many difficult decisions in the coming years. and Congress will face great pressure to spend beyond its means rather than to make the difficult decisions about spending priorities. Unless Congress is forced to make the decisions necessary to create a balanced budget. it will always have the alltootempting option of shirking this responsibility. A Constitutional balanced budget requirement. combined with the spending and tax limitations in this legislation. will set our nations fiscal policies on the right path. This is a common sense approach to ensure that Congress is bound by the same fiscal principles that guide Americas families each day. I urge support of this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout our Nations history. hardworking American men and women have labored to make our businesses become the most productive and dynamic in the world. Unfortunately. when some of these businesses encounter financial difficulties and seek to reorganize their debts under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. these very same workers and retirees are often asked to make major sacrifices through lost job protections. lower wages. and the elimination of hardwon pension and health benefits. while the executives and managers of these business are not required to make comparable sacrifices. Particularly now. as our economy continues to struggle and more businesses falter. we must do more to ensure that Americas most important resourceworkers and retireesare treated more fairly when these businesses seek to reorganize their financial affairs under the protection of our bankruptcy laws. The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2013 accomplishes this goal by amending the Bankruptcy Code in several respects. First. it improves recoveries for employees and retirees by: (1) increasing the amount of worker claims entitled to priority payment for unpaid wages and contributions to employee benefit plans up to $20.000. (2) eliminating the difficult to prove restriction in current law that wage and benefit claims must be earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing in order to be entitled to priority payment. (3) allowing employees to assert claims for losses in certain defined contribution plans when such losses result from employer fraud or breach of fiduciary duty. (4) establishing a new priority administrative expense for workers severance pay. and (5) clarifying that back pay awards for WARN Act damages are entitled to the same priority as back pay for other legal violations. Second. the legislation reduces employees and retirees losses by: (1) restricting the conditions under which collective bargaining agreements and commitments to fund retiree pensions and health benefits may be eliminated or adversely affected. (2) preventing companies from singling out nonmanagement retirees for concessions. (3) requiring a court to consider the impact a bidders offer to purchase a companys assets would have on maintaining existing jobs and preserving retiree pension and health benefits. and (4) clarifying that the principal purpose of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the preservation ofjobs to the maximum extent possible. Third. the bill restricts excessive executive compensation programs by: (1) requiring full disclosure and court approval of executive compensation packages. (2) restricting the payment of bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation to senior officers and others. and (3) ensuring that insiders cannot receive retiree benefits if workers have lost their retirement or health benefits. This legislation is identical to H.R. 6117. which was introduced in the prior Congress. It is supported by the AFLCIO and many of its largest affiliates. and the United Steelworkers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I reintroduced a bill to amend and reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. Conservation of coral reef ecosystems is essential to protect public health. promote environmental sustainability. and ensure longterm economic progress for the jurisdictions we represent in Congress. The sovereign waters of the United States off the coast of Guam. and in the Pacific region as a whole. contain a majority of the shallowwater coral reefs in the United States. as well as some of the worlds greatest coral reef biodiversity. These reefs. and reefs around the world. provide habitat and shelter for fisheries. provide food and recreation for our residents. and are the basis for marine tourism industries. Coral reefs also provide important mitigation from extreme weather events. including hurricanes and typhoons. by absorbing up to 90% of wave energy. mitigating some of the most costly aspects of severe storms. Coastal storms account for 71% of annual disaster losses. Healthy reef systems may protect an estimated $47.000 of property value for every meter of reef during severe weather events. Today. however. various pressures on the worlds reefs threaten to destroy them and the numerous ecosystem services. valued at over $8 billion. which they provide. These threats have led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to propose that 54 species be listed as threatened and 12 species be listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Unless the United States acts in conjunction with the global community to support focused. prolonged action on coral reef education. research. and management. the condition of our coral reefs will continue to degrade. Since its enactment in 2000. the Coral Reef Conservation Act has stimulated a greater commitment to protect. conserve. and restore coral reef resources within jurisdictional waters of the United States. As a result. we now have a much better grasp of the condition of our coral reefs. and more focused management capability than at any time in our history. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization and Enhancement Amendments of 2013 expands emergency response mechanisms. establishes a new communitybased planning grants program. promotes international cooperation. and recognizes the important contributions of the U.S. Department of the Interior in coral reef management and conservation efforts. The bill does not authorize any new funding. This bill would also codify the United States Coral Reef Task Force established in 1998 by President Clinton through Executive Order 13089. The work of the Task Force and its mission to coordinate the efforts of the United States in promoting conservation and the sustainable use of coral reefs internationally is vital to our interests. Since 1998. the Task Force has acted to facilitate and support better management and conservation of coral reef resources at the local level. Many beneficial efforts. such as the development and implementation of local action strategies to address threats to our reefs. are underway thanks to the work of the Task Force and its member agencies. I would like to thank Reps. PIERLUISI. FARR. CHRISTENSEN. and WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for joining me as original cosponsors and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation to enhance our capacity for the conservation and restoration of healthy and diverse coral reef ecosystems.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am pleased to introduce the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2013. This bill would level the playing field between health care professionals and insurance companies in the health care industry and improve the quality of patient care. The Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2013 would eliminate the antitrust immunity provided under the McCarranFerguson Act for price fixing. bid rigging. and market allocation by health insurance issuers or medical malpractice insurers. The bill would also repeal the McCarranFerguson exemption for the business of health insurance and enable enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. The purpose of this bill is to extend antitrust enforcement over health insurers and medical malpractice insurance issuers. which currently enjoy broad antitrust immunity under the McCarranFerguson Act. This immunity can serve as a shield for activities that might otherwise violate federal law. This bill will end the mistake Congress made in 1945 when it added an antitrust exemption for insurance companies into the McCarranFerguson Act. The blanket antitrust exemption created by the 1945 bill has shielded health insurance companies from legal accountability for decades. Our nations antitrust laws exist to protect freemarket competition and this bill will restore competition to the health insurance marketplace. The House Judiciary Committee held extensive hearings on the effects of the insurance industrys antitrust exemption throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. It became clear that the exemption was not needed to enable the insurance industry to provide any service to their policyholders. and that policyholders and the economy in general would benefit from increased competition among insurance providers. I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it would prohibit price fixing. bid rigging. and market allocation. pernicious practices that are detrimental to competition and result in fewer options and higher prices for consumers. The bill I introduce today is intended to root out unlawful activity in an industry that has grown complacent by decades of protection from antitrust oversight. In doing so. we aim to make health insurance more affordable to more Americans.",
