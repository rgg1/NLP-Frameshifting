I rise to officially recognize the valiant effort of the Los Angeles Lakers. L3 2310 Yes. I realize that the Detroit Pistons swept the Lakers in four straight games to the shock of many of us. however it is very important to note that Magic Johnson and Byron Scott. arguably one of the most. noted backcourts in the National Basketball Association. were not suited LIp for most of the series. but enough for excuses. Mr. Speaker. The Pistons are a fine basketball team. My colleague. the gentleman from Michigan will now enjoy the fruits of the Pistons labor as this morning In his office I presented him with two Sun World California seedless watermelons. That came abi.ut as a result of our wager. California is famous for many things. and now notably for our seedless watermelons. Mr. Speaker. this is also a fitting time for us to pay tribute to Kareem Abdul Jabbar who is retiring. Clearly. as most everyone will agree. he is the National Basketball Associations greatest player ever. We in Los Angeles will sorely miss his talents. and we wish him all the best. Enough thought. They did not win their third consecutive championship. however. Mr. Speaker. I doubt that anyone can dispute the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers were most clearly the leading NBA team of this entire decade.",

I take great pleasure in rising today to pay tribute to Lafayette High School. located in the Gravesend section of my district. which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. I am proud of the exemplary service that it has given to the high school students of Gravesend for so many years. Lafayette has played a very important role in the community since it began functioning in 1939. Whether supporting the war effort during the 1940s. delighting the neighborhood with a spring carnival in the 1950s. or rallying fans around the schools exceptional athletic teams during the 1960s. 1970s. and 1980s. Lafayette has been a model educational institution and community center since its founding. Through time. the school has flourished under the loving attention of devoted principals and faculty. and has grown to accommodate .changes in the population and ethnic character of the surrounding community. Everyone connected with Lafayette believes that the school is not only an academic community. but a social one as well. and as a result. extracurricular activities have thrived. The first student elections were held in 1940. and ever since. succeeding principals have encouraged and have recognized the importance of programs sponsored by the student organization. The Lafayette community has long held the philosophy that public service goes handinhand with learning and has established a tradition of involvement that will continue to benefit Gravesend residents for years to come. Through many years of growth and enrichment. the school has continued to add to the strength of the area and has enabled Gravesend to grow into one of the most prosperous neighborhoods in Brooklyn. While Lafayettes presence is felt most strongly in the neighborhoods surrounding it. the school has had even more widespread impact. Indeed. graduates of Lafayetteexcelling in areas as diverse as entertainment. medicine. engineering. and professional baseballhave not only made major contributions to Brooklyns greatness. but to New York Citys. New York States. and the United States as well. On the celebration of this milestone. I am proud to honor Lafayette High School as among the finest institutions of learning and community activity in my district.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in recent years. there has been growing concern about various problems associated with corporate mergers and acquisitions and the concurrent growth in corporate debt. While some mergers have been good for the companies and their employees. others have resulted in the loss of jobs and the devastation of entire communities. Pension funds have often been used to help finance these corporate restructurings. In a number of cases. corporate raiders have terminated pension plans and used socalled excess pension assets to help finance the takeover. In other cases. the assets of ongoing pension plans have been invested in junk bonds and other financial instruments which are used to underwrite the corporate takeovers. Pension plans represent deferred compensation. In effect. workers forego higher wages and benefits in exchange for future retirement income. These benefits are actually earned by employees over their working careers and. in a very real sense. the moneys which are contributed to a pension plan represent another form of compensation to which workers are entitled. It is only fair that employees should have a voice in the management of their pension funds. Therefore. I have introduced legislation. the Employee Pension Rights Act. that calls for employee representation on the boards that oversee singleemployer pension funds. The number of employee representatives would be equal to the number of management representatives on the board. Although labor unions theoretically have the right to negotiate for worker representatives on singleemployer pension plans. in practice this has not been feasible. Employers which sponsor these plans have guarded their \"management prerogative\" to name the pension plan trustees. Unlike the multiemployer setting. where control over the plan is already diffused among a number of employers. in the singleemployer setting companies have not been willing to allow workers to have a voice in the management of their pension funds. The notion of workers being represented on the board of trustees of a pension plan is not unprecedented. Workers have long had representatives on the boards of trustees of multiemployer pension plans. Section 302 of the LaborManagement Relations Act specifically provides for equal unionmanagement representation on multiemployer plans. There is no reason why this same principle should not be extended to singleemployer pension plans.",

One of those expelled is Alan W. Pessin. the bureau chief of the Voice of America. the international broadcasting service of the U.S. Government. Mr. Pessin has been covering China since 1984 and. according to the Chinese. engaged in \"illegal newsgathering.\" It should not be news when a totalitarian government expels an American journalist for doing his job. Totalitarian governments. like June 1.5. 1989 that of Communist China. have no conception of a free press. But in one sense the expulsion of Mr. Pessin is good news. By that I mean that it reminds us of the importance of the Voice of America. In an age of hightech gadgetry. of television by satellite. of fax machines and glasnost. the Voice of America may have seemed to some to be oldfashioned. a \"relic of the Cold War\" as some have said. To the contrarythe Voice of America remains. as it has been since World War II. a voice of freedom. of solid. factual news. of opinion that is labeled opinion and of clear. authoritative. official U.S. policy. The jazz programs of Voice of Americas Willis Conover have introduced millions in Europe and Asia to the best of American culture and. in doing so. have opened a window through which freedom of artistic expression could be glimpsed by those long denied such freedom. If the expulsion of Mr. Pessin reminds us of the importance of the Voice of America. perhaps it was worth the price. We in the United States. who are used to freedom of information. and who take it for granted. forget how important a free flow of information can be to those who lack freedom. I just want to congratulate the Voice of America. its director Richard Carlson and the entire staff. An organization whose representative is expelled for telling the truth to those denied freedom deserves the support and the applause of the American people. I hope our colleagues recognize the importance of this great American institution and that we provide the funding and support its needs.

I happen to feel there are all kinds of special interests. I am not one who argues that a special interest is only defined by the fact that It happens to form a group such as a PAC. Clearly an individual can come to somebody. that individual could be a contributor. and that individual could be considered. If you are being honest about your definitions. a special interest. The question. as I deal with the issue of special interest. is one of perception. I think that is at the root of everything we are trying to deal with here In terms of reform. I do not believe. as the Senator from Delaware said. that Senators here have a direct correlation between the vote and the contribution. But the perception is that they do. The perception is worse where there Is a larger sum of money and where there is a specifically defined interest rather than the more general interest that we generally attribute to individuals. So I know where the Senator is going. but I Just do not subscribe that that is the real problem. I think it is more of a question of appearances. and we have to deal with the problem of appearances because that is where the question of integrity is most at issue.",

All I am suggesting is that having been willing to do it for 15 years in a way that did not work very effectively. here we have an opportunity to give the American people a chance to decide for themselves whether they want to take advantage of not a $50 deduction or $100 credit. but a $3 or $6. or whatever the Ways and Means Committee and the Finance Committee on which the Senator serves were to decide was the appropriate tax checkoff amount.

I suspect there is going to be far more participation as a result of the limit of the influence of money. and we may get back to the real grassroots politics as a consequence of that. Mr. President. I would quickly point out on my time. in answer to the comment of the Senator from Kentucky. that the record Just does not bear out his comment that there is not fulltime fundraising going on. In the 1988 Senatorial cycle. Senator WILSON raised in 1983 to 1984 $8.857 a week. in 1985 to 1986. $23.000 a week. and in 1987 to 1988 $113.000 a week. It never stopped. Senator MOYNIHAN. a Democrat. $1.400 a week the first 2 years. $13.000 the next 2 years. and $43.000 the next 2 years. Senator DURENBERGER. almost $8.000 a week the first 2 years. $10.500 the second 2 years. $49.000 the third. There is not one Senator in the U.S. Senate who was not raising money every week. on an average of every week. throughout the yearI think the record is very clear on thatranging from the $10.000 in the outyears. to $60.000. $70.000. and over $100.000 a week in the inyears. That is precisely what we are trying to get rid of. It is on both sides of the aisle. There is no partisanship in that. But the reality is there is always fundraising.",

From his early days in the Florida Legislature. to his tenure in the Senate to his final days in the House of Representatives. Claude Pepper never stopped caringnever stopped believing that he could make a difference in the lives of his fellow Americans. He was a man of humanity. a caring and loving individual who saw injustice and tried to right it. who saw a downtrodden person and tried to uplift them. Pepper was a \"noexcuses\" New Deal Democrat who stood for the very essence of democratic values in much the same way as the other statesmen he emulated. Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Claude Pepper had the courage to fight the difficult battles for the difficult causes that other less noble individuals might have shied away from. He was an ardent advocate for the elderly. instilling in them a sense of selfworth and political activism as he strove to ensure that even as they aged. their rights and liberties were protected. Claude Peppers nonstop energy and half century of public service was rooted in a uniquely human concern. a deeply felt belief in the causes and in the people. He was a truly unique individual with a depth of compassion and understanding. We have been enriched by his presence and by his deeds. We will miss Senator Pepper. but we will be better for having known him. The legacy he leaves behind is what must drive us in the future. We honor him and remember him best by continuing to strive for the ideals and the causes that he pursued throughout his life. We must always remember. as Claude Pepper did. that we can make a difference in the lives of other poeple. that we can effect positive social change. that we can make this world a better. more humane place to live.",

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that any future improvement of diplomatic relations with Ethiopia should be continued upon Ethiopias willingness to allow free emigration for its Jewish minority. There have been reports recently that Ethiopia seeks and welcomes improved relations with the United States. This resolution will put Ethiopia on notice that Congress will be watching to see that it upholds its commitment to free emigration. Ethiopia voluntarily accepted this commitment when it became a signatory to the U.N.s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Mengistu regime has never renounced Ethiopias adherence to the declaration. The approximately 15.000 Ethiopian Jews who are still in Ethiopia are in desperate straits. They suffer from political oppression. poverty. malnutrition. and lack of opportunity. Most of those who remain are divided from their families in Israel. Parents left in Ethiopia have been cut off from their children. Children have been divided from their parents now living in Israel. This is simply intolerable. By comparison. the upward of 10.000 Ethiopian Jews who were able to flee Ethiopia to Israel earlier this decade with the help of the United States have found the freedom from discrimination. the educational and professional opportunities. and the economic advantages so sorely lacking in the land of their birth. In Israel. they were welcomed in a generous outpouring of national support rivaling that given to any other refugee group in any country in the world. Mr. President. as Senate cochairs of the Congressional Caucus on Ethiopian Jewry. Senator CRANSTON and I have spearheaded congressional measures calling on the Ethiopian Government to recognize the right of family reunification. Senator WILSON has always been active on behalf of Ethiopian Jewry. Despite our efforts. the struggle still goes on. I believe that Congress must continue to lend its support. and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure.e",

I will be conducting a series of town meetings throughout Alaska on the effects of the Exxon Valdez oilspill. While I regret having to be absent from the Senate and having to miss votes on the supplemental appropriations bill. I believe it Is more important for me to be in my home State during this week. Since March 24. 1989. when the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound. the citizens of Alaska have been struggling to make sense out of this catastrophe. They have asked themselves and each other innumerable questions: How could such an accident happen? Why was the initial response to the spill so inadequate? How could the oil industry and the Government be so unprepared to deal with a disaster of this magnitude? Why are the cleanup efforts so disorganized and apparently ineffective? But the most important question all Alaskans have been asking is: How can we ensure that such a catastrophe does not happen again? Mr. President. I do not mean to imply that people who do not live in Alaska have not asked themselves the same questions. They have and will continue to do so. But I believe that the citizens of Alaska. because they are the people most directly affected by this disaster. have pondered these issues more than most. Mr. President. the asking of all these questions has not been a futile effort. To the contrary. Alaskans are reaching conclusions and are providing answers to those questions. And. that is why I arranged the town meetings in Cordova. Valdez. Homer. Soldotna. Anchorage. Fairbanks. Palmer. Seward. and Kodiak. I wanted to hear firsthand what Alaskans are thinking about these questions and about the oilspill in general. I wanted to understand what they are feeling and what they think we in Congress ought to be doing to respond to the oilspill. Most importantly. Mr. President. I wanted to know what Alaskans think the Congress should do to ensure that such an oilspill does not happen again.

Look at our unhealthy addiction to foreign oil. up from our dangerous dependence in 1979. This situation forces us to focus on our national security. and forge new partnerships with nations whose longrange interests can be quite different from ours. We are reviewing our competitive position in the world. our increasing electricity demands and environmental concernsincluding threat of oilspills and pending clean air legislation. The crisis in the gulf highlights the need to incorporate all these concerns into a national energy strategy. Seventeen years after the 1973 oil shock. we still find ourselves facing all too familiar and unfortunate developments in the energy marketplace as a result of our Nations overdependence on imported oilsharply rising prices. disruption of our economy. and the possibility of an oil supply interruption. The vulnerability of the United States to interruptions in oil imports increases the need to promote the development of domestic energy alternatives to foreign oil. It is readily apparent. that an addition to conservation and more efficient use of our energy. we must increase our reliance on secure domestic sources of energy. One such alternative is nuclear energy. Nuclear power in America has proven itself as a clean. reliable source of energy and must be included in the future energy mix of this country.

Yesterday. the same day that the House Energy and Commerce Committee favorably reported H.R. 5693. a bill to reauthorize title X of the Public Service Act. the Senate effectively refused to consider reauthorization of our national family planning program. It is a source of shame that. for the fifth consecutive year. Congress cannot find the courage to support this critical. costeffective health program. Budget constraints provide no excuse. Title X services save taxpayers at least $4.50 for every program dollar spent. The modest funding increase sought would not even have returned program funding to its 1979 level. Each year in 4.500 title X clinics across the country. nearly 5 million women are provided with contraceptive services and with treatment or referral for anemia. hypertension. cervical and breast cancer. sexually transmitted diseases. kidney dysfunction. diabetes. and infertility.

The U.S. Attorney General estimates that between 25 and 30 percent of the S&L failures ere due to criminal activity by thrift officers. I am introducing SLAMRA. the Savings and Loan Accountability and Management Reform Actlegislation to give the Secret Service authority to investigate fraud committed by savings and loans operators and other criminals in the financial services industry. It amends title 18 of the United States Code. section The Secret Service will commit 100 agents immediately upon passage of this legislation. with an additional 200 to follow. It requires no further expendituresit merely reallocates our manpower resources to the areas of greatest importance. We should arrest and punish those responsible for the failure and subsequent Government bailout of the S&L industry. now estimated to cost in the hundreds of billions of dollars or $2.000 for each person in this country. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is overloaded with cases and backlogged. According to a March 1990 FBI survey. there were 2.327 fraud and embezzlement cases which had not been addressed due to lack ol personnel. Of these. about 1.300 cases Involved at least $100.000. Additionally. the agency has received at least 20.000 referrals involving fraud. SLAMRA would increase our manpower on S&L crimes by 50 percent The FBI currently has 600 agents working on fraud cases. The Secret Service has a historical link with financial institutions. Although most visible in its role of protecting the President and Vice President. the agency was originally created as a bureau within the Department of the Treasury to suppress the counterfeiting of U.S. monetary instruments. Since then. Congress has expanded its jurisdiction to include offenses relating to Government obligations and securities. credit/debit card fraud. computer fraud. false identification. and electronic funds transfers. SLAMRA is a companion legislation to S. 2721. which Senator LIEBERMAN introduced in the Senate on June 8. We need to start clamping down on these criminals and put them in the SLAMR. before the statute of limitations runs out. I hope you will join me in cosponsoring this needed legis. lation.",

The report says so far as the Congress Is concerned. and the President has signed the legislation. that the V22 ought to be maintained If the study by the Institute for Defense Analysis supports it. Now are you saying that the Department of Defense will abide by the results of the Institute of Defense Analysis?",

When you make available a lot fewer resources. which is the situation we faced a year ago and the situation even more than we are facing today. then of course you should drop off those which are the least critical. Senator SPECTER. Well. Mr. Secretary. the decision on resources is a relative thing. and the Congress has a view. We have made our decision. Again.

This aid. intended to protect an elected government and vulnerable democratic institutions from a Communist insurrection. has instead become part of the problem. We have become part of the problem. Instead of fostering a process of political reconciliation. we have created an environment in which the Salvadoran Armed Forces can abuse human rights with impunity. while claiming to seek an elusive. impossible. military victory over the FMLN. Instead of strengthening democratic institutions. promoting judicial and agrarian reform. we have empowered the military at the expense of the civilian government. We have given the \"tandona\". 12 military commanders. the tools to subvert the very democracy which we seek to support. The November murders of six Jesuit priests. their cook. and her daughter at the University of Central America reflect grievous and deeply rooted problems with the Salvadoran military and judicial system. As the Moakley task force on El Salvador reported. this investigation represents the Salvadoran justice system at its very best. Yet. the investigation has ground to a standstill. crucial evidence has been lost. and all those now charged with a crime might not have been arrested had an American military officer not provided incriminating testimony. The horror of the Jesuit murders. of Archbishop Romeros brutal assassination. and countless other human rights abuses is compounded by the criminal negligence. the utter impotence. of the Salvadoran justice system. To continue ignoring this misconduct is to condone it. as we have done in the past with unconditional military assistance. The provisions contained in the MoakleyMurtha substitute offer strong incentives for both sides of the conflict to negotiate in good faith. and to discontinue patterns of violence which victimize the innocent. This is timely and appropriate action. and I strongly urge your support.",

Eunice Shriver is Special Olympics. just as she is the spirit and substance of almost every program for people with mental retardation that has been developed over the past 30 years. In 1968. Eunice Shriver founded Special Olympics. She had faith that people with mental retardation could do many more things than even many experts thought they could. And she was right. Since that first track meet in 1968. millions of persons with mental retardation have taken part in sports activities through Special Olympics. And as they have become skilled in sports they have also learned the living skills that have made them valuable citizens at school. at home. in the community. and in the workplace. No single program has had as dramatic and lasting effects as Special Olympics. More than just another sports league. Special Olympics has become a worldwide movement for justice and equality for persons with mental retardation. And behind this movement. for 22 years. has been the energy and dedication of Eunice Kennedy Shriver. While we know that Special Olympics will grow and touch many more lives. it just will not be the same without Eunice Shriver. Whatever else she goes on to do now. she has left a legacy of human service that is unequalled in our generation.",

While her official role may change. her influence and guidance will. I am sure. continue to be an integral part of the Special Olympics. Mr. Speaker. the timing of this special order is very appropriate. For earlier today. I joined with an overwhelming majority of my House colleagues in adopting the Americans With Disabilities Act. which seeks to prohibit discrimination against disabled individuals. However. long before the ADA bill was on the drawing board. Eunice Shriver was already showing the Nationand the worldthat individuals with mental retardation have the desire. the ability. and the right to participate in sports training and athletic competitions. One of the unique and admirable aspects of the Special Olympics programs during Mrs. Shrivers tenure has been the fact that she has almost never solicited Federal funding for this program. She did not want it to be part of a huge bureaucracy but to rise and fall on its own merits and its own ability to attract private funds. And rise it has. Today. Special Olympics International raises more than $70 million from the private sector in every State and many Foreign countries. including China. Chile. the Soviet Union. Cuba. and the Netherlands. to support its yearround training and competitions. Almost 1 million athletes train and compete in 22 Olympictype sports and 500.000 volunteers assume most of the coaching. training and fundraising responsibilities. For my own part. I have. over the years. participated in the Nike Capital Challenge which raises money for the Special Olympics program. and I am proud that my Alma Mater. the University of Notre Dame. has been the site of the International Special Olympics. Again. I commend and thank Eunice Shriver for her leadership during these 22 years. and no doubt. the support and participation in Special Olympics will continue to grow in the years ahead.",

In that year. the First International Summer Special Olympic Games were held at Chicagos Soldier Field for 1.000 athletes from the United States. Canada. and France. Since then. the Special Olympics has had worldwide impact with some 750.000 athletes and 550.000 volunteers participating in yearround activities. As dean of the New York congressional delegation. I am especially proud to honor these dedicated athletes. In my State of New York. the Special Olympics has grown from 100 Special Olympians in 1969. to the largest program of sports and athletics competition for children and adults with mental retardation in the United States. The New York Special Olympics serves nearly 28.000 Special Olympians in 38 regions of New York State through a network of more than 15.000 volunteers. I am deeply touched by the courage. determination. sportsmanship. and voluntarism that are displayed during these yearround events.

If it had not been for Eunice Kennedy Shriver. millions of children and adults all over the world would never have known the joy of competitive athletics. and the health that comes from regular. vigorous sports activity. Before Special Olympics. only 25 percent of this Nations citizens with mental retardation received as much as 1 hour of physical activity per week. Most got none at all. They had never run a race. thrown a baseball. skated on a rink. skied a slope. swum or dived in a pool. Special Olympics changed all that because one courageous woman was convinced that people with mental retardation could do much more than many experts said they could. Because of Special Olympics. the public has a better understanding of the gifts and qualities of persons with mental retardation. parents of special children have a new sense of pride. and the athletes have developed a heightened selfesteem and confidence In their own ability.

Mrs. Shrivers vision. her compassion. and her determination have left us with a program for mentally retarded persons that is unique in its aspirations and in its success. The International Special Olympics today provides a forum for the athletic achievement of close to 1 million youngsters internationally. It is a source of pride and inspiration not only for the athletes involved but also for our country and the world. Small wonder that cities vie for the opportunity to host the culminating events. which attract worldwide attention. This remarkable program arose out of Mrs. Shrivers lifelong commitment to improving the lot of the mentally retarded. and her ability to find the means to do so. Beginning in 1963. she sought to encourage revolutionary research into the development of resources for the retarded with funds from the Joseph P. Kennedy. Jr.. Foundation. She also provided the impetus for various national projects such as the Presidents Panel on Mental Retardation and the Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act of 1963. which supplied Federal funds to help the Nations retarded persons for the first time. Finally. she founded and developed the Special Olympics. a celebration of the talents and abilities of mentally retarded athletes and. again. an astonishing success. Today. Eunice Shrivers dream of international athletic events involving mentally retarded athletes seems as natural as the original Olympics. Her vision has become an independent and enduring reality. We are all fortunate for this turn of events.

Madisons amendment. which was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights. is still very much alive todayin fact. 25 States have not ratified it. On January 3.

The recommended increase for Members of Congress from $89.500 to $135.000 can only be called excessive in the face of the budget deficit this Congress was elected to deal with.

If they think they deserve one. why not vote on it? I have had a hard time answering why Congress does not want to be held accountable for its actions to the very people who put them in office. The response to our actions. or rather inacion. up to this time. emphasizes the need to act now to reform our system. We must make changes which allow us to be straightforward with our constituents. The rules of the House must be changed to require a separate. recorded vote on any proposal. whether it is legislative in nature or a recommendation from the executive branch. which would change the salary for Congress. Also. such changes in salary. if approved. should not take effect until the beginning of the next Congress. Changes in the Presidents income are by law prospective. Why should Congress be any different? We were sent here to represent the people in our districts. For their trust in our ability to make the choices on the tough issues. we owe them this vote. I just hope it hasnt come to late to restore that trust.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to the proposed 50 percent pay raise for top Government officials. The recommendations of the Presidents Commission on Executive. Legislative. and Judicial Salaries would raise the salary of Federal judges and Members of Congress to $135.000. and would raise the salaries of Cabinet members to $155.000. In an era of huge budget deficits and the resulting pressure to cut Federal spending. a 50percent pay raise is at best illtimed and most certainly sends the wrong signal to the American public that top elected and appointed officials are not willing to share the burden of deficit reduction. My constituents in the Fifth Congressional District of Alabama. like Americans all across the country. have sent a very genuine and very strong message of disapproval of the pay Commissions proposals. They have also expressed an overwhelming desire that the Congress. by recorded vote. approve any pay increases for top Government officials just as we do for other employees of the Federal Government and for beneficiaries of Federal programs. It is a basic question of Congress accountability to the people who elect us and I wholeheartedly agree that we should vote on any pay increase. As a cosponsor of H.R. 533. a bill that would abolish the Federal Pay Commission. require a recorded vote on any future pay increases. and delay the implementation of any pay raise for Members of Congress to the next term. I believe the current system is flawed and should be changed permanently. What we have seen over the past few days and months is the kind of grassroots democracy that our forefathers envisioned in setting up a House of Representatives. elected every 2 years. that would be more sensitive to the wishes of the people. The people have spokenloud and clearand their voices have been heard.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Id like to echo the opposition heard today to the proposed pay raise. Hundreds of calls and letters have flooded my office objecting to the pay raise and the same has occurred at offices all over Capitol Hill. Like many of my constituents. I object to the size of the raise at a time when our Nation is facing the most serious budget deficit in history. The public is demanding a public vote on this subject and thats exactly what we should do. Raises of this sort need to be approached in the same manner as other Government expenditures. Other Federal workers. State workers. and Social Security recipients receive a costofliving adjustment [COLA] every year to cover the rise in inflation. In past years. Congress exempted itself from the COLAs. which led to the Quadrenniel Commissions recommendation of a large. lumpsum increase. Senators and Representatives should be treated as any other civil servant. with their salaries rising with the inflation rate. If any raise is to be considered above that. it should be tied to legislative achievements. such as reducing the Federal deficit. The salaries for judges. however. need to be addressed immediately. Our inaction in this area has caused a crisis in the judicial branch. Between 1958 and 1973 only 6 Federal judges resigned from the bench. From 1974 to the present that number rose to 57. Its clear that people with decades of expedience as judges are not going to accept the salary of entrylevel lawyer. This is a legitimate public policy concern that should be addressed by Congress. Congress needs to reform the Federal pay system to prevent more dedicated judges and civil servants from fleeing to the private sector.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. let me say to my colleagues that the Quadrennial Commission report recommendation is before us. The item that we will be voting on today would turn down that recommendation of increase in pay for high levels of the administration. for Judges. and for Members of Congress. So much ink has been spilled and so many hands have been selfrighteously wrung over this topic in recent weeks that it is time to complete this cynical exercise. Since the founding of this great Republic. Washington has tied itself in knots every few years trying to evade the inevitable conflicts of interest in setting Federal salaries. In this circumstance we are dealing with the Quadrennial Commission report that suggested a certain level of pay. At the same time that report suggested that we consider eliminating honoraria or outside income. I think it is important for the public to understand that the proposal would have done 2 things: Establish this level of pay. but. beyond that. take approximately half of that level of that pay away by eliminating outside special interest income. In recent years I personally have become very concerned and uneasy with the honoraria process. and it is time for us to address that matter. But we are not going to reduce Members pay as a result. It is very important that Members recognize that if. in the future. we are to attract the kind of quality personnel we need in the House to meet the major challenges we face. indeed we must pay at a level that will attract the best that is available for public service. In this instance I am afraid we are walking away from that responsibility. It is very clear that the vote today will be overwhelming to reject the Commissions report. It is the result of a public furor that may not completely understand the needs and demands of the House. Mr. Speaker. today the House is responding to the voice of the people and the public it serves. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

For thousands who seek care at military treatment facilities. long waiting periods have become the norm. For others. care simply is not available. Military families have been required with increasing frequency to obtain their medical care under the Champus program. which means they pay a part of the cost from their modest family incomes. This. I remind you. is for a benefit promised to them without charge when they enlisted. Many problems in the military health care system arewith the help of Congressnow moving toward a solution. User fees are not a part of that solution. They will only hamper morale. recruitment. and retention in our military services. Mr. Speaker. Americas military families know a duck when they see one.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman. the people I represent in Oregon are tired of Justice only working for the criminal. I think that lawabiding citizens and victims of crime need to be protected. Our current system of justice puts criminals rights ahead of citizens and victims rights. One criminal right is. of course. the socalled exclusionary rule which often disqualifies perfectly good evidence simply because a policeman acts slightly improperly in the heat of an arrest. No one wants unconstitutional and unreasonable searches and seizures. but we must put the reasonable back in our legal system. In my opinion. the provisions in the bill do not do nearly enough to restore reasonableness in the collection of evidence. In fact. they may jeopardize the narrow exceptions we already have. This amendment does put reason back in the Constitutions fourth amendment protections. The exclusionary rule needs fixing for several reasons. but mostly because the rule now punishes the police officer and lets the criminal go free to endanger lawabiding citizens. In effect. It puts blinders on judges and juries and asks them to determine guilt or innocence without the benefit of seeing all the relevant evidence. The Douglas amendment allows evidence collected in good faith to be acceptable in a trial. It gives the police officer who carries out a search the benefit of the doubt rather than making him responsible for the technical conformity of a warrant. This amendment removes the blinders so that evidence collected in good faith can be used to put the criminal behind bars. The guilty criminal should not go free simply because a police officer made an honest mistake or is himself the victim of one not of his own doing. Mr. Chairman. a vote for the Douglas amendment is a vote for reasonableness in law enforcement and a vote for putting lawabiding citizens rights ahead of criminals rights.",

This is one of the most important amendemnts that will be offered to this crime bill. and one of the most important votes that Members will make with regard to law enforcement in the time they serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. We need to vote to pass this exception to the exclusionary rule if we are going to let our law enforcement people be able to get into evidence what they seize in these drug bust cases whre they do not have a search warrant. but they do not violate anyones constitutional rights intentionally. but someone comes along with a technicality later and throws out the evidence. There are hundreds of cases thrown out every year on the basis of the socalled exclusionary rule. All the Douglas amendment does is codify what is already in court -law with regard to searches with warrants. and says with warrantless searches. police officers evidence will be treated the same way if they have acted in good faith. It uses exactly the court language with this. Mr. Chairman. if we do not do that and leave the bill the way it Is. we will actually change the law in a lot of jurisdictions on this issue and allow less evidence in. Mr. Chairman. if Members want more convictions. if Members want to support their local police. if Members want to get tough with law enforcement. vote for the Douglas amendment on search and seizures.",

Weve all seen the statistics. There is one murder in this country every 24 minutes. one robbery every minute. one burglary every 10 seconds. one aggravated assault every onehalf minute. and the list goes on. According to one poll. 84 percent of Americans believe that crime is getting worse. At least 4 in 10 Americans are afraid to walk alone in their neighborhoods after dark. Americans are sick and tired of criminals on our streets and in our courts. They use our justice system as if its a oneway avenueback to the streetback to crime. Police officers tell me that if we could make one reform. it should be correcting the exclusionary rule. I agree. People are most assuredly sick and tired of being victimized by criminals. But they are totally fed up with watching as the few criminals who are caught walk awayfree on a technicalIty. The criminal is guilty. no question there. but he goes free on a legal hitch. I am pleased to stand here today and support the efforts of Mr. DOUGLAs and Mr. SMITH. Their amendent would provide a limited exception for cases in which police had a reasonable. good faith -belief that evidence was seized lawfully.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr. DouGLAS]. This amendment would codify the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in cases of warrantless searches. Under this exception. the exclusionary rule could not be used to suppress evidence at trial If it was seized without a warrant by a law enforcement officer who. although mistaken. was acting with the objectively reasonable and goodfaith belief that his actions were legal. There is considerable merit in establishing such an exception to the exclusionary rule. I cannot support the amendment. however. for the following reasons. First. although reasonable on its face. I am concerned about the potential that such an exception would have for abuse. it is an invitation to mischief that might result in an erosion of fourth amendment rights. Both the excluslonary rule itself. and the goodfaith exception. are judicially created doctrines. Over the years the courts have successfully eliminated some of the excesses of the exclusionary rule by developing a series of exceptions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has adopted the goodfaith exception in warrantless search cases. I would prefer to allow this natural evolution of the rule and its exceptions to continue before .any further legislative action is taken. At the very least I want more information about the experience In the fifth circuit before I vote to extend the scope of the exclusion as proposed. Second. the exclusionary rule has been an extremely controversial issue within the law enforcement community for decades and remains so today. The bill before us already contains a number of similarly controversial issues. Inclusion of this amendment. in my view. would threaten the. chances of this important anticrime package achieving final enactment into law. We are carrying enough of a load. Finally. I have consistently supported the provisions in the bill codifying three other exceptions to the exclusionary rule: Goodfaith reliance on search warrants. inevitable discovery and independent source. I believe that these provisions serve to ensure that the exclusionary rule is not applied in clearly inappropriate circumstances.",

In these times of limited resources. it is not only appropriate. it is necessary. for us to examine every proposed expenditure. But in making that examination. we cannot lose sight of the ideals that made our Nation what it is today. Without question. the principles of racial equality and nonviolent social change that Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. taught us have become a part of the fabric of our national character. Just as it is important for our Nation to set aside time to reflect on Dr. Kings life. it is also important to make sure that future generations of Americans. and people throughout the world. are aware of the importance of his principles and his teachings to our country. Since 1986. the Martin Luther King. Jr. Federal Holiday Commission has helped this Nations youth learn the importance of Dr. Kings teachings: of achievement at school. of service to others. and of living in harmony and justice in a global community. The Commission has taken that message to over 140 nations around the world as well. giving us hope that Dr. Kings vision of peace and justice throughout the world will one day be realized. Mr. President. I hope my colleagues will join with me In recognizing the value of the Commissions work to our national character. and will vote to pass S. 431.",

The 1986 repeal of the capital gains differential has created a host of new problemsproblems that threaten the competitiveness of the American economy. The elimination of a capital gains differential has created a formidable barrier for longterm investors. It has resulted in a climate that is both economically and psychologically damaging. At a time when world markets are becoming ever more competitive. America can ill afford this. The repeal of the capital gains differential has eroded the Nations investment base and has reduced confidence in the longterm profitability of the American market. Additionally. treating capital gains as ordinary income results in unfair taxation for the individual investor. Without a capital gains differential. taxes are determined by an investments inflationary increases. not its actual increase in value. The unfairness of this present situation must be rectified. Mr. President. with these considerations and arguments in mind. I am reintroducing legislation that will reduce the effective tax rate on capital gains to its pre1986 Tax Reform Act level. The bill will reestablish a capital gains differential of 25 percent and thus ensure that no taxpayer pays more than a top effective rate of 21 percent on capital gains income.

I have introduced today the National Voter Registration Act of 1989. which is identical to H.R. 15 which was introduced earlier this Congress in the House of Representatives by Mr. SwIFT. A hearing on this bill will be held by the Committee on Rules and Administration this Wednesday. May Last Congress the Committee on Rules and Administration held two hearings on voter registration and voter turnout in elections. The 1988 election. with its very low voter turnout. demonstrated once again that something must be done to increase the number of voters in our elections. The testimony and information received by the committee made It clear that while changes in registration procedures do not necessarily result in increased voter turnout. they have effectively increased the pool of citizens who are eligible to vote. I believe that this bill will provide our States with the means to increase their voter rolls without undue additional costs by using existing State and Federal agencies. Its provision that would tiein driver license applications and renewals with voter registration alone presents an opportunity to reach some 90 percent of the voting age population. It is a workable and costefficient approach to the problem of low registration and voter turnout. Mr. Presidc it. I think it is important that any law nacted in this area not intrude unnecessarily on the election administration functions of our States. nor significantly Increase their costs of conducting elections.

Mr. President. we cannot overemphasize the gravity of this situation for the future of US participation in WHO. and for other UN agencies which may find themselves in a similar situation.

Stark who lost their lives in the line of duty when their ship was mistakenly attacked by Iraqi aircraft in the Persian Gulf. The Government of Iraq agreed to expeditiously pay a total of $27.350.374. When the U.S. Government receives the money. It will be distributed to the 37 families on the basis of the formula used to calculate the original claims. which properly takes into account the individual needs and circumstances of the families. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the outstanding U.S. negotiating team which successfully concluded this agreement. This negotiating team deserves special commendation for their fine work. The team was lead by the State Department Legal Adviser. Abraham D. Sofaer. and consisted of Capt. John Geer of the Department of the Navy. the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. April Glaspie. and a group of State Department personnel. I met the Judge Sofaer prior to his trip to Bagdhad last month. He briefed me on the background of the claims and on his objectives for this latest round of discussions. I lent my full support to this effort. and I am delighted to see that it was successful. It is a credit to Judge Sofaer. Captain Geer. Ambassador Glaspie and the rest of the U.S. team that they were able to conclude such a favorable agreement in a relatively short. 5day period. In my opinion. the settlement is a good and fair one. It will provide compensation to the wives. children. and parents of those 37 fine young men. Although money can never adequately compensate for the loss of life. it can provide the financial support that the dependents need and to which they are entitled. However. this agreement settles only the first of three categories of U.S. claims arising out of the attack on the U.S.S. Stark. It is my understanding that the United States Government will soon present claims to Iraq on behalf of the crewmen injured in the attack. as well as for damages to the ship and other United States Government losses. I hope the Government of Iraq will continue to show its interest in improving relations with the United States by cooperatively addressing the remaining claims.9",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Railway Mail Service. a branch of the Post Office Department. was established on August 28. 1864. by George Armstrong. assistant postmaster at Chicago. Prior to its official founding. the roots of the Railway Mail Service can be traced back to Missouri. It was in St. Joseph. MO. in 1862 that William A. Davis. the assistant postmaster. first experimented with using the railroad system to transport mail. Train service in the United States began in 1830 and by 1869. parallel bands of steel carried the iron horse from coast to coast. making it ideal for transporting the mail for the Post Office Department. The C.B.&Q. Railroad was honored with the experimental cargo of mail. transporting it from West Quincy. MO. to St. Joseph. MO. Going beyond mere transportation. the postal service began utilizing railroad cars as mobile post offices. They became so successful that shortly thereafter railroads all over the country began to receive post office cars from the U.S. Post Office. In some large cities. even street cars were used as traveling post offices. The Railway Mail Service officially changed its name to the Postal Transportation Service in November 1949. when Airmail and the Railway Mail Service were merged. At its peak. immediately following World War II. the Postal Transportation Service employed over 30.000 clerks who handled more than 90 percent of all nonlocal mail. There were Railway Post Offices [RPO] aboard more than 1.900 routes across the Nation. With the increase in air service. however. the Postal Transportation Service began to cut back on train utilization. The final run of any RPO was from New York City to Washington. DC. in 1977. Trains played a vital part in shaping our Nation and the postal services use of them allowed those who moved west to keep in touch with their friends and family in faroff towns and cities. The dutiful RPOs carried the everimportant news of marriages. births and deaths. and war and peace. I hope that my fellow Senators will join me in commemorating the 125th anniversary of the establishment of the Railway Mail Post Office and honoring the people associated with this branch of the Post Office Department.e",

I worked with the chairman and ranking member and we added report language that goes as follows: \"The committee continues to support strongly the CRP and urges the Department to encourage further enrollment in the program.\" The most important message to send to USDA is that Congress supports the Conservation Reserve. The House Agriculture Committees action on reconciliation sends the signal that Congress is wavering in its commitment and this is untrue. A moratorium on enrollment in the CRP would be a crippling blow at best and most likely a death blow to the program. CRP is a key component in the strategy to remove highly erodible lands from crop production. To back off on CRP is to back away from conservation. This will be a key issue on the 1990 farm bill. and we must not send I mixed messages now about Congress intention in this area. Again.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to express my support for the increase designated in H.R. 2883. the Agriculture appropriations bill. for the Supplemental Feeding Program for Women. Infants. and Children [WIC]. The bill provides an increase of $197 million above the fiscal year 1989 level. or $118 million over the current services level. With this increase. approximately 250.000 new participants will be brought into WIC. We often hear about the impressive cost savings associated with WIC. For every $1 invested in WIC. we save around $3 in hospital costs. In addition. we save about 50 cents in Medicaid costs during the first 45 days after birth alone. Today I want to emphasize the human savings that are associated with WIC. Medical research tells us that WIC markedly reduces infant mortality. low birth weight. premature births. and anemia. Despite having the worlds most advanced medical technology. the United States ranks 19th in the world in terms of infant mortality. And it saddens me to point out that my own State of South Carolina has just about the worst infant mortality rate in the country. WIC is one of the most effective tools that we can use to rectify these disheartening statistics. The increase for WIC provided by H.R. 2883 builds on our commitment to the children of this Nation. Earlier this year. the Senate passed the Act for Better Child Care. and I would like to point out that WIC builds on our efforts to provide a solid start for our children during their formative years. WIC increases infants head size. which usually corresponds to brain size and intellectual capacity. Children on the WIC Program get a healthy start in life. and this leads to a healthy start in school. Mr. President. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for his support of the WIC Program. He too recognizes the great service that WIC provides to the most vulnerable members of our society. I would also like to thank his staff. who have worked very hard to address the need to expand the WIC Program.",

American farmers depend on our ability to compete effectively in world markets. This research facility will be a giant stride toward increasing our ability to compete. and win. I also wish to commend the chairman for the leadership he has shown on the WIC Program. The special supplemental program for women. infants. and children is a crucial food support program that reaches millions of needy women and children each year.

The bill before us includes an increase in 1990 of $118 million over the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] baseline for the women. infants and children [WICI feeding program. The $2.126 billion appropriation for WIC is $197 million above the 1989 funding level. This is a major achievement. Mr. President. This funding increase will allow an additional 230.000 lowincome women and children to be served by the WIC Program. The WIC Program is widely regarded as one of the Federal Governments most costeffective programs in curbing infant mortality and meeting the health needs of poor mothers and children. It is a program that enjoys overwhelming bipartisan support. Recognizing the importance of this program. the 1990 budget resolution included a major increase for WIC. The funding increase for WIC in this appropriation bill affirms the budget resolution and. in fact. provides the largest single increase for WIC in recent years. Today. only half of eligible women and children are served by the WIC Program. Because of action by the Appropriations Committee. the percentage of those served will increase in 1990. If we continue the funding pattern set by the Appropriations Committee. we will be well on our way toward ensuring that all qualified poor mothers and children will someday benefit from this program. So let me once again congratulate the senior Senator from North Dakota for his support for the WIC Program.

Doris is a pioneer for women in the Montana legal community. and in accepting this nomination she becomes one of only four women to serve as a U.S. attorney nationwide. Her interest in law came from her father and grandfather who both were lawyers. When she attended the University of Montana law school. from which she earned her law degree. she was the only female law student for 2 out of her 3 years there. After the death of her husband Doris practiced law as a deputy Yellowstone County attorney and later as a public defender. In 1974 she joined current Montana Supreme Court Associate Justice Diane Barz to establish the first womens law firm in the Northwest. As U.S. attorney. Doris goals include continuing emphasis on prosecuting drug dealers. monitoring gangs for signs of Federal violations. and working to establish better relations with Montanas Indian reservations. She already has established a victimwitness program which keeps crime victims aware of developments in their case. Including when the suspect Is released on bond and when the suspect is scheduled to appear in court. This is a proud day for Doris Poppler. Her entire family has traveled from across the country to share the significance of the swearing in ceremony. This also is a proud day for the State of Montana.

This committee would be referred to as the \"Battle of the Little Bighorn Indian Memorial Advisory Commission.\" At least 10 interested Members will be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior to advise the Secretary in the performance of the Secretarys duties under this act. H.R. 4660 would authorize the Secretary of Interior to hold a competition to select a design to build a monument in honor of those native Americans who fought and won the Battle of the Little Bighorn. on July 25. 1876.

That man is Steve Gerstel of United Press International. who today celebrates his 30th anniversary as a member of the Senate and House Press Galleries. Steve has been around a great deal longer than I. and as a result. I often find his insights and his comments both helpful and enlightening. He has served our Nation as a reporter. and although that is not an official position under our system. it is a role that is tacitly recognized and honored in the first amendment. Steves work is of a caliber that respects and honors the purposes of the first amendment and it is particularly fitting that he marks his anniversary at this time. because it is a time when the worth of the first amendment is being acknowledged worldwide as never before. Not all of us know it. because Steve has so thoroughly assimilated American culture and traditions. but his family emigrated to this country from their homeland of Czechoslovakia. Indeed. it was Steves unvarnished Czechoslovakian name which led to his untimely detention by an overly enthusiastic FBI agent when he was detailed to cover Khrushchevs visit to this country In 1959. That detention may be the only time Steve has failed to fulfill his duty as a reporter honorably. fairly. and well In the three decades that he has covered the Congress. Today. when the liberties of free speech and a free press are being openly sought in Soviet Russia and Eastern Europe. It is a good time to consider the role that our Nations independent media have played in the development of our system and the preservation of our liberties. Not all of us always enjoy the attention we receive from our friends in the press. but if we are given the honest and fair reporting that is a hallmark of Steve Gerstels work. we have much to be grateful for. Our Nation was the winner when Steve came to this country. and It is a real pleasure to congratulate him on his 30th anniversary on the Job.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to take Just a moment to salute someone who is celebrating a remarkable anniversary today. I am talking about Steve Gerstel of United Press International. who is observing his 30th year of dedicated Journalism on Capitol Hmllthat gives Steve more tenure than almost every Member of the U.S. Senate. In fact. It might even entitle him to vote on the floor. Lets face it. anyone who has spent that much time listening to the Senate deserves something speciallike a free doctors examination. Steve found out all about this place when he first joined UPIs Washington bureau. One day his boss told him to get some reaction comments from Senator Herman Talmadge of Georgia. Although it was late in the evening. the young reporter dutifully called the distinguished Senator at his home. Senator Talmadge answered but told Steve he would call him back in the morning. \"Thats OK.\" Steve said. Well. the Senator called back in the a.m.-4 a.m. to be exact. Steve. welcome to the U.S. Senate. Since that time. Steve Gerstel has seen plenty of 4 a.m.s on Capitol Hill. Of course. UPI subscribers and newspaper readers dont think about how the news got to their desks or breakfast tablesthey just want the news. But behind that news are the men and women who do the thankless task of digging out the news and getting it out to the public in a seemingly endless series of pressurepacked deadlines. That is why Steve Gerstels service in the Press Gallery is so impressive. Steve. I congratulate you and wish you all the best as you continue your recordsetting pace in this historic building. You have earned the respect and admiration of your colleagues and my colleagues as well.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. It is with a strong sense of the absurd that I have listened to defenders of President Bushs capital gains tax cut invoke President Kennedy in support of their scheme. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In 1983. President Kennedy proposed a comprehensive set of reforms to reduce tax rates and close tax loopholes. It was similar In many ways to the historic Tax Reform Act of 1986. which he would have enthusiastically supported. Yes. President Kennedys proposal included a reduction in the capital gains tax. But it also included taxation of capital gains on assets transferred at death or by gift. In his message to Congress in 1963. President Kennedy clearly stated: Adoption of this proposalmeaning taxing capital gains on transfers at death or September217. 1989 by giftis an essential element of my program for the taxation of capital gains. certainly in its absence there would be no Justification for any reduction or present capital gain rate schedules. Does President Bush support this reform as well? The answer is no. All he has proposed on capital gains is the tax cut without the tax reform. I have no doubt that my brother would vigorously oppose the Bush plan if he were here today. Invoking President Kennedy on behalf of this multibilllondollar giveaway to the richest taxpayers in the Nation is intellectually dishonest and politically preposterous. It misreads history and misleads the American people. I hope that House Members who should know better will stop misrepresenting President Kennedys position.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today President Bush. convenes a historic education summit with the Nations Governors. This meeting offers a unique opportunity for the President. members of his Cabinet. and the Governors to work on strategies for reversing the education deficit. President Bush and the Governors do not need more studies telling them how our education system is failing our children. They are convinced its failing usand so are the American people. They are fed up and they want action. The President has worked closely with the Governors to shape an agenda that responds to the publics concerns. The participants will focus on teaching. the learning environment. governance. choice and restructuring. a competitive work force and lifelong learning. and postsecondary education. One aim of the summit is to begin the process of developing national goals for our education system. The American public is ready for this idea. A Gallup poll released last month found Americans strongly favor national goals and standards for public schools and national tests to determine if students are meeting the standards. What they do not want. however. is a national curriculum. The President and the Governors will also explore the possibility of allowing greater flexibility in the use of Federal education funds in return for greater accountability for performance. I amconvinced this is a trade the American people will support. Americans do not want Uncle Sam running the classroom. What they want is more bang for their education buck. and plenty of local control. Mr. President. our system of higher education Is already the envy of the world. There is no reason our elementary and secondary schools should not be the same. But to get there we will have to make changes. fundamental changes. Thanks to President Bushs leadership. we are heading in the right direction. Now we need a renewed commitment to go beyond tinkering at the margins so we can implement real reforms. We have to give school administrators more flexibility and parents more choice. we must do more to recruit and retain good teachers. and we need to improve the curriculum and make schools more accountable for results. These are all themes which the President has sounded and which he and the Governors will take up during the summit. I am confident that their work this week will give a renewed sense of purpose and direction to the reform of our educational system.",

Cooper Holt. who was then a 19yearold soldier stationed in the South Pacific. paid $1 to Join the VFW as a memberatlarge. Although he did not know it at the time. it would signify the beginning of a lifelong partnership. In 1956. just 12 years later. Cooper Holt was elected commanderinchief of the VFW and became the youngest man ever to serve in this capacity. In 1963 he became the executive director of the VFWs Washington office. In each of these positions. Commander Holt served with integrity. dedication. and conviction. Commander Holts leadership will be sorely missed by the members of VFW and by those of us who have worked closely with him in past years. The outstanding service which he rendered to our Nations heroes. however. will be forever remembered and admired. Representative G.V. \"SoNNY\" Mowroommy. our colleague from Mississippi. has written an excellent article detailing the career and accomplishments of Commander Holt.

Members agreed that two timesensitive matters would be included on H.R. 3275now before usand second. a larger trade bill including the Caribbean basin initiative and miscellaneous tariff provisions would be considered very early in the next session. The steel bill. H.R. 3275. represents a wellcrafted compromise supported by the administration and domestic steel producers and consumers. This bill gives the President the authority to implement his Steel Trade Liberalization Program. Since September 30. those in our Government assigned to count imports and collect export licenses have been working under the assumption that Congress would soon extend the steel program. We are late in carrying out this responsibility so I am pleased we are acting now. The two additional provisions. although unrelated. are exceedingly important and time sensitive. The first responds to a GATT panel finding that the U.S. Superfund fee discriminates against imports and is. therefore. illegal under international law. The change we make here equalizes the fee and puts United States negotiators in Geneva in a better position to continue important Uruguay round talks aimed at an effective dispute settlement regime. Also included by the other body is compromise language. originally worked out by the Ways and Means Committee. establishing the level of Caribbean feedstock required to make Caribbean ethanol eligible for dutyfree treatment under the CBI Act. This language is important to several small businesses who. in good faith. made investments in the region. and later the rules of the game were changed. Mr. Speaker. all three items in this package are urgently required and I ask for swift adoption. Mr. Speaker. I withdraw my reservation of objection.",

And. it is a reminder that the clean air bill awaits our return In January. But now there is hope on the horizon. Cleanburning alternative fuels. such as ethanol from Americas farms. can play a critical role in making the air breathable again in cities all across this land. The clean air legislation we consider next year may well determine the role of alternative fuels in the 1990s and beyond. Alternative fuels have been the subJect of much debate within the Energy and Commerce Committee. and without doubt they will be the subject of even more debate when the clean air bill comes to the full House next year. Congress must make informed choices on alternative fuels and other important air quality issues soon after Congress reconvenes. As a congressional member of the U.S. Alternative Fuels Council. I will do what I can to provide Members with information on this subject. To that end.

In addition. there is a report that the Secretary General of the OAS may be in the hotel. I do not know If that is actually true or not. This is another of the continuing outrages by these Marxist guerrillas who are proven enemies of democracy in El Salvador. We have heard all sorts of criticism of the duly elected Government of El Salvador while it fights for its life against the recent terrorist offensive. which seeks the very destruction of this democratically elected Government. This terrorist offensive was undertaken with the clear purpose of causing as much death and misery to the innocent civilian population as possible in order to undermine the Salvadoran Government. This is in line with traditional Marxist doctrine. I ask. where Is the outrage from those who were so quick to Judge the Government of El Salvador? These critics rush to judgment over the tragic murder of the Jesuit priests without awaiting a preliminary investigation of what actually happened. And this while the Marxist guerrillas take credit for the urban offensive in the suburbs of San Salvador. an offensive that they know will bring death and destruction to large numbers of innocent civilians. The critics call for negotiations with these terrorists. who have refused to participate in two elections where there was a free and open process to determine who would lead that government. We are fixing to have a resolution ou this Issue. I urge my colleagues to look at the resolution and support it. Mao Tsetung said many years ago that every Communist must grasp the truth that \"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\" That is what is happening In El Salvador. They are trying to seize power through guns. through taking hotels. through attacking the capital of El Salvador. We should not allow these actions to destroy the democratic government in El Salvador.",

The world of atomic and subatomic particles has been a lifelong love of this Nobel Prize winner. He Joined the University of Washington faculty in 1955. and in 1973. along with several assistants. he used electricglmagnetic fields generated in a vacuum to hold a single electron in place. It is for this accomplishment we honor him today. But Professor Dehmelt did not stop seeking more information on particulate behavior. In 1986. he and others energized a single barium atom and watched it make a quantum leap to a higher energy level. Professor Dehmelts work in the measurement of quantum leaps. which has led to the most precise timekeepIng method in scientific history. is astounding in its Implications for the future. Although as a layman. the Intricacies of his work remain as mysterious to me as they do to most Americans. we are no less its beneficiaries. His achievement is a major step forward In the slow process of defining and understanding our universe. I understand that the Germanborn professor Is a naturalized citizen. we should be honored that he has chosen the United States as his new homeland. His presence reaffirms the vitality and curiosity immigrants bring to our country. Washington State is particularly fortunate Professor Dehmelt chose the Seattle area as his home. the announcement of his Nobel Prize in our centennial year of statehood is a marvelous finale to our year of celebration.

President Bush and more than 75 heads of government around the world will come together at the largest summit meeting ever held.

The subject of this summit is the concrete shape of the future of the world. in its most concrete embodimentthe children of the world. We live in a time when the marvels of technology. communication. and organization have recently made it possible to share the basics of good health. good nutrition. and basic education with everyone in the human family. But this process is not complete. and children are those who are most left out. About 40.000 preventable deaths still occur every day according to UNICEFmost of them among children under 5 in the poorest countries. At least half of those deaths could easily be prevented by the end of this century at low cost if the leaders and people of the world set this as a real priority and work together to do it. I applaud President Bushs decision to focus on the future by attending the World Summit on Children in New York this weekend. The House of Representatives passed a resolution last year urging the President to lead the world community in proposing concrete actions to achieve the goal of permanent improvement in the survival rates. health. and development of people in all countries by the year 2000. especially children. Mr. President. please convey to the other leaders of the world this weekend. that the American people and the U.S. Congress want the children of the world to be given the highest priority and that we will work together with them to make this historic summit the beginning of a new historical era for children. This Member would like to end by quoting from a declaration written by a seventh grade class in the Palms Gifted Magnet Junior High School in west Los Angeles. \"We. children of the world. declare peace on the future.\"",

Casimir Pulaski and his spirit and innovation. a far different version of American history could have been written. Born in 1747 to a wealthy family near Warka. Poland. Pulaski shunned the aristocratic life and became deeply involved in the resistance to Russian encroachments on Polish independence. When the effort failed. Pulaski was forced into exile. however. his devotion to freedom and liberty never wavered. In 1777. hearing of Americas struggle for independence. Pulaski volunteered his services to Gen. George Washington. Distinguishing himself at the Battle of Brandywine by saving Washingtons life. Pulaski was appointed brigadier general of the cavalry on September 15. 1777. Pulaski transformed the American cavalry from a mounted infantry into the Europeanstyle cavalry. The Pulaski Legion was in the thick of many battles. claiming victory in the Battle of New Jersey in 1778 and successfully defending Charleston. SC. General Pulaskis last act of bravery came during the Battle of Savannah. The British had a stronghold on the city and were firing heavily at the American soldiers. Pulaski volunteered to charge the British line of defense. enter the city and confuse the enemy. It was during this charge General Pulaski was seriously wounded and 2 days later. on October 11. 1779. he died. Mr. Speaker. it is only fitting that today we honor this great patriot who sacrificed everything in the name of freedom.",

Under this resolution. crop insurance is continued at the lower of the rates provided in the House and Senate appropriations bills for Rural Development. Agriculture. and Related Agencies. The House has funded crop insurance at a level of $264.518.000 and the Senate has funded it at $663.222.000. Therefore. for the duration of the continuing resolution. crop insurance will be funded at the House level. The House level does not provide for the continuation of the Crop Insurance Program in fiscal year 1991 but. rather. provides funding to pay for those insurance policies which were signed prior to October 1. 1990. and for closedown costs during 1991. The Senate. on the other hand. has provided sufficient funding for a fullfledged Crop Insurance Program for the entire fiscal year 1991. My concern is that under this resolution the Department of Agriculture would have to begin shutting down the crop insurance program immediately. However. I have been assured that. because of the short duration of the continuing resolution. the crop insurance program will continue. I have been assured that the Department of Agridulture will request a special apportionment of funds made available by the resolution. and I have been assured that the Office of Management and Budget will approve this request. in order to continue the program for the duration of the continuing resolution. Therefore. crop insurance employees will not be laid off or furloughed. and commissions will continue to be paid to crop insurance agents. It is also my expectation that crop insurance contracts will be signed during the period of the continuing resolution for those crops and for those policies that are due. Therefore. for the duration of this resolution. crop insurance will continue as it was operated in fiscal year 1990. This arrangement will allow the conference committee on the Rural Development. Agriculture. and Related Agencies appropriations bill and the Congress to work its will with regard to funding for crop insurance in fiscal year 1991.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me be brief by simply saying you can write a long list of civilian employees who are on call 24 hours a day from FBI and CIA agents to the firefighter who Is working at a military base. So. granted. there is a special facet to the relationship between military personnel and the Government. but it is far from unique. I cannot understand the passion of our dear colleague from Ohio for assuring the political freedom for civilian employees but no passion whatsoever for the similar freedoms for those who defend the freedoms for everybody else. Either this bill makes sense for all Government employees or it makes sense for no Government employees. How do our military personnel feel about repeal of the Hatch Act? I do not know. Let me also say I do not know how civil service feels either. I know how public employee labor unions feel. I am not aware anybody has done any kind of effective survey that indicated that rank and file civilian employees want a protection which they have always had against pressure to be involved in partisan politics removed. My guess is that the vast majority of our civilian employees do not want the Hatch Act repealed. But my point is one of logical consistency. and I think the amendment stands or falls on that argument alone. Does it make sense to allow all of these other Government employees to be involved in partisan politics and not allow the uniformed services similar involvement? I say no. Either this bill is wrong for everybody or it is right for everybody. and that is the question posed by this amendment. I yield the floor.",

It Is very simple. The Congress is still committed to unending increases in spending every year over the previous year. The answer to our deficit problems should be to cut and control spending. And I am not talking about below what we spent in the past. just freeze it. Every year we have had an increase across the board almost in every program.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to provide farm program fairness and equity to married couples by correcting problems with current Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service regulations. In my view. classifying spouses as one person. as under current ASCS regulations. can create serious inequities. For example. family members. except the spouses of farmers. can be eligible for separate payment limitations as long as they make a significant contribution of active personal management or labor. In some cases. spouses of farmers may inherit farmland far from the original farm but still be ineligible for a separate payment limitation. I find this very troubling. as many spouses of farmers contribute as much or more than other eligible family members. Mr. President. these problems indicate to me that current ASCS regulations are unfair. Finally. this legislation also addresses a problem with payment limitation requirements relating to the Conservation Reserve Program. Under current regulations. a person who is receiving the maximum payment limitation and inherits land which is under a CRP contract cannot receive the rental payments from the inherited land. Given that land in the Conservation Reserve Program is under contract. I firmly believe that the owner of the land should receive the rental payments regardless of any payment limitation. Mr. President. I would like to stress that this legislation is not intended to be a giveaway to farmers nor is it intended to provide more opportunities for abuse of current payment limitation requirements. The sole purpose of allowing spouses to be eligible for separate person status is to address the unfairness and inequity in current ASCS regulations. By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. DAMATO):",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing two alternative bills aimed at reducing the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains. I share President Bushs conviction that reducing the tax burden on capital gains would be the single most important step we could take to ensure the continuing resurgence of our Nations economy. Although I strongly support the Presidents proposal to restore a capital gains differential. I believe it is beneficial to consider a variety of approaches to changes in the tax treatment of capital gains. Earlier this year. I introduced H.R. 719. the Inflation Tax Relief Act of 1989. This bill provides that capital assets held longer than 1 year would be indexed for inflation. At a minimum. I believe it is essential that we eliminate the over taxation of inflationary capital gains. The approach taken in the first bill I am introducing today provides for a maximum longterm capital gains rate of 15 percent for both individual and corporate taxpayers. The second bill provides for a 50percent capital gains exclusion for both individual and corporate taxpayers. The current law definition of a capital asset would be retained in both bills. and capital assets would be required to have been held more than 12 months to be eligible for the preferential tax treatment. High tax rates on capital gains inhibit capital formation by reducing the longterm return to entrepreneurial activity and locking investors into their portfolios. Lowering the capital gains tax rates will stimulate capital investmentparticularly in the critical venture capital areawhich in turn will result in employment growth. higher levels of productivity. a higher rate of economic growth. and improved international competitiveness. While I am personally convinced that a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains will result in an increase in Federal revenues. I recognize that there are conflicting views about the revenue implications of changes in the tax treatment of capital gains. However. irrespective of where Congress finally comes down on the revenue debate. the one irrefutable fact is that if the Federal Government reduces the tax wedge it takes from capital savings. the amount of capital savings available for investment in productive assets will increase. Considering our poor national savings rate. that alone should be sufficient jusitification for improving the tax treatment of capital gains. I strongly urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to these three proposals.",

CSPAN. or the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network. has succeeded beyond anyones wildest nonprofit dreams. Since 1979 CSPAN has made the machinery of this Government understandable and accessible to viewers across the Nation. As with any change. the beginning of the televised proceedings of the House and Senate were not necessarily smooth. But. as the bugs were worked out. we began not only to rely on CSPAN to portray our work to the Nation. we also began to understand ourselves better through the introspection a lens offers. As a result. the \"Washington mentality\" we so often speak about is waning as CSPAN has helped to create a community more in touch with Government and frankly. Government more responsive to the public. No longer do Americans interested in their Government need to depend upon press accounts of Government actions. they can see them first hand. unedited. unpolished. and absent an interpreter. I must commend CSPAN and its employees for a tremendous contribution. Government touches almost every American in one way or another. and now CSPAN viewers can consider themselves the real handicappers of Government action.",

By now we are all aware of the terrible oil spill of over 10 million gallons into Prince William Sound in Alaska. I was just in that State. and I can tell the Members that the people there are outraged. They feel betrayed by Exxon. who promised that they would respond quickly and effectively to any oil spill. and it appears that Exxon has not kept that promise. It is time beyond moving and placing blame and put all our resources into cleaning up the spill and preventing. as best we can. the further destruction of this magnificent region. Congress needs to investigate this incident for two reasons: First. to make sure that everything possible is being done to clean up the spill. and second. to learn what is needed in terms of planning. equipment. and strict government oversight to make sure that such an accident does not happen again. Mr. Speaker. while oil is spreading over pristine island beaches and threat uing to destroy a vital fishing industr). many here are lobbying Congress tu begin drilling for oil in the Arctic National Refuge in Alaska. The disastrous oil spill calls into question the industrys ability and the Governments ability to protect the fragile Alaskan environment. It appears to force us Into that choice that we were told we did not have to make. Do we want Alaskan oil or do we want to preserve the environment? No longer will we accept the promises that accidents will not happen or. if they do. the environment will not be harmed. Mr. Speaker. while Exxon. the Feds. and the State of Alaska are placing blame on each other. the local fishermen are out on the water placing booms around the fish hatcheries that are vital to their livelihood. These fish. wildlife. and waters are public resources. and there Is a public trust to preserve them. and Congress must fulfill this. We must do all we can to see that the people of Prince William Sound get whatever resources they need to protect the environment. the wildlife. and their Jobs from the spreading oil slick.",

I am introducing H.R. 3097. the administrations Senior Executive Salary Act of 1989. As ranking minority member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee I participated in the series of hearings the Committee held concerning the recommendations of the Commission on the Public Service. Chaired by the distinguished Paul Volcker. the Commission presented to the President and Congress a series of recommendations to restore confidence and trust in the public service. In an effort to Increase talent and performance throughout government. the Commission asked Congress to build a pay system which is both fair and competitive while setting higher goals for public performance and productivity. The legislation I am introducing today attempts to meet these goals by providing for higher salaries for a small number of employees in positions requiring specialized and critical skills. H.R. 3097 also provides for salary increases ranging from 8 to 25 percent for senior executive branch officials. In addition. the bill links receipt of the higher salaries to effective job performance. H.R. 3097 is the executive branch counterpart to the administrations judicial salary proposal calling for a 25percent increase in the pay of Justices and judges. The pay of senior government officials has eroded significantly in relation to the pay of executives In comparable private sector jobs. For example. over the past 20 years the pay of executive level II (Deputy Cabinet head. such as the Deputy Secretary of Defense) has slipped from 66 percent to 39 percent of the pay of the lower range of private sector executives. From 1969 to 1985. corporate ex. ecutives enjoyed a 69 percent rise in real compensation. while senior Federal executives saw their pay fall by 30 percent.

Mr. Wamble is a valued friend and constituent who has exhibited a sincere commitment to the betterment of Arkansas pharmacy. The Arkansas Pharmacist Association recently recognized his leadership by awarding him with its highest honor. He was chosen for this award because he has earned the respect of his Arkansas colleagues. He has served as past president of the Arkansas Pharmacy Association. he has chaired several special interest committees and has taken a sincere interest in following legislation affecting the industry. He currently holds positions on the National Association of Retail Druggists membership committee and political action committee. In 1986. he played a vital part in forming the \"Guy Newcomb Legislative Leadership Award\". This award honors the memory of Guy Newcomb and his contributions to Arkansas pharmacy. It is given annually to a legislator that has been involved in pharmacy and health issues. Critical issues of concern to the health and welfare of the citizens of Arkansas. Such matters have always been a top priority for me. and I will continue to support them as long as I represent the First Congressional District. Although Larry has given a great deal of his time to the pharmacists of Arkansas. he has not neglected his civic duties. He is a pastpresident of the Osceola Kiwanis Club and pastlieutenant governor of Kiwanis International. He was also a member of the city council from 1976 to 1986.

Fusion Systems Corp.. which is located in Rockville. MD. has high intensity microwave lamp products and are often preferred over competing Japanese products in the Japanese marketplace. However. it has come to my attention that Mitsubishis \"patent flooding\" tactics in Japan threaten to undermine Fusions market position in Japan and elsewhere by making it impossible for Fusion to continue making its own products without violating Mitsubishis web of patents. The loss of advanced technologies to foreign competitors is of significant concern to me because these losses erode our domestic base of supply and run counter to our compelling goal of restoring the ability to provide for our defense needs through domestic procurement. These losses are particularly disturbing when they are the direct result not of U.S. manufacturing inferiority but of deliberate predatory tactics aimed at our most promising technologies In the past year. Congress recognized and began to address trade practices abroad. The Trade Act of 1988 includes provisions specifically Identifying piracy of U.S. intellectual property protection as an unfair trade practice and directing the U.S. trade practice and directing the U.S. Trade Representative to prepare a special 301 list of countries that fail to adequately and effectively protect U.S. intellectual property abroad. Such piracy is of particular concern in Japan because it is typically our advanced technologies that are targeted for misappropriation. Hearings in the United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and Tourism have documented a number of patenting tactics used by powerful Japanese competitors to extract valued intellectual property rights from United States companies. The Department of Commerce. the Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Trade Representative have taken an active Interest in eliminating these abuses through negotiation with the Japanese Government. So far the Department of Defense has not taken a position on the process. But as patent flooding. coercive cross licensing. and other predatory practices begin to threaten the viability of innovative and reliable domestic manufacturers in the defense chain of supply. the Department of Defense and the Armed Services Committee also have a responsibility to respond. I would like to put foreign contractors on notice that their practices with respect to U.S. intellectual property are of significant interest to me and my constituents.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and Mr. PRICE to suspend temporarily the duty on import of ranitidine hydrochloride. This legislation is Identical to S. 1342. introduced on July 18 by Senator TERRY SANFORD. This legislation would affect the imports of ranitidine hydrochloride. an imported raw material produced exclusively outside the United States and used by a U.S. corporation in the Second District of North Carolina to produce Zantac. a widely used pharmaceutical product for the treatment of ulcers. This company. Glaxo. is the sole producer of Zantac in the United States and has produced Zantac since 1984. employing 500 to 600 American workers in its production. Increasing demand for Zantac has outgrown the capacity of existing domestic manufacturing facilities. Unless Glaxo expands its manufacturing capability to satisfy these demands. it will be forced to import Zantac tablets and new dosage forms from abroad. A temporary suspension of the duty on ranitidine hydrochloride would assist this company in expanding its production capability to meet the needs of U.S. consumers and would also result In the employment of 80 to 160 additional American workers. I understand that the current 3.7 percent ad valorem duty on ranitidine hydrochloride has been randomly designated by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 2932.19.50007 and does not represent a conscious decision on the part of the U.S. Congress. This duty increases the cost of production of Zantac. Passage of legislation temporarily suspending duty on ranitidine hydrochloride would have a strong beneficial effect on the United States. Suspension of this duty will make expansion opportunities in the United States more attractive and enable Glaxo to keep up with growing consumer demands. This U.S. producer of Zantac is hopeful that it will be able to Increase the manufacture of the finished product rather than import it from abroad. This in turn would create more jobs for American workers and enhance the U.S. balance of payments. Because there are no domestic producers of ranitidine hydrochloride. no domestic interests would be adversely affected by a duty suspension. Furthermore. It would considerably benefit the Nations Interest to have Zantac produced domestically. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as part of any tariff suspension legislation thai comes before the House.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I feel constrained to reply. if I might have the attention of the Senator from Massachusetts. to his last comments. I voted with those who opposed the constitutional amendment and I did so because of my conviction that the statute will pass constitutional muster next time around and that the statute provides for expedited court review. I made an extensive statement on this subject by analogy to the New Deal legislation in the 1930s and the Communist legislation in the 1950s and most recently on the situation with respect to the affirmative action matter. But I do not think it is an accurate characterization to call this the BushAtwater amendment. This is an amendment which had widespread Democratic support. I just hurriedly made a tally on the rollcall. and I find at least 14 Democrats who supported this constitutional amendment. So I think that that is significant support on both sides of the aisle. It seems to this Senator thatI have just been handed a retally and there were 18 Democrats who supported this amendment. But it seems to this Senator that. while I disagree with the amendment. there is ample room for a good faith representation that this is an important matter. aside from what Lee Atwater may think. aside from what President Bush may think. The vote was 51 to 48. so that the majority favored the amendment. That is not the twothirds requirement to have more than a majority test and to have ratification required by threefourths of the States. But I do not think. on the face of this record. that it is accurate to say that this is a partisan matter which is being engineered for crass political purposes when 18 Democrats have supported the matter and a majority of the U.S. Senate. albeit short of a twothirds vote. have supported the amendment.",

Health and Human Services. and Education in what has been a very. very difficult year. As articulated by my colleague. we have worked together and I think. through the conference process with the House. structured a bill. which is a good bill. considering all the problems we have had. Our subcommittee has had enormous difficulties. as have all the subcommittees. on limitation of funds. I suggest our subcommittee has been at a greater disadvantage when the full Appropriations Committee. early in the process. reallocated $393 million. making our job all the more difficult. We have some of the toughest items. items of greatest need which this country faces. We have addressed those. Mr. President. and I think we have done so in a way which is balanced and accommodates needs as best possible with the limited funding. Many were concerned about the lowincome home energy assistance. from my State and from the Nation generally. and we have provided for an increase over the 1989 funding. Not a great deal. $10 million. but an increase. We have taken a look at very critical programs on mental health research. where there have been so many advances in recent times. a very costefficient increase. And we have provided a very significant increase. $64.6 million over last years funding. similarly. on refugee assistance and on the homeless and on the Job Corps and black lung and mine safety and health administrative matters. to mention only a few.

We worked very hard over a period of many hours to craft this conference report. There were some serious differences of opinion expressed by the House on a number of issues in this bill. I was particularly interested. and I know others were. including the managers. in the education programs that are funded by this bill. There are some new programs that are experimental in nature. that are designed to bring to many schoolchildren. learning opportunities and experiences that they would not otherwise have without the use of new and modern technology such as satellite communications and the like. There is a provision in the conference report. the Senate should know. which supports the action taken here in the Senate to fund the star schools program. This is a program that had not been included in the House bill. but it provides. I think. $15 million of funding to carry this program forward in the next fiscal year. It is a program providing grants to consortia of local schools. State education agencies. colleges and public television authorities to bring to many classrooms courses that would not otherwise be possible because of the lack of qualified teachers in the local communities. These include foreign language courses. advanced science and mathematics courses. and many other subjects that enhance the learning experience of many of our Nations students. particularly in rural areas or small communities where the tax base is Just not sufficient to support that kind of instructional availability. So I want to add at this point. again. my thanks and congratulations to those. on the part of the Senate. who stood fast and urged that this be included in the conference report.

This comprehensive legislation deals with the threat of rapid climate change resulting from rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. chlorofluorocarbons. nitrous oxide. methane. and other infrared trapping aerosols. Americans witnessed an unusual number of disasters in 1988 that included: the cropdestroying drought that devastated many of Americas farms. raging forest fires that spread uncontrollably through our commercial timber and pristine wilderness areas. Hurricanes Gilbert and Helene that ravaged the Caribbean and our southeastern shores. leaving entire communities homeless. the record heat wave that gripped the Nation and intensified the unhealthy effects of urban pollution. and the tragic flooding of Bangladesh that left disease and starvation in its wake. Scientists lack adequate data to say whether these costly incidents were influenced by the global warming trend. But the scientific community is united in warning us that in the future such disasters will occur with increasing frequency and severity if the rise in greenhouse gas emissions goes unchecked. Clearly more basic research on climate change is paramount if science is to be able to better predict the many consequences from rising levels of greenhouse gases. Yet. we already know that massive economic dislocations are in store if business as usual continues. as was detailed in the climate impact report recently prepared for Congress by the Environmental Protection Agency. Sea level rise could destroy onefourth to twothirds of coastal wetlands. jeopardizing U.S. shellfish and finfish supplies. Significant dieback of southern forests could occur. which currently supply about half of the Nations softwood and hardwood timber.",

In the late seventies and early eighties. this country experienced great concern over the future energy supply. With the uncertainty of the OPEC oil prices. attention focused on domestic sources. Utah is a State with considerable energy resources including oil shale. tar sands. uranium. oil. and gas. During this furor over energy. the Federal Government saw a need for a water development in the Uintah basin. home of abundant oil shale reserves. in order to meet projected development demands. Since the development of oil shale requires a lot of water the Jensen unit was born. The project was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation over the next few years. As the Jensen unit neared completion. the people became concerned because the predicted energy boom had never materialized. How were they supposed to pay for all the municipal and industrial water supplied by the project. one that was built at the Federal Governments insistence? Last September. the district completed negotiations with the BOR on an amendatory contract. This contract would allow the district to purchase the water it can afford and turn the remaining M&I water over to the United States. If the energy boom should ever occur. the Government can release the surplus water under the terms of the amendatory contract. My colleagues and I hope that Congress can move quickly on this legislation. Without it the Federal Government will end up with no return at all on the Jensen unit project.",

As a former history professor. it is easy for me to recognize how important it is for our children to be proud of our heritage and the bravery and sacrifices of our Nations forefathers. By altering the dates to allow the famed \"three day Februaty 22. 1989 weekends\" we neglect to acknowledge these valiant individuals and their heroic deeds in our scramble to get out of town. In their battle to have the dates changed to Monday. the travel industry as well as various other sectors successfully destroyed the meaning of the holidays by equating them to business and profits. In looking at the CONGRESSIONAL REcoRD during the debate in 1968. the arguments that carried the day include absenteeism and money lost as a result. and the closing down and startup costs of some plants and industries. Since 1971. when the Monday holidays first took effect. the meaning of the special days has become more and more obscure. The Washington Times sums it up best in an article written on February 9. 1971: The price of these dubious achievements is one more sacrifice of tradition at a time when that commodity Is in seriously short supply. Draining holidays of meaning and color. the plan does honor chiefly to the dollar. Obviously It Is good for travel agencies. motels. gas stations and chronic weekenders.

I am proud to join the gentlewoman from California. Representative NANCY PELOSI. as an original cosponsor of this bill. which will greatly help to resolve the housing crisis that our Nation faces. Contracts with private investors to provide Governmentsubsidized housing are expiring in the near future. some within the next 2 years. Unless these units remain in the subsidized housing stock. our country will face an unprecedented increase in the number of homeless Americans as these evicted tenants find they cannot afford housing at market prices and turn to the streets. In my home district of San Jose. CA. approximately 2.200 units will be lost in the next 2 years. In the years to come. the number could rise to 7.000. But this is a nationwide problem. At least 300.000 lowincome families could be forced out on the streets all over the country. Homelessness has risen during the last decade because fewer and fewer lowincome housing units have been put on the market. In this case we can prevent further increases in homelessness by preserving what we have already. Representative EDWARDSs bill will allocate $437.5 million in each of the next 3 years to be granted to the States. They in turn will make grants to local governments and nonprofit bodies to purchase the units whose contracts are expiring. This bill grants maximum flexibility to local organizations. those most responsive to the immediate needs of area citizens. Most importantly. it allows the Federal Government. a partner in providing lowincome housing for our Nations needy. to preserve our lowincome housing stock and keep our promise to the poor to help them find a decent place to live. We can stave off future misery by taking immediate steps to retain lowincome housing. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the bill.",

Mr. Speaker. this year it is the same story: President Reagan. in submitting his final budget. called by the elimination of COLAs for Federal retirees in 1990. and the new administration seems willing to follow his lead.",

To stand up here and imply that Jim Gordons claim to fame was based solely on my friendship with him would do a great disservice to a great man. As a Federal judge appointed to the bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. Jim is best remembered for his influential role in shaping the desegregation policies of the Jefferson County public school system. Many of you may recall the tremendous uproar that ensued in 1975 when Louisville first began busing its students. This action generated enormous resistance. school boycotts. and violent demonstrations. But through it all. Judge Gordon received praise from leaders of civil rights groups and members of the Jefferson County Board of Education for the confidence and evenhandedness that he displayed during what could well be considered one of the Louisville areas most tempestuous periods. and his plan for desegregating the Jefferson County schools became a model for other systems to follow. Jim came from a family rooted in Kentucky politics and in the law. His father was a circuit Judge. his mother. one of the first women to be admitted to the Kentucky bar. And an uncle served in both the U.S. House and Senate. Jim. however. never sought an elective office himself although he was seriously considered as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1963 and for the U.S. Senate in 1968. To Jim. the law came first. and it is through the law that he felt he could best serve others. It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to Jim. His presence will be missed. but we will always have fond memories of his quick wit and sharp style. And his contributions to buildIng a more harmonious. racially integrated society will be long remembered.",

Mr. Thomas. that that is not my understanding and I do not believe you are stating the facts. I believe that these are Federal claims. they are processing Federal claims under the ADEA. (tr 239). In my letter to you on February 9. I pointed out that EEOC regulations state that all charges filed with the FEPAs with whom the EEOC has worksharing agreements are considered to be charges filed with both the EEOC and the FEPAs. This practice of \"dualfiling\" is utilized to preserve the fed. eral ADEA rights of older workers whose age claims are filed with FEPAs. Despite my repeated questioning on this matter. Mr. Thomas never acknowledged this ftutdamental point. In his February 16 written responses to the Committee. Mr. Thomas did admit that the FEPAs are handling federal ADEA charges: \"When an age charge is received first by a FEPA with which the EEOC has a worksharing agreement. the FEPA files and processes the charge under Its age discrimination law. Under the worksharing agree. men the state filing also constitutes a technicalfiling of a federal age discrimination charge under the ADEA. which EEOC enforces.\" (emphasis added) The fact that an age discrimination charge filed with a FEPA is considered to be a \"federal age discrimination charge under the ADEA.\" is no mere \"technical\" matter. It means that older workers will not be able to pursue their claims in federal court ifas has happenedthe FEPAs fall to process those claims within the statute of limitations. Mr. Thomas February 16 response goes on to state that the charges filed with the FEPAs are regarded as \"dualfiled\" in order \"to preserve the charging partys right to file a private ADEA lawsuit in federal district court. and to preserve the charging partys option to have EEOC investigate the charge under federal law rather than have the state FEPA investigate it under state law.\" In short. after the hearing. Mr. Thomas did correct his erroneous assertion that FEPAs do not process federal ADEA charges.",

    "speech": "With respect to the fair employment agencies. those agencies do not have statutes of limitations. Unlike the twoyear statute of limitations under ADEA. the charges filed with them are filed under State law and. to our knowledge. none of these State laws have statutes of limitations. so there cannot by definition be lapses in those agencies. (tr. 236) This is clearly incorrect. FEPAs are paid by EEOC to process federal ADEA charges. If the FEPAs fall to process those charges within the two year statute of limitations. the federal ADEA claim is lost. In his February 16 response. Mr. Thomas did not correct this misstatement of law. He did. however. provide data which demonstrates that there have been lapes of federal ADEA claims at the FEPAs. The data provided by Mr. Thomas show that between January 1984 and April 1988. over 2000 individuals who filed federal age claims with FEPAs had lost their federal cause of action due to the state agencies failure to process the charges in a timely manner. These individuals were granted an extension of the ADEA statute of limitations by Congressional enactment of ADCAA in April. 1988. ADCAA only granted an extension to individuals whose federal ADEA claims had lapsed. It is also clear that there continue to be lapses of federal ADEA charges filed with the FEPAs. Data provided to the Committee by the EEOC reveal that since April. 1988. an additional 1500 age charges filed with the FEPAs have not been processed within the twoyear statute of limitations. Thus. individuals filing these charges have lost their federal cause of action. and will not have the benefit of the extension of the statute of limitations granted by ADCAA. These figures were available to Mr. Thomas before the hearing. Inded. the lapsing of federal ADEA charges was perhaps the single most publicized event which occurred during his tenure at EEOC. For Mr. Thomas to assert at his nomination hearing that \"there cannot by definition be lapses\" at the FEPAs demonstrates an alarming lack of knowledge. And his refusal to correct this misstatement of law forthrightly and directly is equally disturbing.",

In 1983. it issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and in June 1984 it voted to rescind the IB and instructed staff to prepare new rules. In March 1985. the EEOC voted again to issue the new rules. The issue had been discussed repeatedly with other agencies and departments during this entire period. The interagency coorporation process was certainly complete when the Commission was sued. in June 1986. to rescind the IB and issue the new regulations.

In this instance. as in the case of the lapsed charges. the blame must rest squarely with the Commission and Mr. Thomas.

Mr. Lowry has been executive director of the Philadelphia Veterans MultiService Center since 1981. During his tenure. the center has placed more than 4.000 veterans in career jobs. The center has given help to veterans in a wide range of causes. including career guidance. job development and placement. disability compensation. posttraumatic stress disorder. drug and alcohol rehabilitation. and housing and emergency assistance. Mr. Lowry has brought the center other great honors. For example. in November. 1989. the center was awarded a grant from the Agent Orange Class Assistance Program to help the children and families of Vietnam vets who may be suffering the effects of exposure to the agent orange defoliant. Recently. the center started the first of a series of computer applications training programs for veterans. Each 12week course teaches basic and advanced elements of computer applications. along with career guidance and counseling. and job placement upon completion of the program. Mr. Lowry. congratulations on your prestigious honor. I am sure that I am joined in my applause by all the thousands of veterans who have received your helping hand.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Vienna followup meeting to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE] mandated a number of subsidiary activities leading to the fourth main followup meeting. to be held In Helsinki in 1992. One set of those meetings is the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE. combining discussion of human rights. human contacts and other humanitarian issues into three 4week meetings. The first of the CDH meetings took place in Paris in 1989. The second of those three meetings was held in Copenhagen from June 5 to 29. 1990. At the end of the meeting. the United States and the other 34 States participating in the CSCE Conference on the Human Dimension in Copenhagen adopted a farreaching political document setting forth ambitious new goals in the areas of free elections. rule of law. and minority rights. It is a document that expresses the conviction that as part of an expanding CSCE process the role of governments in ensuring the rights of individuals is to be strengthened institutionally and procedurally. Mr. Speaker. many people contributed to the successful outcome of the Copenhagen Conference on the Human Dimension. including several Helsinki Commission staff members. But one individual deserves much of the credit. for it was his masterful leadership. clear vision. and steady direction that guided the process throughout. I speak of Ambassador Max Kampleman. who was head of the United States delegation to the Copenhagen Meeting. Ambassador Kampelman served in a similar capacity during the Madrid CSCE followup meeting. It is a fitting commentary that a leader of Ambassador Kampelmans stature was recalled by the U.S. Government to meet the challenges facing CSCE today. He did so with eloquence and with strength of conviction. Mr. Speaker. I respectfully request that Ambassador Max Kampelmans final plenary address on June 29 at the Copenhagen meeting be included as part of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. It is an eloquent statement of vision and hope but also one of warning. We must never become complacent for freedom can never be taken for granted. I urge my colleagues to read these remarks.",

American Indians currently suffer onL- of the Nations highest unemployment rates.

Other reservations across the country have unemployment rates exceeding 50 percent. The millions of dollars spent by the Federal Government over the past 20 years have not broken this cycle of unemployment and poverty. Progress in overcoming the conditions of extreme poverty and its attendant social problems on reservations can only be met if we create institutions that will foster sustained economic growth over the longterm. Such institutions must enable Indian peoples to do for themselves rather than have the Government do for them. In this very important sense. the Indian Finance Corporation will foster the selfsufficiency and independence which tribes so desire. The Indian Finance Corporation will spur economic development by furnishing the necessary capital. financial services. and technical assistance to Indian owned business enterprises and will stimulate the development of the private sector of tribal economies.

Since the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975. much has been accomplished to secure and protect the human rights of citizens in the 35 signatory countries. Although there have been periods of tension and intransigence during the last 15 years. great progress has been made in acknowledging the value of the individual and in preserving the rights thereof. Indeed. Mr. Speaker. events in just the past few months highlight both the advances in this area and the failures that have yet to be avoided. The allowed emigration of tens of thousands of individuals from the Soviet Union stands as an example of major headway in restoring the rights of the individual. On the other hand. the violent suppression of antiGovernment protesters in Romania and the continued detention of Romanian Students League leader Marian Munteanu and over 100 others stands as a reminder of the Governments blatant and regrettable disregard of the rights of Romanian citizens. These events depict the present mix of significant. valuable progress and yet continuing failures to guarantee human rights within the 35 signatory states. In order to acknowledge the accomplishments. but also to press on toward greater improvement in this area. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and supporting this legislation that designates August 1. 1990 and \"Helsinki Human Rights Day.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 6 weeks ago I spoke on the Senate floor about the fiscal crisis that is certain to confront the hospital insuranceMedicaretrust fund before this decade is over. And I noted In that speech that the experts agree that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will be bankrupt within 15 years. Yesterday. the experts revised their projections. and the bad news they are reporting is that Medicare will be insolvent 2 years soonerby 2003. And. according to the trustees of the Social Security and hospital insurance trust funds. the Medicare trust funds will start being depleted in barely 5 to 7 years. Mr. President. we owe It to every citizen of this country to ensure the fiscal integrity and financial soundness of Medicare. We should not. and need not. wait until a crisis befalls the Medicare system. We should do something this year to restore integrity to the Medicare promise. That is why I introduced legislation last monthS. 2249that would reallocate the composition of the Social Security and hospital insurance payroll tax to ensure that the Medicare trust fund will be solvent for the next 25 years. Under my legislation. the 7.65percent payroll tax paid by employers and employees would neither be increased nor decreased. Instead. beginning as late as the year 2000. the Social Security portion of the tax would be reduced from 6.2 percent to 5.9 percent and the Medicare portion of the tax would be increased by 0.3 percent. A further small reallocation between the trust fund taxes would occur early next century with the result that by the year 2007. the Social Security portion of the payroll tax paid by employers and employees would be 5.65 percent. and the hospital insurance portion would be 2 percent. Mr. President. I want to emphasize that this small shift in the payroll tax will not endanger the Social Security trust fund. In fact. these tax rates were arrived at after consultation with the professional actuaries at the Social Security Administration and the Health Care Financing Administration who advised that these rates would provide safe reserve margins for both the Social Security and the Medicare hospital Insurance trust funds.

I am referring to the Civilian Conservation Corps [CCC] which was established by President Franklin Roosevelt in March 1933. It was the first New Deal agency specifically charged with providing relief for unemployed young people and veterans as a result of the Depression of the 1930s. Gov. Carroll Campbell of my State of South Carolina has formally proclaimed the month of April 1990 as \"National Civilian Conservation Corps History Month.\" Between 1933 and 1942. more than 4 million men and women were enrolled in the CCC. Enrollees ranged from age 17 to veterans of World War I in their thirties and forties. Camps were in every State plus Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. working on over 100 different kinds of projects. These men and women were responsible for building. rebuilding. planting. protecting and restoring our Nations natural resources. Some 4.000 fire observation towers were constructed. 3 billion trees were planted. miles of telephone lines were installed. and many forest trails were constructed. The enrollees planted nearly 3 billion trees. constructed over 150.000 miles of trails and roads. stretched over 85.000 miles of telephone lines. erected 4.000 fire towers. and built approximately 45.000 bridges and many buildings. Enrollees. who usually lived in camps of 200 people each. were paid $30 monthly for their work. $25 of which was sent home to their families. The Civilian Conservation Corps was abolished in 1942. not because of unpopularity. but because growing reemployment caused by World War II and the end of the Depression rendered its continued existence unnecessary. The CCC gave many unemployed Americans the opportunity to work due to the adverse effects of the Depression. The accomplishments of the CCC are still being experienced today. Mr. President.

These forces should have been made available pursuant to an agreement between the United States and the Security Council. which agreement would have been approved here in the Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am here today to urge support for H.R. 1677 and the amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 1677 offered by Senator INOUYE. This legislation represents years of work by Members of this body and the House of Representatives. I thank Senator INOUYE for all of his work. The legislation is designed to ensure that television programming aimed at our children is responsive to their needs and interests. It also limits the amount of time that can be devoted to commercials during childrens programming. In view of the educational crisis this country faces today. we must do all we can to enhance and increase the educational material to which our children are exposed. In addition. the substitute provides for the establishment of an endowment for childrens educational programming. The endowment provides funding for educational and informational childrens programming. The programming produced with the assistance of the endowment ultimately will be available to anyone who wants to air it. including broadcast stations. cable systems and schools. This program also will further the important educational interests of our children and enhance the educational function of childrens television programming. I believe that the legislation represents a giant step forward for our Nations children. Our responsibility today is to enact this legislation to protect our children and enhance their educational opportunities. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1677. as amended.",

This measure is only slightly different than S. 1992. which the Senate passed in July. It limits the time that can be devoted to advertising in all childrens television programming. The bill also requires the Federal Communications Commission to determine. in broadcast license renewal proceedings. whether the television broadcaster has served the educational and informational needs of children in its programming. Finally. it establishes a national endowment to fund educational childrens television programming. This measure includes my amendment to apply the advertising limits to childrens programming on cable television. Children do not distinguish between cable and overtheair broadcasts when they watch television. This provision ensures that they will be protected from excessive advertising from either source. As the courts have long held. children are a special class. deserving of special protections. This legislation serves the interests of children without imposing unreasonable burdens on broadcasters and cable operators. Therefore. I recommend its immediate passage.",

If we do not lose any jobs. no money is required. Your amendment only has an effect if jobs are lost. They ought to be for this amendment. The reason they are not for the amendment is that they know jobs are going to be lost. and. they are going to be lost for one reason. because the Government. if this bill were to pass. is mandating the requirement. the net effect of which will be to lose a certain number of jobs in this country. So the decision to eliminate those jobs will come right out of here. The Senators amendment says if that happens. let us have something in place that recognizes that impact and let us at least have the responsibility to recognize that we caused that to happen. They want it both ways. They want to get rid of the jobs. They do not want to have the acknowledge they are getting rid of the jobs. and they sure do not want to have the Government accept any responsibility for the fact that we will have caused it. I will just say one other thing to the Senator. that is. the extra capital costs out through 1995 are estimated to be. the extra capital costs for the automobile industry to get this job done. over $60 billion. Those are the estimates as to the additional capital that will have to be required to meet the mandates in this bill. There is no idea where it is going to come from. We are not providing it here in the bill. We are not providing 5 cents in the bill to actually cover the capital costs of getting it done. The economic impact is going to be tremendous and on the automobiles. I will talk about that later.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment is really fairly simple and one I expect the managers will agree to. I am not sure if they have seen a copy of it. If not. we will get both managers a copy. This bill basically requires all Federal agencies in the executive. legislative. and judicial branches to buy cars and light trucks that exceed the CAFE standard. It is about that simple. In other words. the CAFE standard says the automobile companies have to manufacture cars that exceed a certain standard. and. under the Bryan bill. it will increase the present standard by 20 percent by the year 1995 or 1996 and 40 percent by the year 2000. This bill says that GSA. when it is purchasing vehicles for the Federal Government. has to purchase vehicles that meet or exceed CAFE standards so the Government agencies will have fuelefficient automobiles. If it is good enough for us to mandate it on the entire public. certainly Government should set the standard and purchase vehicles that meet or exceed the standard. I also have an amendment which would require that. by March 31 of next year. all the vehicles that are owned or operated by the legislative branch will meet or exceed the current CAFE standard. Again. this is the idea that if we are going to mandate this on the rest of the consuming public. then the vehicles we purchase and the vehicles that the legislative branch has would meet or exceed the standard. I have seen the Sergeant at Arms and others drive big cars that do not meet the standard. Frankly. they miss the standard by a lot. I do not know exactly what their fuel economy standard is. but it is my guess it certainly is less than 20. and the current standards is 27.5. So if we are going to mandate fuel economy standards on basically the entire American public. we should make sure that the Federal Government leads the way. leads by example. So I hope that my colleagues will agree to this amendment. I have been informed that the GSA currently purchases something like 55.000 automobiles per year.

Its a vote to make that family pay over $2.000 more of new income taxes through 1995. Its also a vote to take away $600 of tax deductions from every family of four filing a tax return. It goes on to say. \"Millions more middle class taxpayers would find themselves in the 28 percent tax rate bracket.\" It goes on to say. \"The tax increase portion of the committee reconciliation bill also deserves rejection. It represents a larger tax increase than that proposed by the rejected budget summit agreement.\" \"These higher taxes. and especially higher income tax rates threaten our economy which is already in recession in much of the country.\" The National Taxpayers Union makes clear that the taxers are the Democrats. The notax people are the Republicans. Reject the big tax budget. Reject the taxers.

The truth of the matter is that the Democrats arent talking about taxing the rich. they are talking about taxing every American. Mr. Chairman.

The Democrats now want to levy the largest tax increase in American historynot on the rchbut on all Americans. even those with modest incomes. This bill would delay indexing of tax brackets and personal exemptions. That one provision represents $36 billion out of the pockets of all Americans over tl.e next 5 years. The Increased Medicare premium and deductible will force senior citizens to shoulder a disproportionate share of deficit reduction. It lays the foundation for a new national sales tax under the guise of luxury taxes. It taxes alcohol and tobacco. The Democrats want the American people to pay significantly higher taxes so that Congress can continue its spending binge. Look at the spending bills the House of Representatives has passed so far. The VAHUD appropriations bill 17.3 percent over last years levels. The LaborHealth and Human ServicesEducation bill which totaled 11.3 percent over last years levels. a $17.3 billion increase.

Our committee reported provisions which exceed the amounts of savings which we were asked to produce. The bulk of our savings are achieved by raising existing tonnage charges which apply to commercial vessels entering the United States from a foreign port. They are found in section 121 of title 46. United States Code. These tonnage charges date almost to the beginning of our Nation and have not been increased since 1909. This single provision will generate $190 million in additional revenues each year. The committee has also authorized the Coast Guard to collect true user fees for services like examination and inspection of vessels and the licensing of crews. These user fees will generate about $30 million in the first year. The committees proposal also authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to charge user fees which offset the cost of several environmental regulatory programs. raising an additional $22 million. Finally. the committee has amended the Coastal Zone Management Act to require the Undersecretary of Commerce to charge fees offsetting the cost of permit appeals under that law. This amendment will achieve savings of as much as $500.000. For legislative history of the CZMA provisions. please see pages H8068 to H8103 of The committee also added provisions derived from H.R. 44. H.R. 188. and H.R. 4333.

We speak to how we should pay for the deficit. that all Americans should pontribute their fair share. that the wealthy should not be left off but should be paying about the same percentage as everyone else. The Democratic alternative speaks to that. Mr. Chairman. the alternative we have before us speaks to the issue of fairness but. most importantly. speaks to the issue of dealing with the deficit of this Nation. The American people expect action. We have the opportunity today to do that by voting for this amendment and voting for the Reconciliation Act.",

They came up $100 billion short from what the President insisted upon. It is very. very difficult if you simply try to do it on the spending side or you simply try to do it on the revenue side. This package is progressive. The minority leader is correct. it does ask more out of those at the upper end of the income scale to pay. It is a fairer package than the one we voted on last week.

The idea that we could reduce the taxes for the wealthy. increase spending for the military. that we could have it all. is over. It has come crashing down during these weeks that we have wrestled with the problems of how to cut $500 billion from the deficit that the Reagan years brought us. What the tax proposal of the Committee on Ways and Means attempts to do is very simple and clear. It says to the people who have benefited over the last 10 years. who have seen their real income increase 94 percent and their real tax rates go down 23 percent. \"We want you to sacrifice a little so that the country as a whole could benefit.\" Mr. Chairman. what have our Republican friends said? \"Dont tax the wealthy. Cut spending.\" Of course. when one asks. \"Just what type of spending? Is it Medicare spending?\" \"Oh. no. no. no. Dont touch that.\" \"Should we cut spending for student loans?\" \"Well. maybe thats a good idea.\" \"What about spending for WIC mothers and the poor?\" \"Well. that may or may not be a good idea.\" Mr. Chairman. they hide behind the cloak of spending attempting to tell the mistruth that all spending is the same. It is not. And all taxes are not the same either. What the package of the Committee on Ways and Means attempts to do is to tax the people who should be taxed and recognizes that a small break In the form of the capital gains reduction that we have should be vested in the middle class. It is a balanced proposal. For 10 years we have attempted to get the publics attention about the basic unfairness of the Republican package. and George Bush has finally handed it to us. He has decided that he would rather see the Government of the United States shut down than to tax the wealthy. Mr. Chairman. we have had enough. It is time for the wealthy to pay.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Democratic alternative to the omnibus budget reconciliation bill. It is billed as soak the rich. but under this proposal. American taxpayers from every income level will be subject to higher taxes. Whats even worse is that this proposal will raise taxes more and more every year. without Congress having to vote on the increases. The Democratic proposal heralds the return of bracket creep. the silent thief who will quietly rob more and more Americans every year by forcing them into higher tax brackets due to inflation. Dont let yourselves be fooled. This is not a taxtherich package. its a taxeverybodyagainandagain package. If you are one of the fortunate Americans who receives a costofliving increase in your income. you may be surprised to find yourself pushed into a higher tax bracket. This could mean a 13percent increase in taxes for Americans in the lowest tax bracket. In fact. the only Americans left unaffected by bracket creep are the 1 million richest Americans. who had their personal exemptions taken away in 1986. This tax increase would have the greatest impact on those Americans least able to afford it. Tax increases will not reduce the deficit. In order to control the Federal deficit. Congress must control Federal spending. In order to control Federal spending. Congress must not raise taxes. Congress must reform the budget process. and Congress must repeal the congressional pay increase. I urge my colleagues to reject the acrosstheboard tax increases proposed in the Democratic alternative.",

It was 20 years ago almost to the day that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was created. Since its creation in 1970. NOAA has been a national leader in ocean and coastal research and management. Among its strongest initiatives are the very successful Coastal Zone Management Program and the National Sea Grant Colleges Program. It is the intent of this legislation to reaffirm the Congress commitment to NOAAs mission and to the leadership this agency has shown during its 20year history. The joint committee amendment before you today authorizes NOAAs mapping. charting. and geodesy programs at $60 million for fiscal years 1991 and 1992. These programs include nautical and aeronautical charting and survey work on the exclusive economic zone. The bill further authorizes the agencys observations and assessment programs at $162 million and NOAAs ocean and coastal management programs at $73 million. including the Coastal Zone Management Program. Under NOAAs climate and air quality research programs. there are authorized over $100 million for the National Global Change Research Program. This funding will ensure that NOAAs vital research on the role of the oceans in determining future weather patterns may continue. Authorizations for NOAAs ocean and Great Lakes research programs are also included in this package. These moneys will fund the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor. MI. and the National Undersea Research Program. H.R. 4115 contains several other important and innovative programs. in. cluding an authorization for funding of priority oyster disease research in the midAtlantic region. the establishment of a Cooperative Institute of Fisheries Oceanography in North Carolina. and an authorization for modernizing and rehabilitating NOAAs outmoded and obsolete fleet of 23 vessels. In addition. H.R. 4115 authorizes $4.5 million for research on methods to tackle zebra mussels and other harmful exotic species. which are currently wreaking havoc in the Great Lakes ecosystems. The Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee supports this bill wholeheartedly and we urge the House to endorse this important environmental legislation.",

Mr. Speaker. this is the second year in a row that the Congress has consid. ered legislation to specifically authorize NOAAs programs. In the past. the Appropriations Committee has appropriated funds for NOAAs ocean and coastal programs pursuant to their general authority authorizing the agency. By considering NOAAs program authorization separately each year. the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. and the Congress. I believe. improve both our oversight of the agency and the agencys administration of these programs. Mr. Speaker. the ocean environment is an Increasingly important issue. Just one example of this Is the role of our oceans in global climate issues. which is becoming increasingly better understood. Accordingly. NOAAs importance and prominence as a Federal agency has gown in recent years. This legislation recognizes the important role that NOAA plays within the Fed. eral Government and the internation. al community in dealing with these important and complex ocean and coastal issues. Most of the funding levels in the bill are consistent with either last years appropriation level or current law. While some are higher in key areas. they are. as a whole. quite resonable. The Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee was able to work out a deal with the Science. Space. and Technology Committee so that this bill includes authorizations for all of NOAAs programs within one bill. including those programs which fall in their jurisdictionsuch as the satellite and weather programs. By doing so. we have a comprehensive bill which addresses NOAAs programs and issues on agencywide basis. Mr. Speaker.

H.R. 4115 also includes language that I offered requiring the Commerce Department and the EPA to produce a decision aid to assist State and local authorities in planning and managing suburban and rural growth and development. This is an effort to make certain that as our local officials are faced with growth and development concerns that they will have planning documents from which to work that will show them what works and what does not across the Nation.

I would like to address one program within the NOAAthe National Woather Service. Our Natural Resources Subcommittee. under Mr. Scheuers able leadership. has undertaken a careful investigation of the National Weather Services ability to detect hazardous weather and to issue timely warnings to the affected areas. Our scrutiny was prompted in part by a devastating tornado that tore through nine North Carolina counties without warning on November 28. 1988. killing four people. injuring 157 others and damaging hundreds of homes and businesses. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes an amendment that TIM VALENTINE and I have offered to ensure that our severe storm research efforts gives particular attention to storm formations in the Southeast region. In hearings in North Carolina and South Carolina. it became apparent that tornado activity is be. coming more frequent in our region. It is essential that we earmark some funds to study this phenomenon especially since easlwn storm cells possess a unique character as compared to tornadoes in the West and Midwest where most of the current research is done. I am also pleased that the bill authorizes sufficient resources to enable the National Weather Service to modernize its vintage equipment. The equipment currently in use is representative of the technology of the 1950s. It is outdated. outmoded. and In many cases. unreliable and inoperative. It is essential that we move quickly to take advantage of the improved forecasting capabilities that the Next Generation Radar System [NEXRAD] and other modernization efforts promise. The importance of this was again underscored by the tomato in my district. The National Weather Service offices In North Carolina did not provide any advance warning of the tornadoes and no watch was issued prior to the initial tornado. In fact. the RaleighDurham radar had been out of service for 8 days. because of a lack of spare parts and spare part modification kits. as well as problems with the spare part distribution system. Mr. Speaker. by passing this bill we put in place the opportunity to save lives and avoid a repetition of the problems we experienced in North Carolina.

The resolution also recognizes the sacrifices made by American and Allied soldiers who gave their lives to liberate Europe and save the world from Hitler. This legislation has been endorsed by the American Legion. the Disabled American Veterans. the AMVETS. and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. On June 6. 1944. Allied troops invaded Normandy. France. marking the beginning of the end of the Nazi empire. On that day. hundreds of thousands of American. British. and Canadian troops sprang from the sea and air onto the coast and fields of Normandy. France. in Operation Overlord to punch a gaping hole in Hitlers Fortres Europe. On the morning of Dday. more than 5.000 Allied ships carrying nearly 100.000 men with 1.083 heavy bombers and more than 2.000 fighter planes overhead hit the beaches of Normandy. France. The invasion was the largest combined air. sea. and land operation in history. After a day of bitter fighting the Allies established a beachhead in Normandy. During the next week the Allied Expeditionary Force solidified its position. The Germans. because of the disruption of their transportation system and Allied air superiority. could not bring sufficient reserves to the battlefield to launch an effective counterattack. Within a few days. the Allies broke through the Normandy defenses and were racing toward Paris. Another Allied invasion of Southern France took place in the middle of August and on August 25. 1944. Paris was liberated. opening the way to an invasion of Germany itself. The people of the United States owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all members of our Armed Forces who participated in Operation Overlord on Dday. and in all other theaters during World War II.

I am pleased that the Senate has scheduled time for consideration of S. 255. a bill to reauthorize appropriations for the Local Rail Service Assistance Program [LRSA] for fiscal years 1989. 1990. and 1991. As chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. I would like to commend the members of the Senate Commerce Committee for their concerted efforts to move this bill expeditiously through the committee. I would like to congratulate my distinguished colleague from Iowa for his tireless leadership on this issue as well as Senators PRESSLER. BURDICK. ROCKEFELLER. and SIMON. among others. This legislation. which was introduced by Senator HARKIN and on which I joined eight of my colleagues as an original cosponsor. reauthorizes LRSA for 3 years at levels which take into consideration current budget constraints a. well as the need that still exists for funding to assist States in preserving efficient rail transportation. As many of you from States with large rural areas know. the railroads have been abandoning marginal light density rail lines. some of which have survived as shortlines. However. as the railroads. spinoff lines which are marginal but potentially profitable. these lines are being purchased by entrepreneurs who are forming shortline railroads. Mr. President. the structure of our railroad system continues to be in transition now as it was 13 years ago when Congress acted to expand the LRSA Program to include all States. However. a 3year reauthorization bill approved by the Commerce Committee as well as a Housepassed measure that would have reauthorized the program at a $10 million level for fiscal year 1989 where both are prevented from being considered on the Senate floor at the end of the 100th Congress. This year. the administration has agreed to honor a commitment made by the Reagan administration to support $10 million to fund the program in fiscal year 1989. if LRSA is reauthorized. However. the administration opposes funding the LRSA Program beyond this amount. in part. because States and private interests are now more significantly supporting rail needs than is the Federal program. I would submit that this is a direct result of the LRSA Program. Nationally. over 10.000 miles of railroad have either been purchased or rehabilitated as a direct result of LRSA.",

    "speech": "Program as it is structured currently requires that 30 percent of the funding come from nonFederal sources for rehabilitation projects. In practice. the States. railroads. and shippers have often provided many times the amount required for this match. However. in a considerable number of cases these funds would not have been made available without Federal funds. In my own home State of Nebraska. some of the projects assisted by LRSA funds include rehabilitation of the 30mile Chicago and Northwestern line between Long Pine and Stuart. rehabilitation of the Sidney and Lowe Railroad between Huntsman and Brownson. and emergency repair of the flooddamaged Burlington Northern line between Burress and Milligan. Not only does S. 255 reauthorize funding. it seeks to achieve the most mileage with limited Federal funds. by reducing the Federal share of the matching formula from 70 to 60 percent. The Senate have no objection to the formula change. Though I support passage of a 3year reauthorization bill for the Local Rail Service Assistance Program CLRSA]. I. along with Senator HARKIN and other supporters of the LRSA Program recognize the importance of ensuring funding for one additional fiscal year. The administration has agreed to support $10 million in funding for fiscal year 1989. We are hopeful that this commitment will extend instead. to $10 million in funding in fiscal year 1990. It is my belief that the Federal Government has a responsibility to continue its partnership with State and local governments. to preserve rail freight service in areas of the country where continued service is in jeopardy. Therefore. I will pursue multiple options to achieve this end. Today our highest priority is to ensure that LRSA funds are available to the States in fiscal year 1990 to meet the needs we know they currently have. This amendment will accomplish this objective and therefore I lend my support. It is also my intention to continue to work to reauthorize funding for this program for additional years. I urge the Members of this distinguished body to support the continuation of the LRSA Program in order to minimize the adverse effects of rail abandonments and to address the critical rehabilitation needs of our rail freight facilities. LRSA has. and should be allowed to continue to improve the competitive posture of our national. State. and local economies.",

Unfortunately. exactly as I had predicted. this Tax Confusion Act has created problem after problem for many Americans. Mr. Speaker. I was an early cosponsor of legislation to repeal section 89 that now enjoys the support of more than 300 Members of the House of Representatives. which is nearly threefourths of the membership of the House. As these Members of Congress have now come to realize. section 89 is nothing but a boondoggle for business. By the U.S. Treasury Departments own admission. complying with just the partial regulations of section 89 will require 9.000.000 hours and impose great monetary expenses on businesses. Section 89 was a misguided attempt by Congress to make benefits fairer for lowerpaid workers. Although the intentions were good. section 89 puts employee benefit plans at risk because many smaller companiesas they discover the complexities of compliancemay be discouraged from offering any benefits. If that happens. everyone loses. Again. I commend my Republican colleagues who are pushing for this vote to preserve an environment for businesses to expand and create new jobs.

While section 89 is intended to ensure that businesses do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. it attempts to effect this policy. through an exceedingly complex set of tests which require employers to collect and maintain extensive information on workers. plan coverage provisions. and workers benefits eligibilitles. and sanctions noncompliance with onerous penalties. In short. the law is so exceedingly complex and imposes such a costly administration burden that it will impede. rather than encourage. the expansion of health care coverage among the Nations uninsured. Clearly. any Federal policy directed at closing the gap in health care coverage among the working uninsured must focus on the small business sector. And any policy which would discourage the expansion of health insurance coverage among small business must be avoided. This is why I have joined with over 300 of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation to repeal section 89. Repeal will give us an opportunity to explore reasonable. simplified alternatives to achieve the policy goals of assuring fair distribution of employee benefits and reducing the ranks of the uninsured. Recently the Bush administration ordered a 90day delayfrom July 1 to October 1in the beginning date for testing benefit plans for compliance with section 89 and the Ways and Means and Finance Committees held hearings on rewriting the law. Both developments are further evidence that the battle for section 89 relief had gained real momentum. I am disappointed however. that an amendment was not made in order to the legislation we are considering today. to make supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1989. which called for an outright repeal of the section 89 nondiscrimination rules. In light of the tremendous outpouring from the American public. I believe the Rules Committee should have made this proposed amendment in order. I am confident that the overwhelming majority of the House would have supported it. I will. of course. continue to strongly support efforts calling for an all out repeal of section 89.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the committee markup of this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. the Committee on Appropriations rejected two amendments to fully fund the Essential Air Service [EAS] through the end of fiscal 1989. The rejection of these amendments was not in opposition to EAS. but rather due to a lack of consensus on the offsets that are necessary to fund the $6.6 million needed to maintain current EAS levels. I would like to commend the gentlewoman from Nebraska for her efforts on behalf of EAS during the committees deliberations. The gentlewoman has worked many years in support of EAS and the rural communities that depend on its service and has been an effective spokeswoman for the concerns of Americas rural residents. There are currently 68 congressional districts that contain airports which participate in the EAS Program. many of them located in rural areas. Two of those airports are in Illinoisone at SterlingRockfalls and one at Mount Vernon. Both those communities will possibly lose the airlines that currently serve them if additional EAS funds are not forthcoming. If these airlines go out of business. they will not return magically in fiscal 1990. Without EAS funding. those airlines will get a oneway ticket out of town. Mr. Speaker. earlier this month I sent a letter to two of the distinguished Members of the other body. asking for their support for EAS when H.R. 2072 is considered by them. I know they recognize the importance of this program. and I would encourage Members of the House to look favorably on EAS when H.R. 2072 is sent to conference.",

Thomas Jefferson believed that democracy could not survive without universal public education. And so today. all over this country. millions of children are sitting in classrooms. participating and learning. preparing to become the skilled. informed. thinking citizens America will need in the next century to maintain our economic strength and our democratic heritage. I want to talk to you today about the 1 out of 15 children in the public schools who is severely emotionally disturbed. Citizens of our great Republic who cannot and will not be able to participate in the vitality and opportunity of our great country. A recent study by the University of Washingtons division of community psychiatry identified 50.000 kids in my State out of a school enrollment of some 750.000one or two in every classroom. on the average who are severely mentally disturbed. These kids cannot learn. some of them can hardly function. These are kids whose response to stress is violence. kids who cannot relate to other people. kids who hear voices. Only one in four of these emotionally disturbed children gets any help. Fewer than 1 in 20 receives actual mental health treatment. There are 39.000 severely emotionally disturbed children in my State who are not receiving any kind of service. These children are not going to become functioning. selfsupporting adults. Our society will pay the pricein State hospitals. in prisons. in welfare costswhen it is too late. Well pay the price later because we are shortchanging them now. Federal mental health block grant funding has been cut in half. The Child and Adolescent Service System Program. enacted in 1984. reaches only 40 States. The pioneering primary intervention project. which brings mental health services to children in the early grades. operates in only 11 of my States 300 school districts. Its easy to make speeches about family values. about being the Education President. about how much we care for children. The test of our commitment is whether we are willing to pay the price.

But if she takes the job she will lose the Medicaid benefits for her children. So she Is locked in. not because of any bad feelings. not because of a lack of sense of responsibility but indeed the very responsibility that she has forces her to stay in a mode where medical care will be available. not to herself. but to her children.

I want to commend both members of the Committee on Ways and Means for their leadership which they have shown on a number of bills that deal with these issues. But once again I wish to state some very glaring statistics. Unemployment among all youth was 15.9 percent in 1987. among black youth it was 33.3 percent and among Hispanic youth it was 29.1 percent. In 1988 close to 1 million students. 950.000. dropped out of school before graduation. ii 1300 Between 1973 and 1986. young people who did not complete high school suffered a 42percent drop in annual earnings and constant dollars. One year of dropouts cost the country $240 billion in lost earnings and taxes. Between 1980 and 1984. black student enrollment declined by nearly 11 percent after steadily increasing during the 1970s. and Hispanic enrollment decreased 14 percent. Despite the problem of atrisk children and youth. in the last 8 years the Reagan administration severely cut programs that assist in the highly vulnerable population. The Federal Governments actual spending for all education activities decreased by 12 percent between fiscal year 1980 and 1988. Between fiscal year 1980 and 1988. chapter 1 education funding for neglected and delinquent youth fell by more than 8 percent. 80 percent of eligible lowincome children are denied education in preschool programs such as Head Start. for preschool children and between 1985 and 1988 education and job training funding under the Job Training Partnership Act fell by 13 percent. I can go on. citing these statistics. I want to commend the distinguished leadership for calling this special order and focusing that we cannot just have rhetoric in dealing with childrens problems as the Bush administration seems to be on the path of doing. We have to have dollar.3 and leadership and commitment. and this leadership and commitment is coming from the Congress. from the Committee on Ways and Means and the Democratic leadership.

Child care providers are being taught to replay program segments from Sesame Street telecasts and use them along with books and other materials to develop the learning abilities of preschoolers. So far 375 preschoolers In 8 childcare centers and 7 daycare homes are participating in the pilot project. with training for new providers underway at 5 more centers and 8 more family homes. An estimated 40.000 children are now in day care In Dallas County. The project hopes that a majority of those children can be enrolled in the program within the next 2 years. The project is the result of a 4way partnership between the Childrens Television Workshop of New York. producers of Sesame Street. now in its 21st year. Dallas public television station KERA. the Dallas Foundation for Health. Education and Research. led by Mr. Ralph Rogers. and the Child Care Partnership of Dallas. The project provides each center with a set of Sesame Street Puppet Characters. includIng Big Bird. Oscar the Grouch. Elmo. Grover. and the Count. for the children to use when theyre watching the program. The projects training Is aimed at teaching care providers to reinforce the programs curriculum: premath. prereading. writing. child and his world. human diversity. and cognitive organization. plus social interaction and the environment. Especially important is training the care providers to be eware of the great power of storybook reading. and how It can be influential in the childrens early development and ability to learn to read. I hope that future child care legislation considered by Congress will provide Federal support to introduce this very exciting early childhood development Sesame Street PEP project to many other areas. I applaud the partners responsible for starting the PEP program In Dallas. I strongly recommend to those who will be responsible for administering our child care legislation that they encourage this kind of development throughout the Nation. Nothing could be more Important than starting our youngest children on the right road to reading and the education theyll need for a better life.",

We have learned from past experiences that it is easy to pollute our underground sources of safe drinking water and much more difficult to reverse the process of leachate seepage once it has begun to occur. Most of the Superfund sites in my congressional district involve ground water pollution from a specific source. often a landfill. My bill will prevent future occurrences of this unfortunate pattern by requiring specific actions to certify protection before the fact. In 1986. we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments creating a national program to identify our sole source aquifers and now it is time to provide protections for these valuable sources of clean water. My legislation is a significant step toward providing the needed protection by placing the responsibility for prevention with the States under Federal guidance. The States make most of the decisions that affect ground water protection and the States should be responsible for certifying that projects under their review are safe. Specifically. my bill would ban the construction of a landfill. surface impoundment. waste pile. or land treatment facility within the aquifier protection area unless the State developed a comprehensive plan for protection of the aquifer. The plan must include a mapping of the sole source aquifer. an assessment of the relationship between land surface activities and ground water quality. management practices to be implemented in order to prevent the adverse impacts on ground water. and a program for State and local implementation of the plan to ensure the continued protection of the sole source aquifer. In addition to the creation of a plan and a means to implement this plan. the State must during the development of the plan consult with and consider the comments of concerned individuals. The State must also conduct public hearings at places within the protection area to provide the opportunity for comment. My bill will play an important role in protecting sole source aquifers and will provide our Nation with clean drinking water.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. forcing an American citizen to give up his first amendment right to petition his Government strikes at the fundamental principle of American democracy. But that is exactly what is at the heart of Frederick R. Weisman versus Toyota Motor Sales. The plaintiff is a Maryland businessman whose company. MidAtlantic Toyota. has distributed Toyotas in Maryland. Virginia. Pennsylvania. Delaware. West Virginia. and the District of Columbia for 20 years. In 1987. in order to renew its contract with Toyota Motor Sales. MidAtlantic was coerced into agreeing that it would \"obtain. directly or indirectly. any political actions at the local. State. or Federal level that are contrary to any business objectives of Toyota sales.\" This gag order represents a shocking assertion of private economic power to Interfere in the public process of governance. This issue raises some troubling questions about Japanese car manufacturers business conduct and practice In the United States. If Toyotas efforts succeeds. this may become a practice by foreign companies in other Industries trying to strip U.S. businesses of their ability to petition elected representatives when disputes arise over similar agreements. I believe that this is a matter that should be the subject of congressional hearings in the near future. This week. 26 of my colleagues and I joined with our distinguished former colleague and longtime chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Peter Rodino. in filing an amicus curiae brief in Federal court In Los Angeles. According to an article in the August 1 edition of the Washington Times. a Toyota spokesperson responded to the filing by saying our arguments are irrelevant. Mr. Speaker. I highly resent a representative of a foreign corporation referring to our constitutional concerns as irrelevant. No individual has a right to seek to keep Congress from becoming Informed about matters of public interest. We are urging the court to clearly. plainly. and promptly declare that the gag provisions such as the one Involved in this case are unlawful. void. and repugnant to our laws and to our Constitution. I urge my colleagues to show their support In this matter by adding their names to the amicus curiae brief.",

The first organizational meeting of the University Club was held March 29. 1919. and on June 20. 1919. Mr. Ralph W. Hersey was elected the clubs first president. On July 16. 1919. the club began serving meals. The rate schedule was: breakfast 35 cents. lunch 50 cents. and dinner 75 cents. On June 29. 1925 Santa Barbara experienced an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 that devastated the town. particularly the central business district. The University Club withstood this temblor magnificently. Some repairs were necessary. but none extremely severe. the advantage of good solid frame construction when building In \"earthquake country.\" The strength of the club and its members was tested during the difficult times of the depressionresignations continually outnumbered new memberships and there were a large number of delinquent accounts during those hard times. It was a difficult time for the club. but It survived. due to the diligent and careful supervision of a cautious and conservative board of directors. World War II was another challenge to the University Club as many members were called away to various branches of the military servIce. To ease the pressure of the times. dues were waived for members for the period of their service. After the war ended many members returned to Santa Barbara and the club was back In full swing. The 1950s and tho 1980s both could be called the decade of expansion for the University Club. During the 1950s the club physically expanded with one extensive renovation as well as acquisition of more property. In 1983 the clubs bylaws were changed to Include the female gender anywhere the masculine was referred to. At this time a special processing method was worked out so that the members of the Santa Barbara Associ. ates. an organization serving the needs of professional women. were admitted to club membership. Today Molly Dahm serves as the first female manager since the founding of the club In 1919. I congratulate the University Club of Santa Barbara on the occasion of its 70th anniversary and I wish the members well in the years to follow. May you celebrate another 70.",

American television may be banned from broadcasting pictures of police intimidation and the numerous arrests of innocent workers and students. But what we cannot see can still be felt. Peace in the Peoples Republic of China can never be attained under these repressive conditions. I urge Deng Xiaoping: heed your own words and \"Seek Truth From Facts.\" Throughout Chinese history. the people have repeatedly demonstrated for greater democracy. The peoples desire for democracy cannot be suppressed. Allow the people of China to strive openly for reform and end this period of fear and pain.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. the President unveiled sweeping revisions to the Clean Air Act. addressing acid rain. urban air pollution. and toxic air. This announcement marks the first time that any President has proposed major strengthening of our Nations clean air law since the 1977 amendments. By all accounts. the President has changed the character and parameters of the clean air debate. No longer can we tolerate excuses or delays. The research is done. The problem is scientifically documented. And the damage is mounting yearbyyear and monthbymonth. To control acid rain. the President proposed significant reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. These deadly airborne killers have wreaked havoc on the lakes. streams. and reservoirs of New England. In my State of Massachusetts alone. over 200 waterways are already dead. and thousands more are on the verge of environmental extinction. Although this plan goes a long way to addressing the devastation of acid rain and other clean air problems. not everyone interested in this issue will agree with every detail of the Presidents proposal. I have some reservations myself. but with this announcement. President Bush has put clean air on the front burner of the national legislative agenda. He has opened the door for a new and revitalized clean air act. Mr. Speaker. let us take up the Presidents challenge and put a strong clean air act on his desk by the end of this session. As he said yesterday. \"weve seen enough of this stalemate. Its time to clear the air.\"",

About three out of five Americans live in areas where breathing is hazardous to their health. according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly 100 percent of the carbon dioxide and 50 percent of the smog is caused from automotive emissions. The hazardous toxins can be eliminated from automobile emissions if Congress requires the use of clean fuels to achieve minimum health air quality standards.

Today. I am offering legislation which will prohibit that satellite launch technology agreement from going through.

We may have imagined that pirates preying on American commerce was a thing of the past. Well. piracy is alive and well. In the 17th century pirates went after gold. today they go after fish. Last week. the Coast Guard caught a Taiwanese vessel. the Ta Chieh No. 3. The vessel. supposedly fishing for squid. was catching salmon bound for U.S. waters. This ship was 500 miles south of the Aleutian Islands. Thats far outside of legitimate squid fishing areas. Madam Speaker. the Coast Guard has video tapes of the crew throwing trays of frozen salmon over the side of the ship. They found logs on this ship which prove that the Ta Chieh violated Taiwanese and international law 64 times over the past 2 years64 times. The Coast Guard boarding party was offered a bribe to look the other way. There is mounting concern this ship is part of a wellorganized fleet which is pirating our fish. It is pirating our jobs. And. Madam Speaker. it is pirating the future of our fishing industry. Such fleets operate not only out of Taiwan but out of other nations such as Korea and Japan. Madam Speaker. the Taiwanese Government granted the Coast Guard permission to board this vessel. But. they need to do more. They need to show this Nation. the world. and the fishing industry that pirates will be caught and punished. The Ta Chieh should be prosecuted to the full extent of Taiwanese law. The Government of Taiwan should take the following three steps: First. place observers aboard their fishing fleet. second. outfit their ships with transpondersfinding their fleet should not be a game of hide and seek. Third. they should make their enforcement officers more readily available to our Coast Guard. Taiwan and the United States have worked hard to build good. solid relations and we should be proud we have just that. Lets not endanger those relations by allowing this piracy to continue. Madam Speaker. 2 years ago. I joined In cosponsoring legislation to keep foreign drift net fleets from stealing our salmon. The Taiwanese and others have flagrantly ignored this law. The time has come to stop the pirating of our fish.",

A year ago we had a young man who had come to the United States of America. by the name of Thi Van Nguyen. He came here to be trained in 1974 to fight for the freedom of his people. Then after a period of time went by he was detained here. of course. and could not go back in and had not seen his wife and three small children since 1974. Last year I went to New York. I talked to the Ambassador to the United Nations of Vietnam and negotiated the release of Thi Van Nguyens wife and three children whom he had not seen for 15 years.

Some of the conversations about this bill that have arisen in recent days have come. of course. because of the negotiations which a number of us conducted to see if we could put something together.

But I would like to have a bill. and I would like to have worked this out. The first opportunity I had to really negotiate this matter was a week or so ago when I received a call from the eminent attorney William Coleman. a former Secretary of Transportation. a wonderful man. a tremendous attorney. a very. very bright guy. a fellow I have a lot of respect for and can even say a friendship and love for. He approaches this bill from a very definite perspective. having suffered himself from discrimination as a young black man brought up in Philadelphia and as a young. near the topoftheclass law school graduate from Harvard University. He was foreclosed from law firms because he was black. He called me and said. \"Orrin. will you sit down with me as a friend and see if we can do something about this?\" I said. \"I will be glad to.\" because I am always willing to sit down and negotiate. I think we would have done a lot better if we had done it from the beginning of the bill. If when they began to file it and after filing it. they had sat down and tried to work it out. I think we probably could have worked it out. We worked for 7 days and nightsI say they were like 12- to 18hour dayswith Mr. Coleman and. I might add. the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. ARLEN SPECTER. Both of them worked indefatigably to see if we could resolve this matter. We came up with basically seven changes.

ID. are taking notice of the significance of the day. On the 21st they will fly American flags to show their pride in Old Glory and to protest the Texas versus Johnson decision. They are now working to encourage people in Idaho and around the country to join them in honoring the American flag. I commend the people of Coeur DAlene for their efforts and encourage others who may be listening to join in this effort to mark the 1month anniversary of that Supreme Court decision by flying the American flag proudly that day. Together let us fly our flags to remind America of what Old Glory stands forthe ideals of America. and the many who died in battle to uphold those ideals.",

Michael Eisner should be congratulated for making a great American company even greater. Between 1984 and 1988. Disneys earnings quadrupled. and by 1988. Disney films were earning more than onefifth of all U.S. box office revenues. Under Michaels direction. Disney has brough us such splendid films as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" and \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills.\" Prior to joining Disney. Michael was president and chief executive officer of Paramount Pictures for 8 years. a tenure marked by such successes as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" \"Terms of Endearment.\" \"Ordinary People.\" \"Star Trek.\" \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" and \"Saturday Night Fever.\" Mr. President.

Mr. Adams has brilliantly guided Troy State University for over 25 years serving as president and later receiving the even more prestigious appointment as chancellor of the university. Under his direction. the structure of the university was reorganized to better suit the students needs and aspirations. He instituted new and farreaching programs which have expanded the students minds and focused on the thoughts. ideas. and opinions so important for tomorrows world. I have previously spoken of his many accomplishments and will not repeat them. but there are some strides I want to mention today. I want to speak especially about those accomplishments concerning his foreign exchange programs. Starting in the early 1970s. Troy State cultivated an exchange with the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge by offering British students a 1year scholarship to enroll Troy State. A summer scholarship is awarded to a male and female American student to attend Jesus College of Oxford University. Awarded to a student with solid academics and involvement in school activities. this scholarship has another important objective. for priority is given to the student who would not otherwise be able to go abroad. Ralph Adams leadership and fresh ideas not only increased the opportunities for his students but helped strengthen ties between these two great nations for generations to come. His aim has been to instill his students with a thirst for more knowledge by giving them a chance to broaden their horizons and establish a thorough base for further learning. I congratulate Dr. Ralph Adams. for the strides he has made in the education of the leaders. entrepreneurs. workers. and educators of future years. Thank you. Mr. President.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. let me give another summary of what the HelmsShelby amendment does and what it does not do. I want to underline and emphasize as greatly as I can. that it is time to do something for America. First. we need a legal immigration policy that serves America and encourage skilled people to come to our country. If you want to do something for America. you should vote for the HelmsShelby amendment. The HelmsShelby amendment increases business visas by the 37.200 without increasing the cap. The skilledbased visas now account for only 10 percent of all visas. I am sure every Senator is hearing pleas for more skillbased immigrants from business and industry in his or her State. Second. the HelmsShelby amendment gives points for English language ability in the point system. Third. the HelmsShelby amendment does notdoes notreduce the number of fifth preference visas during the first 3 years. After the third year. the number is reduced by 20.000. but this will leave almost 45.000. which is twice as much as provided In last years KennedySimpson bill. Furthermore. the Senate voted in 1982 to eliminate this fifth preference completely. In 1988. last year. the Senate voted by 88 to 4 to limit the number of fifth preference visas to 22.000. The HelmsShelby amendment now pending is more generous than both of those bills. So as Senator SIMPSON said. there is nothing mean spirited about the American people. and there is nothing mean spirited about efforts to try to come up with immigration legislation that will be beneficial to America. I close as I began. Lyndon Johnson was exactly right when he said that our immigration policy should be based on what is best for America. I submit. Mr. President. that the pending HelmsShelby amendment is better for America than the underlying bill. I yield the floor. I reserve what little time I may have iemaining.",

We do not need sweeping changes in immigration policy because one person abuses it in New York. I do not know anything about the case that he cited but there are other ways of dealing with that. But if you take a look at who is winning national merit scholarships. who the young people are who are coming up at the very top of their class frequently these days. frequently it is Asian young people. people who were brought in under family preference. and people who would be excluded frequently if you had that English language preference. I hope my colleagues will join Senator KENNEDY and Senator SIMON in voting against the Helms amendment.",

I want to make it clear that this amendment does not reduce the national level of 600.000 contained in the KennedySimpson bill. The HelmsShelby amendment would increase immigration in the independent category and would hold the overall level of family based immigration levels at current levels. The HelmsShelby amendment would increase the present third and sixth preferences in excess of 35.000. I strongly believe that one of the objectives of our immigration policy should be to increase the number of immigrants who would come into this country because of greater skills. This Is in our national interest. The HelmsShelby amendment would also retain the points for English language that were included in the point system in the original version of the bill. I also strongly believe that this is In our national interest. This is not a perfect amendment. but I submit that it does provide a more reasoned and superior balance than that contained in the KennedySimpson bill.

That is 20.000 for higher skills but he reduces the selected immigrants which is the point system which are the more highly skilled by 14.000. So with this marvelous presentation about what is good and what is not good is basically moving some numbers around with the requirement that the Senate consider immigration policy 3 years from now. and penalizing those families which want to be reunified. We all understand the long lines that exist In terms of certain countries. We are not able to address that as completely as some of us would like. But nonetheless. Mr. President. I believe that our proposal is a significant improvement over the one that is being offered by the Senator from North Carolina. And I hope at the appropriate time that it would be rejected.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing. along with Representatives TALLON. JOHNSON of South Dakota. DORGAN of North Dakota. GRANDY. STALLINGS. and TAUKE. the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Credit Act of 1990 to increase Farmers Home Administration [FmHAJ farmer program borrower assistance to beginning farmers. This legislation will: define a new category of FmHAeligible beginning farmers and ranchers. create a marketplacement mechanism for targeting assistance to eligible borrowers. leverage private farm ownership lending through a new FmHA down payment loan. limit total Government assistance to beginning farmers. and earmark funds for the beginning farmer programs. Getting started in farming today is a difficult task. and young farmers are becoming few and far between. During the 1980s. financial conditions slowed entry into farming and forced many younger farmers and ranchers to leave agriculture. The USDAs Economic Research Service estimates that as a result of farm financial difficulties. nearly half of all farm assets are owned by farmers who will be likely to retire in the next 10 years. In my own State of Minnesota. the average age of farmers is nearly 60 years. Traditionally. the Farmer Home Administration has provided credit assistance to beginning farmers and has helped to establish thousands of successful commercial farms and ranches. Recently. however. the FmHA has drifted away from its basic mission of providing modest and temporary credit assistance to beginning familysized farms. During the difficult times of the 1980s. the FmHA used most of its resources to deal with the problems of previous agency and commercial borrowers. but largely ignored the credit needs of beginning farmers. I believe that the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Credit Act would address these shortcomings in FmHA borrowing and would be an excellent addition to the 1990 farm bill. This legislation would create new opportunities for our young and aspiring farmers and help to maintain the American tradition of independent family farms. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4857 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.",

Many of the programs Technician Black started were adapted both statewide and nationally. Technician Blacks outstanding qualities are reflected by his strong feelings for his family. He and his wife Betty have been married for 40 years. They have four children and eight grandchildren. He has a proud family. Colleagues have called Technician Black a model officer. and Captain ONeill of the district 4 police station said. \"I wish I had a whole station full of men like Delbert Black.\" Upon the retirement of Delbert Black I would like to ask my colleagues in joining me in congratulating Technician Black and thanking him for 30 years of dedicated service to the city of Denver above and beyond the call of duty.@",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 635. the Hydroelectric Fairness Act of 1989. This legislation rectifies an unjustice against the more than 300 hydrolectric projects built before 1935 that are at risk from claim jumping. In my State alone. there are potentially two dozen projects at risk. The Federal Power Act of 1935. modified the hyroelectric licensing system by requiring that only Hydroelectric projects built after 1935 need obtain a license. Projects built before 1935 and located along nonnavigable rivers were grandfathered from Federal Jurisdiction and the need to obtain a license as long as no new construction took place on the project. I have heard from various project owners in my State who now find themselves in danger of losing ownership to third parties who have filed for licenses under the pretext of new construction. In many cases. this new construction is a small addition to the project such as increasing the height of a dam. If licenses were granted to these third parties. original project owners would lose their ownership of the facility. To a utility like Orange & Rockland. which serves thousands of residential and commercial customers in the New York area. losing ownership of one of their hydroelectric projects to a claim jumper would cost them $50 million over a 10year period to buy back their property from the claim jumper. This scenerio does not bode well for Orange & Rocklands customers who would foot the bill in the form of higher electric rates. It was certainly not the intent of Congress to allow this kind of claim jumping to occur. Enactment of this legislation would prohibit the issuance of licenses to pre1935 projects other than to the owners of the projects. This bill is urgently needed to project the hundreds of projects at risk from claim jumpers and would additionally protect ratepayers from higher electric rates by insuring that ownership is not passed along to third parties. I urge Members. whether or not they have affected projects in their States. to cosponsor this legislation.* (NOTE.-The following orders were entered earlier and appear at this point in the RECORD by unanimous consent:)",

This years survey. the 25th I have conducted. received a tremendous response. Approximately 12.000 people answered the survey. which asked 13 yes/no questions and also asked each individual to list the activities of the Federal Government which should receive an increase or a reduction in funding. At this time. Mr. Speaker. I would like to share the responses of my constituents in the 15th Congressional District of Michigan with my colleagues.

I asked them whether they would be willing to pay $100 a year more in Federal taxes to address the problems of the homeless.

I also asked whether my constituents support establishment of a National Housing Trust to provide $2 billion a year in subsidized lowinterestrate mortgages to help renters buy their first home. Fiftythree percent said Congress should enact such an initiative. The surveys two questions relating to foreign trade provoked onesided responses. Seventynine percent favor extending the Presidents authority to negotiate voluntary restraint agreements [VRAs] with foreign steel producers for another 5 years.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we have seen a triumph of the human spirit in Poland this week. The Polish people in their struggle for basic rights and democracy have dealt an oppressive Communist regime a startling blow. Not only have they forced a multicandidate election. but they have sent a resounding message to the world by overwhelmingly electing Solidarity candidates. I believe that Lech Walesa and Solidarity deserve praise for bringing about the elections. It is a fundamental step in the journey toward freedom. Any time people are given the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of a candidate or government. the ideals of democracy are reaffirmed and strengthened. Solidaritys success is so overwhelming that the Communist Party is suggesting that Solidarity join it in a governing coalition. While unprecedented in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity is justly wary of the Communist Partys sincerity in relinquishing some of its power so easily. Although the elections were the first \"free\" elections in Poland since World War II. the Communist Party was guaranteed control of the Parliament and the remainder of the government. Nevertheless. this is another step toward a freer and more democratic Poland. As events in Poland continue to unfold. I believe its appropriate to remember two points made by Abraham Lincoln that are especially relevant today. First. Lincoln said that the ballot is stronger than the bullet. and second. that no man is good enough to govern another person without the others consent. I encourage my colleagues to use the talents and energy that have made this House \"the fundamental institution of democracy\" to counsel. encourage. and support those who aspire to bring freedom to Poland.",

Todays police officers are asked to protect our children from drugs and battle crime related to drugs. Despite these differences. the Madison police of yesterday and today still perform the same basic functionsto protect our families and homes. answering the publics calls for help and properly enforcing the law. Every day for the past 100 years the Madison police officers have put their lives on the line to protect their community. And their accomplishments as policemen are a testament to their commitment. They should be proud of what they and over half a million men and women who devote themselves to law enforcement have chosen to do with their lives. They are a special group of American heroes. an elite corps who deserve the thanks and support of us all.

The service is funded through Federal community block grants but relies heavily on a core of over 120 volunteer physicians. dentists. nurses. and community servants. It provides health and healthrelated screening and referral to lowincome Individuals and families. The 60percent of all clients who cannot be treated in the services office are referred to a physician or dentist and assisted in making necessary appointments. The director of the Service also performs followup treatment that may be required. The Health Referral Service is based on the belief that a healthy community is one which can take care of its own. The Service maintains that reaching the goal of a healthy community which can meet the health care needs of lowincome families requires the active participation not only of volunteers but also of local leaders. churches. and philanthropic organizations. Accordingly. the Health Referral Service works with religious and philanthropic groups to help offset the costs of prescription medications and medical appliances. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the Health Referral Service and its many volunteers on the occasion of their 10year anniversary.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today we consider the Tourism Policy and Export Promotion Act. I am delighted to be an original cosponsor of the measure. The tourism industry is important nationwide. but it is especially important In Alaska. It is our third largest Industry and has created some 20.000 jobs. Last year Alaska had more visitors than we have people with nearly 800.000 visitors touring our State. Together. they spent half a billion dollars in Alaska. That Is onequarter of our entire State budget. This bill will go a long way in promoting tourism in this country. particularly In rural areas like Alaska. It establishes a Rural Tourism Development Foundation to develop and implement programs and projects to attract foreign visitors to remote areas. The foundation would help promote our national parks. national forests. and national recreation areas. This function is critical In a State like Alaska where we have 70 percent of the Nations park lands. a quarter of our national forests. and onethird of our public lands under the stewardship of the Bureau of Land Management. This legislation also encourages development of the tourism industry in rural communities which have been severely affected by the decline of mining activities. The National Park Service has effectively shut down mining in Alaskas national parks. Many are converting their mining camps into wilderness retreats for tourism. It is my hope that those miners can take advantage of this program to help them make the transition from a mining to a tourism based economy. Finally. the bill includes a provision that Senator HOLLINGS and I added in committee. It provides $10 million to promote tourism in States that have been struck by disasters. South Carolina Is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Hugo. And Alaskans are trying to recuperate from the effects of the Exxon Valdez oilspill. This money will help our States let visitors know that South Carolina and Alaska are still great vacation destinations. I thank Senator HOLLINGS for his leadership on this issue and want to express my appreciation to Senator DANFORTH for supporting our amendment. I also want to express my gratitude to Senator ROCKEFELLER for all his hard work in drafting the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Tourism Policy and Export Promotion Act of 1990. a bill to help the United States capture its share of the International tourism market. At this time. the United States lags behind In this fast growing and lucrative economic market. While Western Europe attracts between half and twothirds of all world tourism earnings. the United States attracts only about 10 percent. or $43 billion. In spite of our poor showing. at $43 billion. tourism by foreign visitors generated our Nations largest export revenue earnings last year. followed by agriculture. chemicals. and motor vehicles. In fact. in 1989. the U.S. tourism industry achieved its first international trade surplus of $1.2 billion. Enactment of S. 1791 would help us hang on to that longawaited tourism trade surplus. Specifically. S. 1791 directs the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration to increase and sustain our export earnings by focusing our promotional activities on countries with the greatest potential for increasing our market share. Another important provision in S. 1791 creates a Rural Tourism Development Foundation to help the USTTA spread the benefits of foreign tourism to every part of the U.S.A. In 1987. the most recent year for which statistics are available. foreign visitors spent over $107 million in Missouri. Missouri has a firstrate product to offerour State is rich in terms of history and cultural heritage. scenic beauty and recreational opportunities. events ranging from firstrate major league baseball to world renowned symphony orchestras. experiencing life in both big cities and small towns. We are telling the world about the Show Me State through USTTAs overseas marketing campaign involving Missouri and other States in Americas Heartland. With the help of the Rural Tourism Development Foundation. Missouriand other States that offer foreign tourists a unique chance to get into the countrycan do even more. Finally. I am proud to recognize the vital role that a fine Missourian has played in bringing S. 1791 to a vote in the Senate. Peter Herschend. who serves on the Senate Commerce Committees Travel and Tourism Industry Advisory Council. has been a key source of inspiration and energy as we have worked to get this bill written. introduced. and approved. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1791 and help us take one more step toward its enactment.",

This was particularly true when I visited our Embassy In dark and dreary Moscow In 1959. and felt the security that our flag symbolizes. I feel that it is inappropriate to amend the Bill of Rights. the greatest document ever written by man. because of a few misguided radicals. Even if we were to amend the first amendment to protect the flag physically. those same radicals could still physically burn the very Bill of Rights that the flag symbolizes.

I agree with my dear friend and colleague from Florida. Congressman CHARLIE BENNETT. who was quoted yesterday saying \"I look with a jaundiced eye at some modern intellectuals who might not understand the feelings of a combat veteran.\" What really brought Mr. BENNETTS words home to me was a call I received this morning from Mrs. Marie ONeil of Ocala. FL. Her husband suffered in a Japanese prison camp for 3 years. He supports this amendment to prohibit flag desecration. He was forced to salute the Japanese flag for 3 years. It Is not hard to understand why he feels this way. From Valley Forge to Vietnam. In every battlefield wherever American values have been attacked. the Amedcan flag has been the shining. eternal spirit of liberty. To desecrate such a symbol is to desecrate the memory of the thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their lives to keep that banner flying intact. In Justice John Paul Stevens dissenting opinion in Texas versus Johnson. he recognized that the act of flag burning has nothing to do with \"disagreeable ideas.\" but rather involves conduct that \"diminishes the value of an important national asset.\" The act of flag burning is meant to provoke and arouse. not to reason. Flag burning is simply an act of cultural and patriotic destruction. Gregory Johnson was not prosecuted in Texas in 1984 for what he said. but for the method he chose to express himself. Justice Stevens wrote that the Government has a legitimate interest in preserving the flag. similar to the Governments interest in protecting the Lincoln Memorial from graffiti. I support a constitutional amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of the Ameican flag. I approach this task with equal reverence for the first amendment and for the flag. Immediately following the Supreme Courts decision on June 22. 1989. i introduced legislation. House Resolution 185 that expresses the sense of Congress that the Supreme Court erred in its decision.

As children. many of us started our days by saluting the flag and reciting \"The Pledge of Allegiance.\" Our flag was the inspiration for this countrys national anthem. \"The StarSpangled Banner.\" and it demands protection from that small group of individuals that fail to see this. Most Americans believe that this amendment will not threaten their first amendment rights and will not deny them freedom of speech or expression. A recent Gallup poll showed that 71 percent of Americans would support such an amendment to protect the flag. Three former Supreme Court Justicessome of whom felt strongly about individual rightshave argued that burning a flag is an act. not speech. and that an act of flag burning is not entitled to the pervasive protection that is given to speech alone. This body has tried every other recourse in dealing with this matter. and our efforts have been in vain. Since last years Supreme Court decision of the Texas versus Johnson case. there have been more than 1.000 flag burnings across the country. We cannot tolerate this slap in the face. My conscience demands that I vote to prohibit it. Today. I am more firmly convinced than ever that a constitutional amendment is the only answerthe only way to prevent further desecration of our most revered national treasure. I urge my colleagues to join me and vote for House Joint Resolution 350.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. some have said that this debate Is not about values or patriotism. I believe. however. that it clearly Is. The question for us today Is what are our values. how are we to be patriotic. what serves the interest of the values represented by the flag. the symbol of our democratic system? The value at stake is freedom. Not freedom to do that which the majority approvesfor that can be done In many societiesbut the right to do that which the overwhelming majority of us find to be despicable and mindless conduct. It was that freedom that our founders enshrined In our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It is that freedom that has made this great Nation unique and which has led so many to defend It and die for it. And patriotism: What is patriotism? Is it not the courage and commitment to stand for the principles and protections which have moved the world toward democracy and freedom? Is that not the essence of what America means to the world? To stand for those principles which are the essence of the United States of America even in the face of wellmotivated passions. it seems to me. is patriotism. We have amended our Constitution only 16 times since the Bill of Rights insured our liberties. This amendment need not be added to respond to some few demented souls who can attack a flag. but who pose no threat to the overwhelming love and honor accorded the values of the country for which that flag stands. rla conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I believe the interest of the flag is served by supporting the freedom and guarantees for which it stands. I urge a no vote on this perhaps wellmeaning but misguided effort to amend our Constitution. which. I suggest. is threatened most by those who would misuse its symbols and subvert its values.",

These bright young people came to Washington for the finals of the National Bicentennial Competition on the Constitution and Bill of Rights. As a lawyer. it is exciting to know that upper elementary. middle and high school students are studying a specially designed 6week course about the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The preservation of our freedom and our Nation depends upon our young people. tomorrows leaders. We have much to gain from educating them at any early age about the Constitution. the Congress. and citizenship. Phil Harmeson and Karen Montgomery did an excellent job coordinating this fine program in North Dakota. The team from New England which won the State competition is unusual in that it has several international students. Led by instructor John Bachmeier. I would like to congratulate these students for their hard work in reaching the national finals and competing against top students from much larger schools. The class consists of Gary Benz. Roberto Chami. Cecilia Dobitz. John Ehlis. Ti Huang. Ilene Krebs. Mikael Merissa. Stacey Roller. Aaron Tewolde. Benyan Tewolde. Jon Wert. and Metmeku Yohannes. The National Bicentennial Competition is making a difference among the May 4 . 1989 more than 1 million students who have participated in this educational program. Students in classrooms across the Nation. ranging from New England. ND. to New York. NY. are debating the issues that concerned the Founding Fathers and demonstrating how the Constitutions basic principles apply to them today. I commend everyone involved in this exciting program that is increasing the constitutional literacy of our young citizens.",

I have become accustomed to raised eyebrows and curious looks when I talk about my enthusiasm for President Hoover. but then people are \"often surprised to discover that his 4 years in the White House were but a footnote to half a century of public service. during which the Great Humanitarian rescued more people from starvation than all the tyrants of this bloodsoaked century together could murder.\" Those words belong to Richard Norton Smith. the director of the Herbert Hoover Library and the man responsible for breathing new life into the Presidents memory. Since he left Washington for West Branch several years ago. Mr. Smith has made history come alive through a wide variety of projects and programs. After doubling attendance at the Library in just 1 year with a wonderful exhibition of more than 300 pieces of Presidential memorabilia entitled \"30 Men.\" he has now set his sights on a joint conference this fall with the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum to discuss the history and utility of former Presidents. Mr. President. an essay by Mr. Smith entitled \"How the Hoover Library Overcame a MidLife Crisis\" not only describes the exciting work going on at the Herbert Hoover Library but also makes a compelling case for the energetic study of our precious history. I applaud the efforts of Mr. Smith and his talented staff. and ask unanimous consent that the essay be included in the RECORD.",

I searched almost in vain. as I listened to it. for any element in it with which I could cogently disagree. He and the distinguised chairman of the committee have done what they had to do. under the circumstances in which they found themselves. clearly. not the circumstances of free agents. I also. as the Senator from New Mexico knows very well. share with him the view. cynical though it may be. that if we were to increase taxes on the American people by $10. $20. $30 billion a year. most of the Congress would contrive some way or another to spend all or almost all of that amount of money. and that it would not substantially effect our budget deficit. Nonetheless. one is still left with the question which was implied in my original remarks and a question for which I would like the answer of the Senator from New Mexico. He pointed out that we could do better only if we locked arms. and by that \"we\" he meant the President and the administration on one side. and both Democratic and Republican leadership of the House and the Senate on the other side. some of the very difficult choices which are inherent in meeting this problem of the budget deficit. So my question is: Does the Senator from New Mexico believe that circumstances will be sufficiently different 6 months or 1 year from now. that that kind of coming together to make difficult decisions rather than a somewhat lower common denominator decision. does the Senator from New Mexico believe that those circumstances will prevail 6 months or a year from now. assuming that we pass and then implement this budget resolution?",

We also looked at the Presidents requested funding levels and raised the funding substantially above that. Function 500 deals with education. training. and social services. et cetera. which the Senator from Florida alluded to just a moment ago.

It makes it clear that the budget resolution does not prejudice one approach. be it on the tax credit side or any other approach. That is essentially what it does.

Both. if it is the will of the Senate and if we meet the budget targets. could find their way to the floor without budget objection. I have no objection to it. obviously.

Today. as the bracing winds of democracy sweep the world. the ideals of the French and American Revolutions stand as shining examples to the courageous peoples from Poland to China who yearn to breathe the vitalizing air of democracy. The resilient people of these oppressed nations are struggling for a principle that we in the west now take for granted: That government exists to serve the people. not the reverse. As freedoms march enters its third century. the commemoration of these historic events takes on even greater significance. Far from seeming stale or outdated. the principles of democracy. free expression and the rule of law are as fresh in 1989 as the day they flowed from the pens of men like Thomas Jefferson. Tom Paine. and the French patriots. Mr. Speaker. in this year of bicentennial celebration of the roots of our own constitutional freedoms. it is altogether fitting and proper that we commemorate the similar principles that inspired the French Revolution. I therefore urge my colleageus support for this resolution.",

The murder of James Chaney. Andrew Goodman. and Michael Schwerner 25 years ago is an event of historic significance. reminding us of a time in our Nations history when landmark civil rights legislation was yet to be written. They were murdered while trying to guarantee rights that are the birthright of every American. Surely the meaning of such a sacrifice is not limited to a certain time and place. but has meaning for anyone who wishes to see the triumph of justice. The United States of America. given the tragic historic legacy of racial injustice. has made undeniable progress in civil rights. Yes. we have much to be proud ofif little to be complacent about. And whatever we have achieved. whatever measure of justice has been gained during the past 25 years. we owe to many Americans. many of whose names are lost to history. many who endured patiently. many who fought bravely. many who merely helped while others carried the banner. But we do know the names ol Chaney. Goodman. and Schwernerand they have come to symbolize the struggle in which so many nameless. yet heroic. figures played a part. Today. all over the world. in China. in Poland. in Central America. in the Soviet Union. other young men and women are bravely carrying a similar banner. In remembering Chaney.

I knew CLAUDE PEPPER as a friend. most of all. because he was always very gracious to me and very supportive of my career. I met him at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. and we talked over a number of issues at great length. He of course asked for. and I of course gave. my support for long term health care for seniors. one of the issues which perhaps best marks his service to this country. I sat beside Congressman PEPPER on the train to a meeting this year. During the entire 5hour trip. ie was constantly discussing issues. bills he wanted to sponsor. legislation he thought could improve the quality of life for all Americans. He was constantly busy. but he also shared his time with me. as I am sure he had done so many times before with new Members. and I was simply amazed at his grasp of the issues. his clearthinking approach to the future. and his unrelenting enthusiasm for the job. CLAUDE PEPPER served with distinction in both Houses of Congress. was a champion of causes that assisted those who needed it most. and he always stayed true to the ideals of principle and purpose over political safety.

Congress and the American people suffered a great loss in May with the death of the premier advocate for the elderly. Senator CLAUDE PEPPER. As we have heard many times by now. Senator PEPPER introduced his first seniorcitizen legislation. a bill to exempt those over 65 from having to obtain a fishing license. in 1929 while he was a member of the Florida State Legislature. That humble beginning can only hint at the greatness to come of a life devoted wholly to serving his fellow man striving to correct the injustices forced upon so many of this countrys citizens. From his passionate defense of FDRs New Deal to his stillunrealized goal of Federal financing of longterm health care. Senator PEPPER was time and again on the cutting edge of domestic policy. Mr. Speaker. I had the opportunity of knowing Senator PEPPER for over 30 years. The year I graduated from high school was the year that he left the other body. the U.S. Senate. and I followed his career very closely here in the House of Representatives. In my office in the Longworth Building. other than the pictures of my immediate family. I have two pictures of men whom I sat beside at times. One was George C. Marshall. who was the architect and author of the Marshall Plan. and one was CLAUDE PEPPER. and I have great respect for these two men.

Second. substantially reduce Federal timber sales in the Pacific Northwest to a level somewhat lower than that recommended by the Wilderness Society or the Audubon Society. Third. restrict log exports from private and State lands. and Fourth. assist communities to diversify their economy and help affected forest products industry employees with the transition into new areas of employment. This very detailed explanation provides another approach to the management of the Pacific Northwest national forests and I commend it to my colleagues for their consideration. Earlier this spring. the forest products industry organization in the Pacific Nnrthwest. the Northwest Forest Resource Council [NFRC]. outlined its program for managing the national forests of the Pacific Northwest. The NFRC provided us with a fivepoint plan which would maintain a stable Forest Service timber sale program over the next 5 years. The NFRC plan offers the following: First. maintain an interim timber sale level equivalent to the average harvest over the past 3 years. Second. require a complete inventory of northern spotted owls and their habitat. and the preparation of an economic analysis of the impact of a potential listing of the spotted owl under the Endangered Species Act. while deferring a listing decision for 5 years until the inventory and other research are complete. Third. require the Forest Service to review all present land setasides to determine which could be modified to offset the adverse impacts of the designation of critical habitat. Fourth. place all Federal timber receipts. after the county share. into an intensive timber management fund to develop increased yields per acre on the national forest. and Fifth. require the Forest Service to examine all environmental effects. including international. of reducing Federal timber supply in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPAl.",

Concerts have been performed at various Cape May locations. The idea of the festival was developed in 1988 by residents interested in promoting their historic town as a cultural location. Their purpose was to increase the national yearround visibility of Cape May as a cultural environment. as well as encouraging increased tourism. The New York Chamber Ensemble. which performs original concerts in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center has been featured in this seasons festival. The ensemble is a collaboration of two of Americas finest chamber music groups. the Chester String Quartet and the Hexagon Piano and Wind Sextet. Also featured in the festival is the Composers of Guild of New Jersey. The guild is among the most prominent American groups fostering the acceptance of new music by American composers. The festival has enhanced the cultural quality of life in southern New Jersey and promoted the charm of this historic Victorian town.

Mr. Mowbray. who was subpoenaed to testify by the committee after he refused to appear voluntarily. said he cannot remember who at the federal thrift regulatory agency in Washington placed the telephone call giving the order.

This past Saturday we got yet another dose of reality and the need to protect ourselves from the policies of the government of the District of Columbia and its Department of Corrections. Seven years ago. Donald Shelton was convicted of armed robbery and drug possession in the District of Columbia and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. In December. simply because the calendar said he was eligible for parole consideration. he was transferred to a community halfway house in the city. Despite the fact he was denied parole for cause in March of this year. he remained at the halfway house. This past Friday. 7 years after being sentenced to 40 years in Jail. and 3 months after being denied parole. this violent criminal was released on a weekend furlough to walk the streets. At 1 oclock Saturday. Shelton. whom the District of Columbia considered not to be a threat to the community. walked into a Bethesda jewelry store brandishing a .38 revolver. In what I view to be an act of selfdefense of life and property. the storeowner shot and killed both Shelton and his accomplice. Now. the ultimate irony Is that Maryland is preferring charges against the storeowner. If the District would go after its criminals with the same fervor that Maryland shows in going after victims. then this entire metropolitan area would be a much safer place in which to live. If an individual Is sentenced to 40 years In prison. has just been denied parole. most intelligent and law abidIng citizens in this Nation would naturally expect that that person would have been behind barsnot walking the streets of the Nations Capital with a .38 revolver.

If one supports the Bill of Rights. they will question your patriotism. and. now. If you question their leadership on the S&L cleanup. they question your integrity. Madam Speaker. it is about time the White House stopped frantically lashing out at individuals and started talking about solutions. Today the administration will propose cutting entitlements like Social Security to pay for the burgeoning S&L mess. As the President knows. paying for the S&L mess from entitlements like Social Security. because of the S&L crisis. will cost him far more politically than the gain by ad hominem attacks. It is about time the White House stopped the name calling. rolled up its sleeves and started working on a solution.",

But the problem with this target Is that it is firmly pinned on George Bushs own back. because during that decade it was George Bush who headed the task force on financial services deregulation. while the S&L industry headed into insolvency. He watched while Treasury Secretary Regan pushed for deregulation at any cost. while James Baker. as Treasury Secretary. dragged his feet for 5 years without offering a solution. while David Stockman. Director of OMB. blocked the hiring of badly needed S&L examiners. Indeed. now we learn that it was that administration that asked that the Silverado S&L be kept open at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayers while George Bushs election stayed on track. All this from a President who now fails to prosecute those who stole the savings of the American people.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday the House debated the Labor. Education. and Health and Human Services appropriations bill and voted to again decrease the Federal commitment for grant programs for university students. Ten years ago. grants comprised the majority of student aid in this country. Today. loans comprise the largest portion of the student aid package. Students are graduating with enormous debts which may Influence their career and lifetime decisions. In the last decade. tuition costs have gone up 82.7 percent at public universities and 118 percent at private universities. A student entering college can expect to pay an average of more than $20.000 at a public institution and more than $50.000 at a private university over 4 years. Currently. university cost are rising at approximately 8 percent a year. Mr. Speaker. with Federal student aid programs becoming Increasingly focused on lowincome students. middleincome families find themselves unable to afford the rising college tuition costs and they are turning to banks to secure private loans. For these reasons I have introduced the Middle Income Family Higher Education SavIngs Act of 1989. This legislation will provide middleincome families with the means to more easily save for their childrens education. Under my proposal. parents would be allowed to contribute up to $1.000 a year to a childs education trust account. The contributions themselves would be deductible from taxable Income. as would the accrued interest. as long as the funds are used to pay for undergraduate tuition. If a family started an account at the birth of a child. and contributed $1.000 per year for 18 years. at 8 percent interest. this account would accrue to $37.450. According to projections by the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress. this would meet 71 percent of the costs of a public 4year college. or 35 percent of the cost of a private 4year college. Mr. Speaker. this program would help to prevent a university education from again becoming a privilege for only a few wealthy citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this Important legislation.",

As a career member of the Alabama National Guard. I believe we need to extend this priviledge to these men who have so dutifully served our Nation for more than 20 years. This change in benefits was one of the recommendations included in the Sixth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation. According to the document. the change would result in 365 more burials per year. The review further states that this change is estimated to cost $123.000 per year. I believe this small change in regulations will give dedicated servicemen a burial in one of our national treasures. the National Cemetery System. In a time when National Guard and Reservists are being asked to contribute more toward our Nations defense. we should extend the same benefits as those afforded to fulltime military personnel.

I have great respect for my colleagues on the bipartisan Task Force on Ethics who have worked extremely hard In developing this package. I strongly support the ethics reforms contained In this measure. but I cannot support the provision which calls for an Increase in pay for Members of Congress. I would prefer to see the ethics provisions in this measure considered separately from the pay raise. Most of us agree that we need to movu forward with comprehensive ethics reform so Government officials understand clearly the rules that govern their official actions. As public officials we must constantly earn the trust of the people we represent. and the rules that govern our actions must ensure that we are beyond reproach. Many of the provisions in the measure we are voting on move us closer to this objective. I strongly support the ban on honoraria. I do not accept honoraria and I agree that we should move quickly in eliminating this practice. The limits on outside income. as well as limits on the acceptance of gifts to House and Senate Members also move us forward. Additionally. the repeal of the grandfather clause that currently allows Members elected before 1980 to convert campaign funds to personal use when they leave Congress is another step in thn right direction. Other provisions which tighten the requirements on financial disclosures. and privately paid travel also deserve to be considered by this House. Despite my strong commitment to ethics reform. I am against combining these much needed reforms with an increase in pay for Members of Congress. These issues can. and should be considered separately. Mr. Speaker.

Our generation was fortunate enough to see our national space program ascend from the drawing board to the stars. As our scientists and engineers raced to surpass our rivals as well as our limitations. we cheered them and we identified with them in much the same way we do with our Olympic athletes. Our space program has attracted the attention of many young men and women to the realm of science and technology. and has made America the technological leader it is today. However. recent years have been witness to a decline in interest in these fields and a growing distance between students and science. At the same time. we have watched the ascent of many new technological powers whose scientific prowess rivals our own. even as the world of technology is growing at an unimaginable rate. Those of us in Congress have an obligation to stimulate a technological renaissance for America. If this is to occur. it must start with our children. Perhaps the greatest gift we can give them is to fire them with the same determination that our forefathers gave us. This is the goal of the Education and Space Act. and I can think of no better means to achieve it. Specificially.

Senator CRANSTON is introducing companion legislation in the Senate to promote this same deserving cause. To illustrate the scope of the pet overpopulation problem. I would like to share some statistics with you: One female dog and her offspring can be the source of 67.000 puppies in just 6 years. one female cat and her offspring can be the source of 420.000 cats in only 7 years. there are 70.000 dogs and cats born in the United States every day. compared to 10.000 humans. 12 million dogs and cats are brought to animal shelters each year. 7.5 million must be destroyed because there are not enough homes for them. and nationwide. animal control and animal shelter programs cost communities almost $800 million each year. When I was in the New Jersey Assembly. I sponsored legislation that established a program to assist lowincome individuals by subsidizing the cost of spaying or neutering their pets. Since the enactment of my 1983 bill. the New Jersey program has benefited thousands of pet owners. Because the program is funded entirely by license fees. there is no cost to the general public. By passing a resolution declaring April 1990 as \"National PreventaLitter Month.\" Congress can play a major role in the campaign to reduce pet overpopulation. At a time of nationwide budget concerns. the success of this campaign will also help local governments address this crisis. thus making funds available for other worthwhile purposes.",

The 26 weeks of benefits piovided by regular State unemployment compensation programs helps families get through a spell of unemployment with their lives and dignity intact. However. since the origiral enactment of the unemployment insurance system. the national economy has experienced several recessionseight since World War II. The increase in the number of unemployed workers exhausting their unemployment benefits during these recessions prompted the Congress to authorize various temporary programs to supplement regular benefits. For many years these temporary programs were the only method of extending unemployment benefits beyond 26 weeks. Then in 1970. Congress enacted the Extended Unemployment Compensation Act which provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits for States with high unemployment rates. Extended benefits are equal to a workers regular State benefits and are paid half by the Federal Government and half by the State. The Extended Benefit Program is designed to provide additional weeks to those areas where tough times have made it difficult or impossible to find a job within the normal 6 months of benefits. Today. although 10 States have unemployment rates more than 2 points higher than the national average unemployment rateonly 1 is eligible for the Extended Benefit Program. This failure of the Extonded Benefit Program to meet its design goal has been evident for several years. In 1987. only two States were eligible. and none during all of 1988. This would be cause for celebration. if the reason",

Trees have been silent witnesse. to the great events of history and they stand today as living memorials to these events. Building on this concept the Selinsgrove Shade Tree Commission designed an outdoor museum in which trees of historical prominence will be acknowledged. The Living Heritage Tree Museum is the first of its kind on the eastern seaboard. On April 28. 1989. the Solinsgrove Shade Tree Commission. in the true spirit of Arbor Day. planted a grove of trees with historical roots. The Arbor Day plantings included. or will include in the future. seedlings from the JoanofArc Willow Tree of Domremy Haute Marne. France. the Johnny Appleseed Apple Tree of Lima. OH. the Hippocratic Oath Plane Tree from the Island of Cose. Greece. the Sir Isaac Newton Apple Tree of Lincolnshire. England. the Gifford Pinchot Sycamore from Connecticut. and. a Shakespeare Mulberry from William Shakespeares birthplace. For this fine work Selinsgrove has been recognized as \"Tree City USA\" by the National Arbor Day Foundation. I commend the innovative efforts of the Selinsgrove community to preserve and promote the rich history of the Western World. I also challenge the members of the Selinsgrove Area Middle School Band who participated in the dedication of the Livin1g Heritage Tree Museum in 1989 to return to this site on Arbor Day in 2014 and reflect on the sense of community pride that was felt.",

Anne joined VISTA and served a year of volunteer service as an attorney with Legal Action. This was Annes second term with VISTA. Her first was with Milwaukees Independent Learning Center. Annes dedicated belief that our legal system must provide equal justice for all people led to a career spanning 14 years. She worked her way from a staff attorneys position to become the programs associate director. And throughout these years. Anne never flinched at taking on the tough issues. When Milwaukees homeless population was unable to receive general assistance benefits. Anne was there to fight for them. When the children of undocumented migrant workers were denied benefits. Anne stood by the children and took the case to court. When welfare recipients in Milwaukee County were not properly notified of reductions in their benefits. Anne was there to protect their rights. Time and time again. Anne DeLeo has had to shake the system up for the benefits of poor people. Her successes have angered bureaucrats and frustrated elected officials. She surely will not be elected to the Milwaukee County Corporation Counsels Hall of Fame. However. Anne Lucia DeLeo will be remembered by all of us who admired her tenacity and characterand by all who benefitted from her compassion and expertise as a woman eager to make the good fight. and who always valued equal justice above profit. Please join me in wishing Anne only the best in her future endeavors.",

Tom has held a special place in the International Union of United Automobile. Aerospace. and Agricultural Implement Workers of America since 1956. providing his expertise and valuable services for over 30 years. Toms activism on behalf of others is also evident in his involvement as a member of the board of directors of the NortheastMidwest Institute. as a member of the board of directors of the Blue Cross Hospital Corp.. of western New York. and as a member of the board of directors of the United Way. Tom also keeps his commitment to education and the UAW strong by acting as an instructor at both the Cornell University labor extension service and the UAW summer education institutes. I take pride in recognizing the many accomplishments of this fine individual. Toms involvement with the UAW resulted in his election to the UAW International Executive Board as director of region 9 at the UAWs 27th Constitutional Convention in May 1983. Toms election to this position is further evidence of his years of hard work and leadership skills. Thomas Natchuras is indeed a man who deserves our respect and appreciation.

If you havent heard of him. its because he did not seek the national fame that may have come in the college or professional ranks and instead dedicated his life to coaching in high school. He spent his entire career at just two schools in Macon13 years at BallardHudson Junior High and 19 years at Southwest Senior High. At any level. his record would be phenomenal. Coach Richardsons teams have won a total of 581 games and lost just 98. including 5 straight junior high championships. 1 senior high national championship. 6 senior high State championships. and 10 senior high regional championships. He has twice been named State junior high coach of the year and seven times State senior high school coach of the year. If that isnt enough. he has also captured a State championship in track and has been Georgia high school track coach of the year. During 19 years at Southwest High. 87 of his players have received college basketball scholarships and 90 percent of those players started as freshmen. Twelve have been high school allAmerican and four have been drafted by professional teams. including Norm Nixon and Jeff Malone. who is currently with the Washington Bullets. Among fellow coaches. he is. in fact. a nationally prominent figure. He has been selected as coach for the annual Dapper Dan Classic for high school allAmerican players and is director of the annual Nike basketball camp at Princeton University. where the top high school basketball talent is invited for instruction in social and academic skills. as well as in basketball. Coach Richardson is a Iruly remarkable coach and leader of young people. He is also a gentleman in every sense of the word. I know his wife. Jacquelyn. and four children are very proud of him. Macon and all of Georgia are proud of him. too. The community celebrated \"Don Richardson Appreciation Day\" on Sunday. May 21. This event has given us an opportunity to express the pride we have in Coach Richardson and all that he has accomplished for the young people in Macon and across the country.",

I have addressed the House previously on Mr. Beldues program and wish to update my colleagues on what is now a State program in New York and is in the process of becoming a national success. Briefly. the FRY Program offers education and counseling to children about the dangers of playing with fire. The project also offers these services to the families of children who become involved in these activities. It was started after Mr. Beldue noticed a trend of recidivism among several youth offenders. Typically. a FRY investigator will visit the scene of a fire that appears to have been started by a child or children. The investigator will later interview the child and his or her family and offer guidance to counseling services in order to prevent repeat occurrences. The program also conducts research on the causes of recidivist behavior and has published its findings. The research serves as a resource for other fire departments interested in curbing youthful fire starters. These studies are the real focus of my remarks today for the results from the second study. entitled \"Children and Fire.\" have recently been published by the Rochester FRY Program. I invite all of my colleagues to spread the word about these reports to their fire departments back home. I am making them available to all members through the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. On a personal note. I want to thank Jonathan Beldue for all of his work over the years on this project. He was forced to retire recently after injuries sustained during a FRY investigation rendered him disabled. Mr. Speaker. I know of no better tribute to Jonathan Beldue than to continue the spread of programs like the FRY project throughout the Nation. It is a worthy cause in honor of a deserving man.",

Ms. Navarro is the great. greatgranddaughter of the Texas patriot Don Jose Antonio Navarro. who was the only native born Texan signer of the 1845 Constitution of the State of Texas. and one of only two native Texans to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence. After graduation from Brackenridge High School at San Antonio. Adela. or \"Adelita.\" took some social studies courses at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and at Columbia University in New York City. She also studies history and political science at the University of Pennsylvania and real estate law courses at San Antonios Trinity University. Eternally a student and researcher. Adelas studies have taken her not only to all parts of Texas. Louisiana. Connecticut. Spain. and to the Canary Islands. but to many other locations too numerous to mention. The Texas Legislature has honored her for her historical works. including her successful efforts to obtain the historical costs of arms for the city of San Antonio and the county of Bexar. Adele Margarita Navarro is a prominent member of the Bexar County Historical Commission. and was active in the plans for the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the arrival of the Canary Islanders to settle San Antonio and to establish San Fernando Cathedral. In 1965 Adela founded the Canary Islands Descedents Society and the Texas Hispanic History Foundation. both of which were later chartered by the State of Texas. In 1973 Adela visited the Canary Islands as a special guest of the government in celebration of the 500th anniversary of the founding of the city of Las Palmas of the Gran Canarias where she received the \"Medalla de Tenerife.\" and a Citation of Honor. Also during her visit she was received by the Duchess of Bexar at her palace for dinner. St. Bernard Parish. Louisiana. proclaimed Miss Adele Navarro as an honorary citizen of New Orleans in 1978 and in 1982 the San Antonio Independence School District Board recognized Adelas contributions in the field of history education. Several other groups have also honored her. During the Depression of the early 1930s. Adele worked as a casewoker in Freehold.",

Since the appropriations for 1990 have already been allocated in compliance with the summit agreement and revising these programs and appropriations would take a lot of time. identifying the additional new revenues for this purpose or temporarily using some unobligated balances would be much faster. Mr. Speaker. enough valuable time has been lost waiting for the administrations drug program report. instead of moving ahead with the fund. and so I urge the President to Join the Congress in a goodfaith effort to provide these funds.",

During the past year. Amtrak earned a record $1.1 billion in revenue. an 81percent increase since fiscal year 1981. At the same time. Amtraks dependence on Federal assistance has decreased from $896 million in fiscal year 1981 to $584 million in fiscal year 1989. In this period. Federal capital funding for Amtrak has been reduced by 91 percent. If other recipients of Federal funding could reduce their subsidy needs to the same extent as Amtrak. the United States would not now face a deficit. Now. however. Amtrak is badly in need of capital funding to replace the rolling stock it inherited in 1971. With this new equipment. Amtrak can meet the rapidly increasing demand of new ridership. increase frequencies. and start profitable new services.

For the past 20 years the women of Romania were subjected to the diabolical whims of a regime that treated them as little more than brood animals. Childbearing for Romanian women was not a matter of personal desire or choice. Rather. giving birth became a government mandate with a quota system. As reported. contraceptive aids uere denied to women under the age of 45 unless they had met the fivechild quota. Women desperate to avoid exposing another child to malnutrition. poverty. and poor health care turned to dangerous and illegal methods of birth control. Maternal deaths soared. with 86 percent of the fatalities attributed to illegal abortions. Since the overthrow of the Ceausescu government. policies affecting women and family planning have changed. unfortunately. the reality has not. Women still do not have access to safe and reliable forms of contraception. The present medical establishment has virtually no knowledge of family planning methods and no inventory of contraceptive devices. As a consequence. abortions are being performed at a rate of nearly 100.000 a month. This amendment funds two family planning agencies. the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. The organizations would share $1.5 million to continue their efforts at training health professionals and women on family planning methods and providing them with contraceptive supplies. During the debate we have heard about other groups willing to go into Romania and provide family planning assistance. and that is encouraging. Romania needs all the help it can get. The problem is that Romania cannot wait while we decide which group does or does not pass a political litmus test. The language of tie amendment is specific that not one penny of the $1.5 million would be allowed for abortion services or involuntary sterilizations. If any of those funds are diverted for abortions. the money must be returned to the U.S. Government in full. If you want the abortions to stop. if you want to give the women of Romania the freedom to plan their lives and families. if you want to do the right thing. vote for passage of the LehmanPorter amendment.",

Mr. Chairman. this debate represents an extraordinarily progressive dialog because it makes it clear to America that both prolife and prochoice advocates in Congress favor family planning. Nonetheless. as reasonable and responsible as it is to have differences on approach as contrasted with differences of judgment as to whether to advance family planning. I am concerned that the amendment has as a principal goal the undercutting of the most effective international organizations in the field and has. as an effect. a delay in providing services for women desperately in need. Nothing would be more unfortunate than if ideological litmus test approaches to American domestic politics come to undercut American leadership on this compelling critical humanitarian issue. This amendment. while offered in good conscience. should be defeated and a message sent to the worlds poor that America cares and that freedom is a responsibility from which America will not shirk.",

This amendment is one of the strongest profamily planning. antiabortion provisions which the House has had the opportunity to vote on. The Foreign Affairs Committee endorsed a similar provision when it marked up the supplemental foreign aid authorization earlier this year. One of the first actions taken after Ceausescu was overthrown was to legalize family planning. However. contraceptive supplies are in extremely limited supply in the country. As a result. as many as 100.000 Romanian women are seeking abortions each month. because they have no birth control alternatives available. We can help to change this situation by providing support to the IPPF and the U.N. population fund. the only organizations currently prepared to provide family planning assistance in Romania. Todays debate illustrates dramatically the corners we paint ourselves into with overly restrictive legislation. Why should we even discuss sending much needed support to Romania. through the two organizations best qualified to distribute that assistance? Why are we arguing? If you are appalled that 100.000 Romanian women a month are seeking abortions. you should support this amendment. If you are in favor of using the most efficient and effective organizations available to distribute our aid. you should support this amendment. None of the funds in this amendment will be used for abortion and no funds will go to the Government of Romania. I urge you to support the Lehman amendment and oppose the Smith perfecting amendment. in order to provide urgently needed voluntary family planning and to reduce abortion in Romania.",

Under the repressive Ceausescu administration. abortion was illegal in all circumstances and the use of contraceptives was banned for women under the age of 45 who did not have at least 5 children. In his scheme to double the Romanian population by the year 2000. Ceausescu forced thousands of women to relinquish control over family size or risk their lives to obtain illegaloften unsafeabortions. Although the current government has legalized contraceptives and abortion. 3.000 Romanian women seek abortions daily because contraceptive services and training are simply not available. The organizations best equipped to provide these services are the United Nations Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. They are currently making progress in providing services to Romania. but they need our help. The LehmanPorter amendment provides funds for the United Nations Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. organizations which are known worldwide for their success in implementing family planning programs. Opponents of this amendment will ask you to support another amendment which would provide funds through U.S. aid. Surely it is more sensible to support programs which are already in place. rather than reinvent the wheel by starting totally new programs.

I feel that a desperate need for family planning assistance to Romania exists and strongly support such an effort. However. I denounce U.S. funds being awarded to organizations that support abortionboth voluntary and coerciveas a means of family planning. The two organizations to which the Lehman/Porter amendment proposes targeting funds: The UNFPA and IPPF insist on promoting abortion as a family planning option. Moreover. the UNFPA has been and continues to be an active participant in Chinas populationcontrol program. which has been widely accused of being pervasively coercive. Despite massive documentations from a variety of sources that the Chinese population officials routinely force women to undergo abortions. UNFPA officials consistently deny that the Chinese population program is coercive. Furthermore. UNFPA has been the most vocal defender of the Chinese program. It is for this reason that I oppose the Lehman/Porter amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. To accomplish the goal of effective family planning in Romania. I encourage all members to vote instead for the Smith amendment which would direct the funds in question toward organizations which the Agency for International Development has identified as able to put together a new international family planning programorganizations that do not promote abortion and coercive abortion to achieve family planning goals.",

Mr. President. on Tuesday. February 1990. I chaired a hearing in the Senate Committee on Commerce. Science. and Transportation on this critical issue. At the hearing. we heard convincing testimony that millions of pounds of United Statesmade chemicals are ending up in drug labs in Colombia. I do not question the intentions of the U.S. shippers of these chemicals. I know full well the many legitimate uses for these chemicals. However. I am concerned that some Americanmade chemicals are finding their way into the hands of drug lords in South America and then into the hands of our citizens in the deadly form of cocaine. The United States currently has laws to deal with this problem. but many other nations have not adopted statutes similar to ours. It will not do any good to stop suspicious shipments from the United States if drug lords then obtain the chemicals from Europe or elsewhere. I urge President Bush to use the findings of our hearing to raise this issue with other countries that also ship these chemicals to South America at the February drug summit. We are all aware of the brutal consequences illegal drugs have wrecked upon our society. We know it has permeated our culture from street corners to schoolyards. The afflicted are all around usin corporate boardrooms. back alleys. and baby cribs. Policymakers have always struggled between what we want to do and what we can do. There is no question. we all want to stop the deadly flow of drugs.

The Mississippi combines with five other major waterwaysthe Arkansas. Missouri. Ohio. Red. and Tennesseeto form the largest river in North America. More than 1.4 million square miles or 41 percent of the continental United States are drained by the Mississippi. carrying more than 685 million tons of sedimentary material to the Gulf annually. The silt deposited over hundreds of years by this great river laid the foundation upon which Louisiana now flourishes. The 1.5 million people in Louisiana depend on this great river for drinking water. not to mention the millions more for whom the Mississippi provides recreation and irrigation. The Mississippi River is. unfortunately. also a repository for much of the Nations waste from industrial. agricultural. municipal. and domestic operations. We need to know the existing as well as potential sources of this pollution so that the appropriate steps can be taken to improve and protect the quality of the water in the Mississippi River. Although the effects of pesticides and trace elements on the water quality of the Mississippi are already being examined by the U.S. Geological Survey. that particular study concentrates on the portion of the river south of St. Louis. That is why I am proud to cosponsor a bill introduced by my respected colleague from Minnesota.

Once considered a progressive regimein comparison to the other Communist regimes in Eastern Europetodays Yugoslav Government is a symbol of tyranny and repression. One glaring example of this repression we have seen on the front pages of our newspapersthe crisis in Kosovo. Serbia has maintained martial law in the Province of Kosovo for almost a year now. Hundreds of Albanians have been injured and arrested during rallies calling for democracy. And. since January 24 of this year. more than two dozen Albanians have been killed in Kosovo by police and security forces. Groups throughout Yugoslavia. including Croatians and Slovenians. have protested the treatment of the Albanians at the hands of Serbian authorities. Unfortunately. there seems to be no end in sight. According to press reports. earlier this week. the President of the Serbian Republic threatened to send hundreds of thousands of Serbs to take over the Province of Kosovo. Despite this wave of brutal oppression in Yugoslavia. there is cause for hope. Democratic forces are emerging as seen in the formation of democratic parties in the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia. as well as in the Province of Kosovo. And. free elections will be held in the Republic of Croatia in midApril. I firmly believe that democracy and respect for human rights form the basis for effective and lasting solutions to the current crisis in Yugoslavia. Moreover. in my view the United States must publicly support these democratic developments in Yugoslavia. as in other East European countries. And. I am sure that my colleagues would agree. Unfortunately. to date. in public appearances. at least United States policy toward Yugoslavia has not kept pace with events. This situation. however. can be corrected easily if the United States publicly and aggressively supports peaceful democratic change in Yugoslavia. A policy that supports the development of democratic political parties in Yugoslavia will go a long way toward getting things on the right track. In Yugoslavia. as in other East European countries. communism is being slowly strangled by the forces of democracy. As Americans. so fortunate to live in the country that represents the light of freedom. we need to continue to support democracy throughout the world. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

I have carefully reviewed his record and believe that Mr. Thomas is qualified for a seat on the Federal bench. Clarence Thomas rose from humble beginnings to achieve a high measure of success. He was raised in coastal Georgia by his grandfather who could barely read or write but instilled in him a strong sense of the importance of values and education. Mr. Thomas graduated from Holy Cross College and received his law degree from Yale. He began his legal career in Missouri and came to Washington as an aide to Senator JOHN DANFORTH. After a brief stint at the Department of Education as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. he was confirmed as the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. and has remained in that position since 1982. Clearly Mr. Thomas life has been a strong example of an American success story. I recognize that there has been a great deal of publicity surrounding this nomination and that some groups have expressed their opposition to Mr. Thomas nomination. Although some criticisms of Mr. Thomas record have come out. I believe he has successfully addressed each concern in his hearing. After a review of his record. I find that Mr. Thomas is clearly within the mainstream of judicial thought. Although individuals may differ as to a legal philosophy. Mr. Thomas will bring to the bench a thoughtful and scholarly record and approach. I believe that Mr. Thomas has demonstrated the necessary judicial philosophy and temperment which more than qualify him to sit on the Federal bench.

They may well be. and we are concerned about that. and it is precisely because of that. we are exerting all kinds of pressure on them. Even more revealing of Pakistans capabilities and intentions. President Reagan issued Presidential Determination No. 885 on January 15. 1988. in response to efforts by a Pakistaniborn businessman to acquire a special steel used in making uranium enrichment centrifuges. In this unclassified document. which was provided to Congress in accordance with a requirement in the Foreign Assistance Act. President Reagan formally determined: * * * that material. equipment. or technology covered by that provision was to be used by Pakistan in the manufacture of a nuclear explosive deviceI * *. Surely if Pakistan was keeping its uranium enrichment level under 5 percent. and if Pakistans Nuclear Program was entirely peaceful. there would be no grounds for such a determination. The President. however. then went on to renew full U.S. aid. without any new nuclear conditions. claiming that \"United States nonproliferation objectives\" justified such a step. It is useful to recall that a key purpose of our massive foreign assistance was to \"reduce significantly\" the risk of Pakistan acquiring the bomb. In recent years. Pakistani leaders have been stressing that Pakistan is not assembling a weapon. On July 17. 1986. the Washington Post quoted visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Junejo as having told congressional hosts that Pakistan was \"abiding by the guidelines\" established with the United States with respect to its nuclear program and that it is \"keeping components separate.\" A simple question arises: If Pakistan is living up to its commitment not to enrich beyond 5 percent. what possible components would it have to assemble? Prime Minister Bhuttos professed commitments not to put together a bomb. while welcome as are all of Pakistans peaceful assurances. would make more sense if Pakistan was living up to the 5percent pledge. Since you cannot make a bomb with components of 5percent enriched uranium. the best way for Pakistan to clarify its peaceful intentions would be to keep its word on the 5percent pledge.",

He must realize that the vast changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe represent the future of Cuba. They will also have an immediate impact on Cuba. As Castro Is well aware. 75 percent of Cubas trade is with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The new democratic countries in Eastern Europe are unlikely to want to maintain extensive trade relations with Castro. There are even signs that the Soviet Union is becoming impatient with bailing out the Cuban economy year after year. Despite the winds of change in Europe. Castro shows no signs of bringing glasnost to Cuba. In fact. at this very moment. hunger strikes are taking place against the inhuman conditions there. These heroic hunger strikers. who have Just finished servIng 20year sentenced for poltiical dissent. still have not been released because they have refused to grovel before prison authorities. One brave man. Alfredo Musteller. who has refused food since late October. is close to death. No one expects Castro to follow in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev. But one can expect him to at least not act like a monster. I urge him to release Alfredo Mustelier immediately. in addition to the other hunger strikers. I also recommend to the reading of all Senators the following newspaper articles and an editorial from the Miami Herald that describe in vivid terms the difficulties faced by the Cuban people and the ordeal of the hunger strikers. What was previously unthinkable in Eastern Europe has now become a reality. So. too. will this reality come to Castros Cuba. The articles follow: [From the Washington Post. Nov. 9. 1989]",

From cattle barns in Montana and Kansas to antique shops in Manhattan. buying and selling at auctions has been a national pastime since colonial days. As an auctioneer myself. I can safely say that if you have never attended an auction. you are missing a great experience. The auctioneers delivery. the bidding process. and all the other dynamics of an auction are exciting and fun from beginning to end. But an auction is also serious business. Tens of millions of dollars worth of goods are sold at auction every year. and the Federal Government is an active participant in the process. That is because the auctioning of surplus Government property is a great benefit to the American taxpayer. Not only does it bring a great price. it does so in an open public forum. with competitive bidding. under full public scrutiny. The Financial Institutions Reform. Recovery. and Enforcement Act of 1989 recognizes the importance of auction marketing. That law mandates that auctions be included in the oversight boards strategic plan for the Resolution Trust Corp. The National Auctioneers Association [NAA] represents over 6.000 professional auctioneers across the country. The members of NAA are proud of the work they have performed for the Federal Government. and the State and local governments. as well. Using the auction option. Government has turned surplus public property into a resource that can be used for improved public services and deficit reduction. To further promote this activity. the NAA has established a Washington presence in the National Auction Marketing Coalition [NAMCO]. NAMCOs goal is to make sure that the Federal Government takes full advantage of the auction option whenever and wherever it benefits the American taxpayer. The NAA encourages us to \"catch auction fever.\" It is a great idea because of the benefits to the American Government and taxpayers.*",

The slaughter at the University of Central America. including six Jesuit priests. is one more Incomprehensive act of barbaric cruelty in El Salvador. The agony in El Salvador has gone on too long. The wrenching suffering In that bloodstained country sears the conscience of civilized people everywhere. The United States has an obligation to do all that it can to work to achieve an immediate ceasefire. Mr. President. the carnage must be stopped.

    "speech": "As are all Americans. I am shocked and appalled by the escalation of violence in El Salvador. The continued heavy loss of lifethe result of the actions of both sides through their military operations in densely populated civilian areasis a tragedy that must be stopped. The atrocities which have occurred in the past week. including the grisly murders of six Jesuit priests. their housekeeper and her daughter. places the perpetrators of this brutal and cowardly act beyond the bounds of any civilized standard of behavior. The United States must not spare any effort to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly brought to Justice. The breadth and scope of the continued violence underscores the need for both sides to return immediately to the negotiating table. As a first step. I urge the Government of El Salvador and the FMLN to enter into an immediate ceasefire. I also urge both sides to allow the International Red Cros and other relief organizations access to the areas of fighting to provide medical and humanitarian assistance for civilians and others who have been wounded. Failure to take these basic steps will place any future United States assistance to El Salvador in serious jeopardy. I have worked with others in the Senate and House for many years to enact legislation to stop the deportation of Salvadorans from the United States. I believe that a temporary suspension of such deportations and other forced returns is our responsibility because of our longtime and extensive involvement militarily and economically in that country. The increased violence reinforces the urgent need for such action. I have today written a letter to the Attorney General asking for him to administratively stop the return of El Salvadoran refugees. The Attorney General has the authority to grant extended voluntary departure status to nationals of El Salvador who are in the United States. I hope that he will immediately take such action. I am also hopeful that immediately upon the Senates return in January. the Senate will take up and quickly pass the DeConcini/Moakley bill granting a suspension of deportation to Salvadorans and and Nicaraguans. This weeks actions once again highlight the urgent need for the United States to end the disgraceful return of innocent and threatened individuals to a dangerous and violent war zone. Once again.

And it is money from the oil profits that were made in Angola that allowed them to buy the billions of dollars of arms from the Soviet Union. Furthermore. I would like to make the point that we are seeing in Angola a question of broader U.S. policy than \"what are we doing in a country in Africa?\" It is Angola that is a pinpoint pivotal area of Soviet concern on the continent of Africa. It is there that the Soviets have made their stand as they have in South Asia with Afghanistan. It is in Angola that is exceedingly important that we make our stand. that we support freedom. that we support the freedom fighters. in this case UNITA. and that we make the clear statement at this time that we are not about to abandon them. That is what this amendment does. It says let us support the freedom fighters in Angola and not allow for some kin. of negotiated settlement less than a full and fair and free determination be put on the people of Angola.

Notwithstanding these principles. the conferees would also be instructed to insist on the Housepassed catastrophic health care and section 89 provisions. The Senate stripped out all extraneous provisions from the bill it sent to the House. The text of these stripped out extraneous items reportedly weighed some 9 pounds. The House should match the Senates action and do likewise by stripping down its similarly overweight 1.878page bill. Should the House agree to this instruction. it is intended that the conferees strip out spending increases of approximately $1.6 billion in fiscal year 1990rising to approximately $3.9 billion in 1991. and revenue losers totaling approximately $2.6 billion in fiscal year 1990rising to about $4.1 billion in 1991. The instruction also assumes that numerous authorizations. which have no direct budget impact. would be removed. as well as provisions such as the codification of the Fairness Doctrine and DialaPorn.

So this is a key vote for those people who want to see it completely repealed. because they understand that if we do not instruct the conferees. the likelihood Is we will get something less than repeal. because that is the position that many in this House who are dealing with the issue in committee seem to favor. Therefore. I think that we have a very key vote here. and Members who feel that section 89 and catastrophic should be repealed would be advised to vote for the motion to instruct. and is sure that position is represented in conference.

What we have is a mixture. the gentleman offering a motion as is his right. took some very popular items. section 89 and catastrophic. and linked them at his choice with things like the low income tax credit and with child care. Now. if one were seeking to maximize support for repeal of section 89 and catastrophic. one would put an instruction motion forward that only dealt with those items. When a Member adds to that instruction motion other items that the gentleman knows are controversial. that passed this House by large margins in some cases. we are clearly transforming it. It is not a case of section 89 and catastrophic. one way or the other. but a package which includes those. and also includes the capital gains tax. Therefore. the choice made by the makers of this motion to pick and choose among controversial items is a legitimate one. but it is not legitimate for them that this. therefore. be a test vote on section 89. the argument that if you are for repeal of section 89. you must be against child care.

I think the House should be aware that the Senate is not going to conference on the catastrophic illness issue with what passed over there in the form of the McCain amendment. They are going to conference with the current law. with all of its inequities and all of its onerous provisions. and it is absolutely essential that we pass this motion to instruct. to be sure that the DonnellyArcherRusso repeal of the catastrophic program voted overwhelmingly for in this House is the position that our conferees take when they go to conference with the Senate. In addition. it is extremely important that we get serious about the deficits in our Federal budget. We are already now in sequestration. We are acting as if nothing has happened. If this motion to instruct is implemented by the conferees. it will save. as the gentleman from Minnesota said. $14.5 billion on the budget deficit over the first year. There is only $10.5 billion saved in the original House bill. In addition. it would save $67.8 billion over a 5year period. Those are real savings. They are important to deficit reduction and reduction of the debt. What is reconciliation all about? It should not be to bring about new spending programs that are in the form of entitlements. and yet we see that happening in reconciliation. We should reduce the deficit by implementing this motion to instruct. We should support repeal of section 89 and the repeal of catastrophic so that we can have a clean slate next year. It has been argued by the other side that this does not give us a chance to tailor how we want to spend money. but that ignores the fact that almost all the appropriation bills have still not been passed into law. Those are still forthcoming. We still have the opportunity to do what we wish in that regard. Mr. Speaker. this motion to instruct implements the very best in deficit reduction. as well as those issues that the House has voted for overwhelmingly. and I urge its adoption.",

Small business believes both of these provisions are important changes which need to be made in tax policy. Repeal of Section 89 has been one of NFIBs top priorities in this Congress. We do not want the overwhelming vote (39036) for repeal by the House to be forgotten during complex negotiations on the reconciliation bill. Moreover. NFIB members support a reduction in the capital gains tax because it will enhance economic growth. create Jobs. and promote greater entrepreneurial risk taking in the market. Thank you for offering the motion to instruct. We urge all members to support your effort.

When Congress established the IRA incentive for retirement savings In 1981. it was taking an important step to encourage Americans to provide for their own security. The IRA concept leads us away from reliance on Governmentsponsored Social Security. It also fills an important role by providing Americans with the flexibility to establish funds which respond to their own particular needs. Americans have made it clear that they like the idea of maintaining individual plans. and that they have confidence in their abilities to provide for the future. Not only do IRAs benefit individual Americansthey also benefit the national economy. By encouraging longterm savings. IRAs help form the underpinnings of our economy in providing for needed capital formation. Indeed. incentives for savings should be expanded. not further restricted. The Tax Reform Act of 1986. which I did not support in its final form. reduced or eliminated tax deferrals for contributions to IRAs for any employee who is an active participantor who has a spouse who Is an active participantin an employersponsored retirement plan unless the tax filing units AGI falls below a specific limit. My bill would restore the tax treatment accorded to IRAs prior to enactment of tax reform. Like many of my colleagues. my office has been flooded with mail from constituents appealing for this restoration of IRA deductability. I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in sponsoring this measure.",

The Monroney amendment was enacted under Public Law 90560 in 1968. The purpose of this legislation is to provide a fair basis for fixing and adjusting the pay of Federal bluecollar workers assigned to specialized positions.

Various laws have passed which highlight the role of the Great Lakes. However. the references to the lakes are not uniform. creating some confusion over the coverage of the laws. especially in regard to the important connecting channels. The bill I have authored will clarify the waters encompassed by most references to the Great Lakes. However. I must stress that the intent behind this bill is mainly housekeeping: I do not intend to substantially alter any statutory jurisdiction. Accordingly. certain violations or departures from this standard definition may be required due to the peculiar circumstances of a given situation or law. For example. there are some legal references to the Great Lakes which are based on treaty provisions or other special agreements. These particular limits. such as those found under the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between the United States and Canada (16 U.S.C. chapter 15A). the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (33 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.). the Great Lakes Commodities Marketing Board (33 U.S.C. 2309). Great Lakes Pilotage (46 U.S.C. chapter 93). the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships (46 U.S.C. 14101). are to be preserved. Although I believe we have exhausted the United States Code for references to the Great Lakes. there may be some instances where additional adjustments may need to be made.

About 1 year ago. I decided to pay a visit to Jim and Jeanne Patterson. When I arrived at their home I was met by a most friendly and cordial couple. We had planned to meet here for a short period. but ended up talking for hours and could have gone into late evening. So many questions raced through my mind. \"What was Congress like 30 years ago? What were the key issues. who were the legislative leaders. et cetera?\" These questions certainly did not dominate our discussion. As a matter of fact we barely discussed politics. So what did we talk about? Well. here was a tremendously successful businessman. veteran. community leader. Congressman. former drug enforcement official. and scholarathlete who could have spent the time bragging about his own personal accomplishments. But Jim and Jeanne Patterson wanted to talk about their family. their children. their grandchildren. where they lived. what they were doing. As I recall there were at least four doctors in the family. A happy crowd of grandchildren that liked to visit and a lot of traveling by grandma and grandpa to see the kids.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in support of the fiscal year 1990 legislative branch appropriations. I am especially pleased that through this measure. the Senate is taking steps to provide access for individuals with disabilities. I want to thank the chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee for his sensitivity and commitment to improving opportunities within these walls for individuals with disabilities. First. this legislation provides the resources necessary to implement Senate Resolution 13 which the Senate passed in June. Senate Resolution 13 calls for the close captioning of the Senates televised floor proceedings. As you know. the Senates floor proceedings have been televised since 1988. At that time. we decided that it is important that we be accountable to our constituents and that they have the opportunity to partake in the legislative process via television. I am pleased that the Senate has recognized that deaf and hard of hearing Americans be afforded the same opportunity. Not only will the implementation of this resolution bring the Senate floor proceedings into the homes of millions of deaf and hearingimpaired Americans. but it will allow also deaf and hearingimpaired Senate staffers the opportunity to more closely follow floor debates. Second. the legislative branch appropriations bill also requires the Senate to hire one certified sign language interpreter and to provide funds to hire outside interpreters when needed. It is my understanding that the Senates interpreter will be available to Members offices for meeting with deaf constituents as well as to provide services to deaf Senate staffers so they can fully participate in staff meetings and other activities required by their jobs. Mr. President. providing these services. captioned Senate proceedings. and interpreter services. can mean the difference between career development and career stagnation. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped. I want to thank my colleagues for their support of these measures.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have offered amendments to the previous appropriations bills to cap each departments consultant spending. The Congress and the legislative support agencies such as the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Office of Technology Assessment IOTA] are not required by section 1114 of title 31 to report their request for consultant spending. Therefore. I will not be offering an amendment to cap the consultant spending of the Congress because there is no budget request on which to focus. However. I do think it is important to have our own house in order. I want to urge the Senate Rules Committee and the Committee on House Administration to review the way in which Congress uses consultants and ensure that there are thorough guidelines and oversight in this issue. I would also ask that these committees consider whether requiring Congress to submit a budget request for consulting services would be appropriate. Mr. President. I also want to take this opportunity to focus attention not only on the way Congress uses consultant services. but the way in which GAO uses consultants. GAO. Congress investigatory arm. relies very heavily on consultants and contractors for a variety of services. I understand GAOs need to have access to experts with specialized expertise as It has to carry out a governmentwide oversight mission. However. it is my understanding that GAO is considering using consultants to assist them in performing audits and reviews of executive branch programs. This would cause me a deal of concern. Congress has to be able to rely on GAO for unbiased assessments of Government programs. Whenever the Government turns sensitive tasks over to private contractors. questions regarding the appropriate delegation and potential conflicts of interest always come up. I am a great supporter of GAO and its work. However. I urge them to move cautiously toward any expansion in the use of contractors or consultants to carry out actual program work.",

In other words. where the Senate would be limited now to two mass mailings. a Senator. if he chose. could send out 6. 8. 10. 12. 20 pages in each of those mass mailings.

The purpose of the amendment which I have now offered is to limit the number of pages which may compromise each of these mass mailings in either House. to limit it to two legalsized sheets of paper printed on both sides. In other words. four printed pages. legalsized pages. If you cannot say it in four pages. then you are in big trouble.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was pleased to learn that this bill as reported by the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch Appropriations and the full Appropriations Committee includes an earmark of $30.000 to support the employment of one certified signlanguage interpreter. I commend my colleague from Nevada. Senator RzD. for this initiative. This body is on the verge of voting on major. comprehensive legislation to address discrimination against disabled individuals. It is imperative that the Senate provide leadership by example. In 1984 the Senate took an important step toward breaking the barriers between this institution and disabled citizens. The Senate created a special office within the SergeantatArms office to assist disabled tourists. In the past year. that office has experienced a 57percent increase in service requests. The office simply cannot respond to staff requests when it must assist over 3.000 visitors a year. Senate staffs have tried. usually unsuccessfully. to obtain the assistance of this office for their own internal needs. In the month of January. over 100 requests for services had to be denied due to staff and resource limitations. This office provides a wonderful and necessary service. Mr. President. but we must do better. Disabled citizens should not only have every chance to tour our great Capitol. but to work in it as well. For these reasons. this new appropriation should be available to assist hearingimpaired Senate staff. The appropriation of funds for a signlanguage interpreter is one small. but very important way we can ensure the hiring and promotion of qualified. hearingimpaired employees. Mr. President. I am a cosponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act largely because it will open the doors for employment opportunities to millions of disabled citizens. The Senate must open its doors also.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. todays legislative appropriations report includes strong support for an important plan to implement a recycling program in the U.S. Senate. The report language instructs the Architect of the Capitol to proceed with a plan that would help the Senate recycle paper more efficiently. According to the EPA Americans generate 160 million tons of trash every year. Only 10 percent of this waste is recycled. and 15 percent used for waste combustion. That means 75 percent of our Nations solid waste is dumped in landfills. With onethird of our Nations landfills scheduled to close by 1991. it is imperative that we encourage the American people to step up efforts to recycle products after use. While I am pleased to see the number of bills introduced in Congress to promote recycling. I feel that we as a Congress must set the example for the rest of the Nation. Capitol Hill currently produces 20.000 tons of trash every year. of which only 30 percent is recycled. To no ones surprise. much of the Hills trash is highgrade paper for which there is currently a large demand. Instead of paying people to dump our paper. along with wrappers. food. and other trash. in landfills. we could be responding to this market demand with recycled highgrade paper. That is why I introduced Senate Resolution 99. which would implement a voluntary paper separation and recycling program in the Senate. On August 1. the House of Representatives passed a similar bill in the House. and my office is currently working with the Architect of the Capitols Office to start a pilot project on the fifth and sixth floors of the Hart building. By separating our highgrade paper from newspaper and other waste. we can profit economically as well as environmentally from improved recycling. This resolution is now included in the legislative appropriations report. and I would urge all of my fellow Senators to support this measure and encourage their staffs to participate in this program.",

One. the MPLA only last year launched an offensive. as we have already talked about. after they agreed to a ceaseflrel Second. the MPLA has an oil economy. We know what has happened to the price of oil. It has doubled. They have $5 billion in revenue available to them. If we withhold aid to UNITA. obviously UNITA and Savimbi will be at a serious disadvantage.

Those are cuts that are now included in the budget resolution that has passed both Houses of the Congress. In reading the article. I thought it was important to draw the attention of my colleagues to statements that are made there that I think are very misleading. So I take the floor today to seek to correct the record and make clear what it is that agriculture confronts with the proposals from the budget summit and also make clear that the cuts of some $13 billion in that agreement were the bottom end. that the President and his people were pushing for much greater cuts. But let us look at what the cuts that have been agreed to would mean. Let us look at the Presidents Justification. The President said this: \"So Id ask the farmers: look at what we are trying to do. look at the success of the marketoriented approach we took to agriculture. look at how * * * the per capita income to farmers stands. and help us preserve the kind of markets that guarantee continued prosperity to the farmer.\" Mr. President. if the President of the United States is interested in prosperity for Americas farmers then he ought to be very concerned about what he has pushed in terms of the budget resolution and the budget summit agreement. Mr. President. I brought with me these charts that show the trend in agriculture spending. Before I turn to that. let me also read the quote from Mr. Darman. the head of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Darman told reporters that suggested farm cuts were written into the budget deal \"because historically. the farm committees have been among the most inventive in finding ways to actually present programs that pretend to save money. and then somehow or other. not actually produce real savings.\" Mr. President.

The Department proposed tearing down the existing new bugridden embassy building in Moscow. replacing it and building additional space at the staggering cost of $270 million. The request. quite properly. was for a statutory authorization for this plan. At the administrations request Chairman PELL included the $270 million in the chairmans mark and brought the request to the committee. In testimony before the committee on May 23.

To repeat. the State Department could not find a single supporting voice on the Committee on Foreign Relations. The rejection of the request was completely bipartisan. And devastatingly complete. It is. therefore. somewhat of a surprise to learn that the Appropriations Committee has extended an invitation to the Department to use $10 million of already appropriated funds to begin the process of tearing down the Moscow Embassy.

Chief Albert Weingaertner. and 1st Lt. Larry Brody. will be celebrating the purchase of a new pumpertanker for Milan Station No. 1 on August 18. When Lieutenant Brody asked me to participate in the ceremony. it made me recall my 25 years as a volunteer fireman In my hometown of Queensbury. NY. Thats why I have a special appreciation for volunteer firefighters. people from all walks of life and all economic levels who make enormous sacrifices to protect their communities. Mr. Speaker. in rural districts like mine. with few large municipalities. these volunteer companies represent the only fire protection. Milan Volunteer Fire Department. for example. has been protecting the community since 1947. These companies save billions of dollars worth of property every year. and countless lives. They undergo extensive training. and their performance often rivals that of fulltime paid fire departments. Several years ago. It was my privilege to lead the fight to exempt volunteer firefighters from rigid. and in the opinion of many. inappropriate. drivers license requirements. The House exempted volunteer firefighters because Members know how vital volunteer companies are to towns and villages across America. and that the requirement threatened the viability of many companies. Mr. Speaker. thats one of the reasons my office has been decorated by hundreds of fire helmets. Its a measure of my admiration and respect for our volunteer firefighters. At the August ceremony Milan Station No. 1 will be getting a new E1 Mac pumpertanker to replace their 1966 American LaFrance. Please join me in saluting President Windgaertner. Chief Leonhardt. Lieutenant Brody. and all the other able. dedicated firefighters of the Milan Volunteer Fire Department.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. we are faced with one of the most difficult tasks in Congress: judging the actions of a House colleague. Before making that judgment. we should judiciously weigh the evidence before US. Fortunately. the members of the ethics committee have done a thorough job of summarizing the allegations and evidence against Congressman FRANK. Concerning the most serious allegations. the committee found nothing. Congressman FRANK had no prior or concurrent knowledge of prostitution taking place at his residence. Nor were the accusations about Mr. FRANKS sexual activity on Federal property true. I am. of course. saddened by the course of events in which my friend. BARNEY FRANK. has been involved. He showed an uncharacteristic lack of good judgment when he sought dismiss of the 33 parking tickets. He was careless when he permitted his office to send a memo to an attorney in Virginia detailing misleading information about Steve Gobie. For these actions. the ethics committee voted to reprimand him. The committees recommendation can be considered excessive given its decisions on other recent cases of misconduct. However. since BARNEY FRANK. himself. has accepted the judgment of the ethics committees I will reluctantly support its recommendations. Congressman FRANK has apologized for his misconduct and said that he would pay the parking tickets. I for one am satisfied with Congrescman FRANKS sincerity and regret. Still. some House Members insist on taking this matter farther than the committees recommendation by punishing Congressman FRANK with the even stiffer penalts of censure. Such punishment does not fit his misconduct. It is an attempt to punish Mr. FRANKnot for his actionsbut for his political outlook and his personal life. Concerning the latter. the Issue before us today is not Congressman FRANKS sexual orientation. about which he has been courageously open. I would remind my colleagues that what consenting adults do in the privacy of their homes is not for discussion on this House floor. Nor is It relevant to this vote either. It should be offensive to all of us that some members of this body insist on making an issue of anothers sexual orientation. Any attempt to go beyond the committees recommendation can only be viewed as meanspirited and partisan. It Is clearly an at-",

First. it would reauthorize the Childhood Immunizations Program of the Centers for Disease Control. Second. the bill would reauthorizeat current levelsthe National Vaccine Program which conducts and coordinates Federal vaccine development. Third. the legislation would make technical corrections to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. As Members well know. Mr. Speaker. the Childhood Immunization Program provides grants to States for the purchase of vaccine against preventable diseases such as polio. measles. and pertussis. It also provides for the administration of State childhood immunization programs. H.R. 4238 would provide for a 5year extension of this program and would set an authorization level of $185 million for fiscal year 1991. This amount is needed to address a number of financial shortfalls that the program would otherwise face in the coming year. including. First. funds for a second measles shot that CDC is now recommending for all children. second. funds to provide emergency immunization services in areas that are undergoing outbreaks of measles. third. funds to provide hepatitis B vaccine for women and newborns. and fourth. funds to assist States in the operation of their own childhood immunizations programs. For each of fiscal years 1992 through 1995. H.R. 4238 would establish an authorization level of \"such sums as may be necessary\". The provisions included in this legislation relating to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program would correct drafting errors that were made last year when the program underwent substantial revision as part of Public Law 101239. These technical corrections are meant to make the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program more easily understood. and. in one instance. to remedy a serious error that might result In additional litigationa result which was never intended by the Congress.

Mr. Speaker. since its establishment by the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962. the Centers for Disease Controls Immunization Program has become one of the most successful prevention programs in public health. At present. approximately 50 percent of childhood vaccines are administered in the public sector. Currently nearly 98 percent of all children are Immunized prior to entry into school. The high levels of Immunization that the program has been able to achieve have led to reductions of at least 90 percent in each of the vaccinepreventable diseases. This has been a tremendously successful program that merits our support. Despite these achievements. CDC still faces a number of challenges. Last year. we experienced unusual outbreaks of measles unlike anything seen in the recent past. As a result of those outbreaks. CDC recommended that children receive a second measles shot. H.R. 4238 will help CDC meet this challenge by authorizing an additional $25 million for this second round of shots. H. 4238. as amended. also solves a number of technical problems that have arisen with respect to the implementation of the vaccine compensation program and the future of the vaccine stockpile. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4238. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

I especially want to thank Congressman WAXMAN for largely incorporating in his bill. H.R. 4650. legislation which I introduced earlier this year that would authorize $15 million for the purposes of testing potential bone marrow donors. Although the national program has a goal of listing 250.000 potential bone marrow donors. a lack of funding has prevented the registry from realizing this goal and only approximately 135.000 individuals are currently listed. In fact. many of the names in the registry were added after the families of sick individuals conducted their own expensive searches when the registry failed to provide a match. This reauthorization legislation. coupled with the fiscal year 1991 LaborHealth and Human ServicesEducation appropriations bill approved by the House of Representatives last week. sends a strong signal about our commifment to ensuring that NMDP is responsive to those in need of bone marrow transplants. I encourage my colleagues to support this worthwhile measure.",

I also wish to extend special thanks to the full committee chairman. the gentleman from Michigan and the subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from Massachusetts . Without their willingness to work on a bipartisan childrens TV bill. this legislation would never have made it to the floor. The provisions of this bill are not complex. It requires reasonable limits on commercial time during childrens shows. and directs TV stations to comply with those limits. The bill also directs the FCC to consider whethe a TV station has served the educetbonal and Informational needs of children in its overall programming. This is nothing new. TV stations already are required to serve their child audiences. But now. the FCC will be directed to gauge whether TV stations are actually meeting \"tat obligation. While this may be a special provision. i is meant to improve programming to children. who unquestionably are a special audience with distinct programming needs. This bill is not a cure all. It does not pretend to be. Rather. the committee has taken a hard look at childrens TV in the last two congresses. and has tried to encourage sensible behavior toward children by television licensees. We can do no more and still be consistent with the first amendment Television is a pervasive medium. What Comes out of the tube has a great impact on all who watch. That impact is measurabry greater on children. who otten lack thde capability to appreciato that they are being sold as well as entertained.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as a member of the Senate Finance Committee. I have become increasingly aware of inequities for small businesses contained in our Federal tax laws. This is particularly ironic. given the oftenrepeated claim that small business is the backbone of our country. One of the many. ways that our tax system discriminates against small businesses is in denying the selfemployed a full deduction for their health insurance expenses. Corporations may deduct 100 percent of the costs of providing health insurance for their employees. but the selfemployed. whether they operate as sole proprietorships or as partnerships. are only permitted to deduct 25 percent of the cost of health insurance for themselves and their families. Whats more. the 25 percent deduction is scheduled to expire on September 30. 1990. The importance of the deduction for health insurance costs has grown substantially in recent years due to tremendous increases in health costs generally. The annual doubledigit increases in health costs have far outstripped the rate of inflation and led to similar increases in the cost of health insurance. Corporations. which frequently are in a better position to absorb cost increases. may fully deduct the greater insurance expenses. while the selfemployed must pay the bulk of these costs with aftertax dollars. In some cases. this may mean forfeiting health insurance altogether. I think it is time we put the selfemployed on an equal footing with corporations. Therefore. I am introducing today legislation that would increase the selfemployed deduction for health insurance costs from 25 to 100 percent. In addition. my bill would make the deduction permanent. as it is for corporations. If my bill is enacted. the selfemployed will no longer have to worry each year that their deduction for health insurance costs may be completely eliminated. This is just one of many bills I hope to sponsor or support in the future to help small businesses and to address the complex health problems we face. By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself. Mr. DODD. Mr. MOYNIHAN. and Mr. DAmATo): S.J. Res. 276. Joint resolution designating the week beginning July 22. 1990. as \"Lyme Disease Awareness Week\". to the Committee on the Judiciary.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to designate the week of July 22. 1990. as \"Lyme Disease Awareness Week.\" Lyme disease was first discovered in Lyme. CT. in 1976. This tickborne disease has now been reported in 43 States. More than 21.000 cases have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control since 1982. 7.042 in 1989 alone. however. few doctors and even fewer members of the general public recognize the symptoms of Lyme disease. Left untreated. Lyme disease can cause severe arthritis. heart disease. and neurological complications. The damage caused by untreated Lyme dis ease can be irreversible. Lyme disease can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women since it can cause premature labor. fetal damage. miscarriages and stillbirths. Education. prevention. and research on this disease are critical because existing diagnostic tools are insuf! fent. and. at this time. there is no vaccine against Lyme disease. People who contract the disease often go through years of tests and a variety of treatments before a proper diagnosis is made. Two former Members of the House of Representatives. Ken Gray of Illinois and Berkeley Bedell of Iowa. were forced to retire from Congress because they contracted Lyme disease. Both have battled the disease for several years. Their suffering clearly illustrates the need for additional resources for public education and for medical research. The three keys to warding off the worst effects of Lyme disease are prevention. early detection. and early treatment. Physicians and the general public must be taught what precautions to take to prevent the disease. They must learn how to recognize its early symptoms. so that those with Lyme disease receive immediate treatment with antibiotics to prevent permanent damage. I believe Lyme Disease Awareness Week can play an important role in teaching the American people about this devastating disease. Mr. President. I ask that the full text of the joint resolution be printed In the REcom.",

I also think we should look into an expanded use of vouchers. I spoke with several public housing officials in Florida who said they could help more people if they had more vouchers. The freedom direct rental assistance affords helps residents move out of concentrations of poverty to areas with better job and education opportunities. On the issue of affordability. I believe an excellent way to start to reduce the cost of housing is to reduce the amount of government regulation in housing. Instead of creating minimum living standards for everyone. our housing regulations may actually be putting decent housing beyond the reach of ordinary homeowners. While I view high standards of safety and health as a necessity. I am concerned with studies that show how many of these regulations have driven up the cost of housing to the point of pushing potential homeowners out of the market. The combined effect of these regulations. such as zoning laws. building codes. growth controls. impact fees and land use restrictions. may add as much as 35 percent to the cost of a new home. One expert. Anthony Downs of the Brookings Institute. said that \"75 percent of the cost of housing Is due to requirements in excess of the minimum needed for health and safety.\" Americas housing policy should be designed to help those who need it most. The HUD scandal is showing that billions of dollars intended for the poor have gone to everyone except the poor. This is outrageous. But it could be symptomatic of flawed policies that invite this sort of abuse. Federal housing policy will never operate at its optimal level until we acknowledge its flaws. I believe it is the time we rethink our housing policies. The HOPE plan Is a good initial step in this process. DEPARTMENT OF HousING AND",

Population Fund. because it has a program in China where there have been reports of coercion. even though no one claims UNFPA supports coercive practices itself. Rather. UNFPA. which has programs in 130 other countries too. funds alternatives to abortioncontraceptives. education about birthspacing. maternal and child health. The Senate. by a vote of 52 to 48. agreed to Senator MIKULSKIS amendment which does not change that provision but exempts UNFPA from its coverage. It allows the U.S. to fund UNFPA. but requires that United States funds be kept in a separate account and that no United States funds go to China. The House voted to recede to the Senate and refund UNFPA by a vote of 246 to 176. but then immediately turned around and voted 219 to 203 for an amendment which gutted the Mikulski provision by requiring that before any United Stated funds can go to UNFPA the President must certify that China does not have a coercive family planning policy. I have now moved to strike the House amendment. thereby insisting on the Senate language. The opponents argue that this will ensure a veto and cause a delay possibly necessitating another CR. Mr. President. the Senate has already voted on this issue. but yesterday the House. after first upholding our language by 80 votes. then narrowly passed an amendment which gutted it. My motion will only preserve the original Senate language. This means no United States funds will go to China. Nor will this delay final action on this bill.

I wish to discuss the Lautenbcrg amendment. which establishes categories of refugee applicants. First. the Lautenberg amendment. as modified by the conference committee. allows certain refugee groups to qualify for refugee status by asserting a fear of presecution and then asserting a credible basis for concern about the possibility of such persecution. I wish to clarify that the initial fear is a subjective matter. but the credible basis for concern is an objective matter to be established by the refugee applicant. This is consistent with the normal approach under the Refugee Act of 1980. In no way does this language create a presumption that the applicant is a refugee: the burden remains on the refugee applicant. Second. thc Joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference notes: Once a credible basis for concern about the possibility of persecution has been established. the burden of disproving eligibility for refugee status will fall upon the government.

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier this evening the House overwhelmingly approved House Joint Resolution 435. a 5day extension of the continuing resolution. Unless we pass this bill before midnight tonight. large segments of the Government may be forced to cease operations. The House has adjourned for the day. Therefore. we have no choice but to approve the extension and send it to the President for his consideration. If we fail for any reason to approve the House action. the Department of Defense. the Department of Agriculture. the activities of our intelligence agencies. the Federal judiciary. and other departments or agencies have neither the funds nor the authority to continue their action. So I strongly urge Senators to permit us to proceed to enact the continuing resolution. Mr. President. President Bush has signed into law 5 of the 13 appropriations measures. Congress has concluded action on two additional measures which await his consideration. They are Commerce. Justice. State and the Judiciary. and Department of Transportation. The legislative branch appropriations bill will be sent to the White House tonight. We must therefore act finally on five other such measures. Agriculture. foreign assistance. Department of Defense. and the two bills previously vetoed. LaborHHS and D.C. appropriations. Mr. President. I am about to propound a unanimousconsent request that we be able to proceed to the continuing resolution. it is for 5 days. that there be no amendments. and that there be 10 minutes equally divided. If this agreement is reached. and consent is granted. then there will be no further rollcall votes this evening. and the Senate will complete action on this. and we will resume on other appropriations bills In the morning. If. however. there are to be any amendments to this continuing resolution. which I hope very much will not be the case. then we simply will have to stay here until such time as all amendments are resolved. I emphasize that since the House has already adjourned. The effect of that will be to create the possibility if not the likelihood of a cessation of operation by several agencies of the Government. So. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the immediate consideration of House Joint Resolution 435. a continuing resolution. through November 20. and that no amendments or motions be in order. and that there be 10 minutes equally divided on the joint resolution.",

The Senator from North Carolina has an amendment that is important to him and. I think. a great majority of this body. and Senator MCCLURE has an important amendment dealing with rural referral centers. which is important to everybody in this Chamber who has any rural areas in his or her particular State.

The problem we have is that. as of October 1. new regulations which would deny reimbursement rates to rural referral centers went into effect. They are withholding money from those hospitals today. every day that we delay. they lose money. The only cure for that Is for us. at some later time. to mandate that that regulation be nullified as of October 1. and we will go through the procese of giving them the money they should have been getting during this period of time. Every day we wait on that. we just create a bigger problem for the rural hospitals that are in every one of our States. I am certain that this has overwhelming support here in the Senate. and we need to deal with it. I know that the Senator from Texas is trying to work out something. the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is trying to work out something. and he is at an impasse on other matters between himself and the other body.

He proposes a Marshall plan for these countries in concern with our Western European allies. Ambassador Saltzman makes a very persuasive case for helping the Soviet Union. Poland. Hungary. and other socalled socialist nations to enter the Western economic system. As he puts it: The two divergent economic systems prevent us from living in relative political harmony. and theirs does not work. Eastern Europe is ready to enter our world. we cannot afford not to help them. Ambassador Saltzman is uniquely placed to comment on developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He has carried out diplomatic and economic assignments under four Presidents. He has negotiated with Communist governments and has also dealt with them as an unofficial \"honest broker.\" helping to exchange viewpoints between Communist leaders and the United States. As a businessman. Ambassador Saltzman has engaged in joint venture projects in Communist countries. As a result. he brings an insiders perspective to both an analysis of developments in those countries as well as what the Wests response should be. Ambassador Saltzmans views are timely in light of the Senates consideration this week of legislation to provide assistance to Poland and Hungary.

Ambassador Pickering. who holds the highest rank of Career Ambassador in our Foreign Service. is providing Intelligent. vigorous leadership on behalf of our policies at the United Nations. It is rare that we have a career Foreign Service officer as our Ambassador in New York: the last previous one. I recall. was the late Ambassador Charles Yost. who set a high standard that Ambassador Pickering is continuing. In his talk in Washington. Ambassador Pickering said there is now \"more realism in the way the members of the United Nations see the organization. and in their treatment of United Nations issues. As we look to the decade ahead. we are using this new realism to set a positive agenda for the United States in working with the United Nations.\" Just a few weeks ago the United Nations celebrated its 44th birthday. as Ambassador Pickering notes. I had the honor of participating in the founding meetings in San Francisco as a very junior member of the Secretariat. I am glad to note that. as we approach the United Nations half century mark. there are fresh signs of vigor and accomplishment with each passing year. Perhaps the organization will at last line up to the high expectations of its founders. Ambassador Pickering was Introduced at the United Nations Conference by Ambassador Max M.

During this time. the American people and Congress have not only become more educated about the injustices and inhumanity of apartheid. but also better acquainted with those South Africansblack and whitewho have fought courageously and persistently to bring apartheid to an end. One of these is the Honorable Helen Suzman. a member of the opposition Progressive Federal Party who recently retired after 36 years in Parliament. Mrs. Suzman is well known here and in South Africa for her steadfast opposition to apartheid and her deep personal commitment to freedom and justice for all South Africans. regardless of race. During the course of her long and distinguished career in Parliament. Mrs. Suzman consistently spoke out against the apartheid policies and the repressive actions of the ruling National Party and its leaders. Often. hers was a sole voice. Now retired from Parliament. she continues to speak out forcefully. at home and abroad. against apartheid and in favor of a nonracial. democratic South Africa in which all South Africans can exercise basic fundamental freedoms and human rights. Last month. during a visit to Washington.

The reality Is we are not making much progress on the deficit. to make a long story short. So those factors all come together to really justify a reexamination of this initial decision that we made. I hope that Members will acknowledge that and say the world has changed. the cost of this plane has gone up dramatically. the deficit is not coming down. In fact.

The State of Maryland. the city of Balbmore and the friends of the Baltimore Maritime Museum are hosting this celebration. providing the citizens of Maryland with an opportunity to appreciate the dedicated work of the Coast Guard. On hand will be the cutter Taney. the only remaining warship afloat from Pearl Harbor. the Coast Guard tall ship Eage. and a flotilla or ardent supporters. Indeed the people of Maryland understand full well the role that the Coast Guard plays in their lives. protecting fisheries. ports and waterways. fighting pollution. instructing the people in boating safety. deploying in search and rescue missions. and in drug interdiction. In 1790 the U.S. Congress authorized the beginning of this invaluable organization with the Revenue Cutter Service. Today. the Coast Guard is a multifaceted service which epitomizes its 200 year motto. \"Semper Paratus.\" \"Always Ready.\" I urge my colleagues to stand with me and recognize the brilliant achievoments of the women and men in the Coast Guard who are Involved daily in law enforcement. military readiness and maritime safety activities.

Others will say that the Roukema amendment to H.R. 5115. the Excellence in Education Act. is designed to eliminate career schools from the Federal student aid programs. That is ridiculous. These same people voted in 1988 to accept the default measures contained in my amendment. I will be the first one to tell you that most career schools are reputable and do a good job of training students for needed occupations. The good trade schools have no basic objection to my amendment. They say it will help get rid of the bad apples that tarnish the Image of career schools. Ask yourself this question: Why would anyone not want to get rid of the schools that are abusing the Student Loan Program and costing the Treasury and taxpayers billions of dollars every year? The plain trust is that if Congress does not take swift action to bring down the rate of student loan defaults. public and congressionel support for the program may evaporatb. Before voting on the Roukema amendment. every Member ought to read the committee report on the labor. HHS. education appropriatons bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 2655 to reauthorize our foreign assistance programs for fiscal years 1990 and 1991. This legislation is the product of many long hours of work. The chairman of the committee. DANTE FASCELL. and the committees ranking Republican. BILL BROOMFIELD. are to be commended for their fine work in moving this bill through committee and to the House floor. Most of us here in Congress realize that our foreign assistance programs are in need of dire reform. A bipartisan task force of the Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this year released a report concluding that \"accountability of U.S. foreign assistance is extensive but ineffective.\" The task force determined that there are at least 288 separate reporting requirements on foreign aid. and that 92 percent of military and economic aid is earmarked. The bipartisan report recommended a complete rewrite of the foreign assistance and arms export measures. Although H.R. 2655 is not a complete rewrite of the foreign assistance programs. it is a step in the right direction. I support this bill although there are some parts of it I do not likeand I believe this is true of all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. We will have the opportunity to address these portions when we debate and vote on the amendments. Foreign assistance is hard to lovesometimes constituents characterize it as a \"give away\" to foreign countriesand it is unquestionably costly-$115 billionabout 1 percent of the Federal budget. But through this bill we assist our friends and allies in their self defense. through development money we help poorer nations to help themselves. and increasingly we are working with other countries in preserving the worlds fragile environment. The bill attempts with some success to get away from the rigidity of the pastto grant more flexibility to this country to respond to problems as they arise. Now. more than ever. other countries are expressing their yearnings for freedom and democracyand are perceiving that the American way is a better way. We must respond to this call for leadership.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to speak to one part of this bill which I feel is very important. This is the provision taken from the Global Poverty Reduction Act. which Mr. LEVINE and I introduced. The provision calls for U.S. foreign development aid to contribute measurably to eradicating absolute poverty in the developing world by advancing specific antipoverty goals: Reduction of 1980 underfivemortality rates by at least a half or to 70 per thousand live births. whichever achieves the greater reduction. Achievement of universal primary education and 80 percent female literacy. Reducing by 50 percent the proportion of the population living in absolute poverty in the period 19802000. Also. the provision calls on the President to develop other goals in addition to these goals as part of a plan to eradicate the worst aspects of poverty by the year 2000. This would establish standards by which we can measure the effectivenes of our foreign aid programs. That is good news for the American taxpayer who foots the bill for these programs and good news for the worlds poorest people who will benefit from this Increased effectiveness. This provision simply puts in place resultsoriented accountability. It does not measure methods. but only results. This is not impractical. utopian feel good policy. These are attainable goals. For example. according to UNICEF. in 1960. 74 countries had an underfivemortality rate above 170 per 1000 people. Today. that figure is down to 33 countries. This will focus our attention on what we are doing right. so we can do more of it. There is no greater goal. no better use of our development aid dollars than helping to lift the worlds children out of the lifethreatening morass of poverty and illiteracy that engulfs much of the developing world.",

What this amendment would do is it would exclude the provision for export promotion by the Department of Agriculture from the definition of \"United States assistance\" in the drug enforcement part of the legislation. The reason for this is that these export promotion programs provide benefits for U.S. producers and exporters of domestic agricultural commodities and products in order to make our commodities competitive in the world market. It is not assistance to the country: it is not assistance to anybody that would enhance the position of a foreign country. but. rather. it will enhance the position of the producers in the United States.

This measure. the Emergency Chinese Visa Adjustment Act of 1989. will enable Chinese nationals to remain here without jeopardizing their eligibility for permanent resident status. News reports have stated that Chinese officials in the United States are keeping black lists of Chinese students in the United States involved in peaceftil protests against the violence in China. Given these circumstances. it is not the time to reduce options for Chinese students in America. We must protect these Chinese nationals from retribution in the future. On June 6. the Attorney General authorized the Extended Deferred Departure [EDDI Program. which allows Chinese nationals to stay in the United States until June 5. 1990. However. acceptance of EDD status makes individuals. even those who are otherwise eligible. ineligible for visa adjustment or application for permanent resident status. My bill would clarify the \"automatic 1year extension\" atuthorized by EDD. and provide a blanket waiver of the J1 visas 2year return residence requirement for Chinese nationals. Mr. Speaker. if one lone student can stand tip against a tank. then we should be able to stand up against a bureaucracy.

Andrew Goodman. and Michael Schwerner Day.\" Twentyfive years ago today. Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner were slain in Philadelphia. MS as they participated in the Freedom Summer of 1964. These brave young men were among the thousands of volunteers who had gone to the South that summer to help in voting and human rights struggles. On June 21. 1964. the three men left to inspect a church that had been burned by the Ku Klux Klan. Fortyfour days later. their bodies were discovered in an earthen dam. They had been shot to death. The brutal murders of these three compassionate and committed volunteers stunned this country and drew national attention to the struggle for civil rights. Their murders demonstrated anew the lethal potential of racism and helped to spark the movement which led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. Speaker. Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner Day will commemorate the sacrifices that these men made to the civil rights movement a quarter of a century ago and will bring into the consciousness of the country the need for a continuing commitment to civil rights.

On June 21. 1964. three young. idealistic civil rights workers were brutally murdered and their bodies buried in a levee. It took 6 weeks to discover the place where the bodies had been buried. The three martyrs were Mickey Schwerner. Andrew Goodman. and James E. Chaney. They were cut down in the prime of their lives while trying to register Mississippi blacks to vote and helping to lead the fight for equal opportunity. We should take this occasion to educate the youth of today and to reeducate the older of us who may have become complacent and who may have forgotten about the others who gave their lives for the struggle. We need to rededicate ourselves to human rights. civil rights. and equal opportunity for all citizens. It is ironic that this anniversary is commemorated at a time when we have seen several recent Supreme Court decisions that undercut many of the affirmative action programs that were an offshoot of the civil rights struggle of the 1960s. Like the Supreme Court decisions. other events are occurring that attempt to turn back the hands on the civil rights clock. These events teach us that we must be ever vigilant because we cannot rely on past victories to be sustained without continued struggle. We cannot let the deaths of Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner be in vain. Unlike these young men. racial hatred and prejudice are not dead. It may not be as blatant and as open as it was in 1964 and prior but it is nonetheless still an insidious part of our society.",

Mr. Speaker. 25 years ago. three courageous young menJames Chancy. Andrew Goodman. and Michael Schwernergave their lives in the civil rights struggle. They sought racial justice in Mississippirecognizing that the disenfranchisement of black citizens was a pernicious evil. Americans everywhere reacted with outrage at the murders of Chaney. Goodman. and Schwernervictims of senseless racial hatred. We remember Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner when we reflect on the cruel indignities suffered by black Americans that seared our Nations conscience. We remember Chancy. Goodman. and Schwerner when we seek to root out the vestiges of racial intimidation and discrimination and devote our best efforts to the promotion of racial harmony. We remember Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner when we continue their efforts to remove voting barriers and encourage greater participation in the electoral process. \"No right is more precious in a free country.\" the Supreme Court has observed. \"than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which. as good citizens. we must live. Other rights. even the most basic. are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.\" Too many Americans tend to forget that the right to vote is the foundation of our system of government and an essential safeguard for our liberties. The examples of Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner inspire us to help ensure that wider participation in government becomes more of a reality in late twentieth century America. When we succeed in expanding the voting rolls. we reduce the risks that special interests will exercise undue influence over governance. When we inspire others to vote. we reduce the level of public apathy. stimulate discussion of public policy. and make government more accountable to the people. When we seek the participation by Americans everywhere in the electoral process. we recognize that the vitality of our democracy depends on the success of our efforts.

But the problem we have in this one is that it is a tax and that Is the problem we have from a procedural standpoint. The Constitution says a tax has to originate in the House and you cannot put a tax on a Senate bill and expect it to pass. The House feels very strongly about their constitutional position. I was just corrected. I find we have a House bill here. It is not a revenue bill as I understand it. so I think you would run into some serious problems concerning that.

As we have discussed. the bill contains a permanent solution to the prepayment problem. This permanent solution will replace the temporary measure that has been in effect since 1987 and which is set to expire next Wednesday. October 31. Unfortunately. it is highly improbable that the President will sign the National Affordable Housing Act by next Wednesday. Because of the gap in coverage that would arise because of the delay in signing. many owners of federally assisted housing would suddenly be free to prepay their federally assisted mortgages and evict their low income tenants. Needless suffering will be inflicted on thousands of low and moderate income people across the nation. many of whom are elderly. To allow owners a window to prepay at this late date in the process would serve no discernible purpose. The conferees worked long hours to fashion a preservation solution that balances the interests of all the affected parties. The administration participated in the negotiation process and the solution. for the most part. was improved by their participation. I request that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5933. a bill that will extend the existing restrictions on prepayment. Senator DAMATO and I will propose an amendment to change the expiration date from February 1. 1991. to November 30. 1990. The amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle and with the House. Under this extender. current law would expire upon the enactment of the National Affordable Housing Act if that comes first. This language has been worked out in cooperation with the administration.

The literacy bill pased 99 to zero. and the teacher bill passed our full committee 15 to 1. When we see legislation hamstrung this way. legislation I would point out that the President wants. the country wants and which has passed both the Senate and the House by an overwhelming majority. you wonder what is wrong with our system that one or two Senators can hold up the progress this way. This is one of the reasons I think why the Nation as a whole looks at us with some derision because we are Just prevented in this manner from getting passed what the majority of Senators wish. I regret this very much indeed. I am deeply disappointed that the Senate has failed to act on this important legislation. This omnibus education bill contained the Presidents education initiative. the National Literacy Act. and many features of the National Teacher Act. Unfortunately. a small group of conservative Republican Senators has joined together to block this legislation. which is important education legislation that enjoys the support of the President. As I mentioned. this bill contains many proposals put forth by President Bush in his education initiative. These include: Schools of distinction. alternative routes for teacher certification and licensing. assistance for historically black colleges and universities and scholarships to encourage young men and women to enter the teaching profession in math and science. The Senate originally acted upon the Presidents proposal last year. It passed by a vote of 92 to 8. I am proud to have been one of the first Democrats to support the Presidents initiative. I still support it. and still believe it should be enacted. I only wish that every Senator from the Presidents own party concurred.

Both sides of the aisle have worked hard to create a package which was acceptable to the House. the Senate and the White House. Unfortunately we have not been successful in that endeavor.

The role of the President is to set the agenda in education. and use his office to direct the attention of our citizens to the needs of our country. Each citizen is now aware of the importance of a quality education for all students in this country. regardless of economic circumstances. As we review test scores. we see that education needs improvement throughout the entire system. Clearly. we need to improve test scores for those at the lower end of the scale on achievement. and just as clearly. we need to improve the education we provide for students at the higher end of the scale. Part of this improvement must be done by encouraging better qualified individuals to enter the teaching field. We also need to find ways to reward schools and teachers who succeed in raising achievement. reducing the dropout rate and providing school campuses that are drug free. We also need to increase teacher training programs to ensure that teachers in our classrooms are constantly updated both in academic subject matter and the most recent research on successful teaching strategies. We must coordinate and upgrade our efforts in eliminating illiteracy. This bill would have addressed these issues. I hope that each of us will remember the needs of education and move forward in the next Congress to fashion a bill early on to address these needs.

I do hope that in the process of going through these waning days of the session that we are able to address and pass the socalled SEED bill. the Support for East European Democracy. That extremely important piece of legislation has passed. We all looked at it very carefully. It has passed this body. I hope we can get that legislation which will bring to emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. the Bank for Reconstruction and Development. various agricultural assistance programs. access to expanded trade programs. a whole variety of educational. cultural. and scientific exchanges and. very importantly. Mr. President. a whole package of very. very important environmental initiatives and cooperative endeavors. If there is any place in the world where it is absolutely clear that man is able to destroy the environment. and do it very rapidly. all we have to do is look at what has happened in Poland. East Europe. and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union. In a very short period of time. 25 years. a very beautiful and a very mystic section of the world has been rapidly destroyed. Every Member of the U.S. Senate ought to have the opportunity to go there. to look at that damage. to look at the ravaging that has gone on. to understand how sensitive this environment is in which we live. how sensitive the globe is. and what responsibilities we have to nurture it and not destroy it.",

Page 23 of the Executive Overview states. \"... if a lower production rate were to be used and the V22 procurement stretched over a longer period of time. the nearterm costs for the program would be comparable to these for any of the other alternatives.\" 5. This statement compares the V22 program cost in FY 9197 ($7.7 billion) which includes Marine Corps. Navy. and Air Froce V22 procurement and Marine Corps CH53E procurement with an Office of Secretary of Defense alternative ($5.2 billion) containing only Marine Corps and Navy aircraft. 6. The letter compares a slower V22 cost with the SECNAV recommended POM 9297 MLR program. The appropriate comparison would be to the H60/CH53E alternative contained in the Administrations budget request and the COEA. The actual difference is $0.7 billion. vice the $3.7 billion claimed in the letter. 7. This again compares V22 R&D and procurement with R&D only for MLR. The figure of $698 billion is not in the reportit is derived from the report using some unknown Office of the Secretary of Defense method. 8. These figures are based on a procurement of 356 aircraft vice the Marine Corps requirement for 502. which inflates the dollar amount by approximately $3 million per aircraft. 9. Since over 85% of the R&D costs ($2.4 billion) are already sunk. it is not appropriate to include these costs. This methodology used to compute the cost has been applied only to the V22 and not to other programs such as the B2. Light Helicopter Experimental. and C17.",

The reason publicly offered by Dr. Sununu for the position he has successfully urged upon the President is his claim that a reduction In greenhouse gas emissions. or even a stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions. would bring world economic activity to a halt. I am quoting from the Associated Press dispatch out of Houston quoting the other summit participants in saying: The European Economic Community on Tuesday challenged the Bush administration to prove Its contention that taking dramatic steps to halt the warming trend will stall economic growth. Jan Laurens Brinkhorst. Director of Environmental Matters for the European Economic Community. said the facts do not bear out the theory that curbing carbon dioxide emissions will slow economic growth. Brinkhorst said the world economy grew by 25 percent between 1973 and 1986 while energy consumption remained flat. Economists agree. he said. that energy use could be reduced 15 percent to 20 percent in the course of a decade without major economic disruption. I would hope to see. In a serious way. the Europeans and Americans compare notes and actually see what is true. Mr. President. I have made a number of speeches in this Chamber on this same subject. and I intend to continue this series of speeches. I conclude by saying that on this occasion. it is especially disappointing that we have this major missed opportunity after so many hopes were raised in last years economic summit between the G7 participants. and I urge the President of the United States to not rely on John Sununu as his principal environmental adviser. policymaker. and spokesman on the global environment but to rely instead on the individuals. including William Reilly. at EPA. and his science adviser. Dr. Allan Bromley. who have the experience. who have the training. who have the respect of those in their respective fields. and listen to their advice as the basis for policy on this subject.

These communities. whether they are gaining or losing personnel. will need to adjust to the resulting changes. This is most critical to the area schools that depend on Federal impact aid. As you may know. Impact aid is the program by which the Federal Government reimburses local school districts for educating military dependent children. Today. in order to assist the school districts in their adjustments. I am introducing the Community Notification Act. This bill requires the Secretary of Defense to identify by February 1 of each year those local education agencies. such as local school boards. which will experience an increase or decrease in the enrollment of military dependent children. Mr. Speaker. the budget process for a local school district is difficult. It is even more difficult for those districts that rely on Impact aid. As the recommendations of the Base Closure Coinmission begin to be implemented. and the enrollment at local school districts begins to change. the budget process will become even more of a guessing game.

Only this time. seniors will be paying with their health. not their pocketbooks. Actions are now being taken by Members of Congress to introduce expenditure targets into the Medicare system. For those unfamiliar with the term. \"expenditure targets\" simply put means the rationing of health care. \"Expenditure targets\" tell physicians that they can only be paid for treating x amount of patients. Physicians are then left to decide who the lucky patients will be. A decision physicians do not want to make. This is a dubious approach to solving a difficult problem. No one questions the fact that our health care system needs to be reformed. We all agree that rising costs need to be contained. But how should we go about doing this? Should we go forward with a new. untested plan that will deny the elderly adequate care? Should we attempt to balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens? I certainly do not think so.

Amnesty International estimates that approximately 100 ethnic Turks have died since the assimilation campaign began. The assimilation campaign focuses on banning the use of the Turkish language in public. closing mosques. and razing Turkish cemeteries in the hope of wiping out any trace of the Moslem Turkish minority. In addition. the Bulgarian Government is forcing the Turks to renounce their ethnic heritage and change their names to Bulgarian names. Officially. the Turks no longer exist. I cant help but be reminded of the countless deaths of Jews in concentration camps in Germany in the 1940s instigated by Adolf Hitler in an attempt to promote the perfect race. We cannot stand by and let the fervor of this mindless barbarianism escalate to disproportionate levels. Those who forget the past are condemned to relive it. The assimilation campaign by the Bulgarian Government is an abomination to us as a people whose Government is based on democracy. freedom. and justice for all. As an American soldier stationed in Turkey for 1 year. I can attest to the Turks as being strong and faithful friends of the United States. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to demand that Bulgaria account for what Turkish Foreign Minister Mesult Yilmaz has called \"one of the gravest human rights violations of our times.\" Furthermore. we should demand that Bulgaria restore the rights of ethnic Turks to practice their cultural heritage or at least allow them to freely leave Bulgaria. I applaud our Governments suspension of trade talks with Bulgaria until the issue of the forced exodus is addressed and I strongly support Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozals call to keep the TurkishBulgarian border open to allow ethnic Turks the opportunity to return to their native land and bring to a halt the senseless deaths of persecuted Turks in Bulgaria.",

Back in March. the new DirectorAdministrator of Veterans Affairs requested an additional $350 million. In April of this year. the President forwarded to the Congress a dire emergency supplemen. tal request. and now the Congress has continued to play with it. having exploded that $350 million request to over $1 billion. Included in that request are $75 million for a telescope in West Virginia. $1 million for a center for the Navy in landlocked West Virginia. a quarter of a million dollars for a warning system for chemical plants. a quarter of a million dollars for a drought information center. $400.000 for a fire research center. a provision urging the Department of Agriculture to purchase more apples. and a section of other nonemergency items that prevents the veterans from getting the money that the President requested some months ago. I believe that Congress should act this week. We should appropriate the necessary funds to keep our hospitals open for the veterans. We should come back to these other unnecessary items June 20. 1.989 and deal with them directly. and not hold the veterans hostage to this sort of activity.",

But the Physician Payment Review Commission wants to make a bad situation even worse by saddling doctors with expenditure targets. a feeschedule. and limits on balance billing. This is the worst form of price control. Have we not learned anything from past efforts to control medical spending through price administration? In 1983. Medicare began making hospital payments under such an administered price system. The new system was supposed to force wasteful hospitals to operate more efficiently. Instead. record numbers of hospitals closed. mostly in medically underserved areas that could least afford the closures. We should not be shunning the market In the name of cost savings. We should embrace the market. We should be moving toward a capitated system of health care coverage in which individuals can purchase integrated. tailored packages of health care with Medicare assistance. and still retain flexibility and choice. Mr. Speaker. price administration is not working on the hospital side. and it is not going to work on the physician side. We should reject the PPRC recommendations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last Thursday I introduced legislation that would block the Governor of New York States plan to dismantle the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant on Long Island. Why? There are two reasons. First. given the fact that we are on the eve of strengthening the Clean Air Act. America should be weaning itself from its severe dependence upon the burnIng of oil and other fossil fuels. particularly the burning of imported oil for the generation of electricity. In their place. we should be relying on Americanmade. clean. and reasonably priced sources of energysuch as the available 800 megawatts of electricity Shoreham could provide to a foreign oildependent region that faces the threat of brownouts this summer. The second reason Congress should block the plan is because Federal taxpayers are being called in to help pay for the dismantling of Shorehamdespite the fact that its a safe. $5.5 billion facility that has been granted a full power license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Under Gov. Mario Cuomos plan to dismantle Shoreham. the owner of the plant has been granted a $2.8 billion tax writeoff for this year. So. while Congress struggles to keep the deficit down and clean up the environment. Congress also may be complicating its work by allowing Governor Cuomo to pursue his policy of dismantling Shoreham at any cost. American taxpayers and our environment cannot afford this folly. My bill. the Taxpayer and Environment Protection Act of 1989. would work to block the dismantling of Shoreham by disallowing the $2.8 billion Federal tax writeoff on the grounds that the plan to dismantle Shoreham cannot be regarded as a legitimate form of abandonment. The bill also repeals the authority of the Long Island Power Authority to issue Federal tax exempt bonds that would be used to acquire and then dismantle the plant. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Thank you. Mr. Speaker.",

The Peoples Republic of China has $4.7 billion of loans pending and in the pipeline in the World Bank and an additional $1.1 billion is in some state of processing by the Asian Development Bank.

Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying that Chinas policy of economic reforms and its opening to the West will not change. What that attitude says to me.

As a member of the House Select Committee on Aging and the House Rural Health Care Coalition. my statements on the House floor and committee hearings emphasize my continued support to provide all elderly with quality health care. I understand a proposal was approved recently in a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing supporting establishment of expenditure targets for the Medicare Program. One of the most eminent concerns in my congressional district is the threat of hospital closures. How will I explain to my older Americans that they will not only have to travel farther to receive quality care. but be subject to restrictive or rationing of physician services as a means of balancing the Federal budget? Those most at risk will be the elderly and the disadvantaged. Mr. Speaker. let us take a couple of moments to recount Canadas experience with expenditure targets. Although the concept might appear to be appealing. according to Canadian reports. the quality of care provided to its residents is unacceptable and possibly life threatening. Expenditure targets might force a physician to limit or restrict access to health care services. I cannot support a proposal resulting in long delays to obtain necessary medical care. I understand patients in certain Provinces wait 8 to 9 months for coronary bypass surgery.

Despite these wellintentioned efforts by the Ozal government. Turkeys Government is still responsible for the brutal and systematic abuse of human rights. This is the title of a new report by Amnesty International. According to Amnesty: ***Although there has been a civilian government in power for more than five years Amnesty International has not observed any fundamental change in the widespread and systematic use of torture. In the first 10 months of 1988 eight people were reported to have died in custody as a result of torture. This a troubling report. Its pages document the failure of the Government of Turkey to match its international statements condemning torture to a policy that ends its practice. More than 100 prisoners have died in custody between 1980 and 1984. According to Al. alleged torturers were prosecuted and convicted in only 15 of these cases. In other cases. security agents on trial for torture actually received rewards. and even promotions. Turkeys human rights records will continue to be an Issue of concern to Members of Congress and the American people. We have supported the efforts of the Turkish Government in returning the country to a democratic path. The Reagan administration has nurtured a strong political and strategic relationship with that Government. But. the failure to make progress in the human rights areaespecially the failure to end the practice of tortureremains a serious obstacle to a better relationship. I hope that the Government of Turkey will take a long hard look at the findings of this report and respond to the concerns raised by Amnestys mission to that country last year. In the meantime. I commend the report to my colleagues and ask that the introduction to Turkey: Brutal and Systematic Abuse of Human Rights. be printed in the RECORD at this time.",

Social Security retirees aged 62 through 69 are limited in what they may earn each year. Retirees who earn more than the established limits have their benefits reduced $1 for each $2 earned in excess of the thresholf. In 1989. the thresholds are $6.480 for retirees under age 65. and $8.800 for those aged 65 through 69. Retirees aged 70 and older may earn as much as they want without penalty. Mr. Speaker. supporters of the current earnings limitation argue that Social Security was designed to partially replace earnings lost due to a diminished capacity to work. and that a person who continues to work beyond retirement age has no \"need\" for this replacement income. I could not disagree more. It is a sad fact that many of todays retirees either did not. or could not. make adequate financial provisions for retirement. Therefore. they must rely upon Social Security for nearly all of their retirement income. Many more have seen their retirement savings diminished or depleted due to circumstances beyond their control. These people do not want welfare. they want a chance to work.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. another example of our misdirected attempt at tax reform is now surfacing. Section 89 of the Internal Revenuo Code which directs employers with nondiscrimination rules for welfare plans and overhauls the rules. has missed sorely the intent and desire of this body to provide equal benefits for all employees. The Department of Treasury report. due last December. on the administration of these new changes has failed to be completed as of today. I ask my colleagues. how can we proceed with this program when no ground rules have been created? Under section 89. amployers would be required to demonstrate through a group of complicated tests. that their benefit programs do not discriminate against \"nonhighly compensated\" employees. Employers also must ensure equal use of the program by all employees. Section 89 is just another step in the direction of federally mandated. employerprovided health benefits. The pitfalls of this legislation are obvious. The first problem is the overburdening concept of mandating health benefits. It should be the decision of an employer to provide those benefits that he can afford. It is not the role of the Federal Government to tell an employer how to run his business. In a freemarket society. the marketplace will weed out employers who fail to provide adequate wages and benefits while those who do will reap the rewards of quality employees. In addition to the overindulgence of Federal regulations. we must remember that increased Government interference costs businesses thousands of dollars to \"administer in order to comply with section 89. The end result is that the costconscious business will take a position that will lead it to either dropping plans or accepting penalties. Most employers wish to provide certain benefits to all employees. It would be a tragedy if the individuals that section 89 is designed to help turns around and bites them. I am introducing legislation that will postpone this ruling for 1 year. allowing us to study it further and decide if we are on the right track with this legislation. We must postpone it. if for no other reason than to send a message to the business community not to drop their benefit programs and wait until a broader understanding of the implication.: of section 89 are understood.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I. along with Congressman NORM MINETA and several colleagues. will introduce the Airport System Planning Act of 1990. Enactment of this legislation will improve our national airport system capacity through enhanced cooperation in the planning process. Currently. the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA) formulates aviation policy behind closed doors with no input from State and local governments. airport operators. private entities. and private citizens. We seek to change that to ensure that all interested parties are involved in the process. A central theme of the bill is the development of performance measures so that we may accurately determine how our Nations airports are functioning. All other modes of transportation are subject to performance review. it is time for the collection of adequate. accurate data on how our aviation system actually performs. Collection of this data will help identify where our system bottlenecks are. As we identify these bottlenecks. we can work to solve them. We require. in an open door process. the formulation of two new airport system planning documents to replace the current [NPIAS] national plan for integrated airport systems. A strategic 20year plan and a short range 5year capital improvement plan [CIP] will be developed. These plans will identify needs and offer solutions to solve our Nations capacity problems.

I understand the desire of Members of the House to send a strong message to the leadership of Chinathat we condemn the actions taken by those leaders against their own citizens in June 1989 and since. However. I do not believe that cutting off Chinas MFN status hurts the leaders of China. They do not rely on trade with the United States for their livelihood. They do not rely on contacts with Americans to know what the world is like beyond the walls of their compound. Rather. the students and workers of China whose paychecks and knowledge of Western ways comes from contacts with American businesses and institutions would be hurt by such an action. It is no coincidence that those countries in Eastern Europe with the closest trade and economic ties with the United States and other Western .ountriesPoland. Hungary. and East Germanywere the first to overthrow their Communist regimes and push for marketoriented economic systems. Let us not isolate the people of China from America and its influences by cutting off vital trade and investment links with their country. My colleagues will recall that last year. Congress approved a package of sanctions. many of which remain in effect today. Those carefully targeted sanctions have had an effect. China has released nearly 900 political prisoners. hs lifted martial law. and has taken other steps to modestly improve the human rights climate. I will be the first to say that these steps are not enough. But I firmly believe that we have a much greater chance of pushing for change if we remain engaged in China. Cutting off Chinas MFN status will end once and for all the ability of the United States to have an impact on Chinese behavior.

So the human rights issue is the key. and the question is how to get at it. The United States has gotten at it in a variety of ways. Arms exports have been suspended. high level contracts are restricted. World Bank lending is down. high tech exports have been screened and are down. and deferred departure date for Chinese nationals to the United States has been extended. There is one simple fact that we are dealing with here. there is a constant. regular. preordained history of failure using trade sanctions as an individual nation. unless the whole world does it. A perfect example is South Africa. Unilaterally it does not work. unless the whole world does it. and they do. As far as Iraq is concerned. the reason they are working there is because everyone does it. In the early 1980s. sanctions on exports of oil drilling took place against the Soviet Union. They just bought from the Europeans. After Afghanistan. the same thing happened with agriculture. They just brought elsewhere. MFN Is a trade term. nondiscrimination. If we cut this. the Chinese cut us out. They want to deal with us. They do not want to deal with the Japanese. but they will. The question Is how much leverage does this give us with them? It gives us none. the reason being that we do not have anything special. They can buy anything they want from any other place in the world. and that will end our relationship with them and do us naught in our whole relationship. with an extremely important longterm friend.",

Asia Watch and Amnesty International have both said that its emigration policy has become even more restrictive since the massacre last year at Tiananmen Square. The Chinese Constitution does not guarantee freedom of emigration. It is ironic that this administration has asked the Soviet Union to codify an emigration law before it is granted MFN status. What does Gorbachev have to do to get MFN status. massacre his own citizens in Red Square like the Chinese did? That is wrong. That is wrong. To this day the Chinese Government continues to carry out secret executions of political prisoners. There are 10.000 or more political prisoners now being held in Chinese Jails. ISE 30973 There are numerous procedural and monetary barriers to the emigration of Chinese students and other groups. One requirement. a socalled cultivation fee. would require students to pay the equivalent of 8 years of pay in order to go abroad for selffinanced graduate studies. That is how much they want their students to emigrate to the Western World. My colleagues. religious persecution continues. Buddhist monks and nuns are being imprisoned and expelled. China uses the 20 million prisoners in its jails to provide forced. unpaid labor to Chinese businesses. and some of the fruits of their labor reach American ports.

Patrick Henry uttered the phrase for which he is most famous. \"Give me Liberty or give me Death.\" In June 1989. thousands of Chinese students asked for liberty. The Communists gave them death. Since that time. the Chinese Government has made a show of complying with international pressure to correct its system of human rights violations. The release of Fang Lizi. the Governments cooperation with and support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. and the release of some prisoners have been calculated efforts at convincing the international community to return to business as usual with China. But it is precisely because China has returned to business as usual in its internal affairs that it should not be allowed to return to business as usual in its international affairs. Just last month. a total of 1.508 suspects were rounded up by Beijing public security personnel under the pretext that they were trying to sabotage the Asian games. Of these. 250 were college students. Additionally. large numbers of public security personnel were sent onto Beijing University and Qinghua University to report on student activity. Beijing is trying to appease Western opinion by meting out lenient treatment to wellknown intellectuals. but its basic policy of using strongarmed tactics to snuff out dissent remains intact. Until the current Chinese leadership can show that it is improving its record of gross human rights violations. I do not believe they deserve mostfavorednation trade privileges.

This effort supplements an existing Federal rewards program and represents welcome cooperation between the private sector and the U.S. Government. Cooperation is critical in the war on international terrorism and I salute this prudent decision on the part of the airline industry. On May 1. the Air Transport Association [ATA]. a trade organization that represents 23 major U.S. airlines. announced that its members had agreed to augment existing Federal rewards for information leading to the arrest of terrorists. or contributing to the prevention of criminal attacks against the associations member companies. The payment would supplement U.S. Government rewards of up to $2 million that are already available for information about terrorism. The ATAs payment would bring the reward for an individual providing information about planned terrorist attacks to $3 million. The House Foreign Affairs Committee was instrumental in introducing the concept of a rewards payment and last year increased the original payment from an earlier $500.000 to $2 million. The airline fund can be used at the State Departments direction to supplement funds paid to informants about potential airline terrorism overseas. Cooperation is the key element in defeating terrorism. The nations of the world who have been victimized by this menace must work closely togethor in coordinating counterterrorism efforts. In the United States. our Government agencies responsible for antiterrorism activities must closely cooperate and share information with each other. The ATAs recent decision marks a new era of cooperation between the private sector and the U.S. Governent in this aspect of the war on terrorists I commend the following statement by Robert J.

The image of the Salvation Army is not just of a service worker ringing bells at Christmas time or feeding people during emergencies. It is a lot more than that. The Salvation Army reaches all populations as a communitywide rescue mission. The Salvation Army opened its chapter in Saginaw County in 1890 just 10 years after it officially began work in the United States. The Saginaw chapter is now 100 years old. Thats quite an accomplishment. Last year. it worked hard for the needs of 31.000 underprivileged. Since 1890 it has gone beyond providing the necessities of food. clothing. and shelter and emergency service. In 1939. on North Baum Street it opened the first day care center which is still thriving today. In 1959. it opened the first home for the elderly in the United StatesEventide. that existed until 1982. The Salvation Army in Saginaw provides special assistance to lowincome and sick residents. Often. hospitals ask the Army to provide walkers. canes. bandages. prescriptions. and special equipment such as hearing aids and vaporizers. More than 55.000 people use its recreation center and gymnasium yearly. Its day care. preschool. and infant care start at 6:15 a.m. and provide care for 73 children and babies aged 2 months and older. Eightyearold children come after school for a few hours until their working parents pick them up at 5:45 p.m. More than 2.500 white. black. and Hispanic youths come to the different social adjustment programs offered by the Salvation Army. These programs focus on drug prevention. gang wars. and single parent family stress. Of course. the Salvation Army also helped out in the emergencies of the great flood in 1986 by opening its gym to serve meals and provide clothing. When the GM plant in Saginaw was severely damaged by fire. the Salvation Army opened its canteen to feed GM workers. I am very proud of the 22 staff members of the Salvation Army in Saginaw. located at 2030 North Carolina. I am proud to tell my colleagues of the enormous help it has given Saginaw.

I think it is interesting that while the West seems to view Mikhail Gorbachev as some sort of hero deserving of the title \"Man of the Decade\". he is perceived quite differently in his own country. Admittedly. there have been a good number of positive changes in the Soviet Union under Mr. Gorbachev. however. we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Soviet economy was in such a shambles when he came into power that he had little recourse other than to implement such changes. Before we heap too much praise on the man. and before we allow ourselves to alter our foreign policy to please him. we positively must take into account his recent actions in Lithuania. as well as those taken during the AzerbaijanArmenia conflict. The fact of the matter is. that while the Soviet Union says it has changed. it continues down the same repressive path as always. Meanwhile. here in the West we continue to allow ourselves to be brainwashed into believing that the cold war has ended. Please take the time to read the following article which highlights a number of thoughtprovoking statements by one of the Soviet Unions most famous citizens. world chess champion Gary Kasparov.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we are all aware of our trade deficit and the need to lower it. We have heard many speeches in this very Chamber about unfair foreign trade practices which translate into lost American jobs. This is an important issue which Congress must continue to address. but there is another cause of lost Americn jobs which receives little. if any. attention. More shocking still. this impediment to private sector growth is not an overseas corporation playing by a different set of rules. As a practical matter. it is a taxpayersubsidized corporation backed by our Government. It is called the Federal prison industries [FPIJ. or UNICOR. UNICOR has provided prison inmates with work since the mid1930s by manufacturing products and selling them to Federal agencies. The concept behind the programto keep prisoners busy and teach them some work skills which might be applied later in lifewas. and still is. a good one. But UNICOR operations have grown to the point where the very workers and companies which support the program with their tax dollars are being driven out of business. In fact. the problem will become far worse unless we correct it now. as 1989 UNICOR sales-$360 millionare expected to mushroom to $620 million by 1992. This is particularly alarming to me. since more than 40 percent of all UNICOR products compete with goods manufactured by textile. apparel. and furniture workers. North Carolina is the Nations leading manufacturing State. and there are thousands of workers employed in these very industries in my district. How has this happened? Under the current system. UNICOR is essentially accorded a super preference when contracting with a Government entity. This preference forces Federal purchasing agents to buy products from UNICOR without soliciting bids from the private sector. Not only does this take jobs away from taxpayers and taxpaying companies. but. by eliminating the bid system. prevents agencies from comparing prices to ensure that UNICORs are fair market prices. Along with the General Services Administration. UNICOR claims that its products meet the same standards imposed on private sector businesses. but neither organization can document this point. It is time to level the playing field between UNICOR and the private sector. and legislation which I am introducing today. the Federal",

It is a time not only to realfirm and renew our bonds with our past. but to recognize the formation of new ties which beckon toward our future. Heritage Month also is a time for all Americans to reflect on the accomplishments and contributions made by Asian/Pacific Americans. Although the Asian/Pacific American community has faced some tremendous obstacles in the past. over the last several years. through collective work and responsibility. we have overcome many of these difficulties. Each Asian/Pacific American community has its own distinct legacy of cultural heritage. While we are proud Americans dedicated to our lives within this great land of opportunity. we take the time during Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month to participate in the celebration of our Asian cultures. Heritage Month will lead to a more thorough understanding of todays needs and concerns of Asian/Pacific Americans across the country. At the same time. our celebration helps to contribute to a growing appreciation for diversity. not only among Asian/Pacific Americans. but among all Americans. I am confident that Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month will be both enjoyable and entertaining for all those fortunate enough to take part. I highly commend the Asian/Pacific American Heritage Council for their important role in working to create a greater understanding of Asian/Pacific Americans and their role in society. I am proud to be associated with this organization and I am sure that the hertiage council will continue to enrich all of our lives.",

This is not some thing that is unusual or unique. In fact. it is in the law now. Past Congresses have seen the wisdom of allowing a payment schedule under unusual circumstances. and I assert that this is one of them. a situation in which we had absolutely devastating drought in this country in 1988 and 1989. In my State. even with the payments that the Senator from Indiana referenced. even with hundreds of millions of dollars of payments. North Dakotas farm income was cut in half. That is how devastating the drought was In my State. and my State was not alone. Mr. President. we are simply asking that what is already law be invoked. I must ask. under what circumstances would we Invoke this law if not now. if not under this set of facts? My goodness. this is a devastating loss. Prices skyrocketed. but farmers did not have the production to sell. So they were forced to have advance payments repaid. when they had no money to make the repayments.

We specifically on page 9. line 4. establish research education and technology transfer projects. We also have $40 million In our amendment just as in the original bill. I think the key thing you want to remember about our approach is the use of the Extension Service well grounded in every county in the United States for the dissemination of Information. I know that there is a very good organization of people in lowinput agriculture trying to get their information out. I think they do a pretty good job of it. If the intention of the committees bill is to help them get their information out even better than they are presently doing. I do not find fault with that. That is a very worthy goal. But how can you deny that the Extension Service. of all the organizations in rural America. is better prepared to get Information disseminated than any other organization? It seems to me like we ought to take that strong and rural America and build on It. and that Is what my amendment does. Also. I wish to make very clear the organizations in low input agriculture in trying to get their information out. Just this summer in my State several of these farmers held field days where people from all over the State of Iowa or I guess from any place that could come on a specific day on a specific farm and see how lowinput agriculture was working on that specific farming operation. These were staggered in different parts of the State on a different day. So that any farmers who wanted to take advantage of seeing what was involved could actually see demonstrations.

And It Just seems to me that we are talking about a rather reasonable. broadly defined. as a matter of fact. definition of these inputs. and that we are not proscribing in any way that a farmer must select In all cases.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there are rumors all over this place this evening that we are about to get a new budget. although no one seems quite willing to admit what is in it. but the rumor is we are going to remove. at least part of it will be to remove $10 billion from revenues and $10 billion from entitlements to create what is called a $20 billion plug. and that $20 billion plug will be given over to the Committee on Ways and Means to do with whatever it likes. including raising taxes by $20 billion. Mr. Speaker. if there was any message from the rejection by a majority of both Democrats and Republicans of the last budget deal to reach this floor just a couple of nights ago. it was that the American public is not willing to have its taxes raised. If they were not willing to have the taxes raised by the amount that was rejected two nights ago. then a fortiori. they are not willing to have them raised by $20 billion more. It seems to me that this rumor that we are hearing about it. if in fact it is true. is a nonstarter from the beginning. If that is what the Democratic leadership wants to bring to this floor. the American people are going to reject it. and I suggest that this House also will reject it.",

The good news is that happily the space shuttle mission Discovery is progressing nicely. We have launched the Ulysses probe in a very complicated and tricky set of maneuvers on the way to the planet Jupiter. and then using the gravitational pull of Jupiter it will accelerate the speed of the spacecraft. throwing it out of the solar plane at a 90degree angle so that we will be able to take measurements of a part of the universe that we have never been able to. below the solar plane and above the solar plane. I say happily. certainly for those of us who want to understand more about our universe. this is a happy occasion. It is also a happy occasion in that NASA has had such a publicrelations problem recently with the hydrogen leaks. with the flaw that was discovered in the original manufacturing of the Hubble Space Telescope some 10 years ago. but now I think we are starting to put it into perspective and to see that. in a complicated research kind of program. we are able to get it together and go on and do what Americans do best. and that is release our spirit as discoverers and explorers.

The movie was called \"The Sound of Music.\" In there you will remember that the nun said. \"When God closes the door. he leaves a window open.\" I think with all of this discussion that all of America should focus on the big problem. Eightyseven percent of the people in America want a budgetbalancing amendment to the Constitution. Last July 17. we were able to force a vote through a lot of maneuvering and get a public record. In that public record. which I have right here. we came within seven votes of passing a budgetbalancing amendment to the Constitution. I have a feeling that even though this looks like all of these bad things are happening and we are going to reach a temporary resolution to the problem. and next year. maybe even before this session is over. we will be able to use the public sentiment who is standing by and watching all of this and getting a budgetbalancing amendment to our Constitution so we will not have to go through all of this stuff again.",

You are voting on process. so let the committees of this House operate. Every Member will have the opportunity to vote when the reconciliation bill comes out. That is when you can express yourself.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is a new budget deal in the works. but in terms of Its effect on reducing the deficit It is not much different than the previous plan. This new budget deal still requires a $40 billion cut in the deficit in the first year. and $500 billion over the 5 years of the program. The changes are not drastic. The changes simply allow more flexibility for the Committee on Ways and Means to decide how to apportion the Medicare and tax provisions. The changes make it clear that while there are spending caps on defense and domestic spending. there are no floors. If we want to vote for less and to cut the deficit more. we are allowed to do that. The new deal makes It clear that we are expected to offset the cost of Desert Shield with contributions from other nations. and that any new initiatives must be done on a payasyougo basis. In other words. no new spending unless there are cuts to offset that spending. So we basically achieve the objective of deep deficit reduction with a little added flexibility In how we get there.

No Federal employees would be furloughed. We would only be cutting spending in discretionary amounts such as travel money. And the administration has said: If a continuing resolution covering the period October 6 through October 12. 1990. is passed that implements a sequester which on an annual basis would equal a reduction in spending of $40.1 billion (the 1991 savings of the BiPartisan Budget Agreement). the Presidents senior advisers will recommend that he sign it. Now. my only point is this: On behalf of the Republicans. I think on behalf of the President. there are millions of Americans who want to go to the national parks. there are thousands of Americans in this city who planned their vacations to be able to go to the Smithsonian. to the Washington Monument. There are Americans who want to do a variety of things Monday morning. If this Congress. if the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate would simply this evening pass a signable continuing resolution which would cut nothing except travel money. not a single Federal employee would be furloughed.

This Week about Rachel Vermillion. an extraordinary woman who has voted In every election since women were granted the right to vote in 1921. Mrs. Vermillion. a strong supporter of womens rights. was 31 when she was first given the right to vote in the 1921 Presidential elections. She voted for Warren Harding and later listened to the election returns on the radio. The 1921 election returns were the first ever broadcast. Sixtyseven years later Mrs. Vermillion has never missed an opportunity to exercise her privilege to vote. As she signed the register book on November 8. 1988. Mrs. Vermillion remarked. \"I always look forward to this and I always want to vote.\" Furthermore. Rachel Vermillion has instilled the importance of voting to all members of her family. The Vermillion family has a long and rich his. tory of participating in politics. Mrs. Vermillion ran for police judge in 1941. the first woman to run for an office In Corbin. KY. and she finished second in the six man race. Her husband was a county magistrate and her son. Dick Vermillion. is Corbins city manager. Rachel Vermillion turned 98 a few days after the 1988 election and she will be nearing 102 when the 1992 Presidential elections are held. I have no doubt that if at all possible Mrs. Vermillion will be at the polls ready to exercise her right to vote. Rachel Vermillion is a fine example to all generations of the patriotic devotion we should all have to exercise our privilege and right to vote. I cornmend her to my colleagues today.",

The Minnesota Kidney Institute members were not the only Minnesotans who recognized the need for aid to the people of Armenia. Over 150 tons of clothing were donated by Minnesotans. and were collected by churches. community groups. and corporations. This effort was unmatched throughout the United States. It is with great pride that the Minnesota medical communityand all Minnesotanspay tribute to this talented group of professionals. who were so generous with their knowledge. compassion. and time.

I had earlier told the majority leader that I felt at best the Senate could go out about 5 or 5:30. at the time the reception began. so we would have a good attendance of Senators. But my staff is of the opinion that it is going to take a couple of hours to prepare the premises for that reception. It will occur in the reception room just off the Chamber here. and it will also spill over to the LBJ Room. S211. So the majority leader now. with the concurrence of the distinguished minority leader. has agreed to have the Senate come in at 2 p.m. This will allow the Senate to have some morning business and then go out. hopefully around 3 or 3:30. This will give my staff then the opportunity and the time to prepare for the reception. I do hope that all 100 Senators will be able to attend. and their spouses. Mr. President. I thank both leaders for the support that they have given to the publication of this volume. It is volume I. and I believe that the people will. in reading it. understand the great amount of time and effort that have gone into the preparation of it. This book is 800 pages in length. including the footnotes and index. with 270 illustrations. many of which are in color. It contains 39 chapters and weighs 7 pounds. and it will be followed by 2 or 3 volumes in due time. I again thank both leaders.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a genuine pleasure for me to welcome to our Nations Capitol Father Anthony S. Dranginis. pastor of St. Alphonsus Church in Baltimore. MD. who offered the opening prayer. Father Dranginis has dedicated his life in service to our country and to his church. He received his bachelor of arts degree in history from Marianapolis College in Thompson. CT. in 1939. and received a scholarship to attend Kaunas University in Lithuania in the fall of 1939. However. the beginning of World War II prohibited him from pursuing his studies in Lithuania. Instead. he became a chemist assistant. and later entered the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943. He served our country with distinction in Saipan. Iwo Jima. and Okinawa until the end of the war. In 1947. he came to Baltimore. where he became very active in the Lithuanian community. assisting Lithuanian immigrants in resettling in the United States. He also was active in Lithuanian Post 154 of the American Legion. and became commander of that post in 1949. As commander. he helped develop the Post Everlasting Services at the installation of new officers. which is still part of the American Legion State Convention every year. While working with the Lithuanian community. Father Dranginis saw his true calling. In 1951. he entered Mount St. Marys Seminary and was ordained as a priest on May 26. 1956. Assigned to St. Alphonsus Parish. he spent 32 years of his priesthood in service to this church. first as assistant pastor and now as pastor. Also. he writes a column for a weekly Lithuanian newspaper. and his column. \"The Chaplains Comer.\" appears in several publications. including the Free State Warrior. the American Legion magazine. and the Department of Maryland Monthly Journal. I want to thank Father Dranginis for being with us today. and to wish him continuing success in his dedicated work both in the church and in the community.",

George Washington. Today this city is. once again. the murder capital of the country. with accelerating carnage and random violence. More than 50 people have been murdered already this year. That is intolerable. Mayor Marion Barry correctly now admits that there are parts of the city that one should avoid as unsafe. Gross inefficiency and corruption are endemic in this city and drug dealers now. apparently. are threatening the lives or safety of local public officials. Since there is no chance that a Republican can be elected Mayor of Washington. DC. I call upon the Democratic Members to bring their influence to bear to seek Mayor Barrys resignation. or as a minimum to find candidates to defeat him at the polls. By the people he has hired for his administration. and especially by his personal conduct. he has sent the message to the young people of Washington. DC. and all its residents. that he tolerates corruption. abuse of power. and the drug culture. He seems to say. \"Do as I say. not what I do.\" The police are undercut and hamstrung. The judicial system is tragically deficient. The Mayor seems to answer any criticism or serious reform effort with the charge that it is racially motivated. My Democratic colleagues. Mayor Barrys personal and mayoral leadership failures are resulting in hundreds of personal tragedies in the city every day. The current situation will shortly and irresistibly tempt the Congress to reassert Federal control over the governance of the Nations Capital City. If the Mayor cant restore order in the streets and an acceptable degree of safety for the citizens and other visitors to this city. the Federal Government must. I challenge my Democratic colleagues to find a political solution to the tragic leadership void that now exists in the city where Congress conducts its business.",

The bill will help nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to acquire low income projects threatened by the prepayment of HUDsubsidized mortgages and the termination of HUD low income housing subsidies. Unless Congress acts at once to preserve existing low income housing. more than 300.000 low income families nationwide could end up on the streets in the next few years. We simply cant afford to let these threatened units slip away. In the counties in our districts. the potential loss is over 17.000 units alone. And I assure you. congressional districts all over the country face the same imminent crisis. The Federal Government became partners with private owners to build these low income projects. and it has a responsibility to make sure these units remain low income. Our bill provides a sound way for the Federal Government to help States and local governments put threatened low income units into the hands of groups committed to retaining their low income character. It is time for the Federal Government to rededicate itself to providing affordable housing for every low income family. Congress can take an important first step by preserving low income housing that already exists.",

August 8. 15 years ago President Nixon went before the Nation In a televised 16minute press conference that had an estimated viewing audience of between 110 to 130 million viewers. In this famous address Nixon admitted to the American public that he had made some bad decisions. Because of these bad decisions he decided that the proper thing for him to do was to resign from office. He stated that he was resigning not because he was guilty of any crimes but because he \"no longer possessed a strong enough political base In Congress\" to fulfill the duties of the office of President. After the announcement of Nixons resignation Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski released a statement saying that the possibility of Immunity from prosecution had not played a part In Nixons decision to leave office. \"There has been no agreement or understanding of any sort between the President and his representatives and the special prosecutor relating In any way to the Presidents resignation.\" the statement read. No understanding of this sort had been asked for or offered. The resignation marked the defeat of Nixons attempt to concentrate power into his own hands. Nixon and his aids all considered themselves above the law. unhindered by constitutional limitations. By resigning for what he termed bad judgment. Nixon highlighted the reason why he had to leave office. Nixon was unable to see the office of President as an arm of govemment under the Constitution. He was unable to understand that as President he had to obey all laws just as all other citizens do. He was unable to see that he was guilty of crimes. not just bad judgment that led to the commission of crimes for which he was ultimately responsible. 29059 G9031 (Pt. 14) What eventually did Nixon In was his allconsuming quest for power that warped his judgment.

I believe that the United States has continued to play a positive role. However. Members of Congress and the administration have recently raised the U.S. profile in Middle East politics. The moment calls for patience and understanding. not criticism. Leaders all over the Middle East have varying sensitivities. Israels leaders must maintain the confidence of Israeli voters. Anyone in Washington certainly knows about the sensitivities created by this situation. Mr. President. the time has come for U.S. officials to pursue Americas role as a facilitator of peace in a more subtle way. This statement is a criticism of no one. and I state this categorically.

Jr.. of Woonsocket. recognized Bobs potential and brought him from New York to head the citys Department of Planning and Development nearly 20 years ago. In this case. clearly our loss will be New Yorks gain and I wish Bob and his family all the best. He has left Rhode Island with a legacy of new and beautiful parks and conservation areas. as well as a heightened awareness and commitment to environmental protection. We owe him congratulations for a job that has been truly well done. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Providence Journal of April 17 and an editorial from the Woonsocket Call of April 17 be printed in the REconn.",

I would like to pay tribute today to Rhode Island letter carrier Patrick Coyle who on a biting cold day this winter with the wind chill factor below zero. averted a potential tragedy by assisting an elderly man who had fallen outside his home and was unable to get back on his feet. I would like to share with my colleagues an article which appeared in the February issue of the Postal Record. the monthly magazine of the National Association of Letter Carriers. describing the quick action of Patrick Coyle. a Wakefield. RI. branch 3602 member. Our Nations army of letter carriers provides services which go far beyond the delivery of mail. Letter carriers take an active interest in the individuals encountered on their daily routesan interest which can often lead to saved lives. Letter carriers regularly check on elderly and disabled patrons along their routes. Often. a letter carrier is the only daily contact these individuals have with the outside world. Letter carriers also perform an important public service by being on the constant lookout for missing children. There are many stories that I could recount which have happy endings because of the action of a letter carrier like Patrick Coyle. Patrick Coyle examplifies the fine letter carrier tradition of outstanding service to the public and I am proud to recognize his efforts here today. Mr. President. I ask that the text of the article be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

Twentyeight years ago it was my privilege to be the first American to orbit the Earth and see it as a beautiful bluegreen ball silhouetted against the vastness of space. I have never forgotten that sight nor the experience of seeing our planet as a delicately balanced spacecraft Earth which must be kept healthy. whole. and unharmed if we are to have a future in the universe. We have come a long way since the first Earth Day in 1970. The environmental movement has grown in stature. scope. and public support during those years. but the greatest challenge still lies ahead. VA th our advanced technologies and information management systems we command enormous power for altering the soil. forests. water. atmosphere. and ecosystems of the planet. These powers can be used either to preserve or destroy our Earthand the choices are ours. The great value of Earth Day celebrations is that they prepare us to make those choices. Across my State of Ohio. individuals. students. businesses. environmental groups. and others are participating in a range of activities to highlight ways to find solutions for the environmental problems we face and to make the choices that will preserve our environment for future generations. Mr. President. 20 years ago Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency as a response to what was perceived as a serious and growing pollution problem that threatened the health and wellbeing of the American people. On January 23 of this year. I introduced legislation to transform the Environmental Protection Agency into a new Cabinetlevel department. the Department of the Environment. I believe that this measure. like the thousands of Earth Day participants in Ohio and across the land. affirms our commitment to the environment. I believe that our commemoration of Earth Day 1990 demonstrates that we have the energy and the resources to Imagineand the determination to achievenew and better ways of living on and caring for our priceless legacy.

    "speech": "Madam President I rise today to voice my overall support for the minimum wage bill. We rarely pass out a bill that I think is flawless. and unfortunately. while this bill is an improvement over current law. it is definitely flawed. After 8 years with no change in the minimum wage. I believe that it is clearly time for Congress to raise that wage for the millions of working poor In America. Every person who works hard deserves a livable wage. Today we take a step forward In returning the national minimum wage to a level that is livable. I continue to support higher minimum wage levels and hope that. in the future. Congress will be more responsive in adjusting the wage to meet the evolving needs of our lowest paid workers. I have deep concerns with the concept of the \"training wage\" for workers under 20. I have opposed the subminimum wage since I first came to the Senate. The subminimum wage is a flawed concept. and will hurt many students who are trying to save money for college and those launching a young marriage. Why should a 19yearold get paid only 85 percent of a 20yearolds salary for doing the same Job? The U.S. Government should not be in the business of promoting age discrimination. In the future. we must look beyond direct compensation of minimum wage workers and look at the total compensation package for these employees. Health insurance rates are rising at a rate that is quickly making health Insurance a luxury that lowwaged workers simply cannot afford. We need to consider ways to encourage employers to broaden their package of benefits to lowwage employees. Today we take a step in the right direction toward bettering the living conditions of Americas lowwage workers. I commend the leaderships work in breaking the longstanding impasse on this issue. I hope that we can continue to cooperate on other issues so we may quickly dispose of budget reconciliation and the debt limit.

Madam President. earlier in the day I announced my intention to offer an amendment to the minimum wage bill which amendment would require that pay raises for Members of Congress be secured only by rollcall vote In each body. Madam President. this is the selfsame amendment which was adopted by the Senate back in February by a vote of 95 to 5. Unfortunately at that time the House chose not to act on it and the proposal never became law. The purpose of the amendment is. as I have said. very simply to require a rollcall vote in each House on the measure to raise the salary of Members of Congress. Madam President. having discussed the matter with the majority leader and the Republican leader. I am Inclined that I need to amend this. Since things changes since I wrote this. I chose not to offer the amendment based on certain assurance on part of the leadership. The leadership have expressed commitment to supporting that amendment when offered to the pay raise ethics bill which Is expected from the House in the near future and furthermore on their commitment to secure a rollcall vote on that amendment when I offer It to that bill. Madam President. I have agreed to modify the amendment to make a distinction between pay raises and COLA adjustments. Thus. the modified amendment would not apply to annual costofliving adjustments. consistent with those provided to other Government employees. Regarding the pay raise bill expected shortly from the House. I have been assured by the leadership that the leaders in both Houses on both sides anticipate that the House bill will not contain any provisions extraneous to matters of the COLAs. honoraria. gifts. travel expenses. financial disclosure. and things of that narrow nature. It is. further. their expectation that the House bill will be approved or disapproved by a rollcall vote in the House and that the Senate version if it is different. the Senate version in any event will be approved or be disapproved by rollcall vote In the Senate.

Despite their efforts. a gap remains before the fishing industry fully utilizes the boat harbors that are near completion and generates the employment and income stream neces. sary to sustain the villages.

    "speech": "Mr. President. all of us are awed by the accelerating changes in East Germany. The irresistible desire of individuals for liberty has met the immovable object of a hostile government. and the immovable object has moved. A quarter century ago. President Kennedy traveled to West Berlin. He spoke about the Berlin Wall and about the indivisibility of liberty. He understood that when people anywhere are unjustly denied their freedom. the rest of us are not truly free. With four simple majestic words-\"Ich bin ein Berliner\"-he touched the hearts and hopes of Berliners and millions of others everywhere who yearn for liberty and justice. Now. the Government of East Germany has heeded that yearning and announced dramatic and historic steps toward its fulfillment. Friends of freedom everywhere welcome the announcement that the government will open its borders. will permit citizens to travel freely. and will move toward free and democratic elections. For two and a half decades. the Berlin Wall has symbolized the repression of the people of East Germany and the other nations behind the Iron Curtain. But the forces of freedom are too powerful to be denied. Over the past few weeks. one astounding event after another has proved the validity of this enduring truth. The people of East Germany deserve their freedom. no less than their brothers and sisters in Poland. Hungary. and all the other nations of Eastern Europe. Todays developments demonstrate again the invincibility of the human spirit. The concrete and barbed wire of the Berlin Wall are no match for the ideas of liberty and democracyand soon. we hope. the Wall itself will come tumbling down as well. I ask unanimous consent that the text of President John F. Kennedys remarks in West Berlin on June 26. 1963. regarding the Berlin Wall be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. for 27 years the Berlin Wall has stood as a symbol of the forces that seek to oppress man and destroy his spirit. It is a montrous mass of stone that has laid a ponderous weight on the conscience of the world. For three decades. men and women all over the free world have asked how a postwar era of progress and tolerance in onehalf of the world could coexist with an era of brutal repression and nightmarish terror in the other half. Mr. President. today. we have our answer: They cannot coexistbecause the yearnings of the human heart will always triumph in the long run over the power of intolerance. The Communist iceberg of hatred. mistrust and oppression is breaking up. The Berlin Wall that is falling today is just a symbol. but it is a very powerful one. So as we watch it crumble. lets reflect on the fact that Just as we were all Berliners in 1962 when the Wall divided us. we are all Berliners todayso lets extend a hand to our East German brothers and sisters who are blinking in the powerful light of liberty.",

This legislation would amend section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to include the St. Marys River for study as a potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Wild and Scenic Rivers System was created in 1968 to prevent the despoiling of Americas last remaining pristine and freeflowing waterwaysin particular those with outstanding scenic. fish and wildlife. recreational. geological. historical. cultural. or other similar values. Mr. President. I believe that if any river in this country qualifies to be studied for this purpose. the St. Marys does. It has already been included in the Nationwide Rivers Inventory published by the National Park Service in 1982. It is described in the inventory as an attractive. clear. subtropical swamp river with varied and colorful flora and white sandbarsand was noted for having remarkable values In every category. The river. which forms the boundary between Georgia and Florida. flows for 120 miles from the Okefenokee Swamp directly into the Atlantic Ocean near the Cumberland Island National Seashore. It is home to varied wildlife. including many threatened and endangered speciesfrom the bald eagle to the redcockaded woodpecker. from the Florida black bear to the West Indian manatee. Presently human population and development are sparse for most of the length of the river. until it reaches St. Marys. GA. and Fernandina. FL. at the coast. We have an excellent opportunity to maintain the higher reaches of this natural treasure in a condition very close to their wild state. This is. however. a limited opportunity.

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier I mentioned that House Members have been incurring mail costs four times that of Senate Members. Simply put. the cost figures demonstrate that for each congressional mailing constituents receive from their U.S. Senator. they are getting four from their Representative. Under the funding levels provided under the fiscal year 1990 legislative branch appropriations bill. the House will receive $44.5 million for official mail while the Senate will have $24 million available for its use. In reality. the Senate mail account should be twice as large as the House mail account as two Senators represent the same constituent represented by a single House Member. When considering House and Senate Members mail costs. comparing on a per constituent or per capita basis is the only way to fairly assess mail costs as total dollar figures do not reflect the difference in population between a congressional district and a State. In order to compare mail costs on a per constituent basis. the Senate account must be divided by onehalf to compare with the House as each U.S. citizen from a State is represented by three elected officials in Congress. one in the House and two in the Senate. In recent years. House Members. on average. have been spending approximately four times the amount being spent by Senators on a per constituent basis. Mr. President.

For the past 40 years. Reverend Battle and his wife Rev. Willa Battle have faithfully served the Minneapolis/St. Paul community in many capacities. In 1949. Reverend Battle founded the Gospel Temple Church in St. Paul. a truly successful beginning to a stellar career of devout service. Nine years later. he founded the House of Refuge in Minneapolis. and most recently established a modern day radio congregation. with a Sunday morning program \"Your Church of the Air.\" In addition to ministering to his congregations. Reverend Battle has also been active outside the church. working with local youths extensively. In addressing the need for inner city youth to obtain experience necessary to land decent Jobs. he was key in organizing \"Institute of Learning.\" an onthejob training program. Battles service extends far beyond the Twin City Metro area. for in 1957 he started a mission to help the spiritually needy in Haiti. This mission has expanded from 100 churches in the beginning. to a current count of Through his infinite capacity to care. and endless patience to listen. Rev.

It has been only a little more than a year since Pakistan began the transition from military rule to democracy. yet this weeks events show how far democracy in Pakistan has come in so little time. Never before in the Nations 42year history has a noconfidence vote been held. In previous confrontations. civilian rule has often been replaced by military rule. What we have witnessed this week marks a fundamental shift for Pakistan. away from contests between democratic and antidemocratic forces. and toward democratic opposition. Prime Minister Bhutto and the Islamic Democratic Alliance are to be applauded for choosing democratic means to resolve their differences. By confining their confrontation to the National Assembly. they have demonstrated their democratic convictions. They have also shown those who doubt the durability of Pakistans democracy that it has the resilience to withstand open democratic debate. The results of the vote show that a viable democratic opposition exists in Pakistan. It is important for us In dealing with emerging democracies to recognize and encourage the development of democratic alternatives. And it is important for Pakistan to know that we recognize and appreciate the vitality of its democracy. A divergence of views is fundamental to democracy. but so also is the tolerance of democratic opposition.

Evidently. free speech. free elections. and free travel do not win the approval of the great dictator. Well. Mr. President. if Castro was sad yesterday. he must be weeping tears of deep sorrow today. because we have now received word that the icon of the cold war. the Berlin Wall. has been transformed into a useless monument to the foolishness of communism. The East German politburo has announced that East Germanys heavily armed. bristling frontier with the West will be opened prior to passage of a law enabling all East Germans to travel to the West. No longer will the East German Communist Party be able to boast to its own people of the socalled achievements of socialism. for East Germans will be free to cross the border with West Germany and to compare and contrast the achievements of democracy and of communism. However. as we applaud the opening of the Berlin Wall and as we look forward to the hopeful demolition of this symbol of national imprisonment. it is only proper that we remember the many men and women who died on the Berlin Wall. We now see thousands exiting East Germany with their possessions. but let us not forget an earlier generation of East Germans who faced a much more daunting task in seeking entry into the West. men and women who tunnelled under. climbed over and flew over the Berlin Wall. Sadly. many died on the barbed wire. killed by border guards. mines. and cowardly booby traps. If the Berlin Wall is ever truly demolished. I would hope a small piece would be allowed to remain as a monument to these brave men and women. However. Mr. President. I do not mean to cast a somber note on todays news. To the contrary.

On this day. the school district will pay special recognition to the 198889 teacher of the year. Joyce Gordon. The Teacher of the Year Award is given to a teacher who has demonstrated outstanding teaching and has gone above and beyond the call of duty. Mrs. Gordon is such a person. She is a teacher who understands the complexities that go into the learning process. More importantly. she understands children. To quote Mrs. Gordon: All children can learn. All need differing amount of time. repetition. or experience. It gives me great Joy to hear a child say. \"How come I understand it when you show me?\" I believe that teaching is an art. mediated by science. Adults can see the science. tempered by the art. but children feel the art and respond with their hearts to the science. On May 18. the school district will also host a celebration In honor of \"Classified Employees Day.\" At this meeting instructional aides. secretaries. clerks. maintenance staff. and cafeteria workers will be honored for their commitment and dedication to education. They are to be commended for their contributions to the needs of the students In the school district. The welfare and safety of our young people in our schools is protected by these outstanding employees. It takes special people to care for and educate our Nations students.

Mr. Paul Harcar. a native of New Castle. was able to contribute a good deal of expertise in the labor world in a variety of ways before his retirement in February of In his 40 years as an active member of the International Association of Machinists. Paul represented this union in many ways. In serving as a business agent for district 109. Paul was able to negotiate many contracts for approximately 10 different locals in the district. He also handled all thirdstep grievance and arbitration cases in this position. For 18 years. Paul served as a board business representative for District Local 106. He also served as president for Labor Local 1671. As a result of these many contributions. Paul was asked to serve as a trustee of both the Machinist Union 2178 and the AFLCIO of Lawrence County. Paul did not limit himself to the business concerning labor unions though. he was also very active in many community projects and organizations as well. In 1982 as Western Pennsylvania was experiencing some hard times Paul was on the steering committee and the board of the Labor Council Food Bank. He also served on the United Fund Board of Lawrence County during this period. Paul sincerely worked hard to help the unemployed members and the less fortunate in his community. Politically. Paul served on many phone banks throughout the years in an effort to promote and elect strong leadership to government office. Within his busy life. Paul also found time to serve his country as an active member of the Pennsylvania National Guard. After serving from July. 1947 to July. 1950. Paul received an honorable discharge. When Paul Harcar retired from the union. he left behind a tradition of respect. admiration. and integrity. From his work with the unions. to his dedication to community service. Paul personifies human excellence. I take pride in calling Paul a friend and would like to take this opportunity to wish he and his family much health and happiness in years to come.",

As we begin the process of considering legislation and regulations on animal welfare issues in this Congress. we will miss one of those caring and reasonable people who have contributed so much in the past.

A native of Reading. PA. Fay Brisk began her career as a reporter for the Reading Eagle and the Philadelphia Record. and later joined the Womens Army Corps as a public information officer. In 1947. she moved to Washington. DC. and joined the Economic Cooperation Administration as a press officer.

Lack of transport is one of the gravest problems facing the worlds underdeveloped and debtridden countries. The virtual absence of this fundamental need adversely affects the heaIth. wellbeing. and economic productivity of hundreds of millions of impoverished human beings. For millions of families the daily reality requires hours of hand carrying heavy loads of water and firewood located miles from their dwellings. The respected international assistance organization. Save the Children. finds a lack of transport to critically undermine essential health services. For example. the absence of vehicles leave health posts without medicines. mobile vaccination campaigns are not carried out. the sick are not transferred to medical attention. and much disease prevention and health promotion goes untapped because people cannot visit health centers.",

Today country music has also gained International appeal. spreading across our planet.

Over 2.200 radio stations In America are fulltime country music stations. up 92 percent over a decade ago. From the Soviet Union to Australia people love country music. People always know about my home city. Nashville. TN. because it is the home of country music. Since being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. I have had the opportunity to visit many parts of the world. More than once Ive had foreign citizens ask me. \"Do you really know Johnny Cash?\" This illustrates the unique \"Americanism\" of country music. It is a musical style that was bom in the hills of Tennessee. Virginia. and the Carolinas. Country music draws its roots from religious hymns. traditional ballads. folk songs. and even the soulfulness of rhythm and blues. and embodies the spirit of America. In fact. there is nothing more American than applie pie. our flag. and country music. I am proud to represent \"Music City U.S.A..\" the home of country music. I am also proud to present House Joint Resolution 401 to declare October as \"Country Music Month\" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

I would also like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a recent decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of this injustice. On July 26. 1941. President Roosevelt issued a military order. pursuant to the Philippine Independence Act of 1934. calling members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of the United States Army Forces of the Far East under the command of Lt. Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Following the Presidents order. the United States assumed responsibility for pay and supplies for the Philippine Army. For almost 4 years. over 100.000 Filipinos fought alongside the allies to reclaim the Philippine Islands which proceeded to the eventual downfall of Japan. Congress rewarded these Commonwealth Army veterans for their exemplary service by limiting their benefits to serviceconnected disabilities and death compensation. And for those limited benefits that are available. members of the Philippine Army are paid on a peso for dollar rate. reducing the value of the benefits by 50 percent. This compares to the dollar for dollar rate and full veterans benefits for members of the \"Old\" Philippine Scouts.",

One of the eight veterans she was transporting on August 24. 1988. suddenly suffered a heart attack. Nancy immediately notified the sheriffs department of her situation. pulled off the highway. and administered first aid to the victim while keeping the other passengers calm. A rescue squad arrived. gave the victim oxygen. and rushed him to the hospital. According to doctors. Nancy Evans quick action saved the mans life. Mr. Speaker. in a way. this action surprised no one who knows Nancy Evans. She goes out of her way to care for the veterans she takes to the VA hospital. even making sure their prescriptions are filled. She visits veterans who were kept at the hospital. and gives others rides home in her own car. Nancy Evans had proven her compassion a thousand times long before last August. While recuperating. the man whose life she saved wrote a local veterans official and said \"We could use a few more Nancys in our world today.\" Indeed we could. Mr. Speaker. The Hudson Mohawk Counties Council Veterans of Foreign Wars has nominated Nancy Evans for a citation for her heroic deed. I ask this House to echo that effort by joining me in paying tribute to a true American heroine. an angel to veterans. Nancy Evans of Glens Falls. NY.",

    "speech": "legislation. H.R. 1245. would provide producers who have a feed grain base the option of planting any feed grain on their base acreage. This would enable producers to respond to market conditions and produce more oats or barley as the market demands without having to lose existing base or take years to establish an oats or barley base. The 1985 Farm Bill required the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a target price for barley feed value relative to corn. In setting the target price. the USDA does not include the food uses for barley. another reason that malt barley marketings should not be used in determining the deficiency calculation. In fact. the established target price is based on feed value ratios which are nearly 20 years old. Through public and private research. barley varieties have improved substantially over the past 20 years. and the current values used by the USDA are no longer accurate. Additionally. the USDA should include the entire feed value of a feedstuff. including digestible energy. protein. and amino acids. Current research indicates that barley is 104 percent of the feed value of corn in ruminants when the entire feed value is calculated. Overall. this legislation will address the current problem by eliminating malt barley marketings from the deficiency payment calculation for 1989. and readjust the target price for the 1990 crop year. The offsetting reduction in costs of shifting plantings from corn or sorghum to barley or oats would make these two bills largely budget neutral. I urge my colleagues to add their support to my legislation and that of Mr. JOHNSON SO that we can address a serious problem for farmers and bring about an equitable situation for these products.",

There is no way that any nation can maintain healthy. sustained development if their nonrenewable resources are plundered. When nations opt for the quick economic fix through indiscriminate mining or harvesting of forests. future generations must pay.

The resolution calls on the President to submit the convention and its protocols to the Senate for its advice and consent. and for the Senate to act expeditiously toward ratification. The participation and cooperation of the United States in the convention will be a critical step in protecting the environment of the South Pacific region. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 398 Is bipartisan. noncontroversial. and was drafted with the cooperation of the administration. It was approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee. as amended.

Citing national security reasons. the military will reportedly request that all aircraft. spacecraft. wheeled and tracked vehicles. vessels. and weapons be exempt from the Clean Air Act. Additionally. the Pentagon will request an exemption for the burning or detonating of munitions and ordnance as well as an exemption from emissions requirements on paints and chemicals used to repair or refurbish military vehicles. It is estimated that the Army alone has over 800.000 cars. trucks. tanks. and other vehicles. Clearly. many of the actions for which these exemptions are being sought (i.e. the regulations of cars. trucks. and paint and chemical emissions) are significant sources of air pollution. They emit ozone precursors. carbon monoxide. and a variety of toxic compounds. Because the current exemption in section 118 of the Clean Air Act is overly broad. I am concerned that the Pentagon will seek exemptions for emissions sources which are totally unrelated to national security. Moreover. as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee which is currently reauthorizing the Clean Air Act.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak today in favor of the EckartSchaefer amendment which overwhelmingly passed the House in July by a margin of 380 to 39 in the form of H.R. 1056. the Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1989. The reasons behind the original passage of this measure remain the same. the Federal Government should be held accountable to the same environmental laws that apply to private industry. Instead of serving as a leader in compliance with environmental laws. the Federal Government has continued to be a flagrant violator of our environmental statutes. It is time for the Federal Government to act responsibly. This amendment will ensure Just that. The EckartSchaefer amendment will make it clear that Federal facilities are subject to the same regulations regarding management. treatment. and disposal of hazardous and solid waste as private entities. If this amendment is passed. the Federal Government will no longer be able to ignore the environmental laws that protect the health and safety of our citizens. There are countless examples across the Nation where the Federal Government has ignored these laws. In my congressional district lies Rocky Mountain Arsenal touted as one of the most polluted parcels in the Nation. In 1984. TCE was discovered in excessive levels in drinking water wells neighboring the arsenal. When one of the sources of contamination was confirmed as emanating from the arsenal grounds. the Army was initially reluctant to fund a filtration system to ensure a safe drinking water supply for the Adams County community. This is not the kind of example the Federal Government. whose primary responsibility should be to uphold the law. should be to private entities. It is the responsibility of all entities: Private. State. municipal or Federal to protect the health and safety of our citizens. the quality of our environment and to uphold the law. The EckartSchaefer amendment is a step forward in ensuring that this responsibility is not ignored.",

I would like to talk about an example of this in the State of Maryland which existed really in our own back yard. The Bainbridge Naval Complex in Cecil County. MD. which served as a naval training facility until 1976. has had a number of complicated environmental problems associated with it that went unabated long after that facility closed down. In addition to the presence of a pesticide landfill and large amount of asbestos in decaying buildings. Bainbridge had a series of underground storage tanks that were in danger of leaking. I would like to say that it was only after the gentleman from the First District of Maryland went after a lackadaisical Department of Defense that anything was done. and that was 10 years after the facility was closed. That kind of standard would never have been permitted in the private sector. So. Mr. Chairman.

The amendment will help improve Federal facility compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA]. the primary Federal statute goveming the management. treatment. storage. and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. The need for greater compliance Is well documented. The Department of Energy and the Department of Defense alone generate approximately 20 million tons of hazardous or mixed hazardous and radioactive waste annually. And past mismanagement of these hazardous materials has created a huge cleanupupwards of $145 billion by current estimatesthat we will be paying for decades to come. The Eckart amendment offers us an opportunity to improve the management of hazardous waste by the Federal agencies and thereby slow the creation of new hazardous waste sites and even larger cleanup bills for future generations. The amendment gives Federal and State regulatory authorities access to all of the compliance and enforcement tools available under RCRA. something they have not had access to in the past. The most important of these tools is the authority to levee penalties and assess civil fines. This has proven to be a critical lever for EPA to Induce compliance and deter future misconduct in the private sector and with State and local governments. If we are to encourage greater compliance and improve the management of hazardous waste by our Federal agencies. EPA must also have this authority in its dealings with Federal facilities. Mr. Chairman. this amendment removes any doubt that the Federal Government Is to be held to same standard of compliance as any private business or any State or local government.

As you know. Mr. Speaker. the House passed legislation in the last session that would require the end of ocean dumping of sludge off the coast of New Jersey by the end of 1991. The EPA is now in the process of implementing that legislation. however. there is concern and there has been concern on the part of environmentalists. as well as commercial fishermen. off the Jersey coast about the longterm effects of ocean dumping of sludge at a site both 12 miles off the coast of New Jersey and also at 106 miles where the sludge is currently being dumped. Our concern is echoed in the EPA Inspector Generals report which basically shows that the EPA has used inaccurate or ineffective scientific methods for evaluating the long term environmental drawbacks of ongoing dumping at the 106 mile site off the New Jersey coast. The report identifies three areas where the EPA needs to take action to protect the marine environment. including the reduction of discharge rates at the site. development of contingency plans and coordination of research results throughout the scientific community. Basically. Mr. Speaker. I am asking and calling today for a congressional hearing to conduct a detailed study into the report and to show what can be done on behalf of Congress basically to remedy the situation that has been identified in the report. I have written to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight Investigations and also the chairman of the Oceanography Subcommittee of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee to request that these charges of EPAs lax monitoring be part of an agenda at a planned 2day hearing on ocean dumping that the two subcommittees are holding.

Jr. As the former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. he led our party from disorganization to unification within 4 years. Paul Is one of the few people I know who could have accomplished this in such a short time. The media has labeled his tenure as controversial. innovative. and competent. Everyone agrees that Paul Kirk did not have an easy task when he took the reins of command in 1984. There were divisions among the partys many factionsboth on the right and left. the party was in debt. and we had lost another Presidential election. The National Convention in San Francisco personified the worsening problems of our party. the spark needed to infuse the party was missing. Paul Kirk came on board in 1984 with a plan to reform and revitalize weakening party lines. As the new chairman. Paul Kirk relied less on rigid ideology and concentrated on developing a cohesive national strategy to entice Democrats who had departed from the party and to reach out to the growing political influence of the Sun Belt. Mr. Speaker. today our party is more unified. better prepared institutionally. and better financed than it has been since 1964. The party has made dramatic improvements in its direct mail system and other fundraising and constituency contact machinery. Paul Kirks plan to bring swing voters back to the Democratic Party has made significant gains among these voters. Thanks to Paul Kirk. our party is headed in a new direction. the right direction. The biggest test of his leadership was to turn the negatives of 1984 into positives at last years National Convention. Paul Kirk accomplished this feat by being what he is best known asindependent and tough. Mr. Speaker. I have come to respect the direction in which Paul Kirk steered the Democratic Party during his 4 years as chairman. Paul Kirk brought to the Democratic Party a vision of recapturing the loyalty and confidence of the American people.

I feared that he would be an unyielding spokesman for liberalism. and that he would shut out the large and vital moderate and conservative elements within our party. But Mr. Speaker. today I can testify to the extremely positive effect which Paul Kirks chairmanship has had on our party over the past 4 years. He has proven himself able as a leader of the Democratic Party and everything for which the party stands. including maintenance of a broad base across the ideological spectrum. Paul Kirk has made all of usthe liberals. the moderates. and the conservativesproud to be Democrats. I join my fellow members of the Democratic Party in paying tribute to Paul Kirk and the progress he has brought to our party. I wish Paul Kirk well in all his future endeavors. and I look forward to our continued association.",

To say Paul Kirk will be remembered as one of the great Democratic Party leaders is an understatement. What is not an understatement. however. is to say Paul Kirk is a man of outstanding ability and resourcesa man who welcomes a challenge and for whom I think the phrase \"sometimes it only takes a little longer to accomplish the impossible\" was coined. As Paul moves on to new endeavors I can only feel this is an apropos occasion to say our loss is their gain. Let me also add that words alone cannot begin to express the debt of gratitude owed. but for a job magnificently done. muchas gracias mi muy amigo.",

I would like to take this opportunity to honor a man whose contributions to Americas free and democratic political system will leave its mark on this Nation for many years to come. That man is Paul G. Kirk. Jr.. former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. When Paul took over as party chairman in 1985. he brought with him a vision. That vision was to reshape the partys image. strengthen its ties to local elected officials. expand voter outreach. form a solid financial base. and win elections on all levels of government. Four years later. that vision has become reality. During his chairmanship. the Democratic Party retired its financial debt. registered millions of new voters. returned the Senate to Democratic control. laid to rest its image as a hostage to special interests. and increased its majorities in State legislatures across the entire country. With a keen eye on the 1991 reapportionment. Paul Kirk made State races one of his partys top priorities. His attention paid off. The party won 147 State legislative seats in 1986 and 20 additional seats in 1988. His leadership in this area leaves a record of commitment that will long benefit all Democratic Members of this House as we enter the 1990s. When Paul took over as chairman. the Democratic Party had a debt of over $1 million. During the following years. he not only eliminated that debt by raising a record $89 million during his 4year tenure but also left a surplus to his successors. Such a goal had never been accomplished before. One of Pauls greatest achievements was his ability to register over 2 million new voters by launching an aggressive $6 million voter registration drive and a dynamic get out the vote effort. Paul Kirk leaves behind a legacy of fairness. vitality. unity. and strength. Americas entire political process has been enriched by his many contributions.",

I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for requesting this time to pay tribute to a man who has given his all to build the Democratic Party. As chairman of the Democratic National Committee he has seen to it that the party structure remains strong at both the national and State level. The House of Representatives remains solidly Democratic with little indication that this advantage will be lost in the near future. In 1980. the U.S. Senate went to the Republicans during Ronald Reagans election to the Presidency. In 1986. with President Reagan still enjoying high popularity ratings with the voters. Paul Kirk led the Democratic Party back to majority status in the Senate. All Democrats owe a debt of gratitude to Paul Kirk for his work as DNC chairman and for his previous work as party treasurer. Financially. the Democratic Party is doing better than it has in years. The 1988 Democratic National Convention was one of the best ever. The DNC has a fine staff that is known for preparing excellent position papers on a wide range of issues. Democrats are in control or gaining at the State and local level in every region of the country. All of these positive signs for the Democratic Party are directly or indirectly the result of the work of Paul Kirk. Mr. Speaker. I would like to congratulite Paul Kirk on his successful term as Democratic National Committee chairman. I am sure he will remain active in the party. He. and his wife Gail. have my best wishes in the years ahead.",

Paul is a man of determination and integrity who tackled the challenges of a tough job while. as the same time winning the admiration of his foes. As he returns to practicing law. we cannot thank Paul Kirk enough for all his dedicated service to the Democratic Party. The years between 1984 and 1988 saw a rejuvenation of the Democratic Party In cities. towns. and communities across this country. Americans let it be known that they believed in the Democratic agenda. They restored the Democratic majority in the Senate. strengthened the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. and solidified our base of control at the State and local level. I strongly believe that it was not coincidence that Paul Kirk was the party chairman during this renaissance. The party which Paul inherited was going in several directions. but through his leadership he built a solid financial foundation. showed us we could raise the necessary amount of money to compete in todays political campaigns and brought unity to the Democratic Party. Paul Kirk has shown us that he can tackle any task he assumes. and today. for all he has done. we thank him and wish him the very best as he resumes his legal career.",

Paul Kirk was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In his 4 years as chairman. Paul Kirk strove to strengthen and unify the Democratic Party on both the local and national levels. He is to be commended for his organizational ability in successfully creating a more harmonious and stable Democratic Party. By establishing the Democratic Policy Commission. Paul Kirk sought to enforce party discipline and to set an ideological foundation which would reflect the values of the many voices in our party. In addition. the commission would also draft ideas on a variety of subjects which would be a base for our candidates. During his tenure. Paul Kirk was successful in returning the other body to the control of the Democrats. And with that. a national political momentum had begun. He furthermore established a Democratic Unity Task Force to enforce party discipline and to illustrate to the American people that the Democratic Party could manage itself effectively. Paul Kirk has stood as a stabilizing influence and negotiator among our partys factions to skillfully balance the many interests that collectively formulate the Democratic Party. A collective and harmonious voice is essential to the Democratic Party and to its members. Paul Kirk has restored that voice to the Democratic Party. During the 1988 Presidential campaign. Paul Kirk. through his fundraising and effective management efforts. brought a surplus to the Democratic National Committee treasury. Voter lists and direct mailing lists were enhanced through computers. Financially and technologically. the Democratic Party was prepared for that campaign. Mr. Speaker. I commend the achievements of Mr. Paul Kirk under whose chairmanship the Democratic Party has benefited immensely. His leadership has been characterized by dedication. consistency. reliability. and respect. He has proven that the Democratic Party is and will continue to be a party of greatness.",

During Paul Kirks tenure as chairman. many important strides were made within the party. strides that will benefit all Democrats for many years to come. Pauls service within the DNC extends back to his position as treasurer. a post he maintained from 1983 to 1985. During that time. Paul became well known for his reasonable. fair. and honest approach and won many allies within the party. He further built upon that reputation while serving as DNC chairman and is. today. regarded as a reliable. effective. and efficient leader. Certainly his most important achievement has been the development of a stronger and more unified Democratic Party. Through Pauls interpersonal. administrative. and political skills. he was able to overcome longstanding hurdles within the party and put forth a political agenda that helped ensure for many Democratic victories in 1986 and beyond. His further hard work and leadership has allowed the Democratic Party to expand upon these successes and we can look forward to a bright and promising future. For all his efforts. Paul has well earned our gratitude. respect. and admiration and I know that he will be greatly missed. Mr. Speaker.

It is more popular in virtually every section of America. It is in sounder financial condition. It is more united. Largely because of his guidance. members of the party have again learned how to disagree without becoming destructive. Being party chairman is always a tough balancing act. There is a need for the type of debate that will get people excited about the political process. But theres also a need for rules to guide that debate and insure that it is a productive effort.

Since Bart Giamattis youth in the small western Massachusetts town of South Hadley. baseball and his life are connected. From listening to Red Sox radio broadcasts while sitting in cars being repaired at the local service station. to making what he called the once a year pilgrimage to Fenway Park to see his Red Sox in action. he was the consummate fan. And years later. as with many fathers. he too brought his children to Fenways bleachers to watch a ballgame. His career included a Woodrow Wilson fellowship at Yale. several professorships of English and comparative literature. serving as president of Yale from 197886. president of the National League of Major League Baseball. 198689. commissioner of baseball. 1989. and awards and honors too numerous to mention. As Yale president he would be seen wearing an old Red Sox cap around campus. and as president of the National League. he would be tested as to where his loyalties were during the 1986 World Series between the Red Sox and the Mets. \"I think Ill just sit down and be quiet.\" he said. when asked by Red Sox great Johnny Pesky whom he would be standing up for in the seventhinning stretch. Although Bart Giamattis tenure as commissioner of baseball was very short. he was doing what he wanted to do. He loved the game and fought to keep its integrity intact. He faced the Pete Rose case squarely. attempting to be as fair as possible. While history will eventually look back on this man and what he meant to baseball and to the Nation. our thoughts and sympathy today are with the Giamatti family. A. Bartlett Giamatti once wrote of baseball: It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring when everything else begins again. And blossoms in the summer. filling the afternoons and evenings. and then as soon as the chill rains come. it stops. And leaves you to face the fall alone.

Concerned by the Interior appropriations bill passed by the Senate. Mayor Lindsay wrote to the New York Times.

Of additional concern is a ban which prevents two institutions. the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in North Carolina and the Institute for Contemporary Art in Pennsylvania. from receiving NEA funding for the next 5 years. In his letter. Mayor Lindsay reminds us that we are a nation that has thrived on diversity and free expression. He believes that in a free society. \"freedom must be protected even if it confounds. nettles or offends.\" The values of diversity and freedom guided Congress near a quarter century ago when it established the endowment.

And third. that involuntary exposure of children to tobacco smoke reduces the rate of lung growth as their young lungs mature. That is. exposure of young children to cigarette smoke impairs their normal development of the respiratory system. Based on the scientific evidence. the Surgeon General estimated that 5.000 people die each year from the effects of passive smoking. That same year. the National Academy of Sciences issued a second report. entitled \"The Airliner Cabin environment: Air Quality and Safety.\" This report was based on an 18month study. and. given the unique nature of an airline cabin. recommended a total ban on smoking on aircraft. In May 1988. Surgeon General Koop asked the National Cancer Institute to further study the effects of passive smoking in airline cabins. The results of that study were published in February of this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This study made several important findings. It demonstrated conclusively that separating their seating does not separate the air that passengers breathe. The levels of airborne nicotine that flight attendants and passengers in the nonsmoking section are exposed to are equivalent to those found in the smoking section. Based on these findings. Surgeon General Koop renewed the call for a total ban on smoking on commercial aircraft. On March 7. I introduced S. 519. a bill to do Just that. ban smoking.

That survey found that 84 percent of the people questioned. approved of the current 2hour ban on smoking and nearly twothirds thought it should cover all flights. A more recent Gallup poll showed that 70 percent of adult professionals. those most likely to fly. support a total ban. I would also like to point out that in surveys. a majority of passengers identifying themselves as smokers have said they too support a ban. Mr. President. with the pending amount before us. we have a chance to do something that is long overdue. It is the right thing to do based on mountains of solid. scientific evidence. and the American people want it. in overwhelming numbers. There will be more debate on this. So for now. let me finish by making Just one more point. The Senate deals with a great number of issues. Among the most important ones are those to protect the health and wellbeing of all of our citizens. When a train crashes. we respond to do what we can to try and keep it from happening again. We spend billions to clean up our mistakes of the past. which turn up as toxic waste sites. And when workplace hazards. like asbestos. are identified. we act to protect the workers. In each case. everyone in this body. throughout the Congress. recognizes that that is an obligation that we have. to protect the health and the wellbeing of our citizens. But here we have a problem that is taking the lives of almost 400.000 each year. and there are those who would do all within their power to continue that. to stop us from taking even this relatively small step forward. We are not saying you cannot smoke. What we are saying isbe considerate. When you are in the small space of an airplane cabin. for Gods sake. respect the rights of others.

I just want to report to the House and to the majority leader that I think it would be very. very difficult to get very many votes on our side of the aisle for any kind of shortterm debt ceiling that is not tied in some way to a summit agreement. that we may have to think through and in a bipartisan way talk out some kind of schedule. but I would hope that the democratic leadership would not bring debt ceiling. particularly a shortterm debt ceiling. to the floor that had not in some bipartisan way been worked out in terms of scheduling and tying it into whatever negotiations we do on the sunmit in terms of the budget. And. last. I would just say that it would seem to me that we would want to possibly even consider passing a joint resolution on adjournment that would bind the Congress in a very clear way to the precise scheduling procedures that we would use when we come back. I think it is fair for the average citizen of this country and for the President to look at what will have been 4 months of investment by that stage and to ask for a very clear and very binding commitment by Congress before letting us go home for August.

So I should say in support of the distinguished majority leaders comment. that earlier this morning. while meeting with the President and trying to resolve this issue of how do we make a commitment. that it may very well have to be through this mechanism of open dialog. for all to see what has been agreed to as maybe the most efficient way of getting this kind of agreement.

It is simply a sneaky. selective attack on the most progressive States who do the most to solve their own problems. States like Wisconsin. Minnesota. and New York. It pretends to be an attack on the wealthy. but it is a cynical ploy to prevent Congress from eliminating the socalled bubble. a quirk in the Tax Code which allows people with incomes of more than $100.000 a year to pay lower tax rates on that income than people with far less income. So I have a message for the White House: Do not expect people from States like ours to support any tax deal that is so cynical and selective. If you really want to go after high income people who are not pulling their fair share of the load. go after the deductibility of Federal tax provisions that apply to all States and go after the bubble. Those are the only two ways to make the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes in this country.",

More than threefourths of all companies paid less than the supposedly required corporate income tax rate of 34 percent in 1988. and If every company that paid less than the statutory rate in 1987 and 1988 had instead paid the full rate. $38 billion more would have been contributed to the Federal Treasury. Mr. Speaker. at a time when we are hearing more and more about the possibility of new taxes. I think the American people have a right to know these disturbing facts. To those involved in the budget negotiations. my message is a simple onedont try to balance the budget on the backs of middle- and lowincome America. A gasoline tax would do just that. It is regressive and it unduly burdens the average American wage earner.

Without a fuller and more exhaustive effort to find an American buyer. one which clearly could occur if given adequate time. this sale would amount to an unconscionable abandonment of Americas national security responsibilities and Americas economic security.

It is truly a testament to their own hard work and efforts that the product before us today carries with it the unanimous support of the Banking Committee. I would like to take Just a few moments to touch on several provisions in the bill that. at least from this Members perspective. deserve special note. First. I am very proud that legislation that I authored. the Community Enterprise Revitalization Act. has been included in H.R. 5157. My legislation will make important changes in the section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. changes that will for the firsttime make small cities and rural communities eligible for section 108 financing. With this expansion of the 108 program. even more communities will be able to undertake the vital development and infrastructure projects they so desperately need. The committees support for expanding this program stands in my mind as a reaffirmation of the Federal Governments commitment to local efforts designed to assist low- and moderateincome persons. I am grateful to the members of the committee for their support of this measure. In addition. I would like to mention an amendmentformerly the Neighborhood Accountability Actthat I was successful in offering at full committee. with the help of my colleague.",

The FHA insurance funds are not in good shape. We have learned from the S&L debacle that to procrastinate or temporize in dealing with such a situation is unwise. For that reason I am particularly concerned at the 1 percent downpayment program contained in the bill. It is very like the original section 235 program. which was a disaster. Whenever we set the downpayment significantly below the commission that a real estate or mortgage broker will get from the transaction. it is an open invitation to fraud and abuse through under the table provision of the dowimpayment to the purchaser by the broker or use of essentially fictitious purchasers. Those are not hypothetical worries. these frauds have occurred before. I hope that as this bill makes its way through the legislative process. the Congress will take a closer look at this proposal in particular and at the needs of the FHA insurance funds in general.",

After participating In the budget summit for the past 6 weeks. and reviewing the possibilities of a balance budget amendment only last week. consideration of a budgetbusting $28 billion authorization makes me queasy. As an inveterate budgeteer. I must also voice my concern about a small program In this omnibus bill. In title 5 of the bill under consideration. a housing entitlement is extended to families whose children might otherwise be placed in foster homes. Even an old curmudgeon like myself has difficulty finding fault with such a noble provision. Nonetheless. it is a dangerous and expensive precedent. Federal housing assistance programs are. at this time. funded with discretionary money. With this language. a beachhead Is established into which further housing entitlements will certainly be offered. We all know that entitlement programs are exempt from the work of appropriators. We must recognize that additional program exemption from the appropriations process will erode what congressional control currently exists with regard to fiscal policy. Finally. In the course of this measures consideration. we will review the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program. I know the FHA loans are important to low- and moderateincome firsttime home buyers in Minnesota. In fact. FHA loan figured Into roughly 30 percent of existing home sales in Minnesota last year. In this spirit of this bill. which includes various programs to extend the American dream of homeownership to a greater number of persons. such as effective mechanism in providing homeownership as FHA should be retained and continue to exist for qualified home buyers. As we take up reforms to the FHA Program. I hope that we consider the great Importance of this program and its usefulness. now and in the future. for putting Americans in their own homes.",

The Senator from Wisconsin voted for that. along with 95 of his colleagues.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the drug paraphernalia business is a multimilliondollar industry that is a spinoff from the billiondollar drug trade. The drug paraphernalia business Is a perverse means of profiting from the addictive despair of drug abuse and it should be stopped permanently. In the 1986 AntiDrug Abuse Act (section 1822. page 100 Stat. 3207.51). we took action against this perverse trade by outlawing the interstate sale. import and export of drug paraphernalia. We defined drug paraphernalia so as to not prohibit those who are selling genuine tobacco products from making their honest living. But we did not outlaw the trade in drug paraphernalia altogether. What I seek to do in this bill is outlaw the business completely. It is time to put this adjunct of the drug trade out of business. I do not seek to put licensed tobacconists and tobacco distributors out of business. I simply seek to amend the 1986 AntiDrug Abuse Act. to prohibit the sale of drug paraphernalia altogether. It should not be imported. exported. sold across State lines. or sold at all. The exceptions in existing law for legitimate dealers of tobacco products will remain as they are. However. I also seek to move beyond this to subject those who traffic in drug paraphernalia to the same asset forfeiture proceedings that drug traffickers can face. Several States have enacted such laws and its time that the Federal Government act in kind. My bill will force the forfeiture of any profits or proceeds that the court determines were acquired or maintained as a result of trafficking in drug paraphernalia. Any such profits or proceeds that are forfeit will be transferred to the State government in which the offense was committed. I urge adoption of this bill because it is time to stand up and say that we will not tolerate businesses that thrive on the trade of illicit drugs. Spinoff industries like the drug paraphernalia business are simply unacceptable.*",

He played an integral part in the formation of the House Select Committee on Hunger and served as its chair since its inception in February 1984. In 1985. at the height of the African famine. he secured over threequarters of a billion dollars in relief funds. His humanitarian efforts focused on the domestic front also. he visited Indian reservations and Appalachian communities as well as African relief camps. Mickey Leland was born poor. and although he enjoyed success in his later years he maintained a deep compassion for those less fortunate. Mickey Leland was a staunch supporter of Israel and sponsored an internship program under which American blacks and Hispanics were given the opportunity to study on an Israeli kibbutz. Although the late Congressman was intractable in his commitment to combat hunger and unerringly loyal to his friends and family. he was willing to admit to making a mistakean uncommon trait in a politician. Those of us in Congress who had the opportunity to serve with Mickey Leland were indeed fortunate. The designation of this Federal building in honor of the late Congressman. who would have celebrated his 45th birthday later this month. will demonstrate the affection and respect with which he was regarded by his colleagues.",

At a time when the Federal budget deficit threatens our economy and our ability to deal with significant unmet needs. it is simply intolerable that the Government is not collecting billions in outstanding debts. This legislation addresses two major problems in the Federal Governments system of debt collection. First. the Federal Government must follow State enforcement procedures. which vary across the country and which often impede collection efforts. Second. the Department of Justice lacks adequate incentives to make debt collection a priority. The bill addresses these problems by. first. establishing a uniform. national system of debt collection procedures. This will enhance the Federal Governments ability to collect debts in many States. It also will eliminate some of the inequities in the current system. under which similarly situated debters are treated differently in different States. In addition. the bill would create incentives for the Department of Justice to pursue debt collection cases vigorously. Money collected by the Department and U.S. attorneys would be deposited into a debt collection fund. which could be used for future debt collection expenses. This should make it easier and more attractive for the Department to devote significant resources to debt collection efforts. Mr. President. this bill was developed by U.S. attorneys who understand the problems created under the current system. They deserve credit for their work on the legislation.

South Carolinas Barnwell facility is the regions current host facility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste and North Carolina has been designated the next host State for the compact. with waste acceptance scheduled to begin in 1992.

Not surprisingly. the Cook County Judge reached this tortured conclusion by relying almost exclusively on the Supreme Courts blunder in the Johnson case. The Chicago ordinance was enacted in response to the socalled flag exhibit at Chicagos Institute of Art. As we all know. this exhibit was one of the more extreme examples of flag desecration: the exhibit placed the flag on the floor in a way that literally \"invited\" patrons of the institute to trample on Old Glory. Apparently. flag desecration is a bad habit that the exhibits creator just cannot seem to shake: He was arrested on Monday for burning the flag right here on the Capitol steps. Mr. President. I applaud the city of Chicago. Its ordinance was an entirely legitimate expression of the outrage of its good citizens. And the ordinance deserved to be upheld by the Cook County circuit judge. Today. the Capitol steps flagburning case was assigned to a Federal judge here in Washington. In the next 2 weeks. the flag burners will probably file a pretrial motion urging the dismissal of their charges. Once the district court rules on the motion. the Supreme Court should then have the opportunity to review the flag statutes alleged constitutionality. As I have said before. it is the obligation of the statutes sponsors to ensure that the Supreme Court reviews the statute on an expedited basis. They owe this much to Congress.

Simultaneously. the Congress has been undertaking a review of this crucial issue. A congressional research seminar was held in March under the sponsorship of Congressman BERMAN and myself. The Defense Industry and Technology Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings last month. The Foreign Relations and Banking Committees also have focused attention on the proliferation issue. The Senate Appropriations Committee included in the dire emergency supplemental approriations bill a provision. authored by Senator DECONCINI. relating to missile proliferation. The bill my cosponsors and I introduce today is the culmination of several months of effort and represents our best judgment on how to proceed in this area. I particularly appreciate the assistance that I have received from Vicki Huddleston. an APSA congressional fellow working on my staff. I also want to thank Bob Bell of the Armed Services Committee staff. Randy Rydell of the Governmental Affairs Committee staff. Steve Polanski of the Foreign Relations Committee staff. and Bob Shuey of the Congressional Research Service for their generous support. Mr. President. I am delighted that Senators MITCHELL. GLENN.

Senator BINGAMAN has already spoken eloquently of the need to strengthen the missile technology control regime. and of the threat such missiles pose to world security. I believe that it is essential that we in the Congress act quickly and firmly to pass this bill. and to create a body of legislation that will deal with all aspects of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I also believe. however. that we must move beyond first steps. We must go further. and address both the problem of missiles and destabilizing offensive aircraft. Further. I believe we need to broaden the sanctions in this bill. and to establish suitable deterrents to persuade countries from importing such weapons and technology. and to indigenous efforts.

I have no doubt whatsoever that enactment of Senator BINGAMANS bill will enhance our national security and reduce the risk of further proliferation of these nuclearcapable missiles. The bill expresses strong support for the Missile Technology Control Regime [MTCR]. which was negotiated in 1987 between seven nations that export missile technology. and seeks to strengthen this regime by expanded international cooperation. The bill prohibits the transfer of American missile equipment and technology to private firms and to countries that have violated MTCR guidelines. and to countries that support terrorism or to countries outside the MTCR that pursue offensive missiles development facilities. The bill reaffirms the leading roles of the Commerce and State Departments in implementing missile export controls. while improving cooperation and coordination between these Departments and the Department of Defense with respect to the sharing of knowledge about missilerelated export sales. The bill offers improved and reasonable executive reporting requirements to enhance Congress awareness of current proliferationrelated developments and our Nations international diplomacy to halt the spread of these weapons. Finally. and perhaps most importantly. the bill raises the national priority of our missile nonproliferation efforts. and sends a signal to other nations of our deep national commitment to these efforts. I look forward to working with Senator BINGAMAN and his distinguished cosponsors to ensure speedy enactment of this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing a bill to expand the boundaries of the Knife River Indian Villages Historic Site in North Dakota. The site needs to be expanded to protect a number of Indian burial mounds which were recently discovered there. Knife River is the only unit of the National Park Service that was created specifically to commemorate the culture and history of the Plains Indians. and to interpret their lifestyle. The Lewis and Clark expedition stopped at this site along the Missouri River in October 1804 and wintered nearby through April 1805. The site represents one of the longest unbroken records of cultural development among an identifiable tribal group anywhere in the world. Scholars say this is perhaps the largest and most important archeological site in the United States. Knife River is the traditional home of the Three Affiliated Tribes: The Siouanspeaking Hidatsas and Mandans and their Caddoanspeaking neighbors. the Arikaras. Aside from Knife River. very few earthlodge village sites are intact today and no other sites include the range of prehistoric settlements found at Knife River. On the high bluffs immediately overlooking the site is Stanton Mounds. a prehistoric burial mound complex from the Woodland Period. The area is on the National Register of Eligible Archeological Sites and should be part of the Knife River Site. Of the original eight burial mounds. only 51/2 remain. The current owner once ran a gravel pit on this land. After human remains were found in gravel spread on county roads. the North Dakota attorney general became involved in protecting the mounds. Purchase by the National Park Service is the best way to prevent additional damage in the future. I would like to emphasize that the current owner is a willing seller. and the bill provides that any purchase be on a willing buyer/willing seller basis. The Park Services preliminary esti mate is that it will cost $398.000 to acquire and develop the land. I believe this is a fair price to pay to protect the graves of these early Americans. Let me outline several reasons why the preservation of the Stanton Mounds is so important:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am Introducing legislation to increase Federal support of local drug prevention programs. As my colleagues well know. the American people have stated repeatedly that stopping drug abuse is their No. 1 priority. Drugs are tearing apart families and communities all over America. and they are threatening to steal away a whole generation of young people. The Federal Government has poured billions of dollars. most of it into drug interdiction and law enforcement efforts. to stop the escalating epidemic. Although there have been some successes. they have been far too few. and Americans are growing increasingly frustrated for more action. We must continue to search for ways to retake the streets from the drug pushers and dealers. but new approaches are needed. Mr. President. Congress has tried to respond to drug epidemic on many occasionsthe most recent being last year through enactment of the comprehensive AntiDrug Abuse Act of 1988. It addressed the full spectrum of the drug problemfrom beefing up drug interdiction to expanding treatment. That lawwhen it is fully funded and implementedwill help. But I am concerned that not enough focus was placed on one critical aspect of the war on drugsprevention. If we as a society are ever going to be successful in stopping drug abuse. and the increasingly violent crime that often goes along with it. we must stop the demand. Our young people must be encouraged to change their views and attitudes about drugs and to find alternatives to the drug culture. We can step up efforts to stop the flow of drugs at our borders and increase law enforcement efforts to crack down on drug traffickingand I think these activities are importantbut they cannot ultimately stop people from using drugs. Unfortunately. substance abuse prevention programs have traditionally received very little attention or fundIng. Consequently. we are only beginning to learn what works and what doesnt. We took one step forward in 1986 when we created the DrugFree Schools Program to help schools develop and implement substance abuse prevention programs. But we havent done much for communitywide prevention efforts. where. I believe. the real hope lies.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the AntiDrug Abuse Act we passed last year contains a very important provision that authorizes the new drug czar. William Bennett. to designate certain areas of the country as \"high intensity drug trafficking areas\" and to provide special Federal assistance to such areas. I was glad to see that the 1988 drug bill contained this provision. Mr. President. because since March 1988 I have been pressuring the administration to send more Federal resources to the Los Angeles area which is a major drug importation and transshipment center for the entire country. I have consistently argued that the problem in Los Angeles is not a local problem. Rather. the scope of the problem has reached national dimensions. and thus clearly demands a Federal response. With the beginning of the 101st Congress. I joined Congressmen BERMAN and LEVINE in asking the new drug czar to make some commitment to utilize his authority under the 1988 drug law to designate the Los Angeles area as a high intensity drug trafficking area. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. Also. because of the serious problems we face regarding drug trafficking along the southern border. I joined a number of other Senators in asking that that region of the country receive a similar designation. While the drug czar has acknowledged these requests. no commitment has been forthcoming. Consequently. today I am introducing a bill which goes a step further than the step we took in the 1988 drug law. This bill requires the drug czar to designate certain areas as high intensity drug trafficking areas and. when designating such areas. to include those cities which are now acknowledged as major drug importation. distribution. or manufacturing centers: Los Angeles. San Diego. New York. and Miami. Current law merely authorizesbut does not requirethe designation of such areas. and does not name specific areas. I believe this change is necessary. Mr. President. If we indeed are going to make a serious commitment to cut off the supply of drugs into this country. The crisis in these cities is such that we should not delay in making such a commitment.",

The first is aimed at reforming the tender offer process by requiring earlier notice of stock purchases. and changing the waiting period for shareholders to respond to tender offers. I introduced these provisions last Congress as part of S. 678. The second part would increase fairness to shareholders by protecting them against abusive defensive tactics. It would protect shareholders by limiting the use of greenmail. poison pills. and golden parachutes. and providing for confidential proxy voting.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the current budget debate we have been overlooking one very Important. needed step: to restart the Revenue Sharing Program. Revenue sharing began in 1972 and over 14 years provided $83 billion to local governments. Put simply: It was a program that workedworked to keep valuable programs underway and worked to provide for community needs. In October 1986. I offered an amendment on behalf of the Appropriations Committee as a lastditch effort to extend revenue sharing. The House leadership decided President Reagan would veto the entire. crucial spending bill if our amendment was included so we reluctantly agreed to a Rules Committee decision striking our amendment. Since then. Chairman WHITTEN. and I have introduced legislation to reauthorize the program. It is needed at this time for three main reasons. First. with cutbacks during the ReaganBush administrations in domestic programs. more of the burden for community services has fallen to local governments. This was the very philosophy that sparked the Initial round of revenue sharing. The need is just as real today. Second. everyone recognizes that we have a major infrastructure rebuilding problem facing us in the 1990s. Until funds became available for the Federal Government to lead the way in that effort. local government will again be carrying the burden. Revenue sharing will provide them with the financial edge to continue and improve vital water. sewage. road. and community building upkeep until we can take more major steps. Third. while the ReaganBush administrations have made much of their goals of reducing Federal taxes. whether you agree with their approach or not. this policy. coupled with the decline in spending. has placed for many Americans a larger tax burden at the local level. And local governments often work with more regressive taxes that penalize the working families and older Americans on fixed Incomes more than tax rates tied to income level. We can fit revenue sharing into our overall budget picture. It marks an Idea whose time has returned. Revenue sharing II should be a congressional sequel this summer. as it would provide a major economic boost.",

Since that time. how. ever. many Members of this House have spoken and voted as if there was no such thing. To those Members. it was the United States. not the Soviet Union. that should be held responsible for the suffering that still characterizes this bloody century. Much of that blood is on the hands of those who never took the Soviet threat sedously and who now regard its retreat as proof it never existed. But the threat was always very real to those who lived under it for 45 years. and in reality still live under it today. That reality was outlined eloquently in a March 21 column by Richard Grenier In the Washington Times. I submit it for the RECORD. [From the Washington Times. Mar. 21. 1990]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate and pay special tribute to the Fremont/Newark chapter of the American GI Forum of the United States as they prepare to celebrtate their silver anniversary. The American GI Forum of the United States was founded over 40 years ago in Corpus Christi. TX. as an organization composed primarily of MexicanAmericans who were veterans of the United States armed services. A primary concern of the organization in those early years. was fighting the discrimination many MexicanAmerican veterans faced when the returned from their World War II service. Then. as now. the American GI Forum was in the forefront of antidiscrimination efforts. The founder of this organization was Dr. Hector Garcia. whose hard work and dedication paved the way for more chapters to be formed in Texas. Eventually. Dr. Garcia was joined by Vincente Ximenes. and under their leadership the American GI Forum of the United States became nationally recognized. and established chapters nationwide. The Fremont/Newark chapter was founded In 1964. by Forumeer Louis Cortez. and today it Is one of the most progressive and active chapters. Members of the Fremont/Newark chapter have occupied State offices for the GI Forum. and forum members have served in the government on both the city and county levels. Of particular note is the GI Forums vital work In the area of education. Recognizing that the preservation of our freedoms depends on education. the forum has been very active in promoting educational opportunity. Over the years. they have given many thousands of dollars in scholarships to deserving students. The Medal of Honor is the highest military award for bravery that can be awarded to an individual of the U.S. armed services. Over the years. Congress has paid reverence to over 20 members of the American GI Forum by honoring their valor with the Medal of Honor. I am honored to pay special recognition to a group with such distinguished members. Mr. Speaker. for their work in giving educational opportunity to young people. for helping to instill patriotism in our communities. and for their efforts in working toward an America free of racial and ethnic barriers to equal opportunity. I am proud to salute the Fremont/Newark chapter of the American GI Forum.",

Tamar Stieber of the Albuquerque Journal has been awarded the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for specialized reporting. Tamar is being recognized for her outstanding reporting detailing the problems associated with Ltryptophan. It was Tamar who broke the story connecting the dietary supplement Ltryptophan with a blood disorder. Tamars stories led to the nationwide recall of the once popular dietary supplement. It was Tamars convincing stories which led me to Introduce legislation banning Ltryptophan. Before the Congress had a chance to act on my bill. the Food and Drug Administration called for a voluntary recall of Ltryptophan. Tamars outstanding and persistent effort at pursuing this important story accurately reflects the excellent quality of journalism practiced by reporters. editors. and staff at the Albuquerque Journal. The Journals exceptional editorials and superb local. national. and international coverage should serve as a model for many of our Nations newspapers. My congratulations are extended to Tamar and to her colleagues at the Albuquerque Journal. It was a job well done.

In addition. twothirds of rural drinking water supplies violate Federal drinking water standards. There Is a need for more than $28 billion in financing for sewer systems alone. While FmHA. under the direction of Congress. is doing everything it can to meet the demand. the continued need is evidenced by the backlog of watersewer loans and grants. As of December. FmHA had on hand some 2.000 applications representing over $1.3 billion in applications and preapplications for funding. Virtually every State has a huge number of proposals on hand.

So in effect it would raise the tax bill tor upper income taxpayers. But this is the key of the amendment: in an effort to increase taxes. this provision imposes a tax on charitable contributions. Let me repeat: This provision imposes a new tax on charitable contributions. The amendment that I have sent to the desk. along with Senator INOUYE and others. would remove the charitable tax deduction from the across.theboard 5percent floor on itemized deductions. When a taxpayers tax bill goes up. as it will under the floor on itemized deductions. the taxpayer will lessen the out of pocket impact of the tax bill by reducing his or her charitable contributions. Taxpayers have relatively no control over a number of itemized deductions. For example. the mortgage deduction or State and local tax deductions would not be necessarily in the greatest control of the taxpayer. But the tax on charitable contributions. the amount of charitable contributions. is something that they have particular control on. This provision would greatly lessen the impact of their increased taxes. This is a tax on a broad array of charitable causes including the protection of the environment. health research. food programs for the homeless. schools. colleges. housing for senior citizens. and a myriad of other activities that enrich our society. I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues a letter from a group called Independent Sector. which is a group of charitable organizations to encourage giving. volunteering. This amendment is supported by the American Cancer Society. United Way. Council on Education. Heart Association. Girl Scouts. Red Cross. et cetera. I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be made a part of the RECORD.",

I simply want to point out that we are in a very difficult position here to determine what the effect on charitable contributions is going to be if they are in fact taxed. Someone makes an assumption that the charitable contributions of a group of people will be the same whether they are taxed or not taxed. I think they are going to go down. not up. I do not think there is any way that we can determine whether this is going to cost $30 million a year. which is what the independent group says It is. or whether it is going to cost $50 million a year. which is what one of the estimates from Joint tax is. because joint tax assumes that notwithstanding the fact there is going to be a tax on charitable contributions people are going to contribute exactly the same amount. I believe the people are going to contribute less. We can make up this revenue. This is a very. very weak revenue estimate. Charitable deductions are different from any other deduction. They result in no personal gain for the taxpayer. It simply makes no sense to tax money that is given away to serve public purposes. We really cannot determine the effect of the revenue estimate because I believe the people will reduce their charitable contributions if we impose this unfair tax.",

Many of the JapaneseAmericans who were interned are dying before we can ever repay them for the wrong that was committed during World War II.

Many of my constitutents have written to me expressing their disappointment that this administration has not carried out the previous administrations stated commitment to support $500 million for the redress project. The $30 million appropriated will only compensate approximately 1.000 people. At this rate it will take 60 years to compensate each citizen. when we could complete the process in 1 year.

The bill before us contains many good provisions and exercises of budgetary restraint. Unfortunately the bill is not as specific as it should be when it deals with allocations. Since many of the programs of direct interest have the specific appropriations levels reserved for the conference with the Senate. I want to suggest to the House some specific allocations I believe should be made in conference. First. Mr. Chairman. over the past 5 years. I have spoken to the House about the rapid growth in the North Pacific Fishing industry. That fishing industry now provides jobs for over 36.000 people in Washington State and another 46.000 in Alaska. Yet the committee has unfortunately not provided us with specific funding levels. Among the critical programs needed within the NOAA budget are $4.1 million for Bering Sea groundfish research. $8.7 million for the regional fishery management councils. $7.5 million for domestic fishery and marine mammal program observers. $9.37 million enforcement and surveillance. $170.000 for Japanese salmon interception monitoring. $3 million for the Pacfic Research Program. and $1.45 million for west coast groundfish research. These figures. Mr. Chairman. have been developed In consultation with Federal and State fishery management and industry leaders from Alaska. California. Hawaii. Oregon and Washington. Many of our colleagues have endorsed these funding levels. They are reasonable. responsible and necessary. I truly hope the conferees on this bill will properly fund these programs. I note. Mr. Chairman. that supporters of NOAA are not alone in being left to wonder if programs they think are essential are going to be properly funded. For example. the National Endowment for Democracy. an organization supported by many of our colleagues has also been put into budgetary limbo. I hope the conferees will appropriate the authorized level of $25 million. Similarly. I trust that essential programs ranging from the export administration to USIA to the Maritime Administration are properly funded. Mr. Chairman.

I am deeply disappointed that. in light of the $500 million authorization level. redress appropriations were not submitted to a higher level. The sum of $50 million will compensate 2.500 of the estimated 60.000 individuals eligible for this payment. About 2.400 eligible persons are expected to die during this same time. almost the same number as those to be compensated.

I wanted to inform my colleagues of something in this bill that should be of great concern to all of us. As we all know. in 1990 the Census Bureau is required to take the decennial census. The appropriation comes once every 10 years. Last week. during a full committee markup. the Appropriations Committee slashed $30 million from the subcommittees original mark of $1.352.967.000 for funding the work of the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau is responding to important concerns of Americas cities. The Census Bureau has improved methods of counting people who live in public housing and the homeless. They have expanded promotion and outreach among hardtoenumerate populations. They have developed a new multilingual/multiethnic public education promotion campaign. And they have expanded efforts to ensure that local governments participate in promoting the census and reviewing the censu. counts.

I am somewhat disturbed by the remarks of the gentleman from Pennsylvania . and I am certain that he did not mean it. but there have been times in my life and others as well that we were considered unAmerican. I was born an American citizen. and I think the words \"real American\" smacks of things that this Chamber should not be proud. Mr. Chairman. all of us have found that our backgrounds place us in a category that there was a time when we were classified as not real Americans. not one of us here. and so I would ask that the words \"real American\" be stricken. because I think we will find that most of the people who are here. whether they are here legally or illegally in the year 1989. frankly come from the Americas. whether it is Cental America. or South America. or whatever the case might be. so I would appreciate and hope that those words could be somehow stricken. and I am sure that the gentleman from Pennsylvania did not mean it in that way. However. Mr. Chairman. I would just like to make it clear. I would also like to add that my other colleague from Pennsylvania . when he talked about our forefathers and the Constitution. about the purpose of the census. was not to count persons who are noncitizen. but. if I remember correctly. women were not allowed to vote that privilege was for white men only when that Constitution was put together.

I seem to have a recollection that during the formation of the Constitution and the debate that ensued thereon that there were a class of people. although some did not consider them as such in this country. who were slaves. They certainly did not have any documents. Many people did not consider them people. Many people considered them as chattel. It seems to me that the Constitution of the United States. despite their illegal status. despite the fact they were not recognized as human beings by many. yet recognized them for the purpose of counting. As a matter of fact. Henry Clay in what was called the Great Compromise came up with this enlightened vision that we should count at least threefifths of these people for the purpose of apportionment. 60 percent was his great compromise. that they were 60 percent human. Certainly chattel that was 60 percent human being counted for the purpose of enumeration in the census. certainly people that we recognize today as full human beings have a right to be counted as whole persons. or perhaps the gentleman would like to see us count them as threefifths of people as well. Now. I am very sorry that our colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania. argues in this manner. How would he count the Amish? Are they still Americans who refuse to participate in the process?

We are debating them in committee. We are discussing them in committee. We are hearing extended testimony. because they are complex. We have heard a good deal about the constitutional character of the questions before us today. and those constitutional questions will be heard in greater detail once this matter is put behind us and we resume that hearing. where it properly ought to be heard. I would like to take just a moment to suggest that the interpretation that we have heard from our colleagues on this side of the aisle. to suggest that that interpretation has been bolstered by some 200 years of censustaking. a fact we should not overlook as we approach the 1990 census. The accurate enumeration of the population of this entire country and the collection of data about each person represents a challenge of surpassing magnitude for the Bureau and the census. The subcommittee that we chair reviewed in hearing after hearing an enormous number of obstacles that the Bureau must overcome just to promote participation in the census. The introduction of a new factor. as we propose to do. without substantial debate on the floor here today. that of a respondents legal status in this country into the censustaking process. will as a practical matter seriously damage and perhaps even destroy the Census Bureaus ability to enumerate the population in an accurate. efficient. and timely manner and may in fact even provoke unintentionally. but with utter certainty. a greater measure of inaccuracy than that which it presumes to cure.",

This bill. which I introduced last week. would rename lock and dam No. 4 on the Arkansas River after Mr. Emmett Sanders. formerly of Pine Bluff. AR. Mr. Speaker. I have long been an advocate of honoring our most distinguished leaders by renaming the public facilities which they have helped to erect in memory of their accomplishments. In my view. this measure of respect and gratitude Is best bestowed in the twilight of ones years so that the recipient is able to fully appreciate the honor. Accordingly. I have. in the past. offered legislation to rename a number of public facilities after senior public figures who have played an important role in the life of their community. Such is the case with Emmett Sanders. Mr. Sanders was the former mayor of Pine Bluff. AR. who. through tireless effort. worked to tame the Arkansas River. bringing navigation and a measure of flood protection to the area. He was an outspoken and extremely effective advocate of water resources development and progress and his efforts were met with not only success but the appreciation of the citizens of Pine Bluff. It is for these reasons that I have advocated legislation in the two preceding Congresses to honor Mr. Sanders by renaming lock and dam No. 4 on the Arkansas River at Pine Bluff as the \"Emmett Sanders Lock and Dan..\" Unfortunately. Mr. Sanders passed away earlier this spring. His passing was noted with deep regret as evidenced by local newspaper accounts which I would like to have inserted in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. I only regret that we were unable to bestow this honor on Mr. Sanders while he was alive. With that. Mr. Speaker. I withdraw my reservation. [From the Pine Bluff Commercial. Mar. 27. 1989]",

In exchange for the conveyance to the United States of the corporations interest in another parcel of land. The land owned by the United States was acquired in connection with the construction of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam project on the Mississippi River at Alton. IL. The land will May 11. 1.989 be under water when the pool behind the locks and dam is raised. This is expected to happen this September. Local interests wish to develop a boating dock and marina in the area. and have determined that the land scheduled to be inundated would be the best location for the boating facilities if its elevation is raised by the placement of fill material. The land owned by the United States was acquired in 1985 at a cost of $137.350. In 1988 the United States acquired a flowage easement over the land owned by the Blue Tee Corp. for the sum of $1.125 million. The remaining interest in the land held by the corporation. which would be conveyed to the United States. is valued at $200.000. Mr. Speaker. the interests in the lands to be exchanged are of comparable valueif anything. the value of the land to be acquired by the Government is likely higher considering the lower 1985 market value of the land presently owned by the Government.

Yet. laboratories around the country have attempted to confirm the cold fusion claims. with little or no success. Recently. two prominent research centers.

Indeed. its remarkable how little Is known about this phenomenon which has so inspired the American public. And yet. some suggest that Congress divert funding from traditional fusion to cold fusion research. Clearly. Congress needs to get to the bottom of this controversy so that it can make informed decisions in its allocation of research moneys. Today. my colleagues. Representatives BOXER. BATES. COLEMAN.

It recommends that the Department of Energy take immediate action to determine the validity of claims regarding recent cold fusion experiments. The resolution recommends that the Department provide a program to expedite the development of cold fusion. if its promise as an alternative energy source can be confirmed. Otherwise. the resolution calls on the Department to outline a program to expedite the development of traditional fusion research. The potential benefits of fusion power are widely known.

Restarting the Kreactor at the Savannah River plant will be an interim fix for tritium until the new production reactors are operational.

Senator GLENN. and I believe that there Is simply no need for the United States to proceed with construction of the SIS plant at this time. What we are doing in this amendment is precluding the use of fiscal 1990 funds for site preparation. Why is this? First of all. we are simply reinstating the original recommendation of the report by the Armed Services Committee Strategic Subcommittee. Before this recommendation there was no compelling reason for the plant. The evidence is very clear on this point. The argument that Is made here today Is that somehow there Is a great gap in our plutonium supply. That argument has been made by the opponents of this amendment. and yet. the facts of the matter are that we are currently. and for the foreseesable future. awash in plutonium. I make that statement. the other proponents of the amendment make that statement. but we are not alone. I will give you a few examples of who else is talking about the fact that we are awash In plutonium. John Herrington. the Secretary of Energy. said. \"The language of the amendments adopted in the House Armed Services authorization bill\"-which is identical to ours-\"will not adversely impact the schedule of the SIB project.\" John Herrington. Secretary of Energy in the previous administration said. \"Plutonium. we are awash in plutonium. We have more plutonium than we need.\" Troy Wade. Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Program. a very respected individual. at hearings held In Idaho Falls said. \"Our opponents argue that we do not need SIS to provide nuclear material in the near terms. That is a fact. and we do not dispute it.\" Don Ofte. manager of the Department of Energys Idaho operations office said. \"The SIS Is not designed to meet a wellidentified need.\" Mr. President. there are a great number of examples of quotes. made by high Department of Energy officials that this facility is not needed.

I just would call attention to my colleagues that today on their desk in the Senate is a \"Dear Colleague\" letter from Senator MCCLURE atid myself that somewhat summarizes what we have been discussing here. But there is one other point I think that my colleagues should take under consideration. The SIS is cost effective. The material the SIB will clean up is unusable in its present form. Purified. it will be worth three times the cost of the plant. The Department of Energy currently has 15 years reactor production of fuel grade plutonium available for this purification processing now in storage. So there is an adequate supply of plutonium that we will be processing. This is not a plutonium production plant but a plutonium processing plant which will in fact upgrade and improve the value of that plutonium and at the same time will be a cost effective method of doing it. And a timely method. Mr. Presidentand I reemphasize to my colleagues. the SI project is very timesensitive. It will be operating long before the advanced heavy water reactor and long before the high temperature gas reactor come on line. So I think this is critical. The SIS will use a laser process to purify the fuel grade plutonium. It is a new process. It is new technology. It moves this country one step forward in the entire technology field. But I think more than that. Mr. President. is that we have had a good run of things that have been going in the right direction. And I think for us to alter that course at the present time would be a sad mistake in terms of preserving peace and freedom and a strong America. And that is really what the SIB is all about.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Presidents National Security Directive responsible for nuclear materials specifically states that: It has long been U.S. policy that National Security needs and not the availability of special nuclear materials shall govern the nuclear stockpile. The SIS program has been strongly supported by the Congress over the past 8 years because it represents an important. nonreactor. costeffective contingency source of weapons grade plutonium for this country. This mission has become more important in recent years as other sources of plutonium supply have become increasingly burdened with the environmental. safety. and health issues related to old facilities. The Senate report for the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal years 1988 and 1989 stated: In addition to supporting the earliest availability of a new production reactor. the committee believes that technologies that contribute to the availability of plutonium should be pursued aggressively. Accordingly the committee fully supports the Departments request for the Special Isotope Separator (SIS). Mr. President. the bottom line is if the United States desires a capability for providing new weapons grade plutonium in the 19952005 timeframe. the SIS project must be supported now. Eliminating a ready plutonium supply capability weakens the United States stance in disarmament talks. and would allow a Soviet \"breakout\" as has happened in the past. Mr. President. I repeat: The Department of Energy supports this program. the Department of Defense supports this program. the National Security Council supports this program. the Joint Chiefs of Staff supports this program. and the Presidents report has recommended this program. It seems that a sensible thing to do is to kill this amendment.",

What we are objecting to now is beginning to spend millions and millions of taxpayers funds until we make a final and ultimate judgment and determination that the technology works. Now. we hear reported out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate that the Department of Energy and all of these bodies within the Government support this program. Well. Just look at the kind of failed programs that they have supported in the past: The gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Portsmouth. OH. $3.5 billion of taxpayers funds wasted. the Clinch River breeder reactor. $1.5 billion spent. the mirror fusion test facility at the Lawrence Livermore plant. $372 million. the scrap recovery facility at Rocky Flats. $225 million spent. and the intersecting storage accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. $172 million. Certainly we have learned something. We should have learned something. The Department of Energy has the worst track record of any agency of Government for management and we are being asked. before we have the final technology. to start paying millions of dollars in terms of construction. That just does not make sense. particularly at a time of scarce resources. The Armed Services Committee itself. in its report. said it very clearly: the committee is not convinced the construction of the SIS plant merits the urgent priority it was assigned by DOE. That is a bipartisan group that received testimony that was classified as well as unclassified. Mr. President. that should certainly give us pause before we start down the road of the camels nose under the tent. bringing that construction on. and then we will hear later: \"Look. we have already spent this amount of money.

House Resolution 425 is a modified open rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 5114. making appropriations for foreign operations. export financing. and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30. 1991. and for other purposes. The rule provides for 90 minutes of general debate. to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general debate. the bill will be read by title for amendment under the 5minute rule and each title will be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against provisions in the bill for failure to comply with clauses 2 and 6 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations or legislative provisions in general appropriations bills and restricts the offering of limitation amendments to such bills. These waivers are necessary because Congress has not yet enacted laws authorizing various programs funded in the bill. and because some bill language constitutes legislation under the precedents. Clause 6 of rule XXI prohibits reappropriations in general appropriations bills. These waivers are necessary to allow the transfer of unexpended balances from one account to another and the extension of authority to obligate those funds in the new fiscal year. The rule permits no amendments to the bill except for the amendments printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The rule waives all points of order against the amendments. which shall be considered in the order and manner prescribed in the report and shall not be .ubject to amendment except as provided in the report. Each amendment shall be debatable for the period specified. equally divided and controlled by the proponent and a Member opposed thereto. Finally. the rule provides for one motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5114 is our first foreign aid appopriations bill of the post Cold War era. The bill appropriates $15.8 billion for U.S. foreign aid programs for fiscal 1991. and does not exceed the applicable 302(b) allocation. House Resolution 425 will enable the House to work its will expeditiously on the bill. which is carefully tailored to advance our Nations foreign policy interests in a world swept by profound political. military. and economic change.

The Congressional Human Rights Caucus that I cochair with the gentleman from California has been concerned about this situation for a long. long time. that is. the situation in the Punjab. where individual rights are being denied by a Government that calls itself a democracy. calls itself a Government committed to human rights. Yet. as the gentleman from California just said. it does not even allow the basic human rights groups in to see what is happening in that province. It is a very serious situation. The Government of India will claim that there are terrorists there. Undoubtedly there are terrorists there. But even people who are accused of terrorism are entitled to be tried according to law. Even terrorists are entitled to be charged with a crime and not simply held in prisons for years without any charge whatsoever. It seems to me that the gentleman is very properly directing an effort that ought to be made and ought to be allowed under the rules toward sending a message to the Government of India that we expect a fellow democracy. one that claims the same principles that we claim in our relationship between individuals and the state. to live up to those obligations to those principles and provide access to International organizations such as Amnesty International that are concerned about human rights. would look to their own laws to charge prisoners with crimes and to provide trials for people so accused. would provide the same basic human rights In the Punjab that they say they provide throughout India. They are not doing it. The gentleman is very proper in raising this question and the Rules Committee very improper in denying him access to the floor to raise it here.",

And in my view. unless Congress gets the information that it requires to do its Job. It simply ought not appropriate money for the programs about which it is trying to obtain information. That is one of the reasons that we did what we did with respect to the European Development Bank. and it is a major reason that we withheld the majority of funds for the hard loan window of the World Bank. Our experienceI should point out extends to the ExportImport Bank as well. When Mr. Volcker. of sainted memory. was at the Federal Reserve. we tried for 3 years in a row to get the ExportImport Bank to declare a loan loss reserve because we knew they had a lot of uncollectible debts on their books. In my judgment. the Eximbank is technically broke right now. When we did that. you would have thought that we had committed a capital crime. Mr. Volcker tried to persuade the ExportImport Bank and the Congress not to do that. Fortunately. the ExportImport Bank finally did it. The world did not collapse. all that happened is that the public has a somewhat better understanding of the somewhat shaky foundation on which institutions rest.",

We will never overcome this problem without encouraging more people to use mass transitand providing pragmatic Federal funding for upkeep and operation. Unfortunately. the administration does not seem to agree with me. The Presidents national transporation policy would reduce operating assistance for urban transit. This proposed reduction in operating subsidies is occurring at the same time hat the urban mass transit account has a $2 billion surplus. This account is supposed to provide money for capital expenses. Thus. transit authorities would be stuck with minimal Federal funding for operating expenses and capital expenses. In a world: nothing for mass transit. It is clear that our approach to mass transit is stuck in traffic.

In my State of Connecticut. the pregnancy rate for girls 10 to 14 years old doubled In the past decade. This year. 1 In 10 teenage girls will become pregnant. Despite these alarming statistics. Federal commitment to teen pregnancy prevention and health care has dramatically declined in the last decade. Funding for the only Federal program dedicated to teen pregnancy has dropped 30 percent since 1987. In averting our eyes to this national tragedy. we are leaving teens and their babies exposed to serious and multiple risks--higher infant death. higher incidence of low birth weight and seriously disabled babies. and higher percentage of pregnancy and childbirth complications. Further. teen parents are more likely to drop out of school. be unemployed. and depend on welfare. In 1985. over half of the $15.7 billion aid to families with dependent children budget was spent on payments to families in which the woman had given birth as a teenager. Tomorrow we will introduce legislation to take an active and interventionist approach to teen pregnancy and parenting. Our bill involves families and communities in helping teen girls and boys to make responsible decisions about sexuality and their futures. For those teens who become pregnant and decide to carry their pregnancies to term. our bill provides prenatal and wellbaby care. which are so important to ensuring that their babies are given a fighting chance for a healthy life. And for teen parents. our bill provides services to help them finish their education. get job training. and thus break the cycle of poverty and lead productive lives. As our late colleague Mickey Leland said: We are asking our youth to take responsibility for their actions and we must. in turn. take responsibility as legislators and enact programs that meet the pressing needs of our teenagers. Let us say \"yes\" to teens and give them the tools to take charge of their lives.",

The basic idea is to use 5 percent of the tariffs collected on imported machinery and allow industry to use it to increase research.

The plan requires that the R&D be initiated and paid for before a company gets any Federal reimbursement. Thus a projector the first year of a multiyear projectwill be completed before the Government is asked to make an investment. This assures that money will not be wasted.

Professor Hill. who has been studying the savings and loan situation for the past 2 years. estimates that a tremendous amount of wealth will be transferred from 37 States and the District of Columbia to the 13 States where the savings and loan failures are concentrated. most notably Texas. Among the losers is my home State of Ohio. When all is said and done. Ohio will lose an average of $670 per person. And that figure may be low. since Professor Hill optimistically assumes a net bailout cost of $203 billion. By contrast. Texas will win big. gaining an average of $4.775 per person. Critics have quibbled with Professor Hills numbers. but that misses the point. The bottom line is that States in the Midwest and Northeast. whose savings and loan institutions were run more responsibly. are being asked to pay for the negligence and irresponsibility of State regulators and bankers in the Southwest. and that is not fair. There is an equity issue here that is dying to be addressed. Before Congress gives another nickle to the Resolution Trust Corporation. we should design a formula that places the burden of financing the bailout where it ought to be: in the States that caused it.",

This is the same amendment that we offered last year to the LaborHHS appropriations measure concerning aids education programs. This amendment takes a rational and realistic approach. It says that the Federal Government should not fund programs that are designed to promote sexual activityhomosexual or heterosexual. Our amendment would also require federally funded education programs regarding AIDS to provide information on the health risks of promiscuous sexual activity and intravenous drug abuse. At the same time. Mr. President. our amendment clearly and emphatically would require that all education materials \"be designed to reduce exposure to and transmission of\" the virus that causes AIDS. That. after all. is the purpose of any AIDS education effort. The Federal Government should be doing all it can to support and encourage the development of programs that will slow the spread of this deadly virus. Our amendment was adopted last year by a vote of 61 to 37. There were numerous attempts to delete our amendment but they were not successful. Mr. President. the Senate and full Congress has spoken on this issue. The provisions contained in our amendment are virtually identical to provisions also adopted in the Health Omnibus Programs Act. which passed last year. Among other things. that law provided a 3year authorization for AIDS education programs. To summarize. the amendment we are offering will simply make the appropriations bill before us consistent with current law.

AIDS education programs that receive assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and other education curricula dealing with sexual activity that receive as. sistance under this Act(1) shall not be designed to promote or encourage. directly intravenous drug abuse or sexual activity. homosexual or heterosexual. and (2) with regard to AIDS education programs and curricula(A) shall be designed to reduce exposure to and transmission of the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome by providing accurate information. and (B) shall provide information on the health risks of promiscuous sexual activity and intravenous drug abuse. This was the language. Senator CRANSTON stated. that was agreed to in order to not promote these activities through the educational process. I just want to alert all Senators that this will be accepted in the course of the day. say. by 1 oclock. if no objection is raised.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. under current tax law. nonprofit organizations are prohibited from engaging in political campaigns for elective public office. This is a prudent restriction. Nonprofit organizations should devote their resources primarily to charitable goals. rather than becoming involved in partisan politics. The participation of nonprofit organizations in foreign political campaigns is an activity which Congress did not consider in detail years ago when it was drafting the current section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However. the same general principle applies. We should not allow nonprofit organizations to participate in most foreign political campaigns. However. there are some compelling situations where nonprofit organizations should be allowed to participate in the political process of foreign countries. In particular. I have in mind the countries of Eastern Europe which are struggling to cast off 50 years of Communist tyranny and establish a true democracy. While the severe repression of Human rights and free enterprise may be changing. the political process in these countries is still at a fragile stage of development We need to make sure that democracy really takes root In Eastern Europe and is not snuffed out by hardcore Socialist or Communist elements. There are nonprofit organizations which could play a valuable role in helping these countries develop the strong. democratic political process necessary for success. However. if nonprofit organizations tried to \"export\" democracy to Eastern Europe. they probably would lose their taxexempt status because the IRS would assert that they had participated in a political campaign. I have introduced legislation which would allow nonprofit organizations to help promote the democratic political process in Eastern Europe without jeopardizing their taxexempt status under the Internal Revenue Code. The legislative change would expire sometime after 1991. This would allow Congress to review this area of the tax law in more detail in 1992 and perhaps reshape these provisions of the law. But until a more detailed review can take place. the legislation which I support Is a temporary solution to a pressing need for help in Eastern Europe. While the administration may not have the budgetary resources to give generous financial aid to Eastern Europe. it should not stand in the way of nonprofit groups who want to use private funds to promote democracy in Eastern Europe.",

We found that in spite of U.S. calls to countries around the globe to open their markets to free tade. our own markets have remained almost impenetrable. In fact. instead of increasing.

Dr. Sobey. the executive director of the National Invention Center. Akron. OH. the new home of the Inventors Hall of Fame. offers an insightful yet commonsense plan for parents who want to encourage their childrens Interests in science and mathematics. \"Will the great inventors of this next century be Americans?\" asks Dr. Sobey. His response reflects the concerns of a wide range of Americans in the academic and research communities who fear that Americas poor standing in international comparisons of math and science skills will translate into an inability to maintain our technological and innovative edge. Dr. Sobey proposes that parents work in a close partnership with teachers to help reveal the dual fascination of math and science to young students. Both in the classroom and in the living room. all of us must work with our children to show them that we share a genuine interest in learning and that exploring these important disciplines can be both enjoyable and rewarding. I highly recommend this article to my colleagues and the Nation. Dr. Sobey is right.

I should like to commend the Greater New York Coalition for Soviet Jewry and other Jewish organizations for keeping the problems of Soviet Jewry in the political and public forefront through important activities such as the Rally of Response/Solidarity Sunday which took place at the United Nations on April 1. 1990. Under Mikhail Gorbachevs policies of glasnost. advances have been made in the areas of wider emigration rights for Soviet Jews. release of major longterm refuseniks. and sanctioning of Jewish cultural and religious activities. In 1989. 12.915 Soviet Jewish emigrants arrived in Israel. In just the first 2 months of 1990. that number has already reached 10.569. In all. over 1 million Soviet Jews have begun the emigration process to leave the Soviet Union. Israel needs the help of its friends and supporters In the United States and elsewhere in order to settle successfully and assimilate this large influx of immigrants. While there is a growing fear of antiSemitism among Jews in the Soviet Union. Arab States continue to pressure the Kremlim to scale back the Soviet Jewish exodus to Israel. Raising public awareness about the ongoing needs of Soviet Jews is instrumental to ensuring that the advances made for Soviet Jews under the policies of Mikhail Gorbachev are retained in spite of pressure from the Arab nations. There is a corresponding need to keep the problems and concerns of Soviet Jewish emigration and general United States policy toward Israel in the United States political forefront. especially in light of President Bushs recent remarks about East Jerusalem. which have confused both the American public and its decisionmakers regarding our policy towad Israel. I strongly support the right of all Jews in the Soviet Union and anywhere in the world to freely emigrate to Israel and other countries in which they are allowed to live. work. and worship without fear. intimidation. or discrimination. I encourage the Government of the Soviet Union to continue its current positive policies on Jewish emigration. I take this opportunity to applaud the efforts of the Greater New York Coalition for Soviet Jewry. the Jewish Community Relations Council. the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. the Simon Wiesenthal Center. and the United Jewish AppealFederation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. for keeping the needs of Soviet Jewish emigrants to Israel and other countries. including the United States. in the political and public forefront.",

I am writing to urge expedited treatment because of the urgency of the situation. The Iraqi threat to Saudi Arabia. Israel and perhaps other nations in the region is imminent. Beyond the necessity to be prepared for any Iraqi threat. there is a need to maintain the preexisting military balance between Israel and the Arab nations. While it is understandable that military sales to Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries may be warranted at this time. their balance with Israel must be maintained in light of the fact that such equipment may fall into enemy hands (as did the Maverick missiles sold to Kuwait) and such sales to Arab nations without counterbalancing sales to Israel could create a future risk to Israel once. hopefully. the Iraqi threat is resolved. I am taking the liberty of sending copies of this letter to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz. and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Henry Rowen. My best. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week the Senator from Idaho . was literally boxed out of getting a vote on his proposal to eliminate any proposed increase in the gas tax from the reconciliation bill. When that occurred. an increase in the gas tax moved one step closer to reality. despite what I believe were the wishes of the majority of Senators. In addition. the American people were deprived of their right to know exactly how each and every Senator stands on that issue. Now that the conference committee on the reconciliation bill has reportedly ground to a halt. we may have. in this amendment. an opportunity both to prevent any increase in the gas tax for this fiscal year and help resolve one of the differences in the conference. If Senators went home over the weekend. they no doubt heard as much about the gas tax as this Senator did. I believe there are many Senators here who would like to see this issue revisited and resolved. The pending amendment gives Senators a chance to reverse this bodys previous actions with regard to the proposed increase In the gas tax and enables Senators to go on record with regard to the proposed increase in the gas tax. I ask Senators to make a choice. a very clear choice: increase the gas tax or cut foreign aid. In the view of this Senator. that is a simple choice. If Senators vote to approve this amendment. we will create the savings necessary to eliminate any need for an increase in the gasoline tax for fiscal year 1991. The conferees considering the Budget Reconciliation Act could then use these savings to recede to the House which has no gasoline tax increase in its bill for fiscal year 1991. But if. on the other hand. Senators vote against this amendment they will be in the process of saddling the American people with another tax increase in order to sustain foreign aid programs. That is the deal. Vote for this amendment and prevent any increase in the gas tax. or vote against this amendment and the American people will be taxed every time they fill up their cars so that Washington can send more money overseas in foreign aid.",

In Montana consumers are paying the highest price in the country for gasoline. Now. we are about to impose a 9.centpergallon additional tax on consumers. This comes at a time when we continue to make substantial contributions to dozens of foreign countries. Combined with the cuts in agriculture and the lingering effects of drought. farmers and ranchers in my State are being hit with a onetwo punch that will put many of them out of business. We need to look to the future of our own heartland before we contemplate massive giveaway programs that have limited effect. In my State of Montana. we rely on our highways and secondary roads heavily. There are few forms of alternative transportation in Montana. I have heard some say that an Increase in the motor fuels tax is good energy policy because it discourages people from driving. Well. that may be true in Washington. DC. and New York City where people can take the bus and the subway. but in Montana people do not have those options. People drive in Montana because they have to. It is often the only way to get from point A to point B. Any gas tax hits them particularly hard. especially given the fact that Montanas State gas tax is the second highest in the Nation at 20 cents per gallon. Montanas 1.200mile Interstate System was completed in 1988. It cost $1.2 billion and took 30 years to complete. Many portions of these roads now need to be repaired and reconstructed. In addition. Montanas 2.300 miles of primary roads need a considerable amount of work. The State started a reconstruction trust fund in 1983 in order to address a shortfall in Federal funds and to reverse the deterioration of Montanas highways. The needs are clearly there. Mr. President. and the States need help. They cant do it all. and they will have an especially hard time if we raise the Federal motor fuels tax and diminish their ability to raise the State motor fuels tax.",

Urquhart. Mr. Urquhart is retiring from the Michigan Employment Security Commission after 25 years of outstanding service to his community. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956. Mr. Urquhart attended Western Michigan University. He later transferred to Michigan Technological University in 1957. In 1960. he began his long and effective public career with the State of Michigan. Mr. Urquhart began first with the Department of Health in Kalamazoo from 1960 to 1963. He also worked for the Michigan Liquor Control Commission from 1963 to 1965. Mr. Urquhart began working for the Michigan Employment Security Commission in 1965 and has been the Flint branch manager since May 1985. It is with this extremely important human service agency that Mr. Urquharts skills became known far and wide. A recent report released by the Michigan Employment Security Commission illustrates Mr. Urquharts acute sensitivity to maintaining a firstrate operation. The report indicates that the Flint branch office received the highest ranking in the State of Michigan for work produced. job service. and unemployment insurance work load in fiscal years 198688. We in Flint are truly blessed to have had someone like James Urquhart piloting a public institution upon which so many people rely for assistance. Mr. Speaker. it is indeed a great honor and pleasure for me to recognize Mr. James Urquhart for nearly three decades of tireless efforts on behalf of the people of the State of Michigan. Although Mr. Urquhart is retiring after many years of hard work. undoubtedly he will continue to involve himself in the community and continue to leave his mark on Flint and Genesee County.

I am happy to join with my colleagues this week in recognizing the Nations libraries in \"National Library Week.\" Libraries play an important role in our education system. Our libraries offer a window on the world through books and other educational materials. Books and reading are basic nourishment of a growing mind and helping children develop into readers today is the best way of insuring a literate and informed citizenry tomorrow. Library Services and Construction Act funds have been used in South Carolina to train library staff in effective ways of bringing children and books together. The impact of this emphasis is reflected in figures which show that children in South Carolina borrowed over 3.7 million books in fiscal year 1988 and 223.838 children attended book related programs in libraries. In my district. the Marion County Library has paired senior citizens and high school students with younger children and the teams meet at the library to read aloud to each other. In my district. 1.653 groups of preschoolers made visits to the libraries or had a visit from a librarian. who introduced them to stories and books. The General Assembly of South Carolina has designated 1989 as the year of the young reader in South Carolina. The Librarian of Congress states the case succinctly: \"The enterprise of reading is of central importance to the health of the Republic. In this country. we have an urgent need to bring more young people into creative contact with books. reading and libraries.\" Public libraries are enthusiastically working to met this need. The South Carolina State Library is coordinating a statewide public awareness program now with the theme \"L+I+B+R+A+R+YThe Formula for Lifelong Education.\" The beginning of this long trek to lifelong education begins in the childrens room of our public libraries.",

Our Navys submarine force began in 1900 with the commissioning of Its first submarine. the Holland. Named for her designer and builder. the ship was 54 feet long. displaced 74 tons submerged. had a submerged speed of 2 knots. and a crew of 7. In 1958. the nuclear powered Nautilus passed under the Arctic ice cap on a track that crossed the North Pole. The use of nuclear power for ship propulsion signified the most important postwar development in submarine technology. With the power source no longer requiring oxygen for combustion. the submarine was now free of its previous ties to the surface. The advent of nuclear power made the submarine truly submersible. The Naval Submarine Base. San Diego. is a major command. with a mission to provide support to the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. In support of this mission. the base is host to several major tenant commands. They represent a combined force of 19 nuclear submarines. 1 diesel submarine. 2 submarine tenders. 2 drydocks. and 4 deep submergence vehicles.",

More important. he was my legislative assistant for foreign affairs. His indepth knowledge of foreign countries. the issues. and U.S. policy was an invaluable resource to me. Equally valuable was his ability and initiative in working with committee and member staff. with Government agencies. foreign governments. and the private sector. He was always cool under both friendly and hostile fire. However. what was perhaps most apropos of his performance was his answer when I asked what he had learned about Congress over these past 9 months. He said. his faith in government was restored and he had learned to appreciate the political process. I began to suspect he was running for office. But he also told me that he was convinced that Congress was functioning just about the way our Founding Fathers had planned it to. not efficiently but with heart. Well.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Congressman TAUZIN. Congressman HuTrO. and their subcommittee staffs for their help In getting my bill. H.R. 2800. Included as a provision In the DOD authorization bill. Section 329 of the committees report provides for the commercial sale of recordings of Armed Forces bands and for the crediting or preceeds to appropriations used for expenses of these bands. The American people will finally have the opportunity to hear these most Impressive bands. and feel the inevitable patriotIsm that Is created by the sound of their music. In the comfort of their own homes. I think it Is worth mentioning how this whole Idea came about. Neariy 3 years ago a constituent wrote to me that he had been to a concert by one of the service bands. FollowIng the performance he inquired on how to purchase a recording of the band. and was told he couldnt because it was against the law for the bands to sell their recordings. Naturally he did not understand the reasoning behind this law and wanted it changed. After Investigating the matter I was surprised to learn that we were the only country In the worid that didnt allow our service bands to sell recordings. There is now an opportunity for all of this to change. and it all began with a simple constituent letter. Mr. Chairman. this is a wonderful example of how the American public has the power to influence the laws created by Congress. Military bands have an enthusiastic following not only across our great Nation. but also worldwide. I have received letters from England. West Germany. Holland. Japan. Canada. and Australia supporting my legislation on the United States bands. The U.S. military bands are sought after and have performed around the world at a variety of celebrations. In fact. a U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps will be performing at the 1990 Edinburgh Tattoo. the most famous military band show in the world. As a result of section 329. no one will have to attend a performance overseas in standing room only or fight the crowds that gather on the Capitol grounds. Any American citizen and enthusiasts abroad will have the brilliance of the U.S. military bands available at will.",

These cuts would have a devastang effect on a vast number of my constituents. both health care providers and. primarily. patients themselves. In this day and time when medical costs are rising drastically. it Is unconscionable to think of further exacerbating the problem for patients. If the services are needed. and the cost of services elsewhere is prohibitivewhich it Isthese proposals will have a most severe impact on those least able to handle the additional burden. Mental health services have never been as widely covered under insurance and other such programs as they should be. I have Introduced legislation for many years that would create a national mental health insurance program. as the need for these services is tremendous. These services are not a luxury. they are a necessity just as traditional medical services are a necessity. The shortsightedness of our lack of universal health insurance coverage is becoming more and more apparent. as the longterm costs eventually usurp any shortterm savings realized by providing little or no health insurance coverage. It is time that we recognize the need for greater coverageincluding greater mental health coveragerather than attempt to balance the Federal budget on the backs of those in need.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of Congressman MAVROULES amendment to H.R. 4739. the fiscal year 1991 Department of Defense authorization bill. which calls for economic stabilization and adjustment programs to mitigate the effects of reductions in defenserelated activities. From now until 1995. between 880.000 and 1.1 million workers are estimated to lose their jobs as a result of military base closures or reductions in defense contracts. If the transition to peacetime employment is not thoughtfully carded out with appropriate adjustment policies. the proposed reductions in defense spending could be disputive to both individuals workers and affected communities across the country. Based upon our committees experience. job training and economic adjustment efforts have proven to be successful in helping dislocated workers to obtain retraining and employment assistance. I am pleased that Mr. MAVROULES amendment incorporates many of the retraining provisions reported by the Education and Labor Committee on July 31. The Defense Conversion Adjustment Program established under the Mavroules amendJSE 23819 ment. creates an obligation for both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Labor to take a proactive role in helping to ease the pain of job loss by affected individuals and communities. The existing Dislocated Work Program under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act would be utilized under the Mavroules proposal. Individuals who lose their jobs because of defense cutbacks would be eligible for skill training. job placement. relocation. and other assistance through title IlIs delivery system. No new or duplicative structures are created to provide the necessary services to the needy individual. States. service delivery areas under JTPA. units of general local government. employers. employer associations. and representatives of employees are eligible for grants from the Secretary of Labor to provide services to dislocated workers. Since there are contralnts in current programs. an additional $150 million would be authorized to support this transitional retraining program under JTPA. The Mavroules amendment represents an excellent foundation which is necessary for a smooth defense adjustment program. We must continue to stand behind the American workers who help to build a strong defense for our country. More Importantly. we must support programs for those same workers who become unemployed as we experience substantial declines in military expenditures over the next several years. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Mavroules amendment to the Defense authorization bill.",

This amendment is the product of negotiations between the principals of the committees of Jurisdiction and contains modifications responsive to the policy and jurisdictional concerns of both committees. Specifically. the measure establishes requirements to identify Defense acquisition personnel positions and defines \"acquisition corps\" personnel as critical positions employees. The amendment establishes provisions aimed at increasing the number of civilians in senior acquisitions positions. It also establishes a Defense Acquisition University Structure and authorizes an intern. cooperative education. and scholarship program for acquisition personnel.

I also understand that they have stayed In constant touch with DOD. in particular Under Secretary John Betti. during the drafting phase and that much of the Departments input is reflected In the amendment before us. However. it is also my understanding that there are a few outstanding issues where no agreement has been reached and where further consideration is therefore warranted. For instance. this amendment contains extensive and detailed reporting requirements which. in my mind. run counter to the committees initiative this year to cut down on the number of congressional reports we require. I hope this problem will be reexamined in conference. I also understand that the size of the acquisition corps under the Mavroules amendment could end up being over 23.000 people which appears excessive and possibly selfdefeating. Again. I believe this area needs some more work. Lastly.

Many Members have been asking about floor action on Friday. and we have been trying to alert Members to the fact that we may have floor action on that day. and we have scheduled it for that day. especially in light of the fact of sequestration coming on October 16. We may need to be on the floor that day relating to sequestration. avoiding sequestration. and finishing the work on reconciliation and other appropriations bills.",

I wish to call my colleagues attention to remarks I made yesterday in a special order of the House. concerning the efforts of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee to better understand the risks associated with Governmentsponsored enterprises. These remarks are printed on page H6649 of ber 4. 1989. When I speak of GSEs. I am referring to organizations such as Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac. Sallie Mae. and the Farm Credit System. GSEs are corporations created by Federal charter. which are backed by the implicit guarantee of the U.S. Treasury. but which are completely off the Federal budget. I primarily want to alert the Members of the House that because GSEs have the implicit backing of the Federal Treasury. they represent an inherent risk to the taxpayer. Over the past 3 years these potential risks have become all too real. and Congress has had to spend tens of billions of dollars in bailouts. Mr. Speaker. let me be clear. I do not wish to leave the inference that any GSE is presently in financial difficulty. and I do not feel that there is any reason for public alarm. However. I do believe that these operations merit careful scrutiny. It is for this reason that I Joined with Congressman GRADISON and Congressman SCHULZE to initiate legislation requiring the Treasury Department to study and report on GSEs. The public. the Congress. and the administration all have a strong interest in seeing that GSEs are soundly managed so as to anticipate and minimize the risks inherent in carrying out their important public purpose. We hope to keep the House informed of the progress made by the Treasury Department in carrying out this study. and I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to these important issues.",

But I did not know that that was going to extend to Norlega. I must say that I. as many others. have been very. very perplexed by the administrations explanation of what happened. We keep hearing they did not get enough invitations to the coup. I mean. how often do you have any information about a coup? They then said. well. they did not have enough intelligence. My goodness. we have got South come down there. That is the headquarters of our commander of the whole south region. with tens of thousands of soldiers. And we are talking about not a huge continent. we are talking about Panama. very small place. What do you mean. with all that notice. that we did not know where Noreiga was and we did not know what to do and this and that and the other? I really find all of this very. very troubling. I certainly hope that we can get a much better explanation. There has got to be more than we have heard so far or we are really in trouble.",

Yesterday this administration and this country took a giant step backwards. It was given a golden opportunity to end a reign of terror. the golden opportunity to do away with a thug who has been indicated by two grand Juries. given a golden opportunity to say to the rest of Central and South America that we mean what we say and we stand behind what we mean. But I am sorry to stand in this well and tell you that the administration. the President. froze at the controls. froze at the controls. and has let an opportunity pass to do away with this tin dictator who is allowing the importation of drugs into this country that are killing our youth and going to the very roots of our society.",

Tuesday some reports indicate that we were given a chance to capture the most notorious drug dealer in the world. What did we do? Did we pass up an opportuntity to capture the man personally responsible. the man indicted in our courts for shipping tons of drugs onto our streets? That is the question the American people should have answered. Mr. President. it is time for a full accounting. There are more different conflicting versions of what happened in Panama floating around. most from different people in your administration. than Carter has Little Liver Pills. We have had one version saying the rebels did not want to give Noriega up. another version saying It was too risky to capture him. a third version saying it was a plot to trick us. and another version saying we could not make up our minds in time. Mr. President. which is it? What happened? Why did we miss the opportunity and pass up one of the worlds greatest thugs? Mr. President. the American people support your tough words on drugs. but they would support tough action as well.",

Bonnie Pugh. of course. is the wife of Robert Pugh. our Ambassador to Chad. who was killed on the fateful flight from Chad to Paris most recently. Bonnie Pugh was educated at the University of California at Berkeley. She married a young Marine officer. and she was his stalwart companion throughout his military service. When he Joined the State Department. Bonnie became one of those wonderful Foreign Service wives who extends the service of their husbands. rendering to our Nation. I had the honor of knowing her work first hand when they were stationed in Greece. My daughter. Cokle Roberts. and her husband. Stephen. were there at the same time. We all had an opportunity to see some of Bonnies fine work when her husband. Robert. was a congressional liaison for the State Department. However. it was in Beirut where she really shone in her love and her extension of service to Members and to our country. It was there that she stayed the entire time that her husband was stationed in Beirut. giving comfort and strength and courage to the whole American community. and to those other diplomats who were strong enough and courageous enough to stay there. It is a very sad note that a woman such as Bonnie Pugh had to be inadvertently engaged in an act of terrorism. I would say in her words. she would wish to be remembered making certain that she served all of the areas of our countrys life and of our countrys intention. throughout the world. and that she would be glad to be a martyr in the cause of peace.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is unfortunate indeed what happened on Tuesday in Panama. While I. like some of my colleagues before me. would criticize the President of the United States and the chain of command all the way down. for failing to be ready for an event for which we. ourselves. have been calling for months and months. and for failing to have the intelligence capability to know where the man whom we wish to have removed is. every single minute of the day. especially after notification In advance of an impending coup. Notwithstanding that. it is really a sad day because the losers in this are. once again. the people of Panama who have been denied the right to charter their own course. their own will. for democracy. Once again. the people of Panama have been given the short end of the stick. They had the guts to go and obtain. through an election process. a victory for freedom. They won that election. and it was stolen from them by General Noriega. They then had the courage in the snape of a small band of loyal officers to decide if it was time to do something. for their own reasons. but also for democracy. and let it not be lost that they issued a call on the radio for immediate elections under OAS supervision as soon as possible. while they still had control. It was through these people and the attempts that the Panamanians have shown that drew feelings. and we were not for them. We found a lot of reasons on Tuesday not to be there for the Panamanians. but nobody else was. either. The shame of this whole incident is that it mirrors the ineffectiveness in this whole hemisphere of policies not implemented. and rhetoric hollow in words. It is time to start standing up for democracy. Not only do Americans desire that. but the Panamanians and others in this hemisphere deserve it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after much debate. I voted against passage. final passage. of the budget reconciliation measure. While there were several good features in this bill. such as child care provisions. I felt that the overall bad outweighed the overall good. For instance. the budget reconciliation bill is to reduce the deficit. but I have a sneaking suspicion the bill which was to reduce the deficit may end up increasing it. Second. the bill almost completely eliminates major Medicare without replacing care for low and middle income. and comes on top of the capital gains reduction which only adds to the deficit while giving little relief to middle income persons. Third. this bill became a legislative barbell. with more and more weighty matters getting hung on the end. After a while. Mr. Speaker. it simply cannot be lifted. Finally. I am glad it is over. I am glad it is over. Mr. Speaker. because this reconciliation process is like the reconciliation process I used to see in practicing domestic relations law. Too much reconciliation. and after a while. nobody can talk to one another anymore.",
