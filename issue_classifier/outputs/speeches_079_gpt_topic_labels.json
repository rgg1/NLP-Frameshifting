    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Public Buildings Administration has issued a report which shows that 6 months before Pearl Harbor the Federal Government occupied 68.277.000 [square feet of leased office space throughout the country. On VJday. August 1945. this total had increased to 227.800.000 square feet. Six months after VJday the Government had released but 4.000.000 square feet. We must re.member that this is leased space and does not include the enormous number \"of buildings owned by the Government. In New York City 36 agencies and bureaus occupied -in excess of 6.000.000 square feet of rented space as of late February. This accounted for about 10 perccnt of the total cfficq space in New York City. The Federal Government has been reluctant to relinquish space they now occupy. In doing this. they keep private business and returning veterans from getting proper office space. In connection with the Federal pay roll. there has been little reduction since VJday. Excluding the Army.and the Navy personnel. the pay roll has actually increased. during January. 34.569more than 1.000 people a day. including Sundays. A review of the appropriation bills indicates that there are some eight Government agencies working on labor problems. The Presidents requested -budget for 1947 is nearly double that of 1945. Yes. more than the alltime high for F. D. R. in wartime. There are some 60 agencies that gather statistics and put out propaganda to the public. Much of these statistics is never used. There are 30 agencies set up to lend the peoples money. A dczen different agencies deal with the problem of health. Is .it not about time that this Congress demand that Fcderal pay rolls be reduced. that overlapping and the duplication of various agencies be curtailed? Unless this Congress takes drastic action and cuts appropriation bills for this sprawling Government bureaucracy. the Budget will never be balancedpay rolls will increase and more office space demanded.",

We had thousands of pounds of dried milk and dried eggs and many thousands of pounds of other commodities that are being sold by the Government. If we would turn those commodities over to UNRRA or give them to the Red Cross instead of trying to sell them at commercial prices and taking a loss. and if we did the same with the Army rations we would save money for this country by buying more and in that way we would keep down our expenses.

In some parts of my State as many as onethird of the farm homes are vacant. In the metropolitan counties. of course. the percentage is much smaller than that. But even in those counties the trend away from the farms is noticeable. City jobs offer more money for less work. and only a small percentage of men drafted from farms are returning to them after their discharges from the armed service. In the face of this trend away from farming. the famine which is facing a large part of the world today becomes a desperate problem. Meatless days. wheatless days. belttightening are all minor stopgaps. What is needed is bumper production of farm crops. A start in that direction could be made if the Selective Service System would abide by the law which Congress passed. and particularly by the Tydings amendment to that law. Even today. with the shooting war over. Selective Service is flouting the Tydings amendment. As a preventive of World War III. plentiful food is more effective than a large peacetime army.",

Certain Republican members of this committee have brought Franklin D.

They may think they are fooling the American public. but the American people are quick to catch on. The American public caught up with their actions. General Marshall. with a plane waiting for him several days to take him on an important mission over to China. one of the most important in the history of our country. was on the stand 8 days. 8 days under crossexamination. I think 6 or 7 by one member of the committee not a Democratic member. Then there was the matter of going out to the hospital with the photographers several days before the public hearings started. All those things are illustrations. The American people realized they were trying to get something on Franklin D. Roosevelt. That is what they were determined to do. They brought Franklin D. Roosevelt in as an issue. Roosevelt is an issue this year. he will be an issue next year. but I repeat here what I said at Newark last Saturday night: Franklin D. Roosevelt licked the Republican Party four times In life and. as they have raised the issue by the Pearl Harbor investigation which will make it an issue this year. Franklin D.

Two conferees on behalf of the Senate who supported the conference report are Republicans. So far as the Republican Party is concerned. or at least so far as the Republican conferees on behalf of the Senate were concerned. they were completely in favor of the conference report. The same statement holds true with reference to the conferees on the part of the House. Since the beginning of the war. especially so far as the Senate Military Affairs Committee. the Senate Committee on Education and Labor. and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations are concerned. there has never been any reference to political action in connection with any measure being considered.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. a few weeks ago we passed a bill appropriating about $6.000.000 to finance the taking of a farm census. Many of us were opposed to it on the ground that this is no time to take such a census. in view of the manpower shortage. Now we find that farmers are beginning to rebel. I want to read from a newspaper article from one of my counties with reference to what is going on in that connection. This article appeared in the Evening Times of Monroe. Wis.: A few Green County farmers. suspicious of the motives behind the Federal farm census. have barred the enumerators from their farms or have refused to yield any information concerning their farming operations. In that county we have a splendid county agent by the name of Edwin Baker. Mr. Baker has been endeavoring to secure the information that is required by the Farm Census Bureau. He has had to call for help. and he has called in the State chairman of enumerators. Between the two. they have been attempting to sell the farmers in Green County on the idea that this census is necessary. I read a further excerpt from the article. This is a statement made by the State enumerator. a Mr. Smithback. He said: In some Wisconsin counties farmers greeted census enumerators with axes and shotguns. displaying a belligerency which. said Baker. showed a lack of understanding .of the motives behind the census. The enumerators. Baker wants to assure the farmers. are not getting information for tax purposes. are not snooping. but are carrying on a regular 5year census. The farmers. however. come back with this proposition. and I conclude reading from the article: What befuddles the enumerators and other officials. of course. is when the farmer bluntly says: \"Why. when most of this information (all that Is pertinent) already is in the hands of the triple A. does a government which is pleading for manpower. pleading for conservation of cars and tires and traveling. send 12.000 men out in cars to traverse the countryside. to get information which already Is on file I \" Mr. Chairman. that sounds much like the argument that was made on this floor only a few weeks ago. I believe a serious mistake was made when this House appropriated more than $6.000.000 to conduct a farm census at this particular time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in order that the Senate may thoroughly understand the entire story. let us recapitulate a little further. In 1941. 1942. and 1943. Mexico tried to develop pumping on the lower river. .She suffered severe losses because the river meanders. and the flow is uncertain. Then Mexico began to abandon her pumping. But in 1944 she had more -land than she could irrigate by pumping. .which had not proved successful. Mexico said that she .had. sustained a very heavy. loss. running in.to millions of dol.lars. and would continue to sustain it unless we relieved her. She was relieved by a planwhich was worked out by the Secretary of State. the Bureau of Reclamation. and the Imperial irrigation district. Through the AllAmerican Canal. and partly through the Alamo Canal. she was given 1.100.000 acrefeet of water. I have no objection to the Senator making whatever argument he cares to make out of the. situation which I have de.scribed. but in frankness. I think he should state to the Senate that.the State Department attached a condition to the delivery of the water that it should not constitute any precedent by which Mexico should receive that much water again. Mr. President. we do not have to indulge ifi an involved argument in attempting to determine how much acreage was irrigated before the construction of Boulder Dam. and how much acreage has been irrigated since then. We have the definite records of the Mexican company and the United States company with regard to the diversion of 1.100.000 acrefeet of water out of the river. and the delivery into the laterals of 980.000 acrefeet. I believe the loss was approximately 7 or 8 percent. and not 25 or 30 percent. as the distinguished Senator was led to believe by certain witnesses. the most important of whom was. I believe. the witness from the State of Colorado. We also have the recorots as to what was required in delivering 750.000 acrefeet of water. The loss of 300.000 or 400.000 acrefeet of water in the canal in the distance involved. is almost unbelievable. At an almost insignificant additional cost it would be possible to concrete the canal and prevent the loss.",

I believe the Senator will admit that the lands which have been serviced by pumping are different lands entirely from the ones about which he was speaking. So I considered the statistics with regard to pumping out of. the Yuma drain over a long period of years. and Iadded that amount to the 1.100.000 acrefeet. Then. in order to bring that into relation with the Senators claim as to what was being used during preBoulder Dam days I developed that the acreage which was watered from the Mexican laterals last year.was less than it was during the year in which the maximum was taken before the construction of Boulder Dam. The Senator has not answered my statement. I am willing that the Senator jump either way. but I suggest that- he jump one way or the other.",

It is thoroughly understandable why many of them do not feel it necessary to do so. but that does not change the unfortunate situation to Which I have had reference.

There is no way to compel them to do so. because every time a point of no quorum is made a quorum is developed and then it evaporates before the roll call is over. My experience here has led me to believe that the best way to get a quorum to remain in the Senate. or to keep .what the Senator calls a respectable attendance. is to have some concrete proposition before the Senate. We cannot keep Senators here indefinitely over a general debate on a treaty or anything else. and I think the Senator from California will find that if he offers something which goes to the merits of the treaty. in the way of an amendment or a reservation. he will be honored by a larger attendance of Senators than he can ever expect to remain and listen to merely prolongated debate upon the general treaty itself. I say that with great respect.

With respect to the question of meat this shortage already exists and is daily becoming more serious. The supply of meat depends upon the amount of livestock feed available. A poor feed crop this year or the loss of any of our existing supplies of feed will further curtail the amount of meat which will be available during the coming months. With this thought in mind I call to the attention of the ccmmittees in the House and Senate which are investigating the food situation the fact that there are millions of bushels of valuable livestock feed which is now rotting on the ground because of a lack of transportation. Unless relief is speedily afforded there will be lost forever the equivalent of millions of pounds of pork. beef. and poultry. Everyone knows how serious is our shortage of transportation facilities. Everyone knows that our railroads and the Office of Defense Transportation are laboring under tremendous difficulties in trying to move the vast amounts of war material. food. and other necessary supplies. As short as we are of transportation facilities. however. there is no justification for a policy which is resulting in the loss of valuable food supplies at a time when food shortages become more threatening every day. It is time that those who have the responsibility for allocating transportation give greater heed to this situation than has previously. been the case.",

From the very beginning the record will show the good percentages of enlistment and of voluntary service as well as the drafting of the men from the farms. It has been stated that 364.000 men are in this deferred class for agriculture between the ages of 18 and 25 and approximately 303.000 between the ages of 26 and 29.

These 364.000 Tmen were under the Tydings amendment until this January 3 directive came from the selective service. Now there has been brought into it. in addition to the statement from Mr. Krug and Mr. Jones. the statement from the President of the United States that there is an essential need for men in the armed service which is greater at the moment than the need for men in agriculture.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment would strike out the proviso that has been in this bill for a number of years. This proviso precludes the District from testing its own material. It makes it impossible for the District to use its own laboratory constructed and equipped some years ago at a cost of $100.000. So. the testing of material for the District of Columbia is done at the Bureau of Standards. The officials of the District that appeared before your subcommittee insisted that since 1934 it has cost the District of Columbia more than $100.000 in excess of what the cost would have been had the District used its own laboratory. They claim it is costing them four times as much to test material at the Bureau of Standards as it would cost if they were allowed to test it in their own laboratory. Your subcommittee. feeling that this would be one place to save money for the District taxpayers. decided to eliminate the proviso and allow the District to test its own material and accomplish this saving. However. I wish the committee to know that this proviso was placed in this bill by the full committee. by an overwhelming vote. on an amendment offered by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. But your subcommittee is unanimous in the belief that a saving can be made here. I ask for a vote on the amendment.",

You probably recall that. when the Treasury appropriation bill was before this body. we had a most peculiar rule. waiving all points of order. I opposed that rule then. and I am opposed to it now. The House is facing this situation because you did not listen to those who were opposed to attaching legislation to an appropriation bill. There is criticism because the other body has attached a rider to this bill. Who set the precedent? Did not this House attach the socalled Green bill to the Treasury appropriation bill? We are getting the logical results of our indiscreet action. It is said no hearings were held by the House. Of course no hearings were held. because the proper legislative committee of this body should have had supervision over this particular legislation. The other body. in the consideration of this appropriation bill. did hold extensive hearings. Yet I believe the only sane solution would have been to refer this to the proper legislative committee. I want to impress upon the Members that. when we adopted that peculiar rule. waiving all points of order. we asked for exactly the parliamentary situation which faces this body at the present time. There are three reasons for this current silver shortage: First. an increased demand in foreign countries. particularly in the Orient. because they do not like and do not trust paper money. second. there has been a 200percent increase in the industrial use of silver. and third. there has been about a 50percent decline in the domestic production of silver. We all know that. during the war. we were willing to go along with the socalled Green bill. because it was only logical that we utilize the idle stores of silver owned by the Federal Treasury in order to stimulate the production of munitions and supplies essential to the war effort. Why is there no silver today? The gentleman from Illinois said that the world price is about 35 cents. The gentleman knows full well that. if foreign silver were procurable at 35 cents the silver processors in the Eastern States would not want to pay 71.11 an ounce. There is no silver available in the world market at under $1 an ounce.",

My colleagues. let us be sane about this. As I said. I objected to the intrusion of legislation in considering an appropriation bill. But this body asked for it. The present price of silver is less than the cost of production. The silver processors are willing to pa- not only 71.11 cents. but 90.03 cents.

It says you shall not sell at less than that figure. This means that if the Treasury. in its judgment. wanted to exact a little more. they could do so. In other words. there is a floor but no ceiling. I think that may clear up some of the fog that prevails here. There is no danger of the Governments incurring any loss. There has been some discussion about this legislation coming before us as a rider on an appropriation bill. Frankly. that is the only way there could have been any aid secured.

I intend to support the motion offered by the gentleman from Idaho because I believe this compromise on the price of silver which has been worked out in the other body is the best possible solution to this problem. It is for the best interests of all concerned that an agreement be reached as quickly as possible. In my opinion the compromise reached in the other body is fair and reasonable. and I had hoped that it would be accepted by our conferees. Mr. Speaker. I have the greatest sympathy for the processors and industrial users of silver. We want them to have silver and to use more silver in their operations. However. I want to call your attention to the fact that before any processor or manufacturer can obtain the silver he requires. that silver must first be mined. It is therefore necessary to offer sufficient inducements and price incentives to the producers of silver before they will assume the risks and hazards involved in the mining of silver. Many mines are closed today because the price of silver has not kept pace with the increased costs of production. I also feel. Mr. Speaker. that we should produce as much silver as possible in this country. I call attention to the fact that the industrial consumption of silver has increased from 22.000.000 ounces a few years ago. to an average of 116.000.000 ounces during the 1941 to 1945 period. At the same time our domestic production dropped from 50.000.000 ounces annually to 46.000.000 ounces. This trend should be reversed and we should make every possible effort to get our silver mines open again. The production of silver will be stimulated and encouraged if we concur in the Senate amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I hope the House will vote to recede and concur in the Senate amendment to this Treasury and Post Office appropriation bill. Such a rider as this should never have been permitted on an appropriation measure but you will recall that the Rules Committee passed a special rule making it in order that it be done. It is necessary that the price of silver be increased if the metal mines of my State continue in operation. The fact is. that since 1941 the number of lode mines of all classes has been reduced from 4.542 to 1.186 due to the prohibitive cost of production. The cost of silver mining has increased 60 to 70 percent. Since 80 percent of the silver produced domestically comes from mines that also produce copper. lead. and zinc. this means that the production of those important commodities is also being reduced. Conversely. an increase in the price of silver would serve to stimulate the production of all these metals. Silver fabricators and brokers testified before the Senate committee that the level of their needs before the war was from thirty to thirtyfive million ounces of silver a year. whereas their estimated needs in 1945 were 140.000.000 ounces. This is due to such uses as photographic supplies. electrical uses. dental and pharmaceutical products. engine bearings. jewelry. and silverware. The United States Mint reports show that the domestic production of silver has steadily decreased from 72.000.000 ounces in 1937 to 29.000.000 ounces in 1945. Basically. silver has been a 75 percent monetary metal and 25 percent industrial metal. This increased demand with the reduced production. has resulted in a world price on April 30 this year at Bombay of $1.33 an ounce and a dollar or more an ounce almost anywhere outside the United States. For these reasons it seems eminently fair to agree to the Senate compromise of 90.3 cents an ounce for the next 2 years at least.",

Some people have the termerity to say that we must now pay 90 cents an ounce for silver for 2 years and thereafter the extortionate amount of $1.29 an ounce. Prior to the World War the average world price for silver was less than 35 cents. We were compelled to pay 71 cents an ounce for all the silver mined in this country. thus giving to the silvermine owners a subsidy. Not being satisfied with that. they want now to increase the subsidy and put a gun at the people of the United States and say. \"Stand and deliver. We want 90 cents. and 2 years hence we want more subsidy in the form of $1.29 per ounce.\" This House is not going to stand for that sort of thievery. because that is what it is.",

My appeal is for the small miners. many of whom in my State have been forced to close down because of the treatment they have had during the war by the Government in the handling of their mines. About 80 percent of these small mines in the West have been forced to close. We need these mines in order to produce the silver and the other minerals produced from these mines in combination with silver. that is copper. lead. and zinc. Mr. Speaker. since July 1. 1939. there has been no raise granted in the price of silver. During that time the cost of mining operations has risen 60 to 70 percent. The result has been that 80 percent of the small mines of the West producing silver. lead. copper. and zinc have been forced to cease operations. This in the face of a shortage of silver. lead. copper. and zinc in this country. One of the principal minerals found in the deposits with silver is lead. A short time ago the oil refineries of my State appealed to me for aid in obtaining tetraethyl fluid to make antiknock gasoline. On investigation I found that this country was on an import basis as regards lead. something unheard of before the war. I further found the world supply was very short. Antiknock gasoline must be limited because of a shortage of lead. I might extend my remarks to other uses of silver. lead. copper. and zinc but this illustration will make my point. which is that we need to encourage these small mining operators and it will be to the advantage of not only the mining in the West but to all the people of the country who are users of these minerals.

I believe if we permit these people to buy silver. even at a price of 90 cents per ounce or better still at $1.29 per ounce. the United States Treasury is doing the right thing by them and they can go ahead and buy it. The gentleman from Idaho stood in the well of the House and showed us the profits made by the jewelers. The gentleman from Idaho stood right here and picked up about a dollars worth of silver and showed how it had been put into a vessel that cost him about $20. The enormous profits that are made by these manufacturers could easily pay the difference between 71.11 cents per ounce and $1.29 per ounce. Concerning the motionpicture industry. in which I am also greatly interested. I want to tell you that the way we pay at the door going into a theater and considering the salaries that are paid to producers and actors. it would certainly warrant that industrys paying $1.29 for all the silver they use in pictures.

The estimated cost of this hospital center is anywhere from twenty to thirty million dollars. It was originally estimated at $20.000.000 when it came from the Senate. There are no other hospitals in the District. apparently. that want to go into this hospital center. So with the $5.000.000 of assets that they will turn over to the Federal Works Administration. the Federal Works Administration with the other twenty to thirty million dollars will construct the hosptal and the representatives of these three hospitals will go in and operate this huge medical center. There is not a representative of the District of Columbia to be on the board. There is not a representative of the United States Department of Health or the Federal Government to be on the board.

I have used three charts and many tables from the Agriculture and the Commerce Departments. I have also used the Carl H. Wilken chart on factory pay rolls and national farm income in this study. Chart No. I indicates the total agricultural exports and imports. Chart No. II shows the exports and imports of foodstuffs. These charts were obtained from the Department of Commerce. which Department also furnished a breakdown of the food items used in the charts. The imports and exports of foodstuffs include meat products. dairy products. fish. animal edible fats. grains and preparations. vegetables and preparations. fruits and preparations. edible vegetable oils. sugar. glucose. fruit juices. tapioca. nuts. and feeds.

In 1920 we passed the Transportation Act to amend the Interstate Commerce Act. I happened to be one of the conferees on the part of the House in the resolving of the differences between the two Houses on the Transportation Act. It was first passed in the House as the Esch bill. coming out of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. It came over to the Senate at the time Senator Cummins. of Iowa. was the chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce of the Senate. The bill was extensively amended. went to conference. and was in conference 6 weeks. Out of that conference came the Transportation Act of 1920. Neither in the original law nor in any of the amendments ever adopted to it. nor in the Transportation Act of 1920. nor in any other act since that time has Congress ever seriously considered lifting railroad transportation out from under the antitrust laws. Now. we are confronted with another bill to take away from the courts the right to pass upon practices indulged in by railroads. There is now one case dealing with such practices in the Supreme Court of the United States. and there is litigation pending in Nebraska brought by the Attorney General of the United States against certain railroads in that area tor practices which the Department of Justice feels are in violation of the antitrust laws. I ask the Senate in all seriousness. how often and to what extent are we to constitute ourselves into a supreme court in order to take away from the court litigation which has gone there properly under the law. in order that we may cut the ground out from under the Supreme Court in determining what is the law in regard to these situations?

Congress is asked to enact a law passing upon the question in advance of the courts having an opportunity to pass upon it. I think it is a vicious practice. I think it is a vicious habit. it ought never to have been indulged in. This measure involves the same principle as that involved in the insurance cases. It involves the same sort of situation as existed last week when the Senate passed a bill taking away from the courts its jurisdiction of passing on the tidelands controversies. And now for the third time we are asked to take similar action. by lifting the railroads out from under the antitrust laws so that no court can pass on the validity of agreements. combinations. all sorts of things that involve practices and rates and agreements and combinations. Everything we can think of that the antitrust laws were enacted to outlaw would be possible under this bill if it should become law. only subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. and the Interstate Commerce Commission has no power and will have no power under the bill nor under the law to inflict any penalty for violation. even if it is in connection with approved combinations that might be entered into under this legislation. \ufffd I am deeply inearnest about this matter.

We dare not demand immediate return of all our boys. we dare not urge conversion to peace production until all military needs are met. If VEday is to mean the beginning of lasting peace. instead of just another 20year armistice. we must work immediately and continuously for an International organization with both justice and teeth in it.

We dare not think in terms of going back to prewar standards. we must agree to go forward to a new high standard of living for everyone.

Walker last night sent to the Treasury Department a check for $51.102.579the largest single payment to the Treasury for postal surpluses he has made. The check brought to the $150.000.000 mark payments from surpluses for the fiscal year which will end on Saturday. June 30. when Mr. Walker retires as Postmaster General. For the fiscal year which ended June 30. 1943. the Post Office Department had a surplus of $1.334.551. This was the first surplusin 24 years. It was followed by a $37.768.028 surplus in 1944. The sums with which the postal service was dealing became so large that Mr. Walker. during the present fiscal year. inaugurated the practice of paying surpluses into the Treasury at the end of each quarter. The check mailed yesterday brought to $189.102.579 payments to the Treasury from postal surpluses during the time that Mr. Walker has served as Postmaster General.",

This is just one ofthe steps to see to it that they do live up to the mandate. I have heard that we should bring this matter of postal rates before the House all at one time. There is no mandate as to making either second- or thirdclass mail pay its way. that is entirely at the discretion of the Congress. they can do that or they do not need to do that. but since this law is on the books requiring that all fourthclass mail pay its way then it seems to me there is nothing left for us to do but to see to it that all subsidies on the different types of fourthclass mail are removed.",

The Post Office Department advises your committee that it costs roughly $5.000.000 to handle the catalogs that go through the Post Office Department. that they receive for handling those catalogs $4.000.000. in other words. the catalogs of the country are being handled by the Post Office Department at a loss of $1.000.000. or. to look at it in another way. the catalog people are paying 80 percent for handling the catalogs and the general public is paying the other 20 percent. Why the taxpayers and why the businessmen of this country should pay 20 percent of the costs of handling the catalogs of the catalog houses is beyond my understanding. The proposition is very simple and. as the gentleman from Illinois said. we are just carrying out the law. We have already passed a parcel post law that has been adopted by the House and we are trying to see that all of these different classes of mail in the fourthclass department are put on a selfsustaining payasyougo basis which is certainly sound for the Congress and the Nation to do.

It is an undisputed fact that for years the Post Office Department has been carrying and delivering. catalogs for the large mailorder houses at a loss of a million dollars or more per year. Is It fair to continue to subsidize these large mailorder houses in the carriage of their catalogs through the mails? Here is what happens to your catalogs that go through the mails. These large mailorder houses send their catalogs by freight or by truck to the various centers of the United States and there deposit them in the post offices for local delivery. on rural routes. or for delivery within zones 1 and 2. They do not send their catalogs more than 175 miles through the mails because of the cost. If this bill is adopted it will only mean a cost of about 2 cents on every catalog. Catalogs are the advertising media of the mailorder houses. No mailorder house can exist today without catalogs. Why in the world should the Post Office Department be called upon to continue to subsidize these large mailorder houses? It is not fair to the local businessman for the Post Office Department to pay a subsidy of a million dollars per year to the large mailorder houses in the carriage of their catalogs. I cannot see how any Member could be opposed to this legislation. It provides enough revenue to make the carriage and the delivery of catalogs selfsustaining. I know that you are not in favor of a subsidy for sending catalogs through the mail. May I say to the gentleman on my left that the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads is making a study now of first-. second-. and thirdclass matter. and expects to bring in bills readjusting the rates on those classes of mail.

But In recent years there has been developed a new system of shipping these catalogs into various local areas and distributing them by individual doortodoor carriers. rather than by mail. in order to save money. However. I want to go to another point which the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee failed entirely to mention. There are two or three large mailorder houses in this country that may possibly get a small advantage here. But there are literally thousands upon thousands. if you please. of small manufacturers who are sending out their small catalogs to the small businessmen. over whom some have been crying here today. for that is the way the small businessmen purchase the commodities and goods they sell. They buy from the catalogs sent to them by the small manufacturers. What you are actually doing by this type of legislation is to place a burden upon the small manufacturers of this Nation at the very time when we are trying to reconvert back to peacetime production. I am not interested in the large mailorder houses. these three or four concerns that the gentleman has in mind and which he knows so well. Instead. I am interested in the thousands upon thousands of little manufacturers and small businessmen over the country who use their service and who will be penalized by this bill. Remember the postal service as a whole is a profitmaking venture today. Remember that the small manufacturers are also using firstclass postage. and by the passage of this bill the firstclass postage of this country will in no way be reduced but will simply increase. if you please. the profits of the Post Office Department.",

We do have a surplus today. We had one of $5.000.000 in the previous fiscal year. but this is the first surplus in 14years. If you will take the Post Office Department statement for the past 14 years you will find the Post Office Department has lost more than a quarter of a billion dollars. Where did that money come from? It came from the pockets of the taxpayers. because every one of those annual deficits was made up by a deficit appropriation which you Members of the House had to vote. Therefore it so happens that over a normal period of time there is a deficit in the Post Office. The reason that firstclass mail today is making a profit is because you raised the local rate from 2 cents to 3 cents. and because of the fact that so many people are dislocated. working in war industries and places like that and thney are writihg back home and the folks at home are writing to them. The boys in the service write back home free. but the letters going to them are either going by air mail or by firstclass mail and paid for. That has built up an artificial volume of mail. which will not pertain when we get back to normal times. Now. if we are going to be factual about this thing. this is the time to adjust it while we do know what we can do.

The bill of course is not perfect. Some things have been brought out here this afternoon that ought to have been brough out as to who was exempted under the bill. The Congress should make it clear whom it intends to cover and whom it intends to exempt before any legislation is enacted. But I think we should enact this legislation now with a full realization that a heavy moral responsibility rests upon the Congress to give to those engaged in agriculture the just consideration which they fully deserve and which .we very properly should also give to industry and labor.

As the Senator said a while ago. the Senator from Rhode Island would ascertain whether some product of his State was affected. the Senator from Illinois would ascertain whether some product of his State was affected. and the Senators and Representatives from all the 43 States of the Union would seek to tack onto an agreement amendments. and thus the old logrolling system would be renewed. As you sgid in the committee the other day. the system of \"You scratch my back and I will scratch yours\" would be revived. That was the old system. If we adopt it again. when we get through there will be nothing left to which any other nation will agree. That is the truth of the matter. In that case. the trade agreements would be gone.

Not only is it unnecessary but it is unconstitutional for us to say what we are saying in this section of the bill. The question of just compensation is a judicial question. not a legislative question at all. I should like to place in the RECORD at this point the following language from the case I have just cited. which may clear up this point: By this legislation. Congress seems to have assumed the right to determine what sr.l be the measure of compensation. Lut th.s Is a judicial and not a legislative question. The legislature may determine what private property Is needed for public purposesthat is a question of a political and legislative character. but when the taking has been ordered. then the question of compensation Is judicial. It does not rest with the public. taking the property. through Congress or the legislature. its representative. to say what compensation shall be paid. or even what shall be the rule of compensation. Mr. President. the Constitution says that one from whom property is taken is entitled to just compensation.

I should like to make another point with respect to the use of the word \"employees.\" The section says that it is the policy of the Congress. and so forth. that neither the employer nor the employees shall profit by reason of the Government operation. The only possible way by which an employee could profit would be to have his wages increased. He does not participate in the profits which are distributed among the stockholders. In that sense he does not share. anyway. in what we ordinarily call profits. But inasmuch as we have provided here that while the Government is operating the plant the Government may adjust the wages and working conditions. it certainly is inconsistent to say in the following section. which I am now moving to amend by striking out the language referred to. that the employees shall not be entitled to any profit. which might be interpreted to mean. if it were interpreted to mean anything. that the employee could not receive any adjustment of his wages. no matter how long the Government might hold and operate the plant.

The Wagner Act was placed on the statute books in order to provide labor and capital with an opportunity to sit down and bargain together without interference from anyone. and if men did not want work. they had a right to go on strike. and if those who owned factories did not want to operate them. they had a right to close them. That was the happy theoretical philosophy. Now we find that just so soon as some strikes occur. there is a desire to throw the whole machinery overboard. and to destroy the gains which political orators talked about and said that labor had madethe sacred right of collective bargaining and other rights of the workingmen As I see thesituation. both sides are attempting to enlarge the field of collective bargaining. That attempt is made by both those who have upheld it as a wonderful benefit and those who have attacked it.",

It is simply a measure which levies a taxor it will. when all of its parts are put togetherupon those who work for employers. The tax will be in a certain amount. The employer will be required to pay the same amount. and there will be certain Federal appropriations. and perhaps some State appropriations in the long run.-one way or another. to make up the total sum of money which will make possible the providing of all the care that is contemplated.",

During the consideration by Congress of the amendment to the civilservice retirement system. which became the act of January 24. 1942. the Commission. upon request of the Civil Service Coin-. mittee. submitted a report in which It recommended approval of the bill. When the bill was approved it contained provisions extending retirement coverage to heads of departments. independent establishments. and agencies (including corporations) in the executive branch of the Federal Government. The act of March 7. 1942. withdrew this particular coverage. There are at present about 2.000.000 positions in the executive branch of the Federal Government covered by the civilservice retirement system. There are approximately 90 positions in the executive service excluded by the language in the retirement law which H. R. 5831 proposes to eliminate. However. some of the persons holding these positions are now under the retirement system because they were promoted to their present positions. without break in service. from positions which are under the retirement system.

She reached the age of 70 years. and she had completed more than 15 years of service. and was then separated. She would be entitled to retirement of $50 a month on the basis of her own service and contributions made to the fund.

In construing this section. the Comptroller General in his decision of April 3. 1934 (13 Comp.

Californias contention is that if we adopt the treaty Mexico will vastly expand her cotton production. If the treaty shall not be ratified. what will she do? Then. there will be no limitations on her at all. Between 8.000.000 and 10.000.000 acrefeet of water each year are now going down the river unused. and what is to prohibit Mexico from expanding very greatly? But if we place a limitation of one and a half million feet in the treaty. whatever expansion she makes will be at her peril and will be wiped out if the time ever comes when California can use the water. I do not think that time will ever arrive. however. unless there should be another flood such as occurred in the days of Noah. The Senator says that under the treaty Mexico. can use more than one and a half million acrefeet if it flows down there. In the absence of the treaty Mexico can certainly use it if it flows down there. Water cannot be stopped from flowing. It is going to flow into Mexico anyway. and if it is there by our permission and consent. treaty or no treaty. of course. Mexico can use the water. So there is nothing contradictory in the treaty saying that this extra water may be used by Mexico. and at the same time providing that she acquires no right and no title to it. It is merely a matter of sufferance. because the water is down there. It comes down the river. 8.000.000 to 10.000.000 acrefeet every year. and there is no one who can prevent Mexico from using it.",

At the end of 50 years the great Boulder Dam enterprise will remain the property of the United States Government.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as an illustration of the impractical policies of our Government toward the German people. permit me to give an illustration. We have in America a great surplus of cotton. A surplus which is large enough to affect the whole economy of America. both in industry and agriculture. Germany. on the other hand. has a textile output which is far from adequate. but a textile industry which was largely undamaged during the war. There are millions of destitute. ragged people on the European Continent. millions whom Americas own textile industry cannot clothe. What happened? The -cotton Interests of the United States and the German textile industry reached an agreement whereby cotton would be consigned to the Port of Bremen. spun in German mills and enough of the product sold in central and southeastern Europe to pay us for the cotton. From 25. to 30 percent of the proceeds thus derived would be used to pay us for the cotton. and the remainder of the goods would be distributed or sold as our own military government desired. I am informed that that agreement was approved by our military government. but the State Department refused to make the cotton available. The reason which was assigned was that there is a shortage of coal in Germany. and yet they permit some rayon manufacture. although it takes seven times as much coal to manufacture textiles from rayon as it does from cotton. and cellulose. which is. the basis of rayon. is an explosive which can be used in rearmament. When the matter was pressed the real reason came out. and this was that the textile industry of Germany might be given to Russia as reparations. In fact there is the authority so to do. Now Russia refuses to purchase the Anerican product. and in eastern and southern European countries the Red Army which occupies those countries by force of arms prevents the textile mills from spinning American cotton. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks an article on the Russian cotton policy which appeared in the New York Times of Sunday.

But the point I am making is that instead of depriving Germany of the industrial production to replace devastation in other countries. instead of shipping out her own industry. I would force her to rebuild industries for France. Luxembourg. Russia. and other countries. When it becomes apparent that as a result of our policies they cannot feed themselves our people will demand that new industries be created both to relieve us of the relief load and to create markets for our products. In the end Germany will be reindustrialized by us and at our expense. I think that is a reasonable conclusion to draw as to what we will do in the future. This simply means that the American people as a result of the MorgenthauBernstein proposals will be paying the reparations of German industry which now are going to Russia.

Chairman. it woull certainly just about bankrupt the tribe. even when this money becomes available. If it turned out to be a good project. then well and good. but this committee did not feel like embarking on an elaborate business proposition like that. taking the responsibility of practically bankrupting an Indian tribe. Just let us suppose that the scheme or enterprise is a failure. and we do know that a lot of people have made failures when the venture looked very rosy. Suppose it is a failure. suppose we do bankrupt this tribe. then every Member of this Congress is or will be responsible for having done that if this amendment is adopted. Our commiftee thought that the amount involved. $350.000. belonging to a tribe of Indians was of sufficient importance that a subcommittee should go out there and study the matter carefully before putting our O.K. on it. We have no feeling in the matter at all. We have a great respect for the gentleman from Montana and we know he is doing fine work for the Indians and is deeply interested in their welfare. Let your conscience be your guide. This committee ought to know. however. that we did not want to take the responsibility of entering on such an elaborate business enterprise that might be a failure and. if so. would bankrupt this particular tribe of Indians.",

I take it this is the list right here on page 487 of the hearings. and if you will turn to the hearings you will observe that there is a paragraph closing that letter following that list. and this is the way it reads: The effect of any such drastic reduction. which would be contrary to the recommenda-. tions of the executive agencies. would be disastrous to the program for the development of the West. disruptive. to the Presidents fiscal program. and to the Bureau of Reclamations programs. and would jeopardize the Bureaus plans for compliance with the repayment requirements of the reclamation law inasmuch as all of these projects would be left to some smaller or great degree in a nonincomeproducing category until further congressional action repaired the damage.

That represents a backlog of funds for many years prior to the war. The work in the Missouri River Basin was not authorized until 1944. I contend that from the standpoint of carryover funds and from the standpoint of new money that the Missouri River Basin has not received a just share of the amount that is recommended by the committee. I sincerely hope that that fact will be taken into account. The Missouri River Basin represents onesixth of the area of the United States. There are seven States in it: The Bureau of Reclamation only operates in 17 States. I submit that the very small fractional part of the carryover funds that can come to the Missouri River Basin make it all out of proportion to the rest of the West. and the further fact that the rest of the West has had its major construction program before this. and the Missouri River Basin has very few projects to date. My district has never had $1 of Reclamation Bureau construction funds spent therein. The need is very great. however.",

(b) In addition to the apportionment in paragraph (a). the lower basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by 1.000.000 acrefeet per annum. (c) If. as a matter of international comity. the United States of America shall hereafter recognize in the United States of Mexico any right to the use of any waters of the Colorado River system. such waters shall be supplied first from the waters which are surplus over and above the aggregate of the quantities specified in paragraphs (a) and (b). and if such surplus shall prove insufficient for this purpose then the burden of such deficiency shall be equally borne by the upper basin and the lower basin.

If a farmer was experiencing a drought and was told it was an extraordinary drought. probably that would merely mean a more severe drought.

In other words. first he had some drought. then he had some more drought. and finally he said to himself. \"It is an extraordinary. drought.\" But I suppose it would still be a drought. I wish to ask the Senator a question. If the Senate ratifies the treatyand I devoutly. sincerely. and earnestly hope the Senate will not do so--and if a drought comesand when it comes. I suppose there will be no doubt about itI presume that under those circumstances some day we may say to Mexico. \"We have agreed by treaty to deliver to you 1.500.000 acrefeet of water. but we do not have it. and we cannot deliver it.\" The Senator has said that will not occur because. so he has told us. we have so much water which is now wasted. However. I understand that in 24 of the 44 years there has been a drought. If there were a drought and we were unable to deliver the water as we had promised. and as we had committed the people of this country to deliver. and if we had stored water at Boulder. Dam and at other places in years when there was sufficient water. as against the time when the American people would need to use it because of the existence of a serious drought in our country. would we not be compelled In all good faith and in order to keep the word of the people of the United States to open the gates and let the water go down to Mexico. so that Mexico could have the water we had guaranteed her?",

The Congress then believed in these objectives and passed a law to accomplish them. An overwhelming majority of the Members of Congress still adhere to those desirable purposes. The administration- set up the OPA. One of the complaints against it is that much of its personnel is made up of untrained and inexperienced persons who are not familiar with the subjects with which they deal. It is also urged that the OPA. in issuing approximately 45.000 regulations and directives. have involved the farmers. business people. and the American people generally in a maze of uncertainties. contradictions and obstructions in their efforts. There appears to be no general complaint about the law. It is the manner in which the OPA has administered the law. They have discouraged production by their policies and bungling. and have encouraged the black markets. These policies and black markets have prevented a fair and equitable distribution of food as well as other commodities. Price increases have been encouraged instead of held down. and the net result is that we have a real threat of uncontrolled inflation. a Nationwide famine. and the black markets reaching their tentacles into every byway and highway of the land. Unless vigorous and effective action is taken at once in relieving the scarcity of food. the control of the black markets. as well as unfair price increases. the entire pricecontrol structure of the country will break down. and the country will be faced with uncontrolled inflation.",

The conference report under consideration Is to accompany Senate Joint Resolution 30. and is the agreement reached by the Senate and House conferees on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendments of the House to the said joint resolution extending the effective period of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. as amended and the Stabilization Act of 1942. as amended for a period of 1 year. I voted for the amendments and for the resolution as amended when they were passed by the House. last Saturday. I. therefore. very definitely supported price control. I doubt if any Member of the House is opposed to a law for price control that is fair. equitable. and will provide for proper distribution. The amendments to the bill gave a protection to the people of the United States from abuses and maladministration and it could. therefore. be supported with good conscience. No one contends that all is bad in the administration of the OPA. but there have been so many bad practices and so much wrong administration in many respects that those things ought to be stoppedand stopped now. Under the Andresen amendment directives. orders. and edicts could not go into effect on the responsibility of OPA officials alone. for almost all of the entire responsibility was placed on the Secretary of Agriculture. It was the opinion of many that this would stop the arrogance of OPA officials and produce only such controls as are necessary to the war effort. Much freedom would have been restored to the people. The conference report also removes the Dirksen amendment which gave people the right to go into the Federal district court when aggrieved. Under the conference report no such right exists. But the conference report has changed the Andresen amendment and the people may be sure that no improvement in administration may be expected. In view of these changes in the law which offer the people -no relief and which provide them no protection. I cannot support the conference report.",

Although there are many provisions that I had hoped would be embodied in the bill and some that I cannot subscribe to but realizing that legislation after all is a compromise. I feel that there is nothing for us to do but vote for the conference report. Otherwise. the entire purpose of the OPA organization. especially the good that has been accomplished. will be nullified. Mr. Speaker. a few minutes ago. the gentleman from Texas [Mr. PATMANI called attention to the splendid work of the OPA and how they held prices down and prevented inflation. A moment thereafter. the gentleman from North Dakota arose and read a price list that was published in his town newspaper in 1918 on many food articles. I cannot recollect what prices were quoted but I am satisfied that they were about only onethird the prices that the farmer is receiving for these products today. I believe both of these gentlemen are right to some extent. but I cannot understand in view of the high prices the farmers are receiving for cattle. hogs. and in fact everything they raise. which if time would permit I could show that they are from 200 to 400 percent higher than they were not only in 1918 but in 1940. why they continue to clamor for and demand higher and higher prices. Do not the gentlemen representing these agricultural districts real-. ize that there is a limit as to the benefits. extensions of credit. subsidies. and parity prices that the Government may extend to the farmers? Do they not realize that the consumers. especially the low paid wage earners and the millions of white collar workers who are earning less than $1.300 per year. cannot stand the everincreasing cost of living? If the prices will continue to be forced upwards. the country will again have on hand a surplus which is bound to work to the disadvantage of the farmers as the wage earners will not be able to buy on account of the high prices for these commodities.",

Do you know that there are about 387 contingencies which I as a lawyer might urge upon that client that might conceivably arise that might be covered in the writing of a will? I could be there until doomsday writing the will if I took into consideration every conceivable thing that might be urged as a possible contingency and that ought to be covered. After all. Mr. Chairman. about 370 of those contingencies never arose. So. some point out that we are liable to have communism sweeping the country if we disturb the Constitution and that under the treatymaking .power we might unite with Russia or adopt \"union now\" or something equally unthinkable. but I want to say to you that I am convinced that insisting upon a policy of maintaining at all times the status quo of things. without consideration of the demands for reasonable progress will do more to encourage the growth of radicalism than anything proposed in the pending resolution. What would have happened in America if the people had listened to the argument that the thirteenth amendment should not have been adopted? So far as I am concerned.

The people of the United States look now for a return upon the investments in lives and treasure which we made when we joined the nation.. of Europe in overthrowing Germany and her satellites. This is the hour. and now is the time for those nations to turn their might to .the relie and aid of the United States as we turn wholeheartedly to the task of wiping out the vicious Japanese. In some quarters of our country there is a fear that we. who sent millions of our boys to Europe. will be left alone. or virtually alone. to carry the burden of the Pacific war. I should hate to be one of those entertaining that feeling. I should hate to see that feeling grow. It would be bad for the world. I look with confidence to those whom we have aided with our men. our treasure. and our resources. to come at once. fully armed and adequate in their power. to join us -in the bitter struggle which we face in the Pacific. Long before the Pacific war developed. our. Nation. in the hope of strangling the outburst in Europe. .did many things to support those with whom we now share the European victory. We did these things unselfishly and at a time when there existed no legal and little moral requirement that we do them.

It would be well. in fact common decency demands. that those nations since associated with us shall now come to the fore and aid us in our struggle.

I favor this amendment because I believe the American people are entitled to this greater representation and voice in treaty making. I feel that it would be unfair to deny the several States an opportunity to express themselves on this proposition. The Constitution is not a static instrument. It must be amended to meet the needs of the people. Our founding fathers anticipated this when they provided means of amending it. Safeguards must be provided against many actions of both Houses of Congress. but we should not permit a minority in the Senate to rule against and have the power to deny the will of the majority as the twothirds rule now permits. We should adopt this amendment because I do not think the people of this Nation do not want 34 Senators who may represent a very small area and population of the United States to decide on the approval or rejection of treaties. We can have just as much confidenceyes. morein a majority of both Houses passing intelligently on treaties than we can on twothirds of the Senate.

With this Schwabe amendment inand it looks as though it is going inthe resolution will apparently pass. Often you Members of the House have observed that many matters of greatest public interest pass by your door without pause but stop on your Senators doorstep. The reason is plain. Since you do not rate the rank of passing on treaties there is no reason why interested persons spend any time in your office. They are not interested in your personal interests. Ilow many a time have you seen your Senator questioned and written up in your hometown paper on matters of public concern about which you had never been questioned? This was no conspiracy against you. though your constituents questioned you with embarrassing interrogations. \"Why were you not given opportunity to be heard?\" \"Why do you play silent on these matters involving the business of the Nation?\" Now let them know why. Let each State legislature in the United States be given the job of passing on whether the people wish the whole Congress to pass on the wisdom of our treaties. All polls taken on the subject show a definite affirmative. We are 150 years beyond the fears of Madison. Hamilton. Gerry. and Mason. When Senators began to be elected by direct popular vote it was time to have bilateral treatment of treaties. This defeatist attitude of Members of the House is the only thing left as a real argument against submitting our contracts and agreements between ourselves and other countries to the Congress as a whole. Let us not only ask for the responsibility but do so with such force the Senate will be influenced. The voice is already heard in the land calling for this action.

This certainly cannot properly be objected to by those favoring change in our method of ratifying treaties. and to those who are fearful lest the resolution make it too easy -to enter into treaties. it gives definite assurance that there will never be a possibility of a treaty being slipped through without full consideration and responsible decision by every Member. * I am gratified that the chairman of the committee indicates he is favorable to the amendment.

At the same time. a similar resolution was introduced in the House by Representative WRIGHT. of Pennsylvania. and Representative COMPTON. of Connecticut. No group of people has suffered more than the Jews from the bestial brutality which Hitler let loose upon civilization. No people have contributed more. in proportion to their numbers. to the efforts of the United Nations. The record of the Jews in Palestine. both in the establishment of a sound. flourishing economy and as wartime allies. is superb. Now that the German forces have surrendered and the war in Europe has happily come to a close. I feel that the time has come to do justice to the Jews. Most of the Jews of Europe have been annihilated. Justice demands that those who remain should be allowed free access to Palestine and permitted to rebuild their ancestral homeland as a free and democratic Jewish commonwealth. I believe that those are the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the American people.

February 27. an overflowing crowd of Huntingtonians. imbued with a deep sense of pride in their city and its history. ushered in the seventyfifth anniversary of West Virginias largest city at a Charter Day program in the city auditorium. On this day. 75 years ago. Huntington. W. Va.. was incorporated as a city and this ceremony marked the beginning of festivities. including social affairs and pageants. depicting historical events beginning in 1669 with La Salles explorations in the Middle West. which will continue until November. Huntington. W. Va.. today is a thriving. hustling community of nearly 90.000 happy souls. the largest city in the Ohio Valley between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. I We have a diversified industrycoal and timber abound in the hills to the south and natural gas is produced in abundance throughout the area. Our cultural institutions are unsurpassed. We have fine churches of every denomination. a great publicschool system. and Marshall College. an institution known throughout the land. We have wide streets and beautiful homes. As to transportation. our city is served by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. the Norfolk & Western Railway. and the Ohio River. Our population was largely supplied by the sturdy pioneer stock that crossed the Allegheny Mountains in the early part of the nineteenth century to build the greatest industrial and agricultural empire the world has ever seen. Yes. we are a great city with a great history. and we face the future with confidence and a determination to build and create a greater city and make our contribution for a better country and a better world. I request my colleagues to join with me today in saluting my home town on its seventyfifth birthday.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is amazing to see the pressure that is being brought on the Members. of Congress to grant the loan of $4.400.000.000 to Great Britain. As soon as you grant that loan you are going to have requests from at least half a dozen other countries for great sums of money. This country cannot afford to lend money as a country. It is not the function of a government. All these loans can be floated through the bankers of this country with the country involved or their bankers or some other system that may be devised. but it Is not good. sound business for the Members of Congress to grant these loans in any respect. I represent the people in my district. and I am not going to obligate them nor tax them for this request. Let me tell you what they are doing. British purchasing agents are over here. or they say they are purchasing agents. trying to purchase merchandise and. are getting manufacturers to come to me. telling me to grant this loan because they want to sell their merchandise in Britain. They say they will not buy unless the loan is granted. They also say that 80 percent of this loan will be returned to us in manufactured goods. thus putting our workers out of jobs. Thus. I am against it. Yesterday a British peer. Lord Rotherwick. attacked vigorously the proposed loan to Britain. asserting that Its approval would mean that country would become an illegitimate fortyninth State of America. I want the British peer to understand we do not want them as any kind of a state and I do not think this loan should be granted.",

This is borne out by the fact that the President has called to the White House some of the great food experts of the Nation. I trust that all of them will come and I hope that the PresIdent will pay some attention to their advice. I understand though that Chester Davis and Dr. Myers will not be present. That will leave exPresident Hoover as about the only man who knows the food business and in whom the people have confidence. I call attention to the fact that the corn situation in the country is desperate. Much. probably more than half. of the corn in the country is in the black market today. In my district there is a foundry which employs between six and seven hundred men. You would hardly believe that a foundry uses corn. however. this foundry to which I refer uses about a carload of corn meal a month. Corn is the Nations most important food and feed product and corn products are widely used. The foundrys supply of corn is now down to about 10 days and if they cannot get any more corn meal within the next week or 10 days six or seven hundred men may have to lay down their tools on account of the lack of corn. The Republican Congressional Food Study Committee has for the past 3 years pointed out the Incompetency of the numerous food agencies of the administration. especially the OPA. I hope the President takes steps to abolish these conflicting agencies.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most crying needs in the world today is for the adoption and enunciation of an American foreign policy in which our objectives and our actions are in harmony. Once that foreign policy is formulated and clarified so that the average American citizen knows what it is. the White House and the State Department should begin pursuing a course which leads toward the objectives which have been fixed. We have too long followed too closely the example of the whirling dervish in our foreign policies. Russia is a case in point. Mr. Speaker. We have tried appeasement. amity. arrogance. and austerity toward Russia all within a 5year cycle. It sometimes appears as though we try all four avenues of approach within the period of a 5day week. What we need and what the world needs is for the adoption of a clearcut statement of American foreign policy toward Russia and toward other nations and then an adherence in the field of action to the policy set forth in the realm of articulation. Based on the observations and studies which a group of us from the House Foreign Affairs Committee made in Russia and its neighborhood last fall I believe that the path to permanent peace and workable and respectable relations with Russia is a sixlane highway: First. be firm. second. be fair. third. be definite. fourth. be friendly. fifth. be realistic. and sixth. be American in our foreign policies in her part of the world. In my opinion we are today failing completely to be consistent in the application of any of these recommendations in our RussoAmerican relations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker..a very important conference is being held in Washington today on the subject of food supplies for the hungry people in the rest of the world. This conference was called at the instance of President Truman. and several outstanding Americans have been invited to attend. The subject of the conference. as indicated by the President. will be to find ways and means to curtail food consumption by the American people. so that additional food will be made available for destitute people in other countries. I am sure that the rank and file of our fellow Americans want to do what they can to help all starving men. women. and children. This morning I received a telegram from a prominent constituent of mine who made a very unique and worthwhile suggestion of how many carloads of choice food could be saved in this country. and since the suggestion is very timely. I will read his message to the House: MARc- 1. 1946. Apropos Truman Wlhite House conference today to develop program of voluntary cooperation for Americans to eat less food would suggest President set example of maintaining. as he expresses it. \"Our national self respect.\" by canceling all Jackson Day dinners scheduled throughout the United States. Would mean many carloads of choice foods for starving countries. We understand that these Democratic Jackson Day dinners are at the rate of $100 per plate. One hundred dollars perperson will surely buy a lot of food. If the Democrats would call off the dinner and use the $10.000.000. which amount they expect to raise. for the purchase of food for starving people. it truly would set a splendid example of human sacrifice.",

Mr. Chairman. if this bill were to be administered with the varying degrees of intelligence that have been displayed in this House on the subject of real estate. I think you would have even more confusion than there is at the present time. Let me point out to you again. as I tried to point out the other day. a few facts. In the first place. if you are going to place ceilings on real estate. the one equitable ceiling. the ceiling that can even come close to being called equitable. would be on the basis of its currently appraised value. I say that for this reason: Suppose one of these veterans buys a home that has just been completed or which is completed shortly after this bill is passed. Let us hope that the price is in the lower brackets. Let us say he buys this house for $6.000. Presumably. the purpose of this bill is to place the control of prices and priorities in the hands of some more reasonable agencies than the OPA. That means there is going to be an increase in the ceiling price for materials. Who knows what is going to happen to building labor so far as their wages are concerned? Suppose 6 months from now the price of materials is 10 to 15 percent higher and the price of labor is similarly higher and the same identical home costs 15 percent more to build. Therefore. the purchaser of such an identical piece of property necessarily pays 15 percent more for it. Are you going to tell the veteran who purchased the house for $6.000 that he can now only get $6.000 for the house when quite definitely the house is worth 15 percent more of anybodys money because it costs 15 percent more to build and also the ceiling price on the identical new home is necessarily raised 15 percent? In other words. you absolutely stick that man so that he cannot change his dwelling from one place to another even in the same general locality without loss. If the house were burned down to the ground and he received the insurance on it. he would have to pay 15 percent more if he went out to buy the same kind of house.",

No change can be made in that mandate. no modification affecting the mandatory power can be made. and no alteration can be made. unless it is made. as the Senator has so well explained. by the power which gave the mandate. and by the powers which subscribed to it. The President of the United States cannot. by creating a commission or by issuing a proclamation. modify that mandate. The Prime Minister of Great Britain is without power and authority to interfere with it. That mandate. as the Senator has well said. in my judgment will have to be considered. if it is to be amended or altered. by the power which gave it or by the power which succeeds the power which created it. So. Mr. President. the report of the AngloAmerican Commission only emphasizes the necessity for making available in Palestine a homeland for the Jewish people of central Europe. who have suffered so much in the last few years.

The first 100.000 refugees to be admitted to Palestine are within the immediate power of the British Government. and within its immediate obligations under the mandate. as pronounced by every competent authority. British and American. who has considered the question. The only consequence of this delay and confusion is further to add to the difficulty. The.

All the arms and munitions and whatever limited resources he possesses come solely from those sources. and all the forces he possesses are thousands of miles away across the Arabian. desert. as we saw when we traveled over that area.

It occurs to me that under existing conditions. with a hostile British administration. and with encouragement given to Arab leaders to initiate hostile raids. it might prove disastrous for the Jewish people to give up such defense methods as they may have under existing circumstances to protect themselves. It is not for them. in my judgment. to create peace in that community. It is for the power which has the mandate. the power which has the military might. And it can do so. It is my judgment that that power will find the Jevish people eager and willing to cooperate in any effort of that kind. But an effort has not been made in good faith. and until it is made it will be difficult for me to blame the Jewish people of Palestine for devising some means of selfprotection. Mr. President. the second condition of Britains Prime Minister. namely. that we share responsibility for the immigration of 100.000 Jews into Palestine. does not appear to me to be valid. First of all. we are not told whether the responsibility we are to assume is to be political. financial. or military. It occurs to me that they ought to be more specific. But if we are to share in the responsibility. if it is to be political. military. and economic. then. of course. it should carry with it our participatioi in everything else associated with Palestine. including some of the rights and privileges.

As I pointed out earlier in my remarks. only a short time ago Great Britian. ih violation of the mandate. set up an independent nation within the mandated area. namely the nation of TransJordan. and within it established a military base. Probably the British are spending millions of dollars to concentrate a huge military force there. That in itself. in my judgment. is a violation of the mandate.

Under our AngloSaxon jurisprudence we always have the right to appeal. Using the word \"may\" does not give the litigants the right of appeal as a matter of right. It becomes then only a matter of discretion. As has been stated. in all these special courts and in all the laws creating the special courts there is specifically given the right to an appeal. not by sufferance. but as a matter of right. I believe it would be highly unjust to deny the right of appeal in this particular instance. The right of appeal should always be safeguarded by the Congress. We should never take that right away. If. you gentlemen use the word \"shall\" instead of the word \"may.\" then the disgruntled litigant or the defeated litigant has no right to go to a court higher than that court which rendered the adverse decision.

You will find in the hearings that the average annual income of the Nation. which is some key to carloadings and railroad earning power. was less than $60.000.000.000 a year.

R. 7037 under a closed rule which would prohibit any amendments to the measure being considered. The Rules Committee was very reluctant. as it always is. to grant a closed rule on this legislation. and the rule was granted simply because of the realization that this legislation is very complicated. It deals with the whole field of social security. and if a closed rule is not adopted and an open rule becomes in order. then all sorts of amendments and substitute measures could be considered in the most controversial fields. In fact. when this bill was first presented to the Rules Committee there was a controversy existing within the Ways and Means Committee over some of the provisions of the bill. and the Rules Committee. feeling that a controversial measure. on which the great Ways and Means Committee itself could not agree. should not be sent to the floor under a closed rule. held several hearings and discussed this matter rather fully. In the meantime the Ways and Means Committee had subsequent meetings and reached an agreement on H. R. 7037. as it now appears before us. whereby the committee eliminated the controversial sections of the original bill so as to permit the Congress to give certain very necessary relief under the social security laws at this time. In these closing days of the session I believe it is often necessary for us to compromise our differences and try to work out some sort of a program upon which all of us can agree. I. therefore. compliment the Ways and Means Committee of the House for the manner in which they met this particular problem. worked out their differences. and presented to the House agreed legislation of this type. For that reason the Rules Committee has granted a closed rule so that this matter can be decided quickly by passing a bill that I believe is not controversial.",

Department of Common Defehse. It is a serious setback to the best interests of the national defense at a very crucial time in the affairs of the world. There has been so much misinformation put out in public propaganda against this bill that it is most unfortunate that Senators will go home without an opportunity for hearing the full debate on the question. I am confident that if the Senate had heard this debate and heard the simple and logical truths in answer to this widespread propaganda the Senate would not have gone home without voting favorably on this important measure for the common defense. Mr. President. since the bill is not now before us..I would not now arise. were it not for the speech attacking S. 2044. which the distinguished Senator from Connecticut delivered in the Senate last week. In that speech the Senator ably summed up the Navys case against the Presidents program for a single department of common defense. I might add that the Navys case is the only case against it. The vast majority of the people are for it and the country needs it badly. The Navy case is an understandable onefrom the selfish viewpoint of the Navy only.

We found that unification has been a very live issue among the services for years. long. long before any Collins plan was ever heard of or dreamed of or ever submitted. The question reached a head just after the First World War when Gen. Billy Mitchell was so severely squelched by the Army brass hats much as the admirals who favored unirication during World War II have now been squelched by the Navy brass hats. The opening gun of the World War II merger issue was fired by the Navy in 1941. If you will turn your minds back to June 20 of that year you will remember the gloom that then surrounded the Allied cause. Western Europe was underthe control of Hitler. There was serious question whether Britain could hold out against the heavy air attacks to which she had been continuously subjected for eight long months. The Germans had just overrun the Balkans and driven the British out of Greece. Crete had just capitulated to German airborne assault. These were darkest days. In this critical hour. the General Board of the Navy recommended the creation of a Joint United States General Staff to be headed by a single officer. This officer. with his staff. was to be directly responsible to the President. He was to be given authority to issue directives to the War and Navy Departments. The Navy. in fact. proposed an overall military command with no overall civilian secretary. The General Board of the Navy went on to say: The General Board is convinced that through the procedure outlined herein. pre)lminary broad planning can best be accomplished. employment of the best available means obtained. essential unity of command assured. and thorough Indoctrination for the coordination of effort achieved. This was the Navy plan in 1941.",

When Admiral Nimitz. Admiral Halsey. Admiral Sherman. and 20 other highranking naval commanders In 1944. then engaged in the actual prosecution of the war. appeared before a special committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. headed by an admiral. and urged the creation of a single department of national defense. they were not speaking for any Army plan. They were speaking in the national interest and for the common defense.

I can only suggest that there would appear to be a wide discrepancy between the best interests of the Navy and the * best interests of the country should we again enter a major war. Now. Mr. President. the Navy nowin 1946has taken the line that this unification plan is an extension of an ArmyNavy game. Naval officers at the ArmyNavy Club. here in Washington. are toasting the failure of this Congress to act on this bill exactly as they would toast a Navy football victory over the Army. The difference between the Navys unselfish devotion to duty in the war and the present selfish attitude of those in high authority in the Navy toward the President and the best interests of the national defense is appalling. Mr. President. the Senator from Connecticut found it necessary to remind us that the motto of the Navy was \"service before self.\" Now.

It would appear that the Armys motto \"Duty. honor. country\" was being more loyally adhered to than the lipservice being given the Navys \"Service before self.\" The Senator from Connecticut also reminded us that the Navy is called the silent service and states that \"it is a matter of common knowledge that as far as socalled publicity Is concerned the Navy is comparatively Inept.\" Now. I believe that all such comparisons are inclined to be invidious and the Senator leaves little doubt that \"comparatively\" means compared to the War Department. All I can say is this: If the Navy is more inept than the War Dapartment in the conduct of its public relations I indeed tremble for the future of the Navy. But here again. I believe I have more confidence in the Navy than the modesty of the Senator from Connecticut may allow him to have. The only organized group in this country which is opposing unificationexcept the normal lunatic fringe groups which .oppose every measure which would strengthen our defensesis the Navy Department with its Navy League. Yet. on a public issue on which there was almost complete unanimity of opinion in the public press when originally launchedfor it is obviously such a commonsense move to the man on the streetthere is now a nationally organized opposition. From whence comes this opposition? From the Navy Department and the Navy League alone. What is the Navy League? It is primarily a group of steel and munitions makers whose biggest customers are the Navy. Many of them are also members of the Army Ordnance Association. It is interesting to note that the Army Ordnance Association is not supporting unification either. Why? Because there is obviously more money in selling steel and munitions to two competing and duplicating military and naval procurement agencies than to only one.",

The fact that in his message the President added to what he might well have said concerning the internal domestic situation and then stopped. has no relationship to the terms of the bill itself in the form in which it has been introduced. So the mere fact that the President speaks about the international situation and states that he will enter into discussions with other nations. and later report to the Congress whatever agreements have been entered into. or whatever the facts may be. does not. in my judgment. alter the terms of the bill which has been introduced. and which deals wholly with the internal situation.

I can see perhaps some confusion resulting from the appointment of a congressional committee and the appointment of an executive committee by the President. but there would not necessarily be any conflict between the two. I may say. however. that the concurrent resolution which we adopted the other day does not give the joint committee entire jurisdiction. If the matter eventually comes back it will then have to go to a standing committee. We have enough standing committees. and while jurisdiction is somewhat nebulous none of us have encouraged the idea that joint committees or special investigating committees should be given legislative jurisdiction in the sense that standing committees have legislative jurisdiction.

Several bills have been introduced in both the Senate and in the other House providing for scientific research. the development of atomic energy. and all similar matters. Many of those bills have already been referred to various committees. The custom which has been followed in the past of indicating on a bill to what committee it should be referred has been sometimes. perhaps. a bad practice. So complicated became the problem of scientific research in connection with the atomic bomb. atomic energy. and all the integratedmatters. that finally it was determined to hold joint hearings in regard to the matter. Some bills had been introduced and referred to the Commerce Committee. and others had been referred to the Military Affairs Committee. Why reference was made in any instance to the Military Affairs Committee. I do not know.. unless. as the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out. atomic energy may be converted into a weapon of war. If that be not true. then I believe that the Military Affairs Committee would have no jurisdiction whatever over the subject. Beginning next Monday. we are holding joint hearings. Every scientist who had anything to do with manufacturing the bomb. including military men. has been invited to appear before the joint committee of the MiliXCI588 tary Affairs Committee and the Commerce Committee. The testimony. of course. will deal greatly with the problems associated with atomic energy. I do not know why we should refer this bill in any event to the Military Affairs Committee unless we resign ourselves to the claim that atomic energy is purely a military instrument. I suggest that inasmuch as this is a very vitally important problem. perhaps the leaders on both sides of the Chamber should arrange to have a special Senate committee handle the matter. Until that has. been done every committee in the Senate may claim jurisdiction of the bill. The Committee on Interstate Commerce will want jurisdiction because some may say that atomic energy \"will some day provide power for operating the railroads.

The development of atomic energy and the production of the bomb. as I stated awhile ago. came under the jurisdiction and through the activities of the War Department. The War Department has all the facts in regard to the development of atomic energy and the production of the bomb. They are not interested in atomic energy purely from the standpoint that it may some day be used for war purposes. and the fact that it might go to the Committee on Militar Affairs would not. in my judgment. in any sense indicate that we look upon it only as a possible instrument of war.

I witnessed the defeat of those of us who have fought the fight against inflation. as this House. by adopting one crippling amendment after another. destroyed the continuance of price control and opened the floodgates of inflation. Earlier in the day. we defeated the amendment of the gentleman from Mississippi to strike out that part of the bill which follows the enacting clause. The vote was 174 noes to 34 ayes. That vote did not tell the true story. OPA was not to have such a quick deathits opponents thought that would be too flagrant and dangerous. so they decreed a slow death by adopting the Wolcott. Wadsworth. and Gossett amendments. OPA does not deserve such a death. The great consuming public of this country likewise deserves better treatment at the hands of its elected Representatives. Under the bill. as it now stands. price control will shortly be ended unless the other legislative body pays more attention to the needs of the people than the House has done. Perhaps when the bill goes to conference. the conferees will be able to work out a bill whereby price control will be maintained. If they do not. then the United States will fall a victim to unrestrained inflation as have the other countries of the world. I hope when this field day. staged by the opponents of OPA is over. they will realize how they have placed profits above the best interests of the people of this country.

If this bill passes with the alnendments tentatively agreed to we are going to have runaway inflation. Prices are going to skyrocket. Then we will have a collapse. just as we did in the early twenties. The only difference is that it will be worse this time. I have voted against all of these destructive amendments and I regret exceedingly that they have been adopted. I want my record of opposition known. The big percentage of the American people want OPA continued without substantial change. This cannot be done. The House has made it impossible. Today. each group interested in decontrolling their particular industry has joined forces with others in getting their amendments adopted. This is the same kind of logrolling which has always made it impossible to write a satisfactory tariff bill on the floor. The only reason for voting for the bill as emasculated here today is the hope that the Senate may act more sensibly on the OPA extension. If the bill is not rescued in the Senate God help the American people. If it is not saved in the Senate the very groups which have sponsored these impediments and destructive amendments will in the long run be engulfed in the same destructive inflation which will wipe out their capital just as it will the savings of the poor.",

There is an existing shortage in mens suits. Twentyfive million mens suits were produced in the base period proposed by the gentleman from Texas . The current demand for suits is estirmated at 35.000.000. Suit production could therefore reach the 1941 figure of 25.000.000 and still be 10.000.000 short of current demand. Yet the gentlemans amendment would require the President to take off price ceilings on suits with an estimated 10.000.000 shortage. Where would prices of suits go then? Obviously. sky high. Neither the veteran nor anyone else will be able to afford clothes to cover his back if the Gossett amendment goes through. The same reasoning applies to shirts and stockings. for the same situation holds there. too. . The Gossett amendment is a fit companion to the Wadsworth amendment. One will make it impossible for the people to afford meat. the other will make it impossible for the people to afford clothing. And both amendments are suitable to the bill as now emasculated by the Wolcott costplus amendment. The true title of this act should be the \"Let the People Eat Cake Act of 1946.\" If the Senate does not improve it. I hope the President vetoes it.

I will admit there have been inequalities and in certain instances injustices exercised in the enforcement of OPA. but. nevertheless. the consumer. and especially the American housewife. realizes that the OPA has been their savior during this war emergency. During World War I and 2 years thereafter the cost of living increased 108.4 percent. Up until September 1 last year the cost of. living in World War II increased on the average 30.7 percent. In other words. without OPA during World War I the cost of necessities of life were 78 percent higher than with OPA under World War II.

The OPA should not be given discretion in the matter of decontrol. It will be sure to continue controls long after their need has gone. That has been the case already. I call to the attention of the House once more the fact that OPA is still controlling the oil industry prices 100 percentall the way from the equipment for drilling the well down to the quart of oil you buy at the filling station. Oil is plentifulbut control continues. OPAs record in specifying and controlling oil prices is a record of confusion. confliction. and regimentation that has hampered the industry. It is too long to recite now. The issue now is that the Congress should provide the means of making good on the assurances of the President and Chester Bowles and Director Snyder that price control is meant for scarce commodities. Oil became plentiful last August. It was possible to end rationing of gasoline and other products the very next day after war \"ended. Price control should have ended when rationing did. There are only two reasons for continuing oil price control in the face of abundance of the supply. One is that it keeps jobs going. The other is that when you control prices you are moving toward the promised land of the regimented state. Let us provide that OPA shall not be the judge of the necessity for price control in any industry or as to any commodity.",

Under the terms of the bill as it is drawn these funds are channeled through any public agency which. as I pointed out yesterday. and with which I am sure everyone will agree. means State. county. city. municipality. -town. village. precinct. ward. down to the smallest political subdivision of a State government. My bill. goes entirely the other way and requires that these funds -go through the State agencies. Some mention has been made of S. 2. the socalled McCarran bill which passed the other body. They have another formula. They have a middle ground. They provide that 65 percent of their $75.000.000 available each year for 5 years shall go to the States for the development of class 1. 2. and 3 airports. and 35 percent of the $75.000.000 available each year under their plan shall go to the States for development in urban areas of class 4 and 5 airports. Our bill has no such middle ground and no such provision. So. on the basis of the two bills my amendment is at least 65 percent right. where this bill as drawn refuses to recognize participation of the State agencies whatsoever. I want it understood at the outset thatI am not in opposition to the national airport development plan. We must recognize the future of aviation in our country and the possibility from every possible angle of national defense. employment. and all those things that go to the development of aviation. I do not.share the views of some of those that the amount of money involved here is exorbitant and that it authorizes a raid on the Public Treasury. As a matter of fact. if. you look up the figures. you will find that $6\"500.000.000 has been appropriated for public roads. not including $1.700.000.000 last year. Three billion dollars have been apiaropriated for rivers and harbors. as well as $800.000.000 for the development of rail transportation. So when you consider that this is a 10year period and embraces only $650.000.000 to be spread over that period the cost is insignificant when you consider the benefits to be derived.",

Now. continuing further. if you follow this practice of channeling these funds around State agencies. you will also establish in a short time just a Federal systemFederal policy. Federal progress. Federal direction and operation. That has been the history of practically all of the emergency programs that were attempted on a Federallocal basis .You will foster and stimulate the already prevalent habit. on the part of too many political subdivisions. of coming to Washington for money for all sorts of projects. irrespective of the financial conditiomnof. the localities and the States. thus placing severe and continuing hardships on them and their taxpayers. You will create an environment in which the impulse would be for State governments. municipalities. and communities to compete with each other for Federal aid. For the most part. the municipalities and communities will enter the postwar period with serious financial problems. and in sponsoring such projects will need the assistance of the State governments. This is particularly significant in view of the broader taxing powers inherent in State governments as compared with their local subdivisions. The State governments. rather than the Federal Government. are the. appropriate bodies to secure cooperation as to the selection of sites and use. and to resolve disputes between neighboring municipalities and their suburban areas. In almost every prosperous city the mayors are going to the State legislatures applying for funds. for an increase in their debt limits. and at the same time they are reaching out for Federal funds. This is particularly true in the larger populated cities. In those States the legislatures are wrestling with the problem of new revenue for the cities. During the past 5 years the States have reduced their overall indebtedness by onethird.

May I answer a question that was asked here concerning the difference between this and Federal aid. to highways? I respond to the inquiry of the gentleman from Wisconsin. The construction of airports is a municipal function in itself. For example. a road goes between two cities or counties or States. It is natural that a State will appropriate funds to build a road between two cities. because itbenefits the whole State. But take an airport deal. one city quite often does not want to contribute to the taxes of the State to build an airport in another city. For that reason many States will not want to appropriate funds as States to match Federal funds for municipalities. You will find that the municipalities. the .ones that will be benefited are the ones that will maintain the airports. and they are the ones that will have an interest in matching the funds to build the airports.

These States. should b3 considered. This is a Federal project. Some States will never want to appropriate money unless you force it on them. because it is a subject which is within the scope of the municipalities. and those States which do not want to set up anagency should not be forced to do it and should not be put to the expense of doihg it. I know that some of the agencies that have been set up are not set up by legislative -enactment but merely by gubernatorial executive act. They were created by order of the Governor without legislative authority. They have no funds. For the very reason that some of the municipalities will oppose appropriations for State agencies. State governments in many instances will never set up funds. We have found that the system that has been used in the past has worked. because the municipalities were encouragedat least. those municipalities that have enough interest to go ahead were encouraged to deal directly with the Administrator. I think we should continue that system. I know that in my own State. for instance. there has been no appropriation of funds. The municipalities that have been interested enough have gone ahead and built fine airports. They are the ones that have received .the benefits. I know there are other cities in my State. and I think it is true in many States. that would not want to contribute to the creation of an airport in another city when they themselves may not want an airport or may already have their airport.",

I listened with a great deal of interest to the hearings we had in the committee. I thought we had a bill that we had mostly agreed upon. but I see we have. not. It appears to me that the adoption of the Bulwinkle amendment delegates to the States the right to control the participation by the States in this Federal project. so that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinoisis absolutely taken care of by that amendment. Let me read you the Bulwinkle amendment: Nothing in this act shall authorize the submission of a project application by any mu-\" nicipality or other public agency which is subject to the law of any State if the submission of such project application by such municipality or other public agency is prohibited by the law of such State. .\" Congress is merely saying to the States that we have set up an agency here whereby a municipality or political subdivision. acounty. or any other project sponsor might come to the Federal Government and say. \"We have something worth while. We will match you. Will you match us?\" If the States are against that. all they have to do is to pass a law saying to the Congress or to the Civil Aeronautics Administrator. \"You cannot deal with that municipality but you must come and deal with us.\" Is that not fair? That is letting the State control these funds if they want to. In other words. it is Federal aid with State control. That is. I believe. the intention of this bill. We should not cut out any municipality or political subdivision which goes to the Civil Aeronautics Board and presents a picture which is good for the national plan and which is good for the municipality and good for that State. If it is not agreeable to the State. then the State can pass a law and take care of it and say to the Aeronautics Board Administrator. \"You must deal through the Suate.\"",

I gave notice in the committee that I would be compelled to oppose the action of the majority in deleting these provisions. For 4 days we have been listening to oratory on the floor of the Senate about stabilizing the world. W6 are going to stabilize Siam. Abyssinia. Iran. and Iraq. to say nothing of Italy. England. Russia. and all the rest of the world. but when it comes to a little matter of stabilizing railroads in receivership in the United States. we hold back and say. \"Nothing doing.\" We vote billions without hesitation for the stabilization of faraway countries. but when it comes to railroads in this country trying to get out of receivership. we say. \"You cannot pass this way. You must stay in receivership.\" That is what the committee amendment does. It keeps railroads in receivership. During the depression railroads: representing onethird of the railroad mileage in this country went into receivership. Some of those roads have since reorganized and come out of receivership. but there are 19 roadsand not unimportant roadsstill in receivership. and because the Congress does not enact a provision such as that contained in this tax bill. those railroads are not permitted to come out of receivership. or if they do come out. they do so at a great loss. The objective of the provision included in the bill by the House was to enable railroads to come out of receivership. I know that it is said that this is something new and that it should be given a great deal more study. However. I recall that the very provision contained in this bill was passed by the Senate in 1943 or 1944. went to conference. and was deleted in conference.

We have been willing to forget all about what the Constitution says with regard to treaties. And now it seems. on the ground of convenience and expediency. we are willing to consider as legislation matters which.

It would be hard to contrive a measure more likely to drive a wedge between the men who have served their country in uniform. and the men who have served their country on the production lines at home. Thousands upon thousands of our servicemen were union men before they were soldiers. Many unions have provided free stamps for their dues books or other means to keep servicemen in good standing while in the armed forces. I have seen one of the stamps provided. which has on it an eagle. and it says \"In the United States service.\" Servicemen are proud to have those service stamps in their union books. If we make strikebreakers out of returning servicemen by law. they will no longer have protection from their brother union men. They would be the potential threat to the American standard of living. On the other hand. servicemen have no greater friends than their fellow workers who have remained on the home front. They are more sincerely interested than anyone else in seeing that the veteran gets a square break. and will do more for him. In many cases. unions have suspended the requirement of initiation fees for servicemen. As. far as dues are concerned. a union that has no money is of no service to its membership.",

I need not remind Members of this body of the gallant. supremely courageous fight of the people of Poland in behalf of their liberties. They were the first victims of Nazi tyranny. From the. beginning of this war they have fought with unexcelled fury and spirit of sacrifloe. They waged this desperate battle. which destroyed much of their beautiful country. because they believe in democracy and are willing to fight. bleed. and die to preserve and sustain it. They are now entitled to our assistance in reestablishing their free institutions. The manner in which the Polish question is settled presents the first and truest test of the sincerity of the United Nations and will affect for good or evil the entire peace. Are we to desert these gallant Polish people who are now having superimposed upon them by force and conspiracy a form of government and a set of institutions that they do not want? The outcome of this struggle between freedom and coercion will determine whether we have been fighting in vain. I earnestly hope that the President and the State Department of this Nation will soon proclaim to the world that we here in America intend to assist the Polish people in their hour of urgent need and will take affirmative action to reconstitute their free government. For us to do less at this time will be to pervert our objectives in the war and to make a travesty and a mockery out of the sacrifices of our sons. Let us have a clear. unequivocal statement that this Government will supfort and contend with all means in its command for the rights of our gallant Polish XCI28 allies and other small nations and that we will never permit them. if we can prevent it. to be the victims of aggression and aggrandizement.",

Under the stress of a difficult winter and the breakdown of existing streetcar and bus equipment. the city is experiencing a new series of obstacles in the form of Federal obstruction. Cleveland is one of the Nations greatest war manufacturing cities in the Nation. Absenteeism and lbss of maniours in this city through late arrival at work affect the course of the war directly. Under these circumstances it should be the goal of those in authority to do everything possible to keep the workers of Cleveland onthe job every day in the week. It is the easiest thing in the world to say \"No\" to every request for assistance. The Cleveland -representative of the Office of Defense Transportation has chosen this easy way out. That choice does not solve Clevelands problems. It does not meet the Nations requirements for service in wartime. I am informed that 27 gasolinedriven busses now being used on Wade Park Avenue could be freed for use elsewhere if the 0. D. T. would approve the purchase of available trackless trolleys. The electric power and the wire needed are on hand. This permission has been denied. All of us know that these problems are general throughout the country. But they must be solved by the establishment of a formula which weighs both the needs of the community and the importance of that community to the war effort. Cleveland transportation difficulties should have high priority on such a formula. I am urging Mr. Guy Richardson. head of the City Transportation Section of the 0. D. T. in Washington to send an investigator immediately to the Cleveland area to reappraise our needs and offer constructive suggestions to the community.

They must concern themselves solely with atomic energy problems as they affect the Nation as a whole. A military mans first loyalty is to the interests of the military.

The bill already grants full provision for the military to appeal to the President of the United States whenever they feel their interests are jeopardized by the attitude of the Commission. Furthermore. the Army and Navy heads. and General Eisenhower have protested that they do not want military representation on the Commission.

Let me say further that I am not giving the principal credit. for the production of the bomb to the scientists at the present time. for if they had been given the authority to pick their assistants they would have been 10 years late and it would have cost much more than the $2.000.000.000 it did cost to produce it. The fact of the matter is that the highly trained technicians who carried out the theories were hampered because the scientists did not know their business at every stage of the game. they were hampered in every way. shape. and manner. but eventually the trained fingers of the technfcians and that trained organizationin other words. American knowhowproduced the atomic bomb. I repeat. Mr. Chairman. that had the scientists been left alone at it. it would have taken at least 10 more years to have produced the bomb. and I want to say that even if another country could produce it. let them spend their $32.000.000.000. let them hire their technicians if they do not hire the ones that Roosevelt picked. and I venture to say that even with all that they would not have the class of bomb that we have. Remember also that America wants the land of no other country. America is not an imperialistic nation. She will use what she knows only in the interest of peace.

Let us take a look at the record and see just where we stand. The bill provides: There are hereby established within the Commission: (A) a general managerWe did not ask that he be a military man. Then the bill provides that there shall be established a Division of Research. We did not ask that the director of that division be a military man. There is established a Division of Production. We have not asked that the head of the Division of Production be a military man.

I submit. Mr. Chairman. that there is a compelling reason why such postponement would be contrary to the basic philosophy of our form of government. Nothing is more firmly grounded in our beliefs than that military authority in America must be subordinate to civilian authority. Yet. if this legislation is now postponed. the military are left in sole control of a force so awful as to endanger the very existence of the world. When our country has been endangered in the past. have we replaced a President of the United States with an admiral or a general? Of course we have not. We believe in civilian control.

Therefore. to qualify a retired officer or enlisted man. as well as an active officer or enlisted man for this job. we will have to put in enabling legislation which appears in section 2 (d) on page 8 of the bill.

If there is any position created by this legislation for which members of the armed forces should be eligible. it is this particular job of Director of Military Application. We have 1.500.000 men who are making the Army or Navy their career. and there are many highly qualified men among them who could take over the responsibility of the directorship of military application which we are now considering.

I think it is because of the nostrike ledge in time of war. It is desirable that the amendment be sustained. To do that it is necessary for us to vote \"no\" on the motion offered by the gentleman from California to recede and concur.",

He stated emphatically that the amendment would have a serious effect upon the stabilization program because. if enacted. it would leave no adequate machinery for settling labor disputes among these employees or for the application of wagestabilization policies. Director Davis recommended the elimination of the Lea amendment from this bill. and I hope this House will follow his recommendation. In the past. labor disputes have occurred from time to time affecting this large group of employees. and have been satisfactorily settled without strikes. through the efforts of the War Labor Board. Similar disputes will arise in the future. and if the War Labor Board is deprived of authority to settle them. I hesitate to predict what may happen. Mr. Davis sounded a warning to fruit packers that the Office of Economic Stabilization would be unable to fix prices above the minimum required by law if the Office loses power to control wages. So the farmer constituents of the Members who are supporting the Lea amendment may rue the day when this amendment was adopted.

This bill proposes to increase the capital of the institution from $700.000.000 to $1.000.000.000 and authorizes the issuance of bonds up to four times the amount of its capitalization.

I think it is a very proper criti-. cism of the measure that we are not making this decision ourselves now instead of leaving it to the board. But it seemed to be impossible to have a measure which contained such a provision. It is important. for instance. in the livestock industry that the feeders know by August 20 whether they can go ahead. Cottonseed is now being brought in in Texas. and no one knows what can be paid for cottonseed. No one has the faintest idea of what can be paid for cottonseed. In fact. it probably will result in there not being any purchases made of cottonseed until the question is settled as to whether or not it shall be controlled. and what the price shall be. So we have a balancing of convenience. The longer we put it off the longer we keep the country in uncertainty. And also the shorter the time is. the more difficult it is for the Board to decide.

    "speech": "I agree with the Senator. and I think my opinion is correct. Mr. President. I wish to conclude by saying that I have felt from the beginning that it was somewhat too soon to take off all controls. It is unfortunate that this law expired on the 1st of July. I think if it had expired at the end of the year. by that time we would have reached a point at which all serious danger would have been removed. I have been afraid. however. that If all controls were removed we might find speculative increases in goods with respect to which there are still serious shortages. The principle of that statement is illustrated by rents. In the case of rents everyone admits that rents would probably double if controls were completely removed. The same thing is true with respect to a certain number of commodities. in my opinion. I have always felt that there should be a renewal of controls. Unfortunately we were faced in the beginning. as we have always been faced. with the choice between no control at all and control by an organization which in my opinion is completely wrong in many applications of the principles of the Price Control Act. and principles seem to have been adopted which are not in the Price Control Act. I had that problem in connection with the last bill. I have it now. I do not like controls. I do not like the discretion given to the Price Administrator. I would prefer to have a better measure. But in the final analysis my own conclusion is that it would still be dangerous entirely to remove controls. and rather than have no bill at all. I intend to support the conference report.",

Members of the Senate. and particularly the Senate conferees. do not know what provisions of this measure might be interpreted by a board in a manner which would be unfavorable to a decontrol program. If there was any doubt in my mind as to whether I would oppose the conference report. it was entirely removed by the very pertinent questions asked by the distinguished Senator from Michigan . In view of the history of OPA officials In the past and their stubborn resistence to constructive price legislation. I.think it would be impossible for a thinking person to vote for the conference report. Every Senator knows that this measure is no better than the interpretation of a board. which in my opinion will be averse to a decontrol program. averse to a program which would bring about maximum production. The truth of that statement has been demon. strated during the past 4 years. The questions propounded to the maJority leader reveal a pitiful situation. There are to be three decontrol agencies and six pricing formulas. Senators have asked whether certain businesses or individuals would be included under the provisions of the joint resolution. We do not know. I expect to touch on that subject. But first I wish to stress that we do not know what is in this measure. I remember the words of the distinguished Senator from Ohio when he spoke on this subject recently over the radio. He stated that this measure would give the Price Administrator more power than ever before. Yet in all this confusion-",

I hope that it will not in anyway be imputed to meit is merely delegating to the President the exercise of that right in the first instance. and subject to congressional approval. The question. it is argued. Is whether the Congress will approve a reorganization plan. once it has been transmitted. and proponents of this view contend that the issue of granting or withholding approval is not changed by the fact that the bill provides for a negative form of resolution with respect to reorganization plans. If. the bill provided for a resolution in affirmative form. with respect to reorganization plans. it seems clear that the concurrence of both Houses in the resolution would be required. Therefore. say the proponents of this view. if either House elects to withhold its approval of a plan. the form in which that election is recorded makes no difference in the final result. and neither House should be deprived of its constitutional right to require that any legislation shall have its concurrence in order to become effective. That is a statement. if I may address myself to the distinguished Senator from Missouri. of the position of the majority of the Committee on the Judiciary that either House should have the right of veto. instead of the position I take that there should be a concurrence of both Ilouses in the veto.",

I believe these pensions are gratuities. Of course. the Government cannot be sued without its consent. The Government has given consent to be sued in certain contract cases. If any individual furnishes services or material to the Government he is entitled to sue in the courts for payment. However. I believe a pension given to a judge is a gratuity. and I doubt if the ccurts would entertain any suit brought by Judge Johnson for the money provided under the statute. providing pensions in certain cases. To my mind. this situation suggests the necessity for amending the general law covering pensions in cases of judges who have resigned or retired. Nevertheless. I believe the bill should be adopted for whatever good it may do in this particular case.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to talk on the subject of postwar requirements for national defense. It is possible to approach the subject from different directions and to arrive at varying conclusions. But reduced to its simplest elements. the immediate problem of the United States is this: First. We have emerged victorious from World War II only to find ourselves still living in an insecure and warlike world. Second. If we are ever to have a chance for peace. and for the continued pursuit of our peaceful ways of life. we must recognize the possibility of swift and devastating attack by those who envy us and seek their ends through war. Third. It follows necessarily that as a requirement of our national defense. to which we are all committed. we must have both men and weapons at least equal in effectiveness to those of any nation whose purposes we cannot trust. Although we may difter as to the formula. we can agree as to the basic requirement. We need an army. a navy. and an air force strong enough to meet a sudden threat from any quarter. What do we have? It is believed that the Navy as it stands substantially meets this requirement. Like the Army. it is passing through a period of readjustment and reshuffling. These readjustments follow inevitably in the wake of any war. But in an emergency. the Navy could shake down quickly. For all practical purposes. it appears ready to fight. We have the word of General Eisenhower that the Army is notthrough no fault of its own. Less than a year ago it was recognized by all nations as the most formidable and effective military machine the world had ever known. Today it is largely demobilized. It is an army in flux. facing an uncertain present and a more uncertain future. in distressing contrast to its recently glorious past. This discussion. therefore. is confined chiefly to the Army and its needs. and to the broader aspects of our national defense problem. This is not an academic subject. nor is it something that can wait. Other things can wait. but the national defense cannot. It should be approached with a sense of urgency. Whether we attack the problem as a whole or take it step by step. we must act definitely and act soon.",

Calendar No. 1542. which ought to be acted upon. because the provision it deals with expires on June 30. I will read the report. which is very brief. It is as follows: The Committee on Banking and Currency. to whom was referred the bill relating to the insurance of existing construction under the National Housing Act. as amended. having considered the same. report favorably thereon without amendment and recommend that the bill do pass. The bill as reported provides for preserving the authority of the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on existing construction which would otherwise expire and terminate on July 1. 1946. and removes the limitation which would otherwise prevent the insurance of such mortgages if the aggregate amount thereof should equal or exceed 35 percent of the total amount of insured mortgages. The committee believes that the continued authority of the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on old or existing houses as well as on new construction is important and necessary to the housing of those in need and to the success of the entire housing program. The provisions of this bill are identical with those of section 308 of the General Housing Act of 1946 . which was passed by the Senate on April 15. 1946. but which may not be acted upon by the House of Representatives in time to prevent the expiration of the authority of the Federal Housing Administration on July 1. 1946. For this reason. prompt action on the bill as reported Is believed by the committee to be desirable. In other words. we did this in the general housing bill which has not yet received consideration by the House. In order to preclude the possibiity of the expiration of this provision. the Senate committee has reported this bill. which is identical .Vith part of the original bill now pending in the House.",

We entered into a trade agreement with Canada which was effective January 1. 1936. in regard to Cheddar cheese.

The percentage of importations compared to domestic production was twotenths of 1 percent. In 1937. the year after this agreement went into effect. we produced 497.000.000 pounds in this country. and it was worth $79.000.000. which was $11.000.000 more than the value the year before we made the agreement with Canada. The irportations were only 1 percent. notwithstanding the existence of the agreement. In 1929. 3 years after we entered into this agreement. we produced in the United States practically 542.000.000 pounds. which was worth $69.000.000. and we imported 1.2 percent. Our imports in the last year prior to the war. with the trade agreement in existence. were 1.2 percent. Certainly. such an importation of Cheddar cheese could not materially affect the price or the market for that article in the United States. I I should like to mention. the cattle industry. because the Senator includes cattle inhis amendment. Thecattle industry provides a good illustratioii of the fact that imports can increase without injury to the domestic industry. In .1932the domestic industry supplied 98.7 percdnt.of the domestic market. In 1939 it supplied 94.5 percent. or more than 4 percent less. In 1932. however. the cash farm Income of cattle producers.was $621.000.000. while in .1939 it vas $1.290.000.000. or more than twice as -much. in. 1939. with the trade agreement in existence. as it was in 1933.- The small proportion of- the- market whichcan be. supplied by imports is the important thingto be considered.",

For example. in. 1935. when we had the tariff. and without any tariff change the- importations of dutiable cattle in.creased 530 percent over the previous year. If that should happen while the trade agreements were in existence. the Senator can readily understand the kind of an argument which would be made against the continuation of the trade agreements. The point I am making is that without any tradeagreements. and when we had the tariff duty under the SmootHawley tariff. in 1935. the impor.tations of cattle increased 530 percent over the year before. Under the tradeagreement program we have different cattle quotas. Even the cattle industry says the only time trade agreements affected them was in 1936.

Missouri. and Arkansas. The limitation has been removed with respect to those States. The bill would simply accord to Alabama the same right which has been granted the other States. I ask unanimous consent that the unfinished business be temporarily laid aside and that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of House bill 2416.",

I introduced -Senate bill 1160. a companion. bill to House bill 2550. The title of Senate bill .1160 is. \"A bill to provide for. foster. and aid in coordinating research relating to neuropsychiatric disorders. to provide for more effective methods of prevention. diagnosis. and treatment of such dis.orders. to establish the National Neuropsychiatric Institute. and for other purposes.\" Mr. President. I cannot but believe .that by some inadvertence. or posibly due to the peculiar reference of the bill in the House. the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce instead of to the Committee on Education and Labor. which handles health legislation generally. I am not speaking of legislation which requires taxes. such as the socialsecurity legislation. Surely the establishment of such a thing as a national neuropsychiatric institute would come under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Educationand Labor. I have not had an opportunity to bring this matter tothe attention of the chairman of the Committee on Commerce. but it is so dissimilar to the ordinary jurisdiction of that committee. and so natural to the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor. that I am constrained to ask unanimous consent. if necessary. that the Committee on Commerce be discharged from the further consideration of the bill. and that it be referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. which I believe to be the committee having jurisdiction.",

His attempt to make the people believe that he was not asking for compulsory military training is just plain deception. Forcing every young man in the United States between the ages of18 and 20 into a military camp for 1 year -makes it a compulsory military program. regardless of what you label it. Indeed. the President asked for a compulsory militarytraining program and something more. He called for the complete regimentation of every youth in the 18 to 20 age group when he asked that those not physically fit -for combat duty be trained in whatever war service they could perform. Surely the people ought to know by this time that regimentation itself is a part of the administrations program. Matters in this respect have not changed. The Constitution specifically prohibits compulsory military training. The program proposed is opposed to American tradition. I still believe the principles of the Constitution to be correct that adequate defense for the United States can be provided by a Regular Army. Navy. and Militia (National Guard) on a voluntary basis. In any event this subject is too vital to the American people to be summarily disposed of as recommended by the President. If the administration wants compulsory military training it ought to be willing. in the next election. to go before the people of the country and tell them frankly that it wants compulsory military training and let the voters decide the matter by amending the Constitution.",

It is greater than any other nation in the world.\" Mr. Speaker. our educational system and the superiority of the technical training of the American youth has given America its preeminence among wor!d powers. Now that we have won the war our country cannot afford to sacrifice the education of its youth by keeping them in the armed service when there are so many citizens who have finished their schooling \"available for peacetime military service. In order that all the youth of this country may take advantage of their educational opportunity. I have introduced a bill to release them from military service that they may complete their education. H. R. 4471 A bill to provide for the discharge or release of certain persons from the military and naval forces and to postpone the induction of others Be it enacted. etc.. That section 5 (f) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. as amended. is amended to read as follows: \"(f) Any person between the ages of 18 and 26 who. while pursuing a course of instruction at an educational or training institution. is ordered to report for Induction under this act. shall. upon his request. have his induction under this act postponed until he has completed his education or training.

Any such person who was not over 25 years of age at the time he entered the service shall be deemed to have his education or training impeded. delayed. interrupted. or interfered with.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. so far as I know there is no opposition to this bill and there should not be any. For many years. at least 10. efforts have been made to reform the referee system in bankruptcy. to improve the procedure. and eliminate abuses. A number of bills have been introduced on this subject. but in every case until H. R. 4160 came before us there were objectionable features which incurred strong opposition. Apparently the Subcommittee on Bankruptcy of the Judiciary Committee has written a bill which suits all the groups concerned with bankruptcy matters. As the gentleman from Alabama has pointed out. it has the support of the Department of Justice. the circuit and district court judges. the bar associations. the credit associations. and the referees themselves. Let me say here that we are indebted to the gentleman from Alabama for the splendid work he has done on this legislation and I should include also the members of his subcommittee. the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. KEFAUVERI. the gentleman from Illinois . the gentleman from Michigan . and the gentleman from Illinois . We are also indebted to previous chairmen of that subcommittee. I refer particularly to Mr. McLaughlin. of Nebraska. and Mr. Chandler of Tennessee. former able and distinguished colleagues of ours. Briefly. the principal features of the bill provide for putting the- referees in bankruptcy on a full time basis and paying them fixed salaries. thereby eliminating the objectionable fee system. It makes these referees eligible for retirement under the United States Civil Service Retirement Act. It virtually gives them life tenure. Although appointment is for 6 years. reappointment cannot be denied them except for misconduct. incompetency or neglect of duty. It also provides a modern. businesslike method of meeting the expenses of the referees courts in bankruptcy. The only objection which can be raised is that the bill will practically freeze in office for life a considerable number of referees who were appointed more for their political connections and influence than for their judicial capacity. That. however. is not a valid argument against a bill otherwise meritorious. For the sake of the record the bill ought to be explained in detail. For that purpose I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois . the author of the bill. 15 minutes.",

On the other hand. as I tried to emphasize a while ago. we are working out many very intricate matters with foreign nations. I think it is obvious to all of us that it Is desirable for the President and the State Department to have a free hand. or at least that it be as free as it is possible for us to make it. in connection with this matter. As I stated a while agoI am not sure that the Senator heard methere is in the amendment a specific provision to the effect that each one of the charters to foreigners must be approved by the President. Such a requirement is made in order to emphasize the fact that we think there is some importance or some significance existing from the standpoint of our international policy.",

That is also the provision with regard to a sale to a foreign country. Some of the nations have lost more heavily than have others. In a particular instance it may be that a given nation which has been very active in the allied ranks. has been left with only one or two ships.. So In order to equalize the situation. in addition to the 600 ships which those nations now have. the amendment contemplates that an additional number may be chartered. No nation except Great Britain and Russia has more than approximately 16 or 17 ships. In order to carry out a policy of equalization there has been inserted the clause which would permit a small additional number of ships to be added to those chartered to foreigners. So far as I can ascertain. there would be involved at the most not more than 50 or 60 additional ships. In other words. in addition to the 600 ships not more than 50 or 60 ships might be required in order to carry out this roundingout equalization principle which we have utilized all through the bill in our transactions with citizens.",

Provision is now made in the bill for a project which has been long dear to the hopes and ambitions of persons residing in the Columbia River Valley. It is one of the projects which will probably be the economic cornerstone of the development of a great empire in the Columbia River Valley. The senior Senator from Louisiana gave us every consideration in connection with the proposed project. He listened to all the facts presented by both sides. and gave a great deal of his time and energy to the matter. We are deeply appreciative for what he has done. Mr. President. I invite attention to the fact that on page 5 of the bill. beginning in line 18. we find the following language: Provided. That the improvement herein authorized between Shreveport and the mouth shall when completed be named the Overton Red River waterway in honor of Senator JOHN H. OVERTON. of Louisiana. Mr. President. I hope that the project will be a big one because it should be big in order to compensate for the hard work the senior Senator from Louisiana has done and the interest he has exhibited for many years in the development of rivers and harbors and waterways generally. As a member of the Rivers and Harbors Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce he has done invaluable work. and I hope the name \"OVERTON\" will always be synonymous with the successful fight for the development of rivers and harbors in this country.

It is made clear now at the Nuremberg trial that the entire German might was used against Poland and that less than 15 divisions were left by Hitler on the western front. The Polish armed forces fought alongside other United Nations and their deeds. performed on every European front. on all the seas and in the air. particularly during the Battle of Britain. and the heavy bombing of Germany. were praised by every United Nations leader in the war. The Poles fought and suffered for their independence. for their freedom. and for the common cause of the United Nations. They lost 6.000.000 people. killed on battlefields. murdered. or starved by the Germans. deported into Soviet camps and starved there. There are millions of orphans in Poland. The cities of Poland are destroyed and the majority of them were destroyed beyond reconstruction. Starvation and misery prevails in Poland. The country was cut in half. One half of it was handed over to Russia and the other half was deprived of its freedom and independence by Polands own allies. This is the price the Poles paid for their devotion to the cause of the United Nations. for their belief in the pledges which were made to them. and for their devotion to the democratic and Christian ideals of the Western World. Poland for its valorship. its sacrifices. should receive aid to help it out in the reconstruction of its devastated cities and towns and be given every aid to feed the starved people of that Allied Nation that fought arm and arm with the Allies. Further Poland should receive every aid that a free and unfettered election could be executed under the guidance of Allied occupational forces.",

This historical document was adopted by the freedomloving people of Poland on May 3. 1791. less than 3 years after the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. The first written democratic constitution to be adopted by a European nation. it resembles our own Constitution. It recognized the fundamental principles of democracy. . Polish patriots fought that our Constitution might come into existence and it is only proper today that America demands that Poland be restored to its former independence. A free and independent Polish Nation will render the world services still more valuable than those given in previous years and centuries. Willingly the Poles offered their lives for their freedom and for the liberty of other peoples. A free Poland will constitute a guaranty of peace and will help to maintain the European equilibrium. We have millions of Poles in America as our fellow citizens. and they have added enormously to our strength and to our progress. We in the United States. who have been reared in the democratic tadition. believe that right still makes might and that there must be a triumph of good over evil. We must not permit their suffering to have been in vain. We must not allow their courage to go unrewarded. We must not permit others to crush them. but we must aid them to become a strong. independent. and prosperous nation. in a world living in peace. To the Polish Nation. therefore. on this occasion. we send our salute. our praise. our faith. and our prayers. . In this hour of hard decision. it is our duty and obligation to give aid and support to a friendly nation. and hope that. out of the peace to come. there will be a better understanding of the problems of the Polish people. The United States must help Poland economically and in every way she can. We want her to become a strong. independent. and prosperous nation. under a government selected by the Polish people. Once and for all. Poland must become and remain a nation of Polish people not under any alien government. and take her place among the leading nations of the world.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the grim winter of Valley Forge. Washington declared: I This liberty. is going to look easy when men no longer have to give their lives for it. A decade later a friend and Revolutionary colleague of Washingtons. General Kosciusko. was rejoicing over the new constitution of his own country. which marked the birth of freedom for Poland. This constitution. like the other great documents of the eighteenth century. the Declaration of Independence and the declaration of the rights of man. recognized the equality of all men and the rights to religious freedom. Unhappily Poland had only 2 years to think that liberty was \"easy.\" Her greedy and powerful neighbors assassinated that liberty and gobbled up the nation. During the next century a Pole could never fancy that liberty was anything but very difficult but passionately to be desired. Men continued to be ready to give their lives for it. as they did once more in the First World War and recently in the Second. No country. indeed. has suffered more excruciatingly than Poland. It was the first to take its stand against the juggernaut of evil. the Nazi panzer troops. The gallant Polish cavalry stood up against mechanized might and paid the price for it. Only later when the Nazis blitzed the rest of Europe. did we realize the miracle of pure valor which had slowed the Nazis for 1 month. But not only was Poland the first to feel the steel of the Nazis but for 6 years it endured the agonies of Nazi occupation. Three major campaigns were fought through this unhappy land and there was a systematic drive to exterminate the population. And when the Nazis were defeated. much of the agony continued. Today the plight of Poland is as pitiful as that of any land. standing in the backwash of war with famine and pestilence starkly confronting the people. and little political news trickling through \"the iron curtain.\" This liberty does not yet look easy to the Poles. but as Kosciusko once said: All that the Poles have done. and all that they will still do in the future. proves that albeit we. the devoted soldiers of that country. are mortal. Poland is immortal.",

One of the young aviators who was shot down comes from a very representative Maryland family. and his brother had a similar experience to that which he himself shared in the stirring days of combat. He has written me a letter which I shall take the liberty of reading. in the hope that war passions may subside sufficiently to enable the services rendered to be appraised on the scales of justice as evenly as it is possible to weigh them. without malice or factional or partisan advantage or consideration.

The State having been put on a 24hour basis for power by virtue of the shortage of coal affecting our utilities. hundreds of thousands of our laboring men are reduced to half time. Among the messages which have been pouring in to me the last 2 days are many from veterans who have returned from their service overseas asking if that is what they fought for. Because of the danger of fire hazard and utility shortage. I called the Secretary of War yesterday to see if the War Department would cooperate with the Sanitary District of Chicago in giving what permission they can for an increased flow of water from Lake Michigan. to add to the power that is being created at the power plant at Lockport. in order to protect the water supply of Chicago and provide adequate fire and sanitary protection. I am happy to report that he immediately called the Chief of Engineers. and they said they would give us all support possible. Mr. President. if this strike continues longer. what has happened in Illinois will happen in every other State. and then perhaps we will realize that it is now the responsibility of the administration of the United States to protect the people of this country. Great powersgreater powers than were ever given to an Executive in the history of our Nationwere given to the President of the United States during the war. and he still has all those powers. and has a right to use them to protect the people. I say that it is the responsibility now of the President of the United States to utilize the powers which have been placed in his hands by the representatives of the people. and if they are not sufficient. then it is the responsibility of the administration which controls Congress to initiate legislation promptly. without delay. to afford whatever remedy we may find to be necessary in the event of a failure of the administration to act.",

That is a program which has destroyed nations in the past and could eventually destroy this Nation. if continued. Consequently. it is to the benefit of all of us that we get rid of the subsidy program as quickly as possible.",

The top selling price under the Vinson range was $14.85. so that the bulk of the hogs sold for only 65 cents a hundred more than the top selling price. Mr. President. that is not a soaring price. that is almost a normal price. and if the receipts of hogs continue. we will see that prices will not increase on a soaring basis.

It was a pertinent observation and I wanted to look into it and see where the differentiation was between the Associated Press. for example. and the OWl. The gentleman from New York said the overall yearly expenses for conducting the Associated Press amounted to $12.000.000. Whether or not that is correct. I do not know. but I accept it as a correct statement for the purpose of differentiating. The Associated Press is a news service. The Associated Press does not publish or print newspapers. The Associated Press does not engage in broadcasts. The Associated Press does not have a broadcasting station. The Associated Press is not prepared to print and does not print leaflets such as I have here. to distribute in alien territory for the purpose of saving American lives. - I have here a picture which appeared in practically all the papers throughout the country. of a Japanese soldier surrendering. with a leaflet in his hand. That was one of the leaflets of the OWL. Millions of them were flown over in B29s and dropped upon the people of Japan.

The Associated Press has no leaflets and no newspapers. They are not fighting a combat or psychological warfare like the Office of War Information. The radio in OWI is the largest item of expense. The Associated Press does not have that item. Reference has been made to 12 or 13 scripts. The gentlewoman from Connecticut I believe made some reference to them. The gentlewomans reierence was correct. as far as Japan was concerned that day. But the complete information is that every day there are 200 broadcasts going out of the San Francisco office in different languages. not only to Japan but to the Philippines. Burma. Korea. Siam. and the Dutch East Indies and other places in Asia. So that 12 or 13 scripts is correct as to Japan alone. but in addition to that therewere 188 other broadcasts going out each day. As to the OWI in Europe. this comes from a Republican who just came back from Europe. and I read from the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 30. when on that day the gentleman from Illinois. said: I went into these offices to talk to the personnel. I find that while some do not agree with me. and while I went with some prejudice in my heart. for instance. toward an agency like OWL. I do want to say for them. and I must say it in candor. and all honesty of purpose. that overseas they have done a good job.

I am for the FEPC but I believe in protecting the rule that has been reported out by the Committee on Rules and my refusal to vote down the previbus question does not mean that I am against the FEPC. It just means that I want to stand by the Rules Committee.\" So that would have been used as another alibi by those who pretend to favor FEPC but who have failed to support any move that has been made in behalf of FEPC. We are sick and tired of these alibis and we are not going to have any more created to be used by those who pretend to be for FEPC. but who will do nothing to help it. Therefore. in answer to the gentleman from South Dakota. the reason why we did not force a vote on the previous question is that we did not want a defeat on that collateral issue to be used by the enemies of FEPC as a test of strength on the issue of FEPC when we know that on a showdown on FEPC we will receive a majority. That is why we insist that you give the House an opportunity to vote directly on the FEPC issue.",

I am certain the Members of the House did not realize that they were pulling out the connecting pin which has held the dam against inflation. Under the Stabilization Act of October 2. 1941. we directed the President to set up an office to control the forces of inflation. The only agency of this Government that can protect this Nation against inflation at the most vital connecting point is the Office of Economic Stabilization. That is the point where wages and prices come together. You have control over prices in the Office of Price Administration. You have control over wages in the War Labor Board. But the only place that those two can be geared together and connected. to be sure you do not have an unlimited cycle of inflation. is in the Office of Economic Stabilization.",

When this bill was before the House several months ago. I opposed the crippling amendments which were adopted. I later upheld the Presidents veto of the emasculated bill which he was called upon to sign or veto. This legislation is a slight improvement over the bill which the President vetoed. but it is the only protection the consuming public can expect. to keep down the cost of living. Since OPA was discontinued on July 1. slightly over 3 weeks ago. prices have risen rapidly. This increase has taken place in spite of the fact that manufacturers. wholesalers. retailers. and so forth. through propaganda and otherwise. urged everybody to keep prices down. One would infer that their campaign was carried on for the purpose of holding down prices until Congress recessed with the hope that no price control legislation would be enacted. According to a survey conducted on over 900 commodities. the following index reveals:. First. In all of 1945 the general price Index rose 2.4 points. from 104.6 to 107. That is a 2.3 percent increase. Second. In 6 months of 1946 before OPA died the index jumped from 107 percent to 112.7 percent of the 1926 base. That rise was at a rate five times as great as in 14. Third. In 1946 after OPA. in the first two controlfree weeks. prices of these 900 commodities at wholesale shot up from 112.7 to 120.74.5 points in the first week and 3.5 in the second. That rise was at a rate more than 80 times as fast as the 1945 rate. Food prices lead the increase. One can easily understand the effect this will have on uver 9.000.000 families in America whose income is under $1.000 a year12.000.000 families whose income is under $2.00) a year10.000.000 families whose income is under $3.000 a year. I hope this legislation will be sufficiently effective to revert to the July 1 prices on rents. food. clothing. and other necessary commodities.",

I must go to Websters Dictionary to find out what \"incidental\" means. I find that the word is synonymous with \"accidental.\" It means casual. subordinate. not particularized. Section 2 provides for a bond issue in a sum equal to the total assessed valuation of the States of Colorado. Wyoming. Utah. Nevada. and New Mexico. The total valuation of those States does not equal more than $3.750.000.000. I find that the area of Colorado and the area of the United Kingdom are almost identical. the United Kingdom having approximately 10.000 square miles less than the State of Colorado. So Senators are alleging that a loan equal to the total valuation of these five States. including all their private property. their railroads. their mines. their banks. their cities. their homes. all their utilities. and everything else. is incidental. I cannot follow that line of argument. Some evidence has been placed in the RECORD on the question of the definition of raising revenue.

In that section of the Bretton Woods agreement you find this language: The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a publicdebt transaction not to exceed the amount of money of the proceeds of any securities hereafter issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act. as amended. and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that act are extended to Include such purpose.

It seems to me that it is clearly written into the bill that this is not so. In the bill as it has been reported by the Committee on Banking and Currency there is a clear statement of the very point which the Senator from Maryland seeks to cover by his amendment. I refer to the provision on page 13. ifi subsection (d) of section 2. It reads as follows: To that endThat is. the end of establishing free enterprise and full employmentthe Federal Government shall. in cooperation with industry. agriculture. labor. State and local government. and others. develop and pursue a consistent and carefully planned economic program with respect to. but not limited to. taxation. banking. credit. and currency. monopoly and monopolistic practices. wages. hours. and working conditions. foreign trade and investment.. agriculture. education. housing. social security. natural resources. the provision of public services. works. and research. and other revenue. investment. expenditure. service. or regulatory activities of the Federal Government.. It seems to me to be obvious that this language makes it altogether clear that the Senator. in making his argument and offering his amendment. is doing so under the misapprehension that the purpose of the bill is to provide only for. industrial labor.",

There is no statement in the section to which the Senator from Wyoming referred that the position of that obligation must be established and maintained at all cost. If he will turn to section 4. he will find this language: To the extent that continuing full employment cannot otherwise be assured. provide such volume of Federal investment and expenditure as may be needed. in addition to the Investment and expenditure by private enterprises. consumers. and State and local governments. to assure continuing full employment.

There should be written into the bill additional language. and the distinguished Senator offered the language \"and carefully planned\" to be inserted after the word \"consistent.\" The subcommittee. the supporters of the theory of the bill. and the supporters of the bill. very willingly agreed to include the language \"carefully planned.\" But. Mr. President. after my experience with the subcommittee it seems to me that the opposition to the bill in the subcommittee will not stop at any language until the entire philosophy and theory of the bill are sabotaged. They say. \"Yes. we earnestly believe in full employment. but-.\" And. Mr. President. regardless of how many times we include the phrase \"carefully planned economic program.\" it is my opinion that they will not be satisfied. If the philosophy of the bill is not to have the Federal Government give the people of the United States to understand that. if and when everything else fails. the Federal Government will. to the extent necessary. see that there shall not be any appreciable or material permanent unemployment in this country. then I simply do not understand it. After the experience we went through in the thirties. if we have not learned that it Is the responsibility of the Federal Government not only to say to the people. \"We will not tolerate any great unemployment permanently in this country.\" but to say. \"If and when everything else fails. the Federal Government has the duty to step into the picture with all the resources at its command and see that unemployment in great numbers does not exist.\" then I think we blind ourselves to the necessities of the situation.",

I merely wish to make a remark which is evoked by the statement made by the Senator from Utah. The truth of the matter isas is clear\ufffdly demonstrated by the report of the minoritythat the real Issue here is whether we shall proceed into the future upon a program which shall make direct relief or workrelief by the Federal Government necessary or whether we shall undertake to proceed on a program which will eliminate that. The Senators who are opposing the bill denounce \"Federal investment and expenditure.\" but what do they say in their report? Let me read it. I read now from page 5: It is said that the refusal to make up the theoretical deficit by public spending means the starvation of the unemployed. Of course. this is not true. Our policy requires that everyone in this country receive a proper standard of food. clothing. housing. and medical care. and we are making substantial provision to carry out that policy. If unemployment exists. many persons live with their families or expend their savings without any application to the Government for aid. Many persons draw unemployment compensation such as that we have just provided for the unemployed and for the veterans. Others are provided with work relief or direct relief. Mr. President. it is perfectly clear that the issue here is whether we shall follow the policy thus proclaimed by the sponsors of the amendment. the authors of the minority report. namely. a policy of work relief or direct relief. or whether we shall pursue a policy intended so to organize our whole economic machine. including agriculture. consumers. selfemployers. and every other category of our population. that there shall be full employment by private enterprise.",

I take it that that amendment is simply to give workers in an establishment who select a man to represent them in timekeeping or. for instance. in the operation of a coal mine who select a check weighman. There can be no debate among men of reasonable minds as to the proposition that when management sends a man out to represent management he should not betray his trust. He is a man for whose actions the management is responsible. I remember in my State. in 1903. the legislature required mine operators to employ certified mine foremen. but there was a provision written into the law to the effect that in the performance of his duties he should not be under the control of the mine owners. Men who prior to this act were injured through the negligence o- the mine foremen could recover. but the time came when an attorney for the defendant obtained a directed verdict on the ground that the certificated mine foreman. in the performance of his duties. was not under the control of the company. Then we had to go back to the legislature and remove that provision and place the certificated mine foreman under the control of the operators. Of course. where employees of a coal mine. or any other industrial enterprise. elect one of their own members to act for them. and keep check upon the hours recorded by the company timekeeper. or check upon the weight of coal by the company weighman. that man should not be under the control of the company.",

We passed that bill without the House knowing anything about what it was votingon. and then in a few months even the most aident advocates of the SmithConnally bill were denouncing it and saying that it contained provisions that were unwise. That is exactly the situation we have here today. We started off with the Norton bill. then we had the Landis bill. and suddenly last week from under some mysterious wraps we got the. Case bill. Now we have the McMahon bill from the Senate. the Adams bill. and then I am told the gentleman from California also has a bill. and I see Member after Member rising and asking the Chair what we are getting ready to vote upon. Now. Mr. Chairman. I want to refer for Just a minute to what was said by my good friend the gentleman from Oklahoma who referred to the boys from the big cities. He said they were tired of listening to us. that we were out to do a job on the farmer. He inferred that. I will submit that the record shows that there has been no group in this House that has supported legislation for the betterment of the farmer and particularly for the betterment of the farmer from his section of the country. the Cotton Belt. than the gentlemen from the big industrial cities. I can recall when the president of the American Farm Federation.

I happen to notice that title 2 is prepared a little differently than the ordinary appropriation bill. in that each of the paragraphs is labeled with a parenthesized letter. indicating that it might be interpreted as a subparagraph. Some of us desire to make points of Order against certain parts of the title or section 201. but not against the entire section. Consequently the question is whether or not a point of order must be made at the conclusion of the reading of each subparagraph. or should we wait until the entire section has been read?",

I rise to answer some of the criticism that has been directed at the Veterans Administration by insertions in the CONoRESSIONAL RECORD. An attack was inserted by a Member the other day upon the Veterans Administration facility at Mount Alto. Mount Alto Is a diagnostic center. It is always crowded. It always has been. because so many wounded or sick veterans want to come to Washington. When they go to Mount Alto to be examined. many of them want to stay there. when as a matter of fact the best thing for them would be to go to other veteran hospitals. because of the fact that this is a diagnostic center. and other cases are usually waiting their turn. The Veterans Administration has a terrible responsibility and it is doing the best job possible. I daresay it is doing the best job of any organization of its kind in any country in the world. I ask you gentlemen who are getting this information from outside critics who want to jump on the Veterans Administration. to first investigate. If you will go to the bottom of those criticisms you will find that they are not well founded. The Veterans Administration Is doing the very best job it possibly can under the circumstances. and I hope all Members of the House will join in helping continue that splendid service.",

As a member of the Appropriations Committee and being for several years a member of the subcommittee having jurisdiction over the Veterans Administration. I a mfamiliar with the Veterans Administration and its farreaching functions which are growing in magnitude daily. Year after year I have seen General Hines appear before that committee. He always knows personally what it is all about. He does not have to bring a whole army of aides along to flank him on every side and to ask them what the answer is when a member asks for information. as is the case with so many others heads of departments and agencies of Government. I know that Members familiar with the generals work agree that he is doing an outstanding job with what Congress has given him. Of course. Mount Alto Hospital is overcrowded. It is by no means the only hospital in the country that is crowded to the overflowing. But that is not the fault of General Hines. He has repeatedly warned our committee to expect crowded conditions. As Members know. the Congress has made a lot of funds available for hospital facilities. but considerably more are desperately needed and I feel certain that we will not stint in making additional funds available for additional veterans hospitals and also for enlarging our present hospitals.",

Nonetheless. I cannot get the idea out of my head that Mr. Wallaces position against monopoly is the traditional American position. Certainly it was the position of Thomas Jefferson. Andrew Jackson.

Certainly if the Congress proposes to give more than lip service to the cause of small busines- it will be compelled to agree with Mr. Wallaces position on this matter.

It is intended to give the veterans of World War II and their dependents insurance benefits under the Federal oldage and survivors insurance provisions of the Social Security Act. Under conditions specified. the veteran. Shall in the event of his death during the period of 3 years immediately following separation from the active military or naval service. whether his death occurs before or after the enactment of this section. be deemed(1) to have died a fully insured individual. (2) to have an average monthly wage of not less than $160. and (3) for the purposes of section 209 (e) (2). to have been paid not less than $200 of wages in each calendar year in which he had 30 days or more of active service after September 16. 1940. The bill is intended to take care of the widows and children of veterans of World War II who died prior to this time or who may die 3 years after discharge. and who are not eligible for pensions or other payments under the law as administered by the Veterans Administration. The bill is estimated to have an overall costnot annually. but an overall costof $175.000.000 through 1959. It is a bill which is the culmination of a number of proposals made in both Houses by various Members. and as a result of study under the direction of the President. of the Budget. of the Veterans Administration. and other agencies of Government. I very earnestly hope that the bill may be passed. because it does afford some relief to the dependents of veterans who have died heretofore or who may die within the 3year period after their discharge and who are not entitled to pensions or other benefits under the laws administered by the Veterans Administration.",

We are besieged with bills for the chartering of all sorts of nonprofit corporations. The bill in question merely lays down a policy. and prescribes what must be contained in the acts. In the first place. it prescribes that. instead of such corporations filing their own reports at various intervals before various committees. they shall make an accounting to the General Accounting Office. In the second place. it eliminates provisions which have been permitted to slip into other bills. such as a provision to remove taxable property from the tax books in States. We have had provisions that States should not tax such property. In the third place. the bill provides that the act of incorporation must contain a provision for the disposition of assets when the charter is revoked or when the corporation terminates. It really establishes a standard form for the chartering of corporations for nonprofit purposes. We have had so many conflicting bills that the Judiciary Committee finally directed the preparation of a bill which would establish a formula for the incorporation of such organizations. and afford certain protection to the public against being mulcted by persons who might get a bill through for an organization which was not designed for propdr purposes. Incidentally. the bill provides for an investigation by the Department of Justice. at the request of the Judiciary Committee of either House. of the incorporators and the purpose of incorporation. and provides for a report to the committee. However. it does not bind the committee to act in accordance with the report. nor to request a report. Nor does it prevent the Congress from acting on a charter. even though it might not be in conformity with the terms of the bill. However. it establishes a policy.",

UNRRA had shipped in goods $637.000.000. They had laid out programs of how they were going to provide shipment for the balance. Those programs had in mind using it all by the first of the year. However. in the period down to the 1st of November. they had not made shipments in line with their estimates. They had. however. in November. $245.000.000 of shipments out of $250.000.000 estimated. That reduced the backlog of funds available quite considerably. They are estimating shipments in December of over $300.000.000. which might reduce their funds available. after this item which Is being now considered. of $550.000.000. to about $600.000.000. That amount will easily carry them to the 1st of April. if they have good management. There really is ni point to their cry of woe. After the 1st of March all shipments should be of nothing but food. They have been sending a lot of farm tools and tractors to places where they never have been used and never can be used effectively. If they would show a little better judgment on that. they would help their own position. I hope the membership has read the article in the morning paper about the Palace of Zog. where it tells of the enormous quantities of UNRRA supplies upon the wharves in Albania.

It extends the provisions of the Corrupt Practices Act to meet the objections filed by the Attorney General of the United States when he held that it applied only to the corporations. and did not apply to the labor groups because they are nonprofit organizations. It makes the law apply to both of them alike. Is there anything wrong about that? When you become a candidate in your district. would you like to have a labor leader appoint 5 labor men in each precinct and equip them with a pocketful ol money to pay them $50 a day to go out and fight you? If you do. then vote against this rule. Another thing it does is to provide that where a labor group injures the property of its employer by violence or where the employer shuts down and deprives the men of their work. both of them are equally liable and subject to suit in the District Court of the United States where the injury occurred. Should you keep your contract if It provides that you will not strike? In every one of the contracts that were presented before my committee there was a provision stating that they would not strike. We covered that in this legislation. The other thing is a provision that the jurisdiction of the court is the place where the injury occurs. or that It may be at the headquarters of the employer or of the employees. Is there anything wrong about that? Let me say this: I am not a prophet. but I predict that if this rule is defeated you will never hear of the legislation the President asked for between now and Christmas. If this rule is adopted. I propose to keep my word with the leadership when I promised that if the Committee on Labor would have hearings I would hold up the bill temporarily to give them an opportunity to be heard.

When we tried to do it in the SmithConnally bill. you know what happened. The reason the bill ever came anywhere near this House again today is because there was an almost unanimous demand for its repeal. I agree that the bill originally belonged in the Committee on Military Affairs as it is now described. I agree that its repeal could well be before the Military Affairs Committee. But I disagree that in repealing that bill they should take absolute labor legislation and put it into the bill and bring it before us from that committee. I am speaking now as a member of the Labor Committee who has been consulting with my friends in management. Do not forget that I sit on the board of certain companies and am an officer of what I think is a fairly important company. I think both management and labor are agreed that hasty legislation in this regard is going to be only a boomerang against both of them. just as the original SmithConnally bill was. The Labor Committee is now holding hearings on what we might call the Presidents bill for an adjustment of this situation. I spent yesterday in the Midwest. Out there labor and management are trying to solve their own difficulties. In one particular instance it looks as though labor and management might give us the pattern for the kind of legislation we should have here.

If they want to strike. shall give notice of their intention. so that when we wake up in the morning we will not find the transit company. the streetcars and busses in their barns instead of operating on the streets. that we will not find our water and our light cut off. that they incorporate in the contract that sort of a provision. then. giving notice of their intention if they want to strikeand I am one of the very. very few Members of Congress who have said that there should be no legislation prohibiting strikes. prohibiting picketingif they want to strike. let them strike after they have given notice. and if they stay on strike for an appreciable number of hours let them lose their status as employees and compel the corporation to go out and hire someone else because it is inconceivable that the public. you and I. and all the folks In these United States should be at the mercy of those who. as they did in Michigan at one time. cut off water. light. and transportation by pulling a switch in a powerhouse. Why can Con:gress not adopt such legislation as that and pass it? The people want it.",

The same crowd that is talking compulsory military training are advocates of force not freedom. Mr. Chairman. the war may be over in Germany and Japan. but it is plain it is only beginning in the Halls of Congress. There is no room in the American political picture for two conservative parties.

Except for a brief interlude. occasioned by the appearance on the scene of the great \"Teddy\" Roosevelt and the late lamented Wendell Willkie. the Republican Party. as such. has never had a liberal idea since the great Abe Lincoln talked about a \"government of the people. by the people. and for the people.\" What a travesty on the memory of Lincoln is this Case proposal. Those of you who pay tribute to the Shrine of Lincoln. who freed such a great segment of our population. today are proposing to return twice as many to economic slavery and bondage.

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of the principal features of the bill is that which reduces the retirement age from 61 years to 62 years. but gives the President the power to retain 10 admirals who have reached the age of 62 if in his discretion the Navy needs their services. The reason for this reduction in age is to make promotions more rapid. and also to allow younger men to advance to the rank of admiral and assume the duties of admiral earlier than they would if the age were kept at 64 years. The legislation with .respect to the age for retirement of admirals is permanent. So are the provisions for the selection of admirals. The other provisions expire 1 year after the war. The real purpose of these provisions is to readjust the officer personnel before the postwar Navy is established. Another feature of the bill which is of considerable importance is the retirement provision. Up to the time of the war the Navy Department eliminated through the selective board system what might be called. to use a slang term. \"dead wood.\" Some officers of limited ability have been carried during the war becausc of their experience and training and because they were of value and there was a great pressure for officers. This bill permits the Secretary of the Navy to establish boards- to consider -the records of officers and to eliminate those who. for one reason or another. are found to have become unsatisfactory or unable to perform thcirduties. It sometimes happens that an officer. when he is promoted. Is physically well and mentally alert and able to carry on the job. but after 2 or 3 years. for one reason or another. he may not be able to measure up to the standard required and yet is not of sufficient age to retire. This bill would permit the setting up of boards to do what in peacetime was done by the selection board. It is expected that it will result in giving the Navy more efficient officers. and also remove officers who are reaching advanced age. so that younger officers. more alert and better qualified to perform their duties. will be selected.",

Public Law 128 cf the Seventyeighth Congress. approved July 9. 1943. authorized the Postmaster General to detail .postal employees from main post offices to4postal units at Army camps. posts. orstations. without changing their official station and also au.thorized allowances not exceeding $2.50 per day in lieu of actual expenses while so detailed. The limitation of $2.50 per diem has been found to be extremely inadequate in a number of cases. Many of those employees. especially those at Newport News and like -places. have continued on their detail at the $2.50 per diem at a real sacrifice to themselves. A determination was made by postoffice inspectors that $4 a day was the minimum upon which these men in their particular assignments could exist. In order that the Department may have authority to make adequate allowances in those cases where employees are now making a financial sacrifice upon the $2.50 a day allowance. the enactment of H. R. 697. which would increase the maximum allowance from $2.50 to $4 per .day. is recommended. It is estimated that upon the basis of present conditions the cost of this measure will not exceed $15.500 per annum. It has been ascertained from the Bureau of the Budget that there is no objection to the submission to your committee of this report. That is signed by the Acting Postmaster General.

We have the most beautiful set parks in central New York. and hundreds of thousands of people come there every summer to take advantage of the facilities which those parks offer.

Our assessments are on 125 percent of value basis. The assessment in the District of Columbia. are on a 65 percent of value basis. and have been for years. Why would it hurt the District of Columbia to increase its tax rate so that it came more near in line with the communities elsewhere in the United States?

The District Commissioners have been in my office from time to time imploring me and other members of the legislative committee to go along with a sales tax. I was the one. and I say it modestly. who helped kill off the sales tax before. I am not so sure that I will take that attitude again. You cannot run a town on wind and water. When you talk about benefits to your constituents. how many of your boys in uniform came here to the Nations Capital and enjoyed the benefits of this great city. the parks. and everything that go with it? I have some pride in the Nations Capital. Let us not be so niggardly about it. I can challenge almost every tax figure that has been recited on the floor today. Of the 30 cities of comparable size in the United States. there are about 15 which have a tax rate higher than Washington. There are fifteen that have a tax rate lower than Washington. So there is a case for the conferees. I suggest you take it back and come back with a compromise. I am for you on this.",

The District of Columbia has no sales tax. The City of New York has a sales tax of 2 percent. The tax rate in the District of Columbia is $1.75 a hundred. The tax rate in the city of New York is $2.70. Assessed valuations in the city of New York are in excess of true value.

The bill which I am introducing today provides that the provisions of the present law be extended to provide for protection for 5 years in place of 2. Two years is a short time In which a farmer can feel any measure of security in his operations. It is far too inadequate to plan for the future. No segment of our national economy Is so dependent on national legislation and planning as are our farmers. They are entitled to know what is in prospect for. them at least for the next 5year period. While I recognize that this type of legislation does not fully provide security for the American farmer. it does insure a degree of protection until such time as a better program can be worked out. Surely no Member of the Congress wants a return of depression years when farmers by the hundreds of thousands lost their homes and moved to the cities. thus greatly aggravating the already bad unemployment situation. Surely our farmers deserve protection after abundantly producing the vital food necessary to win this war during much of which time ceiling prices were imposed upon them when they could have demanded far higher prices for their products. On behalf of the Senator from Minnesota and myself. I ask unanimous consent to introduce for appropriate reference a bill to make effective for three additional years certain provisions of law providing for loans and support prices on agricultural commodities.",

I should like to have the Senators opinion upon the possibility of a review of conditions which perhaps have been decided between two nations before any acceptance of the treaty.

Here we are today in the midst of the ratification of a treaty according to the constitutional requirement of a twothirds vote. Certainly no one will disagree that this is a treaty. No one is proceeding upon any other theory. When we adopt this charter with article 43 contained therein. we are imposing upon this Nation a sacred and solemn obligation to make available to the Security Council armed forces. assistance and facilities. to maintain international peace and security.

In - other words. under the theory of Mr. Dulles. we today are ratifying a treaty out of which would grow another treaty. and perhaps another treaty that would have to be ratified by a twothirds vote of the Senate. The point I want to reiterate is that when we pass this charter. we obligate ourselves to the other nations signatory to this pact to supply military forces to engage in international police work in order to avoid war. I submit that the details of this commitment such as the exact amount of the forces to be contributed and the places where they are to be stationed. is not a matter for treaty consideration. but it is a matter solely for legislative sanction by the Congress of the United States. I base my conclusion upon article 1. section 8 of the Constitution of the United States which provides the powers of Congress with respect to the control over our armed forces. Paragraph 12 of this section says that the Congress has the power to raise and support armies. but no appropriation of money for that use shall be for a longer term than 2 years.

But I certainly brought it out very definitely at the time the Rules Committee was considering the request for a rule. as the gentleman from Mississippi and the chairman of the committee know. . No. 2: I approve of the statements made by Senator Truman which I have quoted. I am disturbed by the change in his position indicated by the letter of the Bureau of the Budget stating that he is not for the recreation of the CAA as an independent agency. I am disturbed at his apparent objection to the exclusion of these independent agencies. I am disturbed at President Trumans reversing Senator Truman. . That other reorganization did not provide for the transfer of the CAA to the ICC to effect a consolidation. It shortcircuited the ICC and transferred it to the Department of Commerce. where it certainly should not be. No Government employee has spoken to me about my. opposition to this matter. not a single one has said a word to me. I am seeking to exempt these eight because they are in the same category as the three that are exempted and they should be exempted. I am motivated by principle and by conviction. not by a matter of getting votes. If there is any inconsistency it is on the part of the committee that exempts three ratemaking regulatory independent agencies and does not exempt the FCC and the Federal Power Commission and others. It is true. as the gentleman from Missouri indicated. that President Hoover submitted his plan after he was defeated. Maybe it was still a good plan. I do not know. but as I get it. the opposition was: \"We are going to wait for the incoming President to do the job.\" All I have got to say about that is that the incoming President came in. served as President for a long. long time. and if a real effective reorganization were needed then. certainly. in that long period of time the reorganization might have been effected.",

But I said. if we are to make exemptions. those agencies are in a class by themselves. The past administration. the late President Roosevelt. had the power to provide that the Federal Power Commission should fix rates. He conferred that power upon the Secretary of the Interior by Executive order. and under existing law the Secretary of the Interior has a right to dispose of power and fix rates. and it is in a different category than the Interstate Commerce Commission. In my judgment. the constructive approach to the solution that you have in mind will be accomplished by retaining three agencies in a class by themselves and not by multiplying agencies that would be exempted in addition to those that are named in the bill. because if you do multiply them. the more you except. the less you reorganize.",

The actual physical labor may be suspended. and is suspended. during the continuance of the strike and the settlement of it. but during that period the relationship of employer and employee still is maintained. Otherwise there would be no obligation to put the men back to work after the strike had been settled. because the relationship of employer and employee would have been broken. and there might not be any obligation on the part of the employer to put back in their jobs the identical men who had gone out on strike. which is a legal remedy- on the part of laboring men which the Congress and the courts have recognized. I repeat. we cannot lose sight of the fact that this relationship. no matter how long It may be suspended so far as actual work is concerned. is maintained while the strike is on.

President Roosevelt very wisely preferred to have them on a lease basis. which did not devolve upon us the responsibility of the sovereignty of those governments. as permanent. absolute ownership would. With that. I entirely agree. If the British had offered them. in my judgment. our negotiators would have been much wiser to leave the situation as it now is: I do not think we want them as outright possessions. The question of our own welfare. which both Senators have raised. involves a difference in judgment. In my opinion. we are as well if not better off with the present arrangement affecting these bases than if Great Britain had transferred them to us absolutely. As it is we merely have military responsibility. If this country is going to continue the policy of not seeking more real estate. but of seeking to create a better world in which we can all live in peaceif that is our policy. then I think it is inconsistent to seek to obtain more and more real estate. If. on the other hand. we have despairedand I am not sure that I am not about ready to despairof any possibility of working with other countries. of any responsibility in international afairs. if that is to be our policy. then the only logical course is to proceed to acquire not only the bases indicated. but other important bases.

Just prior to the Christmas recess. during the discussion of the bill. I calfed the attention of the Senate to the plight of the Alaskan steamship operators. The conference report makes no provision. as yet. to rectify that situation. I told the Snate during the debate that not only were the Alaskan steamship operators in bad shape because none of the ships to be disposed of was adaptable to the Alaskan trade. but I said that something would probably happen if they kept on using the 20yearold fleet. as they must do. since they cannot afford. as Members of the Senate well know. to construct ships at present construction costs without a doubling of the now excessive Alaskan rates. Day before yesterday. one of those old ships went aground. That is a yearly occurrence in Alaska. Fortunately. everyone was saved. During the war. some Liberty ships were tried in Alaskan waters. I personally went out and looked at nine cracked Liberty ships trying to ply those waters. The Russians used some of our ships. and they cracked up four. We simply carnot use the ships which are available. and the Senate and the Congress should take notice of that. The incident which occurred day before yesterday should force the matter upon the attention of the Congress. and. despite the fact that 1 know the importance of having the shipdisposal bill acted upon immediately so that the Maritime Commission may dispose of the millions of tons of ships which are now under the control of the War Shipping Administration. I sincerely hope that before it is too late. and before all our intercoastal trade to Alaska is gone. and is moved over the Canadian Railroad and in Canadian barges to Alaska. and before another accident may happenand they happen almost yearlythe Senate will heed my plea that some kind of measure for the relief of the Alaskan ship operators be passed. -",

I refer to it again now because at the present time an already bad situation is becoming much worse. and I knew of no other way to call the matter to the attention of the Senate. The matter does have some bearing on the shipdisposal bill. because under that bill all other operators in foreign tradeand this trade is in foreign competitionwill have an opportunity. by the terms of the bill and the conference report. if I understand some of its features correctly. to get ships at such a reduced cost that they will be able to operate.

When those three men have made this study. they tell the President all about it. and you will remember both President Hoover and President Roosevelt guessed absolutely wrong. Hoover when he said something about two chickens in every pot and two cars in every garage. and Roosevelt when he said along in October of 36 that the wheels of in.iustry were humming and everybody had a job ahead of him at good pay. then the following March. less than 100 days later. he said that onethird of the Nation did not have clothing. shelter. or food enough.

My amendment is designed to increase the benefits by 50 percent. As I understand. that is in line with the suggestion made by the distinguished Senator from Michigan. It seems that in the State of Michigan. for example. where the duration is 20 weeks. the period could be extended by 10 weeks. In the States of Washington and New York. which get nothing under the proposal of the committee in its present form. the duration would be extended from 26 weeks to 39 weeks. or an addition of 13 weeks. The other provisions in the bill will remain exactly as they are at the present time. Under the committee substitute every State will be able to extei the duration benefits to 26 weeks. Under my amendment the duration provisions would be liberalized above the 26 weeks maximum In States such as Michigan. Washington. and New York.

Sixty percent of the workers are in States which actually furnish equal or greater benefit to the unemployed workers than does the District of Columbia. What is the trouble about it all? Why not let them go back to the State in which they performed their services? There are more persons on the Federal pay roll in New York and in California than there are in the city of Washington. We do not stop to realize that this is a proposal which would hurt more than 60 percent of the workers. Why Is the proposal made?

Perhaps the general who told us that story did not know what he was talking about. but that is the statement he made. not only to me but to other Senators in my group.

( desire to call the Committees attention to the apparent limitation in the section relative to the Reconstruction Finance Corporalon. This limitation prohibits the paying of salaries or the granting of money to political subdivisions. This would include the REA and irrigation districts. I am not sure but what this should be considered as legislation upon an appropriation bill. The bill would prohibit the Federal Works Agency from making loans under that section to cities or political subdivisions. I hope the committee did not have in mind preventing thu Reconstruction Finance Corporation from making loans to irrigation districts. There is in my State the MidState Irrigation District that iS now in the process of getting a loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. They are getting the green light for this loan This limitation will probably prevent this district from getting the loan. which loan is reimbursable. The loan is on a solid basis. The money will be paid back with interest to the Federal Government. It will bring several thousand acres of land under irrigation. There would be a power project to bring electricity to the farmers in this area. It would bring new wealth to the country. millions of .dollars worth of new wealth. which. in turn. helps carry some of the tremendous Federal debt. Mr. Chairman. this House has appropriated billions of dollars. fortytwo or fortythree billion dollars. for lendlease. We are about to make loans to other countries of money that probably will not be returned. It does seem to me that we ought to look very carefully at this provision of the bill which might cramp or even prohibit the RFC from making loans to irrigation districts.",

I doubt if it should be here. I want to bring out again that I hope this type of limitation on legislation is not prohibiting Federal agencies from making loans to irrigation districts which want to develop large sections of land for irrigation purposes or for extension of rural electrification. If that is the situation. then it should not be in this bill. I can agree with the gentleman from New York that it is time for the Federal Government to stop making loans for which the Federal Government gets nothing. We are making a great many foreign loans of doubtful character. We have spent a great deal of money through lendlease and a dozen other agencies that will be a complete loss. Loans for developing irrigation and REA are paid back with interest. They should not be made difficult to get. Generally speaking. the States. cities. and political subdivisions are in much better financial condition than our Federal Government. However. I am firmly of the opinion.

We feel that even the fastest -moving program for new housing cannot be completed in time to relieve some of the mounting and dangerous tensions in the community.

There is a shortage of steel and iron for the development of mining at the present time. The mining companies are trying to get equipment and priority assistance for equipment for the mines. So the problem is to see to it that there is adequate mining equipment in order that mining can go on and secure sufficient phosphate for the existing facilities and processing plants. The TVA can carry on a very worthy project and the Department of Agriculture. by experimentation and: research through its various demonstrations.-has shown what can be done. They can do a fine job. but there is no need for them going into the field of manufacturing superphosphate or triple superphosphate. Those processes have already been worked out. They are not going into a new field. They are simply manufacturing in a field that has already been explored. We recognize the fact that there have been problems with reference to the distribution of fertilizer. Of course. phosphorous is necessary in many portions of the country. but. may I say. we have on the public domain in the West great deposits of phosphate and pilot plants for only development of processes. and experimentation could be built out there for far less expense and the mining processes developed. also the improvement of processes of getting the phosphorous from those deposits could be used for assistance and cooperation with business instead of governmental competition. Mr. Speaker. there is no need in this particular area for such a plant. It is actually a waste of Government money. It is going into a field that is no longer experimental.

Today there is -a shortage of potash which is also one of the great fertilizer materials. 1. great portion of the potash is on Governmentowned land. Equipment for mining is what we need. Not the use of new plants when there is a shortage for existing plants. Mr. Speaker. I hope the motion will be defeated.",

Our soil has been whittled away over the years until we find today that we only have 6 inches of topsoil compared with the 9 inches we originally had. and when we begin to realize that the foundation of this Government is resting upon 6 inches of top soil. we begin to appreciate the importance of this problem. They talk about free enterprise. Yes. I heard that when we established TVA. but TVA as a yardstick has saved our power consumers of America millions of dollars a year. I am also telling you that TVA. as a yardstick in the manufacture of nitrate fertilizer. has saved the farmers of America millions of dollars per year. It has not only developed a fertilizer that can be bought at a lower price but it has increased the content of the plant food from 16 to 49 percent. When you bought commercial fertilizer heretofore. before we had TVA. you were buying 100 pounds of filler in order to get 16 percent of plant food. The farmer had to pay the freight on that high filler fertilizer. he had to pay extra help to scatter all of that filler. We need this pilot plant in order to develop our fertilizer. to find out just how high we can go in the plantfood content. to reduce the cost. and in order to develop a yardstick by which fertilizer prices will be measured. I hope it will be the pleasure of this House to adopt this amendment.",

The gentleman from Florida . the gentleman from Washington. a former Member of this House. Judge Leavy. and I were the members of the committee from the House of Representatives. The Senator from Florida . the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. George Norris. and the Senator from Idaho. Mr. Pope. were the members from the Senate. When we started the hearings it was supposed that we had about 100 years of phosphate reserves in this country. When we concluded it was agreed that we had at least 2.000 years of phosphate reserves In this country. and they are located not merely in Florida and Tennessee but also in Arkansas. Idaho. and Utah. If we were in need of another experimental plant. common sense would dictate that it be at some distance from the present plant in the Tennessee Valley. but whether or not we need another plant is open to serious question. The gentleman who just spoke spoke of this as a need for a pilot plant or experimental plant. Back in 1938 objection was already heard that the Tennessee Valley plant with its three blast furnaces had already gone beyond the experimental stage and was in competition with commercial plants. I quote from the testimony that was developed by Senator Norris. and certainly no one will contend that he was against the Governments going into business. he would be disposed the other way. Senator Norris asked this question: Now. going on that theory. I think it is conceded that there is a line beyond which the Government ought not to go. but you disagree with them. as I understand your position. In that they have gone beyond that line. and they are manufacturing fertilizer and just selling it to Tom. Dick. and Harry?",

I am consequently familiar with its background and distinguished record of service which it has rendered to the farmers of my section of the Nation. The fertilizer industry of South Carolina was in full progress. serving the people of the Nation when many of the screwballs of the CPA were kicking the slats out of their cradles and otherwise destroying small property before they embarked on the program of destroying the economy of this Nation. For the last few years the fertilizer people have been hanging on the ropes. bludgeoned by Government red tape and Indecision. and saddled with restraints which have caused many businesses to give up the ghost in discouragement and despair. Consequently. our farmers have suffered because of their inability to purchase needed plant food and our people. generally. have been forced to pay high prices because of planned scarcity in a land of plenty. At last we have reached the portals of peace. and just as we are hopeful of breaking the Government bonds which constrain and impede our progress. there comes a proposal for the construction of a fertilizer plant to compete with private producers in the open market. with the taxpayers money. All that private industry wants is an opportunity to go forward. all that private industry needs is the green light of freedom.

I feel that even though no other bureau or agency were exempted. the FDIC ought to be exempted at the present time.

There is no doubt in the world that it was the FDIC which made it possible for us to sail through the past 10 difficult years without serious -banking trouble. The American people are sleeping at nights .in regard to their banks. Why? Primarily and fundamentally because of the FDIC. Mr. President.

We all know that it has been magnificently operated. -It has been brought to the point where it has assets approximating $1.000.000.000. It is economically managed.

Bishop of Toledo. chairman of the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare Council.

Because of the importance of this news release. and because of the 6riginality of the suggestions which it contains. I should like to have it made part of the I wish to point out particularly two paragraphs which I think are very interesting. I read from the statement: The suggestion grows out of two facts that hinder the settlement of lapor disputes. Qne Is the danger that if strikes of great magnitude occur. laws enforcing compulsory arbitration may ensue. That would be tragic. Voluntary arbitration is good. but compulcory arbitration is a long leap down the totalitarian road and is no help toward the proper settlement of disputes on either side. I. will. in fact. not be accepted so long as the working people and the employers are Americans and believe in their dignity as sons bf God. The statement says further: Our proposal is a modest one but one of farreaching importance. It is that a method of factfinding be set up to reinforce conciliation. arbitration. collective bargaining. and the attitude of the public toward anyimportant labor dispute. * - * These boards would make the facts known. They would make no decision as to the dispute. They would present the facts to fortify the right side In a dispute. Mr.-President. this suggestion is built around the possibility of setting up factfinding boards which would not be directly associated with the conciliation or the arbitration or the collective bargaining agency. but would be independent. separate. and distinct. and would bring out the facts after consultation with both sides to the dispute. or all sides to the dispute. and make the facts available to those who have to do with the work of arbitrating or mediating or conciliating disputes.",

From what study I have given the subject. compulsory arbitration is something which theoretically is very appealing. but as a practical solution would not be workable. for the very reason the Senator has mentioned. namely. it would start a dictatorship if we compelled men on the one .hand or industry on the other to do something which they thought would in the end bring ruin on either. I have come to the conclusion that. in spite of the appeal of compulsory arbitration. I do not believe forcible settlement can be achieved without potential liabilities which far outweigh any temporary advantages if that policy should be promulgated and continued. However. there is one phase of the present labor difficulties about which I should like to see something constructive done. I do not know that I am accurate in my facts. but one gains the impression that when labor ahd management. through collective bargaining. enter into a contract. and management then breaks the contract. labor has the right to strike. and no one would want to take that right away from labor. On the other hand. if labor breaks its contract and refuses to work. so to speak. under the terms of .a collectivebargaining agreement. there does not seem to be any redress for the owner of the plant. or the management.

I have no solution to suggest. but I am hopeful that the present conference will devise one. because it has seemed to me that a case like that presents one of the justifiable complaints which management has had. namely. that if they enter into a contract with a union in good faith. make a hard and fast contract. and the union itself feels satisfied as a whole that the conditions are good. no group should be allowed to break a contract which was entered into for that groups protection.",

I am sure we are both concerned that no legislation shall be enacted which will in any way deny to the individual the economic freedom which should go with citizenship. That is. we cannot force an individual to sell his labor against his free will. Solution of the problem is difficult. but it occurs to me that by setting up a factfinding board. such as that recommended in the press release of the National Catholic Welfare Council. there may be the possibility of an avenue of approach so that when the facts are developed. and are made known to both sides and to the public. the number of strikes which do not carry with them the support of public opinion may be reduced to a minimum. Mr. President. I will say that I really believe this is one of the most important domestic problems in our democracy. and I am glad to see that colleges and universities are taking up the subject and are organizing schools on managementlabor relationships.

The Senator from Maryland will probably recall a recent utteranceby Mr. Tobin. the president of the teamsters union. in which he called attention to the fact that as a rule labor loses tremendously by strikes. except when it is absolutely necessary that they gain recognition. and thus. as sometimes happens. become able to eliminate a serious injustice that could only be eliminated by strikes. \ufffd I point out that it would be much better if these gains could be acquired without the economic losses which are sustained by the workers as a result of longdrawnout strikes.

That might in the beginning appeal to labor. but in the end it would simply mean that jurisdiction would be taken of the whole field of wages. and if we ever adopt such a policy labor could not strike without striking against the law. and the law would be there until repealed. So when individuals are appealing to the administration that it fix a particular wage standard. socalled. they are giving hostages to fortune on the road to dictatorship. for the same reason the Senator advanced when he said that compulsory arbitration would also lead in that direction. I am glad that the administration has not fallen into that error. because in my opinion labor eventually would be hurt more than anyone else if such a policy were carried into effect.",

I think that everything which has transpired in connection with Army service since that date has verified the soundness of my amendment. Those who are opposed to a volunteer army do not want to increase the pay of our soldiers. I repeat today. Mr. President. that I do not think we are going to be able to raise by way of voluntary enlistment the Army which we need to do the police job that is needed to be done in various parts of the world unless we correct the pay injustice that men wearing the uniform of the United States Army today are suffering. Not only are the soldiers suffering a wage injustice but their families are suffering as the result of not being allowed adequate allotments to take care of those families while the men are in the service.

For example. there is one school that seems largely to advocate this bill as a peacetime measure for the cure of cancer and leukemia. Now. there happens to be a bill. H. R. 4502. on cancer research which has just been reported out of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this House and I hope will be on the floor of this House today for our consideration. appropriating $100.000.000 for experiments and research in cancer. The bill concerns an effort wholly devoted to the search to defeat the dread disease. I intend to vote for it. and I hope with all my heart that everyone else will vote for It. But the bill before us is not a medical therapy bill. If its passage does eventually result in further beneficial research in cancer. it will only do so incidentally. The main reason for this bill is the defense of our Nation. and for no other reason should it be considered as urgent.

The additional $175.000.000 was added in place of contractual authorizations for obligations to mature in fiscal 1948.

I want to commend the Park Service for doing a good job. They did a good job before the war. they did an excellent job during the war. and they are functioning well and efficiently at this time. War conditions caused a greater reduction in the activities of the National Park Service than any other activity in the Department. Many parks and other areas were virtually placed in the hands of a caretaker. and appropriations and personnel were reduced to a minimum. Visitors in the park areas dropped from 21.000.000 in 1941 to a low of 7.000.000 in 1943. It is expected that the number of visitors in the 1946 travel season will equal or exceed the 1941 record. In recognition of this situation the committee has recommended some increases for personnel necessary to handle the additional visitors and to perform essential operation and maintenance work. For the first time in several years funds are being provided for construction of roads and trails and parkways. the sum of $4.250.000 being included for roads and trail construction. and $7.500.000 being recommended for continuation of construction of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways. A few minutes ago the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi criticized the committee rather severely for failure to give the full amount for the Natchez Trace Parkway.

He placed a map on the wall showing exactly what he wanted. The report of the project which he submitted to the committee showed that he proposed to embark on a $200.000.000 power program. A part of his program the committee felt justified in starting. a part we felt was absolutely unjustified. If you will read our report you will find that we say so in no uncertain terms. that we say we do not propose to embark on a program that even approaches a $200.000.000 mark. It is rumored that an amendment will be offered to restore the full $23.323.000 or a substantial part of it. The committee has allowed $3.198.000 for the construction program during the next fiscal year. We believe that we have provided the primary and essential requirements for the present as well as for the immediate future. We have recommended the construction of transmission lines for three areas. one going to northeastern Oklahoma toward the Grand River Dam where eventually. no doubt. the two dams. Grand River Dam and Denison Dam. will be tied together as one integrated project. another goes to southwestern Oklahoma to the largest. or one of the largest rural electrification projects in the State where it was testified there has been an actual shortage of power.

I am going to ask you to come in here when the bill is being read and support this committee in its efforts to defeat all amendments. You can see by the many questions asked. and the criticisms leveled at the committee. that every Member who has a project affected is dissatisfied with the cuts made. They all say they want economy except when it hits their own pet project. They say we have cut too deeply. There are people in my State who are also disappointed. They. too. want economy. strict and rigid economy. unless. of course. it hits their project. From their viewpoint the bill is cut entirely too deep. Of course. a lot of these projects are desirable. We wish we had funds to give everybody the money they are asking. but the time has come. with a $279.000.000.000 debt. that Congress must do something about it. I tell you. there is only one way to really economize and that is to cut and slash these appropriations. The taxpayers of the Nation are expecting Congress to cut appropriations. not next year. but now. Here is a real step in the right direction. If this House approves our action other committees will take courage to follow our example. I believe the House of Representatives will uphold our hands.

However. there are factors involved that still worry me. The cuts do not worry me. but what there is left to spend does worry me. They had $191.000.000 available in 1946. the current fiscal year. In the next fiscal year they will have $174.652.000. plus $230.692.000 of leftover fundsfunds that they can use next year. making a total available for them to spend of $405.000.000. This thing worries me because of the terrific number of projects and people on the Federal pay roll and because of the way things are drifting. I have in my hand Senate Committee Print No. 26. put out by the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures just the other day. On pages 4 and 5 of that document I find that every single department and agency of the Federal Government. with the exception of the War and Navy Departments. increased their personnel. with very few minor exceptions. in the period from March 1 to March 31 of this year. In other words. during this time those agencies and departments showed a net increase of 32.783 employees. at a time when we should be liquidating war activities and other things of that character. The fact that Budget estimates of $346.765.000 should be sent in here for the Interior Department indicates the depth to which our economy has shrunk under New DealDemocratic management. The resentment among the people against this wild spending of Federal funds has forced this committee to bring in here this cut of almost 50 percent. It is a healthy sign. I hope we will have more such cuts. I hope when opportunities to cut items are presented upon the floor of the House they will have better support than was received last week in our attempt to prevent useless and dangerous expenditure of public funds.",

I do not know of anything for which there has been greater demand than recognition that labor unions shall be responsible on their collectivebargaining contracts exactly as the employer is responsible. The United States Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Wagner Act was: To compel employers to bargain collectively with their employees to the end that an employment contract. binding on both parties. should be made. I quote from President Trumans address to the ManagementLabor Conference in November 1945: We shall have to find methods not only of peaceful negotiation of labor contracts. but also of insuring industrial peace for the lifetime of such contracts. I quote still further from President Trumans address: Contracts once made must be lived up to and should be changed only in the manner agreed upon by the parties. If we expect confidence in agreements made. there must be responsibility and integrityon both sides In carrying them out. A bill was introduced. as I recall. by the Senator from Virginia to require all labor unions to incorporate. We found that to be awkward. and we thought it unnecessary. All we provide in the amendment is that voluntary .associations shall in effect be suable as if they were corporations. and suable in the Federal courts if the contract involves interstate commerce and therefore involves a.Federal question. As a matter of fact. labor unions in theory are responsible for their contracts. At times they have been sued. including actions for tort. In the Danbury Hatters case it will be remembered a judgment was obtained. and because it was a voluntary association. the houses of all the various members were levied upon and taken in satisfaction of the judgment. We do not want to perpetuate such a condition. Therefore. we provide very simply that a labor union may be sued as if it were a corporation. and if it is sued. then the funds of the labor organization and its assets are responsible for the judgment. but the funds and the assets of the individual members are not liable on such a judgment. In other words. we think in subsection (a) and in subsection (b) we have fairly stated the proposition.",

The difficulty with respect to unincorporated associations is that under most State laws they are very difficult to sue. In theory. they are st able. but as a practical matter there are many States in which it is almost impossible to sue them. It is necessary to make practically every member of the labor organization a party to the suit. Various other kinds of restrictions and difficulties exist which. as a practical matter. in a large part of the United States makes it absolutely impossible to sue a labor union. Subsection (d) provides that if an employee strikes in violation of the contract and without the approval of the union. he shall be personally deprived of his rights under the Wagner Act. In other words. that is a wildcat strike. if you please. If the union violates its collectivebargaining agreement. it is responsible. but no individual member is responsible. and he can in no way be .deprived of his rights. But if the union tries to keep its contract and. in violation of its undertaking. some of its members proceed to strike. then the employer may fire those members and they do not have the protection of the Wagner Act. As a matter of fact. I am toldI do not assert it definitely. because I do not have a copy of the contractsthat the last Chrysler contract and the Ford contract provide exactly that. In other words. the unions themselves have said in their agreement that \"if there is a wildcat strike during the period of this agreement you may fire any member who starts it and we will not ask for his reinstatement.\" All we do is to carry out that principle in the law.",

If the Veterans Administration is so weak that it cannot employ a welltrained man for a muchneeded duty to take care of the veterans. because it has not the space. because it does not have the power today to go out and take space for the men who fought for us. it is time that something be done without delay to give the Director of the Veterans Administration authority and power. It is my belief that the establishment of a Department of Veterans Affairs is the only thing that will give immediate authority and space today and for the long range to the agency that handles veterans matters.

Orders have been Issued to ship 85.000.000 feet of lumber to England on lendlease. I contend that lumber for farm storage should be given priority over fendlease lumber for England.

My information is that the lumber that is now being lendleased to England is about 75 percent of the amount of lumber allocated for farm use in this quarter. Germany has extensive forests. Why does not Great Britain get trees and lumber from that country? I understand more than 1.000.000 feet of lumber is being shipped to Guam to build houses for natives who have always lived in bamboo and grass huts. It is true that the WPB. through the War Food Administration. has allocated 380.000.000 feet of lumber for farm use In the second quarter. However. you cannot build granaries. cribs. and farm structures with allotments. Buildings require lumber. not allotments.

The latter part of April several hundred carpenters were laid off at the New York Port of Embarkation and work that they normally do was being performed by the prisoners of war. These carpenters are for the major part married men with families. They are respectable and decent citizens of the community who have supported their Government by paying taxes. buying war bonds. and in many instances have given their sons to the service. These carpenters received a daily wage in the neighborhood of $13.20. but the prisoners of war receive but 80 cents. This may be some \"brasshats\" idea of economy. but to me it is merely an effort to establish a coolie system and coolie standards. How can the War Department justify such an act? What explanation can we give to these American citizens as to why their livelihood is being taken away from them? It is my intention to give the War Department a few days to rectify this condition. but if it is not done I shall then come before the House and ask for a congressional investigation.",

To say the least. it is a grossly inadequate descriptive term. Now. what are the Empire preference agreements which the British Commonwealth of Nations have entered into between themselves and to which they have adhered consistently ever since 1905. long before we embarked upon the socalled reciprocal tradeagreement system of international trading. Well. they are simply a set of agreements in which they agree. each nation with the other. to discriminate against the commerce of the outside world. including the United States. It is interesting to note that after 11 years of our socalled reciprocal tradeagreement program. neither Mr. Hull nor Mr. Stettinius. his successor.- has been able to break down a single Empire preference discrimination against our trade even though we have been negotiating reciprocal trade agreements with 29 of the more important nations of the world. among them being the more prominent members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. their crown colonies. protectorates. and mandates. What is the system? How do they make this thing work so perfectly against us? Simple. The preference agreements ingeniously set up three levels of tariffs. It sets up a top tariff to keep the United States out. an intermediate tariff which applies to their crown colonies. protectorates. and mandates. and a low tariff which applies to the members of the Commonwealth of Nations. True. we have entered into trade agieements with some of these nations which are embraced within the Empire preferential group and they have lowered the top tariff for us a little bit. but never down as low as the intermediate tariff which applies to their middle favorites. certainly not so low as to reach the bottom tariffrate levels which apply only to the United Kingdom and its selfgoverning dominions beyond the seas. That is why we do not get into the British Empire group of nations with our trade. In the Empire preference agreements they. have built a wall to keep us out. How well is it working?

Here is the proviso. and here is what he must comply with: Provided. That (1) the head of such Government agency shall. before entering into any such contract or agreement. make a finding that the agency has made every reasonable effort to arrange for the conduct of the necessary research and development without entering Into a contract containing such provision. In other words. the policy of this bill is that he has to make a contract to take over every invention and every discovery In the name of the Government. if he can possibly do so. and he cannot make any other kind of contract until he makes a finding that he cannot make a contract which would give the Government every discovery. And once he gets the discovery. he is required. under a mandatory provision. to give it to the public at large. Now let us see what the second proviso Is. He cannot make one of those limiting contracts unless he also complies with this provision: (2) the organization shall contribute or -shall have contributed substantially to the .development of the particular inventions. discoveries. or findings for which patent rights are retained through earlier or curent research and development activities financed by the organization. Not by the Government. but before he can make the contract which will let the organization or the inventor keep any part of the findings or discoveries. he must find that it was substantially financed by the inventor. through earlier or current research.",

    "speech": "Nothing Is wrong with it if the Government would keep the patent for its own use. instead of disseminating It to the public and destroying the patent laws. The measure further provides: (3) in every case. the contract or agreement shall provide for at least an irrevocable. nonexclusive. royaltyfree license for governmental purposes to the United States. I think that provision Is good. Then we find: and (4). in the case of any nonprofit organization. the head of such Government agency further determines (A) that the research and development is essential in the field of national defense or in such other fields as the President may specify for such purpose. and (B) that the patent rights retained will not be used to serve the special benefit of any organization conducted for profit or of any individual. and will be made available or licensed to applicants on a nonexclusive. uniform. and reasonable royalty basis. In other words. what is being said here Is. undoubtedly. as I read this provision. first. that the policy Is that the Government shall take any discovery of any inventor. and he cannot patent it for his own use. The right of patent Is to be forever destroyed as to that man. This section provides that the Government shall take it. but not keep it for Government use or for defense use. but shall disseminate it to the public at large. Then comes subsection (d). which says that the Administrator or the head of the Government agency may make a contract if he complies with the provisions I have read. But a reading of those provisions Indicates. I feel. that there can be very few cases in which he will be able to make a contract and still comply with the provisions which are inserted as prerequisites to the making of a contract.",
